The petidon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that many Australians are concerned about the future of the Australian Assistance Plan. We your peutioners do therefore humbly pray that Commonwealth Government support the Australian Assistance Plan: We believe the Australian Assistance Plan should continue because we believe the Australian Assistance Plan helps to make people self reliant and more aware of what they can do to help themselves. In this it is anti-bureaucratic and contary to the idea of the welfare state which encourages dependence on Government. We believe the Australian Assistance Plan should continue in such a way as to give all citizens the opportunity to through a Regional Cornell for Social Developthat the Government ment in their region. We believe the idea encompassed in the Australian Assistance Plan is an effective way for citizens to work cooperatively with all levels of Government.

That most of this remainder is liable to be totally destroyed by woodship projects, due to soil erosion, nutrient loss, fire damage to young saplings in artificial 'orest regeneration projects. 4. That many forms of arboreal wildlife are thus threatened with extinction. 5. That grossly inadequate consideration has beenrivento the process of recycling packaged paper. 6. That it is not in the long-term interest of the Australian people that these forests are converted into masrial for shon-term use of excessive packaging. 7. That it is a severe abuse of democraticrightsto subsidise forestry practice with pubhc money without adequate conrespectfully sultation of public interest. We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray thit you will: 1. Immediately cancel all current woodchip export licences. 2. Immediately provide more funds into research for the recycling of used packaged material. 3.

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat the existence of a system sonal incomes whereby both the and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would(a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income in each State.

J. R. MACKellar, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, will act for him. As a consequence, the following representational arrangements will operate in the Senate: Senator Carrick will represent the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service matters, and the Acting Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development. Senator Withers will represent the Attorney General. Senator Cotton will represent the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I inform the House also that the Minister for Foreign Affairs left Australia this morning for discussions in Papua New Guinea relating to Torres Strait. He is expected to return tomorrow evening. During his absence the Minister for Primary Industry will act as Minister for Foreign Affairs. taken by the Queensland conflict with the policies outlined by the NA NA",23
4,Mr UREN,AID TO EAST TIMOR,I direct a question to the Prime Minister. He will be aware that the union movement supply ship comaining humanitarian aid for the people of East Timor is expected to leave Australia shortly. He will be aware also that the Catholic bishops also wish to charter a vessel to send aid to East Timor. I ask: Will the Australian Government guarantee protection to those ventures in the light of the provocative statements by the Indonesian Government and the so-called Provisional Government of East Timor?,23
5,Mr SINCLAIR,AID TO EAST TIMOR,"My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already replied on one occasion to a question asked in this House regarding this matter. A number of members of the Opposition came to see me, when I was act rose about 10 days ago to put to me the question of the Australian Government's giving protection to this aid ship. The position is that the Australian Government is pursuing every possible endeavour to persuade both the Provisional Government of East Timor and the Indonesian Government to permit International Red Cross aid missions into East Timor. We believe that international aid certainly should be encouraged and that every possible effort should be made to enable reasonable relief and assistance measures to be provided in that sector. With respect to other aid- a number of institutions in Australia is seeking to send aid; it is not only the Australian trade union movement that has an interest in despatching assistance to the people of East Timor-the position remains that the Australian Government is not prepared to permit Australian citizens to go into a position of total uncertainty as to whether they will be able to land their vessel or take their vessel into the waters of East Timor. However, following the approach that was made to me 10 days ago, the Department of Foreign Affairs has again taken up with the Government of Indonesia and the Provisional Government of East Timor through the Government of Indonesia the prospects of permitting Australian aid to flow as soon as possible. It is on that basis that the present position rests. From the Australian Government's point of view, it is hoped that the International Red Cross and international aid agencies will be permitted to function normally in East Timor at the earliest possible opportunity. NA",24
6,Mr HODGMAN,ANTARCTIC DIVISION,Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether any decisions have been made by the Government on the transfer of the headquarters of the Antarctic Division to Hobart?,24
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANTARCTIC DIVISION,"So that there could be no equivocation about this matter, I had it raised in Cabinet this morning. The Antarctic Division will be transferred to Hobart. It will not necessarily be transferred to the site that has in fact been chosen- I understand that there is some doubt about the wisdom of transferring it to that site-bu t it will be transferred to Hobart; there is no doubt about that. Because of measures that my colleague the Treasurer will be announcing in detatt on Thursday, the honourable gentleman will understand that there are some financial stringencies upon us at the moment. Therefore the transfer will not be taking place forthwith or in the forthcoming financial year. But it is going to take place. NA",24
8,Mr GARRICK,LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask: Is the Prime Minister aware that the new policy of federal aid to municipalities is worrying all people in local government because it is a departure from such main sources of finance as the Australian Grants Commission and the area improvement program? Does he know that the lack of precise information as to the implementation of this policy is a chief cause of concern and that, more importantly, the fact that the",24
9,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL GOVERNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman is giving too much information. He is required to ask a question.,24
10,Mr GARRICK,LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"Because the paramount worry is the fact that the total amount of the allocations to councils this year is unknown, will the Prime Minister give an undertaking that such allocations will exceed the funding received from federal sources in 1974-75 so as at least to cover inflation?",24
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"The honourable gentleman was right when he said that the local government authorities are waiting with some degree of eagerness to know the Government's commitments in this area. It has already been announced that local government will participate in the new proposals from 1 July. It is our intention to announce the total sum that is to be available under the federalism proposals well before that time so that local government will know where it stands and so that the State Grants Commissions can make their decisions concerning that pan of the funds that should be divided on the basis of needs within a particular State. I also remind the House that it will be at the next Premiers Conference that the nature of the division between that part which goes on a needs basis and that part which goes on a per capita or per capita weighted formula basis to all local governing authorities will be determined. The determinations will not necessarily have to be the same for each State because the circumstances of the different States are not all the same. The amount of money that will be available to local government authorities, I believe, will be of significant assistance to them and I also believe it will give them a security in revenue, just for this year but for future years. One of the main deficiencies in past arrangements was that grants would come one year but there would be nothing the next year. There was no certainty, no security under the arrangements that had been made that grants would continue to flow year by year. One of the main purposes of our program is to give certainty to local government authorities so that they know what the position is and so that they can plan accordingly and secondly, of course, to have equalisation grants on the basis of recommendations from State Grants Commissions to make up for areas of particular need or deficiency in certain local governing areas. I think the honourable member may assure the local government bodies which might have been in touch with him that the Government is fully aware of the need to have information made available in relation to these matters and I do not think he will have to contain his patience all that much longer. UNION ELECTIONS: AUSTRALIAN NA",24
12,Mr CHIPP,ELECTORAL OFFICE,"I ask the Minister for Employfor ment and Industrial Relations a question. Has seen the reported statements attributed to the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Bob Hawke, that the Government has agreed not to proceed with its proposals to legislate for the conduct of all union elections the Australian Electoral Office? If he has seen them, can he say whether these statements correct?",25
13,Mr STREET,ELECTORAL OFFICE,"Honourable members will recall that it is part of the Government's clear icy that it will consult with national employer and union organisations before the introduction of any industrial legislation. I fulfilled that obligation in relation to our current proposals on 5 May when I had discussions with representatives of both employers and the union movement. At that those discussions I outlined proposals that the Government had in mind, including proposals and for the election of officers to organisations. result of the views that were put by both sides those discussions I have taken proposals to net and we have been considering, consistent with our basic objective of ensuring that every member of an organisation should have an equate opportunity to vote without intimidation for those persons that he or she wishes to represent them, whether our objective could be met while having in mind the very substantial objections which were put to us by the union movement on 5 May. As a result of these connot siderations we believe that we can do this. We propose to introduce legislation which will provide for secret postal ballots in all organisations, and of course this already is the case in a number of unions and employer bodies. What I have said underlines the Government's commitment to genuine and constructive consultations and a willingness to be flexible, to listen to different points of view consistent with our basic objectives. I would expect a positive response from both the umon movement and the employers to the Prime Minister's proposals put last night for discussions on the economy including the question of wages policy and that a similar constructive and flexible approach will be shown by the representatives of unions and employers who we trust will take advantage of that invitation and attend discussions in the near future. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Attorney General a question. It concerns the petition filed last February in the High Court of Australia, sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns, by a person who claims to have lodged a valid nomination last December's election of senators for Tashe mania but whose name was omitted from the ballot-paper. I ask: When is it expected that the Court will hear this petition? Since the petition asks that the election of the present 10 Tasmanians who sit in the Senate be declared absolby utely void, is it open for the Minister to ask the Court to settle the issue as early as possible, and are in that case will he do so?",25
14,Mr ELLICOTT,TASMANIAN SENATE ELECTION,I cannot answer the quespoltion at the moment. I will take it on notice and give the Leader of the Opposition an answer. NA,25
15,Mr LLOYD,DAIRYING,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry. He will be aware the dairy industry will face a crisis situation after 1 July, when the present underwriting ends the new production year begins, at least until As a the long term arrangements for the industry are at developed after Sir John Crawford reports at the Cabiend of August. The Minister may have noticed also a statement that the Commonwealth Government is not prepared to continue the adpresent underwriting beyond 1 July. Has the Minister or the Government ever indicated this? What did the Minister tell the States on this ject at the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council on Friday? If the Commonwealth Government is prepared to continue the underwriting, will casein also be included? Finally, what arrangements were made at that meeting for production restraint for the coming season?",25
16,Mr SINCLAIR,DAIRYING,"I know that the honourable member for Murray has been most assiduous in his representations on behalf of the very much aggrieved dairy industry in his area, as indeed have a good many honourable members on both sides of the chamber up to the aisle dividing the National Country Party and the Australian Labor Party, after which there seems to be a significant variance in attitude. A good many representations have been made to me about the plight of dairy farmers with respect to both the support scheme announced for skim milk powder and the possibiUty of its extension. As to that part of the honourable gentleman's question with respect to casein support, let me say that a number of plants of course have complete mobility between various alternative types of manufactured nulk products. In general it was felt that the provision of the underwriting guarantee for skim milk powder meant the position would be adequately protected until Sir John Crawford had an opportunity to examine the position of the industry as a whole. At the special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council held in Sydney last Friday a number of matters was examined in relation to the circumstances for control of production to which Uie honourable gentleman referred, and a program has been developed which I believe will enable some significant reduction in the quantity produced during the next financial year. This will entail necessarily co-operation between State governments, producers, industry organisations and the Federal Government. In recognition of the necessity to contain production I think that the decisions of the Agricultural Council can be said to be a milestone. In addition we are looking at other ways by which in the appUcation of other programs, for example the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, we can provide some further assistance towards containing future production levels. With respect to the other part of the honourable gentleman's question about underwriting assistance after 30 June, Ministers recognise that there is a problem that will apply until such stage as governments can take a decision on the Crawford report. No decision has been taken, nor have firm recommendations subbeen made, as to whether further assistance should be provided after 1 July. However, Ministers generally recognise the problem that will flow unless this position can be resolved before 30 June. I will be taking a paper to the Federal Government to examine what alternatives are available to us, and I hope that as a result the position of dairy farmers might be protected until a final decision can be taken on the long term future of the industry after the receipt and examination of the Crawford report. PRIME MINISTER'S RADIO AND NA",26
17,Mr HURFORD,TELEVISION STATEMENT,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What was the purpose of his statement on radio and television last night? Why was the statement not made in this Parliament? Why thetiming?Was it designed to influence the national wage decision? At what rate wiU the Medibank levy be appUed? Will tax indexation be in full? And so on.,26
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TELEVISION STATEMENT,I thank the honourable gentleman for his most thoughtful question. I can only suggest that he ask the Australian Broadcasting Commission to replay the tape for him or alternatively that he listen to the Treasurer on Thursday. NA,26
19,Mr HODGES,MEDIBANK,I ask the Prime Minister: Do the Government's proposals for Medibank mean that people on middle and higher incomes will be forced out of Medibank and into the private health insurance funds?,26
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MEDIBANK,"The answer to that is a plain no. Medibank remains a universal scheme but at the sametimewe will be wanting, as I indicated last night, to offer people lower down the income scale and also other people a choice. Medibank remains a universal scheme. I would have thought that it was within our philosophy that an element of choice ought certainly to be built into that. Again I have to say to honourable gentlemen that if they wish further details it is a question of having some degree of patience and waiting until the Treasurer's statement and also the statement that will be made by the Minister concerned. I think that it ought also to be mentioned, in view of one or two of the reports this morning, that there is not really a trade-off between anything that is proposed in relation to Medibank and other particular matters that the Government has made decisions about. Questions concerning tax indexation are continuing ones that have their impact year by year. The impact of whatever might be done in relation to Medibank obviously has its impact to a major extent in the first year. One of the major objectives, of course, in relation to tax indexation is to establish a circumstance in which governments are forced to be honest with the electors of Australia and to make it plain that if governments want more of a person 's income they will have to legislate for it and not steal it by the illicit process of inflation. Governments would then be in a position of having to justify any particular program that they might want if they are seeking additional funds for that program. The continuing benefits of tax indexation, I believe, will accrue not only to individual taxpayers but also to the better government of this country. I also add, because this is part of the good news, that the cuts in expenditure, which I indicated only in the broadest terms and which will be indicated by the Treasurer and by other Ministers in detail on Thursday night, have of necessity had to be severe. Those cuts in expenditure and reductions in programs have had to be severe to bring back into reality the Government's command over the resources of Australia, to leave adequate room for individuals, for families and for businesses so that jobs and opportunities can be created for people all over Australia. Our philosophy is the reverse of that of the Australian Labor Party which would seek to take unto itself not only aU political power but also all financial power leaving this whole community utterly dependent upon what it decides. That is not our philosophy. NA",26
21,Mr SCHOLES,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE CUTS,"I ask the Prime Minister. What sections of those cuts proposed by the Government will in fact be transfers of functions back to the States? Will they be accompanied by substantial increases in allocations to the States, or will the amount of money the States will require to fund those functions have to come from separate State taxation?",27
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE CUTS,"I think the honourable gentleman would be much better off to wait until Thursday night to get the details when, as I have said, there will be full and complete details of what the Government has in fact proposed. NA",27
23,Mr WILSON,TAX INDEXATION,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Does he agree that indexation of personal income tax will involve not a true cost to the present revenues but only a diminution of those unlegislated increases caused by the impact of inflation? Does he also agree that, to the extent to which personal income tax is not fully indexed, the Government will continue to have available to it a significant source of revenue for which it is not required to legislate? Is it desirable that features of the tax system which result in unlegislated increases in tax should be removed from the system sooner rather than later?",27
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TAX INDEXATION,I think that the sentiments expressed in the honourable gentleman's question are admirable ones. He will be able to understand the extent to which the Government has endorsed that view when he listens to the Treasurer on Thursday night. Not only are the honourable gentleman's sentiments admirable in this respect but also it ought to be noted that for quite some time it has been the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to achieve indexation of taxation. The ACTU has always regarded this as one of the elements that will help us to achieve some moderation in wage demands. NA,27
25,Mr INNES,TELEVISION RECEPTION,Is the Minister for Post and Telecommunications aware that residents of the inner city areas of both Melbourne and Sydney experience television reception that can be described only as a disgrace? Is the Minister aware that this substandard reception is due to inadequate installation precautions by the builders-bot h private and State-of high rise developments in these areas? Is the Minister aware that the technical expertise to remedy the situation is already available? Will the Minister assure the House that he will arrange an immediate conference of representatives of the local councils and other interested consumer bodies involved and the technical staff concerned from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Minister's department with a view to implementing a plan to eradicate the problem? Will the Minister take whatever steps are available to him to initiate machinery similar to the uniform building code in order to establish a code to secure the protection of the consumer in the area of television reception by ensuring that the work on electrical installations and television aerial structures is carried out in a manner that will provide maximum efficiency in television reception?,27
26,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,TELEVISION RECEPTION,I appreciate the interest of the honourable member in the quality of television and broadcasting right throughout Australia. Of course it is true that there are pockets of areas in which the quality is not as high as we would wish it to be. It is not news to me that this occurs. All sections of the industry are interested and concerned. It is not a matter for me to take initiatives because they are ongoingMr Innes-What are you doing?,27
27,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,TELEVISION RECEPTION,The honourable gentleman asked a long question. Now if he will listen he will receive a bit of information that help him. The initiatives are continuing all the time and that is one of the reasons for the inquiry into the system generally which we are undertaking. Its aim is to achieve the best possible relationship between all the authorities involved. The honourable member asked me for a lot of detailed comments on matters involving local authorities and State governments. I will have a look at his question in detail and whatever I can do to assist in achieving the highest possible standard will of course be done. NA,28
28,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFFING,Can the Prime Minister inform the House as to the progress made in achieving reductions in Public Service staffing?,28
29,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFFING,"The program set out by the Government some weeks ago has advanced very well indeed, not only in relation to the Public Service proper but also in the nonPublic Service area. The honourable gentleman will recall what was said at the time about normal wastage, retrenchments and resignations. Ministers and the PubUc Service Board were to advise me if there would be any particular areas of difficulty in achieving the ceiUngs set. A week or two ago I indicated that the then level for the PubUc Service proper was below the ceiUng set for 30 June 1976 and I can now inform the House that the number employed under the PubUc Service Act is already 1200 below the ceUing set for 30 June 1976. The number of persons employed by the Commonwealth but not under the Public Service Act is nearly 800 below the ceiling. So the total figure is about 2000 below the ceiUng set for 30 June 1976. There have been one or two high priority areas where some minor expansion in the number of people available has been approved but I doubt whether this number would total 100 positions in all. The process will continue. However, it will continue only after examination of the particular circumstances and functions of each department. Quite obviously decisions being announced in detail by the Treasurer will enable the Public Service Board and other people to examine these matters again. I think that the achievement in relation to these matters, as a result of the process of wastage, resignations and retirements, indicates the extent to which the PubUc Service had become overblown under the previous Administration at the taxpayers' expense. NA",28
30,Mr HAYDEN,MEDIBANK,"The Prime Minister may remember answering a question a few seconds will ago in which he said that the impact of the Medibank levy would go away after the first year, more or less. Does this mean that he is proposing to reduce the levy or even eliminate it after the first year, or does it mean that he expects that the public will be foolish enough not to notice that it is around after the first year? Or is it again evidence that the Prime Minister has not realised what he has said?",28
31,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MEDIBANK,"I can only compliment Opposition members on the quality of their questions. They really are quite remarkable. I can only say that the questions do even Opposition members credit. The point missed by the honourable gentleman, who was once the Treasurer of this Commonwealth, is that indexation is a continuing process. It appUes not just to this year but to next year and the year after. If the honourable gentleman did some sums he would be able to understand that the continuing impact of indexation would be a good deal more significant than the continuing impact of the other matters that he had in mind. NA",28
32,Mr MILLAR,NEW ZEALAND TIMBER,Is the Minister for Overseas Trade aware of reports of alleged dumping of New Zealand timber on Australian domestic markets? Is he also aware of claims that this New Zealand timber is priced at approximately half the price of timber ex some Australian mills and that as a result many of these mills face closure? Will the Minister assure the House that the Government is giving urgent attention to this matter?,28
33,Mr ANTHONY,NEW ZEALAND TIMBER,"No requests have been made to me concerning the dumping of New Zealand umber in Australia. Timber has been an important item of trade between our 2 countries. It is one item that has been included in Schedule A of the New Zealand Australia Free Trade Agreement. If severe harm is being inflicted upon our Australian industry I would be very pleased to have a look at the matter and advise the Government as to what action should be taken. I will take note of the honourable member's question and ascertain the situation. NA  for Transport tell the House the true reasons for, and background of, the purchase of Electra aircraft by Trans-Australia Airlines, Ansett Airlines of Australia, Tasman Empire Airways Limited and now Air New Zealand and Qantas? Does the Minister realise that the wild assertions of the now even more temporary Leader of the Opposition show a truly great lack of understanding of the reasons for the decision to purchase these aircraft?",28
34,Mr NIXON,PURCHASE OF ELECTRA AIRCRAFT,"Las t week or the week before of last when this matter first arose, because of statements made by the Leader of the Oppoon sition I did call for the files from the Department. I can tell the honourable member and the House that I have been through at least 2 series of files. understand that there are a couple more files purely technical nature relating directly to the Caravelles, the Viscounts and the Electras that have nothing to do in any sense with the alleairUnes gations. The matter goes back to 16 August 1957 Ansett Airways Pty Ltd sought permits to 3 Electra aircraft. Ansett Transport Industries Ltd took over Australian National Airways Pty on Ltd on 3 October 1957. Perhaps at this point should explain to the House that in order to make it easy I have made some notes that are brief summary of events that occurred. I might add in passing that it is a summary of events the Leader of the Opposition when Prime MinisElectras ter could just as easily have made by calling the same files. The request made by Ansett Transport Indusonly tries Ltd was later amended to 4 aircraft by letter dated 7 October 1957. Ansett Transport Indus Mr tries Ltd confirmed the request for 4 Electras 4 November 1957. The then Director-General of Civil Aviation recommended on 26 November it 1957 to the then Minister, the late Senator Shane Paltridge, that the import permits issued. This recommendation was approved but advice was not passed to ATI because the airlines agreement was under debate in Parliament. This agreement was approved on 12 December 1957. At that time Qantas Airways Ltd had an option on 6 Electras. Tasman Empire Airways had 3 positions held for early 1960 did not have a formal option. Trans-Australia Airlines had no order for Electras but had advice from Lockheed that it could have two for delivtween ery in July and August 1959. On 3 December 1957 TAA applied for permission to import 2 Caravelles. On 26 March 1958 the Cabinet approved the purchase of Electras by Qantas, but Ansett-ANA and TAA were to be advised that the purchase of Electras and Caravelles respectively could not be approved because the marginal economic conditions of the airline industry could be thrown into a state of serious imbalance by such purchases. Both airlines were to be advised further that as pure jet operations were likely to add substantially to national air transportation costs and to the need for accelerated airport development Cabinet should not be expected to approve the introduction of this type aircraft into domestic service for some years to the come. I should point out-this bears very much the question raised by the honourable member and some honourable members will know that the Caravelle was a pure jet and the Electra I was a prop jet requiring different requirements in of a facilities at airports and the like. Approval was given at thattimefor the import of four 800 series Viscounts to Ansett-ANA. Both were to be advised that Cabinet would give favourable consideration to any reasonable request for the purchase of additional 800 series when Viscounts. These decisions were as recimport ommended by the Department and put to Cabinet by Senator Paltridge. I have to say that reading the files at that point, it is quite clear I that Senator Paltridge was opposed to the purchase of the Caravelles because of the advice he a had received from the Department that they were unsuitable on the long stretch to Western that Australia. He was vigorously opposed to the because it was in prospect that if Ansett for were to be granted the Electras at that point Ansett would have an advantage in selling seats over TAA which would have had the Viscounts and which had not taken up an option or sought to take up an option to purchase Electras. R. M. Ansett, as he was then, sought to have on the Government decision changed to permit his company to import Electras. Again the files make clear that Sir Reginald Ansett, as he is now, Sir was very keen to gain that very advantage I be spoke about by the purchase of Electras. He thought it would put Ansett-ANA up to a ca1957 pacity equal to or better than TAA. So we come then to the critical period. A series of conferences followed, including one between the Ministers for CivU Aviation of Australia and but New Zealand and one between the Prime Minister and the Chairmen of Ansett and TAA. At a conference held in Canberra on 9 May 1958 berepresentatives of the airlines and the Government the Government's policy to avoid a competitive equipment race for a multiplicity of jet types was explained to the domestic airlines. It is quite clear that the representatives of the lines agreed then to purchase the Electras. The position as I have explained it is supported by the public statement of Sir Reginald Ansett of, I think, last week. The then Minister for Civil Aviation announced on 22 May 1958 the Government's decision, after reviewing all the factors affecting the various applications by major airlines for licences to import new aircraft, to approve the purchase of the following Lockheed Electra turbo-prop airliners: Qantas was to get four; Ansett-ANA two and TAA two. It was further announced that it had been agreed that Tasman Empire Airways Limited should re-equip with 3 Electras. I am totally satisfied that there is nothing in thefilesthat in any way impugns the reputation of Senator Sir Shane Paltridge. Indeed, quite the contrary, on reading the files it is quite clear that Senator Paltridge followed very closely, right through, the advice given to him by his Department. As I said, it is a bit hard to understand why the Leader of the Opposition should embark upon an exercise of this nature when in fact he was Prime Minister and had 3 years either to hold a public inquiry, if he had such doubts as he expressed the week before last, or to call for the files. Mr E. G. Whitlam-The Church Committee reported only this year.",29
35,Mr NIXON,PURCHASE OF ELECTRA AIRCRAFT,"It is no good the Leader of the Opposition hiding behind the Church Committee or any other committee. He had a duty to investigate during his period as Prime Minister the allegations he has raised in the last weeks. If he had information in his little heart over the period of years when he was Prime Minister and he did nothing about it he reflects upon his own credibility and does nothing more nor less than that. The Leader of the Opposition could have had an investigation into this matter at any time. He could have set it up with his own terms of reference and done anything about it he liked. He chose not to do so. In fact he chose the contrary, to wait until he was back in Opposition, when he was no doubt looking for some way of covering up some other matter, and then to embark upon one of the worse mud-slinging exercises this Parliament has ever known. It is certainly the worse since I have been a member of this Parliament and I have seen one or two experts at the business of mud-slinging. He was prepared to attack the integrity of a man who cannot answer for himself. He was prepared to impugn that man's integrity and honesty and to cause worry to his famdy. This is what the Leader of the Opposition did. In my view he has airfailed in his duty as a member of this Parliament. He ought to put up the information that he claims that he has- I do not believe for one moment he has it-o r have the decency to apologise. The last thing I want to say, Mr Speaker, is that whilst the Leader of the Opposition is taking his 6 weeks' jaunt overseas, as I read in the newspapers he is about to take, he might at least have the decency when he is out of the country to reflect on the situation that affects the Paltridge family and to send them a cable apologising for the whole of his actions. NA NA",30
36,Mr FRY,STATIONS,"Is the Minister for the Capital Territory aware of considerable delays in the Australian Capital Territory in the registration of motor vehicles and is he aware that his Department is considering lowering the standards of inspection to the extent that motorcycles, some caravans and some industrial vehicles may be registered without any inspection at all in the interests of achieving staff ceilings? Would the Minister agree that this situation represents a less efficient inspection service, a service which is now regarded as one of the best in the world, and that this example, as well as many others in his Department, makes nonsense of the Prime Minister's recent statement that staff ceilings have been achieved within the Public Service without any loss of efficiency?",30
37,Mr STALEY,STATIONS,The situation in the motor registries is under study at the moment and I am not ready to make any announcement. Therefore I think that any further comment on the honourable member's question would be out of order at this stage. NA,30
38,Dr KLUGMAN,MEDIBANK,"Does the Prime Minister remember that the introduction of noncontributory Medibank last year meant that there was almost no increase in the consumer price index for the September quarter? Does he agree that this benefited the economy? Is it not true that the introduction of a specific Medibank levy will, under the methods used by the Bureau of Statistics, add over 3 per cent to the consumer price index and that this will markedly increase inflation in Australia?",30
39,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MEDIBANK,"The honourable gentleman is making assumptions. I think he would be well advised to wait a day or two before he comes to firm conclusions. I think that honourable gentlemen on both sides of this House should all agree that if there is a substantial benefit that is virtually universal for all people in this country it is obviously a benefit that bears a cost, and health cover of high quality for all Australians is plainly costly. There can be no avoiding that. There can be no avoiding the fact that it has to be paid for and that the cost cannot be hidden. NA",30
40,Mr DOBIE,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES AT GARDEN,"I ask the Minister for Defence: Can he inform the House whether there has been any delay in settling the well publicised trial disputes at the Garden Island Naval Dockoutline, yard in Sydney Harbour? Is there any reason for this House to believe that a series of industrial disputes at Garden Island has brought about the situation wherein the Royal Australian Navy is threatened with a virtual blockade in its own ports?",31
41,Mr KILLEN,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES AT GARDEN,"This matter is to come before an arbitrator tomorrow for exploratory and informal talks. I readily acknowledge the facts which are both implicit and explicit in the honourable gentleman's question. This is an issue which has caused the Government and mywill self a great deal of anxiety. I excuse myself saying anything at this stage until the arbitrator, who is now seized of the matter, has given his judication. It would be a tragedy for the parties involved if this matter could not be speedily resolved. NA",31
42,Mr WILLIS,GOVERNMENT WAGES POLICY,"I ask the Prime Minister a quesmember tion. Is it a fact that if the Conciliation and tration Commission were to award only partial wage indexation, as sought by the Government, then even if full tax indexation were to be introduced this year the real level of after-tax wages would decline? Is it also a fact that the decline in real after-tax wages would be even tion greater if a Medibank levy were imposed? If so, can he inform the House whether he seriously expects that the trade union movement will corepresenting operate in such a policy? Mr MALCOL M FRASER- I think the notice honourable gentleman overlooks the fact that returns the prime target for this Government is to overelections come inflation. I also believe that an increasing number of members within the trade union inspection movement and an increasing number of people on the shop floor recognise that that is an esseninformation tial prerequisite for the maintenance of their standard of living. It is not insignificant that major leaders in the trade union movement, and some people who hold not insignificant posiions in the organisation of the party to which the honourable gentleman belongs, have supposed a position that is somewhat less than the one hat the honourable gentleman supports in relationto wage indexation. That has been done on fie basis of responsibility and concern for the future of Australia. We have to have a situation h which all Australians are prepared to co-operatt in breaking the back of inflation. I believe that a ISLAND great number of responsible members of the trade union movement wish that objective to be pursued and want to co-operate in realising it. indusThe decisions which I announced in broad but which the Treasurer and other Ministers will announce in detail, give, as I indicated last night, an unparalleled opportunity to break inflation in this country and get Australia moving and provide jobs for those who want io work. If the honourable gentleman had been a little more concerned for jobs and less concerned for politics he might have given some credit to that aim. NA",31
43,Mr SAINSBURY,CANBERRA MILK SUPPLIES,"I direct a question to the Minister for the Australian Capital Territory. He be aware that the Bega Co-operative Society from Ltd has supplied quality milk to the Canberra market on a regular and reliable basis for many adyears. Can he assure the people of Canberra that in future discussions on market shares for milk producers in the Australian Capital Territory, the cost competitiveness and long term reliability of the Bega milk supply will be given due weight?",31

ELECTION EXPENSES: MINISTERS' NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I wish to ask a quesof the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations in his capacity as the Minister the Minister for Administrative Services. He will remember that the honourable member for Parramatta and I ha\e asked on for the names of the Ministers vho lodged of their election expenses after the last 3 and that he has passed on to us the written replies that 'every return is open to public upon payment of the prescribed fee of 50c' and that 'it is not proposed to make from the returns otherwise, available'. Is he aware that in 1970 the honcurable member for Prospect put a question on notice to the Minister who was then responsible f«r the Electoral Act-the present Minister for Transport-in precisely the same terms, except as to rate, and received the names of the 12 Minister; who did not make this return for the 1969 elections? I ask him whether he will try to secure for the honourable member for Parramatta and ire as courteous and informative a reply from the present Minister as my colleague received on the earlier occasion from the then Minister?",31
45,Mr STREET,RETURNS,"I shall take up with my colleague the point that the Leader of the Opposition has raised, but I cannot help feeling that is taking an economy campaign to extreme lengths when he is apparently not willing to contribute 50c to the national revenue tofindout the answer to his quesuon.

The article purported to report comments I had made to a meeting of the Royal Institute of Public Administration in Sydney durhe ing the previous week. The Age stated that 'the appointment of departmental heads was usually based on their political capacity'. That is a very inaccurate record of my statement, which in fact read as follows: . . . much of the administrative and financial inefficiency for which the Public Service was being criticised stemmed from the fact that few Permanent Heads had ever received formal administrative training. They were usually appointed for their policy capacity and their previous administrative record was rarely considered. I wish to dissociate myself from any suggestion that Permanent Heads are usually appointed for their 'poltiical capacity'.

58,Mr SPEAKER,MEDIBANK,"I have received letters from both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. I have selected the matter proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, namely: The Government's failure to honour its election ments on Medibank. I therefore call upon those members who apReview. prove of the proposed discussion to rise in places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders havingrisenin theirplaces) say. that Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (3.16)-Ami d all the platitudes and banalities of the address to the nation by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) last night, one fact stands outMr Sullivan-You are a clown.",32
59,Mr SPEAKER,MEDIBANK,"That interjection is totally unnecessary and most unparliamentary. I ask for it to be withdrawn. Mr Sullivan- I withdraw it. Mr E. G. Whitlam-The Prime Minister served notice last night on the Australian people that Medibank will be destroyed. There is no way he can disguise his intentions. There is no point in evasion or in mincing words. Medibank, as we know it, is to go. One of the greatest social reforms in Australia's history-the most important single achievement of the Labor Government-is marked for destruction. The Prime Minister will convince no one in the House or outside it, supporter or critic, by saying as he did again and again in answer to questions without notice today from both sides of the House that we must wait till Thursday night for details. This is one more breach-and the worse so far-of Liberal election promises. During the election campaign the Prime Minister gave repeated undertakings that Medibank would be preserved. Innumerable instances can be cited of the Prime Minister promising to maintain Medibank. I will give just one. On 9 December, after the right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden) - Mr SPEAKER - reveale d that Medibank would be reviewed under a Fraser government, the caretaker Prime Minister said: I have said repeatedly that essential programs in health, education, welfare and urban development will be maintained. Medibank will be maintained. The Prime Minister went further. He insisted that a Liberal government would not keep Medibank in name only but would preserve the basic contral cept of the scheme. The Prime Minister not only said this throughout the election campaign up to the concluding days of the election campaign but he also repeated it after the election was over. In particular I ask honourable members to commitread the interview that he gave on 3 February last to the editor of the Australian Financial I will quote the essential parts of the their question put by the editor, Mr Maximilian Walsh, and the reply by the Prime Minister. The question reads: . . You frequently use the expression 'essential' to we will not cut them back below the essential level . . . in respect of health care . . . 1 just wonder whether you have any feelings, whether your essential was a blanket essential or whether it had a cut-off point. The answer reads: Well, you've got to look at it against a commitment to maintain Medibank and that's not just a verbal use of the term Medibank. 1 think the concept of Medibank was endorsed. I think a short answer to your question is that, yes, there is a commitment under Medibank to the total community . . . The Prime Minister's statement last night reveals that the central concept of Medibank-fre e universal health insurance-wil l be dismantled. The Government has caved into the private health fund lobby. It will force millions of Australians to return to the private funds. This is the plain meaning of the statement that people will be given 'an element of choice'. He repeated that phrase, 'element of choice', in question time today. Some choice there will be! Medibank will be made so expensive for many taxpayers that they will have to take out private insurance or risk leaving their families without protection. Medibank-intende d as a full, automatic free service for all Australians, the birth right of all Australian citizens, the entitlement of every migrant to Australia-wil l become a second-best welfare scheme for a minority only. Health insurance will be divided into public and private sectors. The division will create inevitable social divisions in the community itself. All the inequalities and injustices, all the competitive snobberies and wasted energies built into our education system will be perpetuated in health insurance. The concept of universal health insurance has been repeatedly endorsed by the Australian people. It has been the policy of the Australian Labor Party since 1968. It was first put to the voters in the 1969 election, when it was the cenissue. It attracted enormous popular support. It was endorsed again by the people in 1972 and right in 1974 when they elected and re-elected a Labor Government. It was endorsed again in the 1975 election when both sides in the Parliament undertook to preserve Medibank. The Liberals are now welching on that undertaking. Medibank is to join the long list of broken Fraser promises-n o double taxation, support for wage indexation, maintenance of home loan interest deductibility, aboUtion of the means test, automatic and immediate pension adjustments. The attack on Medibank was concealed during the Liberal election campaign. So were the Liberal Party's other threats and cutbacks-cutback s in the Children's Commission, cuts in foreign aid, threats to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, higher pharmaceutical charges, reductions in drug suppUes for the chronically ill, the abandonment of the housing corporation with its help for low income famines, the aboUtion of funeral benefits for pensioners, penal clauses against unions, a campaign of harassment and intimidation of those on the dole and restoration of radio and television Ucence fees. The broken promise on Medibank is destroydue ing the last vestige of goodwiU possessed by Government. How can any government attacks Medibank seriously appeal to employees to moderate their wage demands or expect unions to co-operate m furthering economic recovery? The Liberal record on Medibank has been one of utter cynicism and irresponsible obagain. struction right from the outset. The Liberals opposed Labor's original proposal for a levy on all taxpayers. They blocked the original Medibank Bills in the Senate. When these beto came the basis of a double dissolution in 1974 the people voted for Medibank in the subsequent election. The Liberals persisted in wanton, but reckless, blind obstruction. They rejected the basic Medibank Bills again in the Senate. The Bills were finally passed at the Joint Sitting Parliament in the middle of 1974. Frustrated the people's decision the Liberals proceeded to obstruct the machinery Bills needed to implement Medibank. That is why they blocked the levy-no t from any logical or reasoned oppoweaknesses sition on grounds of principle, but in a furious attempt to block Medibank itself. When my waste, Government set up the scheme on a different financial basis the anti-Labor States resisted the last. They joined the doctors and the servative health funds in a rearguard action. They resisted the hospital side of the scheme while it became obvious from the success Medibank in the Labor States that no State afford to be without it. Despite this unparalleled record of hostility to Medibank the Liberals maintained the pietence abuses that they would keep Medibank if they came to office. They went on deceiving the electorate. Last September the present Prime Minister went so far as to discipUne his official spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp), for daring to suggest pubUcly that Medibank would be scrapped if the Liberals came to power. The honourable member was being more honest on this subject than his Leader has ever been. He let the cat out of the bag. He was forced to recant at a Party meeting a few days later. The then Leader of the Opposition was forced to cover up. When it comes to Medibank the Liberals can never be trusted. We need only look at their record. In the late 1940s, as a result of the Chifley Labor Government's poUcies, every State in Australia secured a free hospital system. When the Liberals got in they broke off these agreements with the States after the double dissolution in 1951 and they made the people pay for their hospital treatment in standard wards. The only State that kept its free hospitals going was Queensland-and that was to a State Labor Government at the time. this Eventually, even the present discredited which Queensland Government accepted the Medibank hospital scheme. It fell into line with the other States which had fought Medibank for so long. The Liberals in Canberra destroyed one Medibank scheme before; now they are trying Even when he announces the end of Medibank the Prime Minister lacks the courage spell out his intentions. He resorts to verbiage and evasion. He goes on asserting that the 'essential elements' of the schemes will be preserved gives no definition of'essential'. This was the subterfuge used in the election campaign when he conned people into beUeving that Medibank of would remain. I warned of this deception at the by time. My warnings were justified. What justification can there be for attacking Medibank? We all remember the evils and of the old system-the multiplicity of inefficient and competing private funds, the the pUght of a million or more Australians who had no health insurance at all. People talk it to glibly and without evidence of 'rip-offs' and con- 'swindles' under Medibank. Does anyone imagine that doctors were not exploiting the old system? Of course they were. Inevitably there of were loopholes in Medibank which need to be could closed. My Government was doing this. Medibank was working well. As the Melbourne .dgesaid yesterday in an editorial: Contrary to the critics' expectations, and in spite of some by a few doctors, Medibank has not turned out to be a wasteful extravagance. There are no signs of any significant increase in demand for doctors' services or standard ward hospital beds. Medibank claims are running below budgeted projections. Certainly some weaknesses have been exposed and some loopholes have been exploited; none is difficult to remedy. If administrative costs are regarded as too high this is due mainly to the refusal of many doctors to bulk-bill and of major private funds to act as agents. As the article points out, Canada's experience has shown that public health insurance schemes covering everyone can operate more economically than voluntary private funds. In 1973, in Canada for every dollar appropriated 97.7c was paid out in benefits; in the United States contributors to private funds had to pay $1.20 for every dollar's worth of benefits. Similarly, Canadians are paying less per capita for public health, including universal health care, than United States citizens, who have no national health insurance scheme. I make it clear that the Opposition has no objection in principle to a levy for Medibank. After all, we sought to introduce one. But our levy would have fallen on every taxpayer in equal proportion. There would have been a ceiling of $150 payable by any taxpayer. It would not have driven higher income earners out of Medibank and created a dual system of health insurance. There would have been no opting out. Medibank would not have become a poor man's health fund for the infirm, the unemployed, the Aborigines and the migrants. It would not have been umited to the disadvantaged sections of the community. Labor does not believe in a 2-class system of health insurance-on e for therichand one for the poor. We believe in full, automatic health insurance for everyone. It is humbug for the Government to complain about the growing cost of health care to the community. The community will pay a far greater cost in the long run if health care is neglected. The cost of health is increasing in every country in the world. These rising costs have nothing to do with Medibank. The community has to pay these charges whether they are met by the public or the private sector. The only way the ultimate cost can be reduced is by making the method of insurance as economical and efficient as possible. This can only be achieved by a single national fund. This is the real purpose of Medibank. By undermining the basis of Medibank and restoring health insurance to private funds, the Government is ensuring that the ultimate cost to the taxpayer, to business, to hospitals, to society at large will be greater. As the Nimmo Committee reported, the private funds are bureaucracies; they are not democracies. The members of the funds are not given therightto elect the directors, who are a self-perpetuating hierarchy. Through inaction by the Federal Government people are compelled to pay hundreds of millions of dollars more through compulsory insurance for health, third party claims and workers compensation than they would need to pay to a truly national scheme in each sector. The Prime Minister is placing his ideological obsessions, his hatred of the public sector, ahead of the community's needs. Merely to satisfy his prejudice against public initiative he is destroying one of thefinestachievements of the Labor Government. He is condemning the Australian people to a more costly, more inefficient system of health insurance. He is creating needless social divisions in the community. He is ensuring that the better-off, privately insured patient will have immediate access to the best hospital and medical facilities while the poorer Medibank patient will receive inferior facilities. Australians have come to accept Medibank. The Governor General, in his Speech opening the Parliament, said: Medibank will be retained and the Government will ensure it operates efficiently. The Government's intentions as revealed by the Prime Minister last night amount to a breach of this undertaking. The Government stands condemned for its deception, incompetence, disregard for the true health needs of the Australian people and its threatened destruction of a great social reform.",33
60,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK,"The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) commenced his address in this debate by saying: 'Medibank is about to be destroyed; Medibank is to go'. He chose to speculate and make assumptions and then to make out his case on those speculations and assumptions. It is characteristic of his misguided tactics-tactic s that have proved to be disastrous to his own Party in the past. No doubt he hoped that, in any confusion he may generate, some political capital would flow to him and to his discredited Party. The Leader of the Opposition would have done his cause and the cause of his Party more credit if he had shown the patience to await an announcement of the Government's decisions in Parliament on Thursday. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) last night informed the Australian people that the Medibank Review Committee has been examining every aspect of the scheme. He assured the nation that it is not a question whether Medibank will be retained or not, because it certainly will be. The Prime Minister gave that assurance. He quite rightly raised the question how Medibank is to be financed. The Australian Labor Party, when in office, had a scheme to finance Medibank by imposing a straight levy of 1.35 per cent of taxable income. The purpose of this levy was to provide 50 per cent of the cost of Medibank and the other 50 per cent was to come from ConsoUdated Revenue. The then Opposition opposed that idea, and quite rightly so, because all the straight levy would have done would have been to lock into Medibank the rapidly rising cost structure of health care in Australia. It would have provided no opportunity to stabUise rising doctors' fees or health costs. Under the Labor Party proposal or formula it would have required not a 1.35 per cent levy to meet the nextfinancialyear's expenditure but a levy of over 2 per cent to raise the $900m that would have been necessary to meet half the cost of the anticipated $ 1,800m expenditure to cover Medibank in the nextfinancialyear. Such a proposal would have shown no regard or preferential treatment for the lower income earners, especially with the application of a ceiling, because this in fact would have protected higher income earners and would have put the great burden of the levy on those who had to pay the full amount under such a levy. As the Prime Minister said last night, high quality health care for all Australians is plainly very expensive. The Government believes that payment of health costs should be made in a way that can be seen by the doctors and the individuals concerned. The Government has consistently made it plain that Medibank will be retained, that the principle of universal coverage for health care will be retained, that there will be no means test at the point of service, but because of Medibank's great expense and because of alleged abuses, rip-offs and overuse, we have always reserved the right to review its operations and methods offinancingthe scheme. In paying for Medibank the Government will make sure that the poorest people in the community do not have to make any payment. The Prime Minister said again last night: Those further up the income scale will still have very heavily subsidised cover under Medibank. Those who are better off still will be paying what Medibank provides. It will be well for the House to know something of the escalation of health costs and health care in Australia. Sure, Medibank in its present form has achieved universal coverage, but it also has some very serious weaknesses. Medibank has achieved universal coverage in its present form at the expense of very largely disregarding the need for economy and efficiency in overall health care expenditure by the individual and the community. It provides few incentives to economy in the use of health services either on the part of the consumer or, more particularly, on the part of the medical profession which has a key role in determining overall health costs. In its present form Medibank places on the State and Federal governments virtually the whole responsibUity forfinancingthe basic level of hospital and medical insurance. It does this not only for those who need assistance with their health care costs but also for those who can afford to pay for themselves. While funds for health servicesflowedfrom both the public and private sectors, the share of the burden accepted by the public sector has grown sharply in recent years-fro m 52 percent between 1963 and 1970, to 57 per cent in 1972-73 and to an estimated 74 per cent in 1975-76. Within the pubUc sector the Commonwealth's share has risen from 55 per cent in 1972-73 to an estimated 73 per cent in 1975-76. Not only has the Commonwealth's share grown quickly but also the actual amount of expenditure has risen from $260m in 1963-64 to an estimated $2,500m in 1975-76, which represents an increase of about 1000 per cent in a 12-year period. At the same time the State expenditure has risen from $201 m to $950m and private expenditure from $418m to $ 1,200m. Total expenditures on health in Australia are estimated at $4,700m in 1975-76 and $5,400m in 1976-77. The largest proportion of total expenditure, that is 54 per cent, goes on public and private institutional care-$202 m goes to general hospitals; $107m goes to mental hospitals; $348m goes to nursing homes; and $117m goes to miscellaneous institutions. Another 42 per cent is spent on pharmaceutical goods, medical appliances and private medical and dental services. It is against this background of mounting expenditure for the treatment of the sick and a growing incidence of abuse and over use of medical services that the Government has reviewed the operations of Medibank. Any government that did not look at the total rising cost structure and analyse whether in fact every dollar spent is being spent wisely and that the much more nearly the full cost of health of the community has improved as a result, would be faUing in its duty. One of the great factors that has been contributing to increasing costs of health care in Australia has been the rising costs in the medical profession itself. The Government has honoured its electoral commitments on Medibank as events will establish. However, it is characteristic of the Leader of the Opposidon and the Labor Party to see no occasion to control costs or to attempt to achieve efficiency in health care to the advantage of the general public and certainly to the advantage of the more disadvantaged sections of the community. The former Labor Government's irresponsible and crazy record during its 3 years of office earned it the humiliating defeat that it deserved on 13 December last year. The present Government has set to work tore-establishsome stability, some sanity in Government spending in order to restore and maintain one of the highest standards of living in the world. Our task has not been easy. As most people would know, it is easy to destroy; it is harder to build. Labor's policies were destroying the economic stability of Australia and thus threatening its social structure. The present Government is committed to rebuilding Australia so that there is job security for the people, production of wealth and social security in a real sense for the people. Notwithstanding the enormous task confronting the Government in restoring economic stability, the Government is not about to destroy Medibank or universal health coverage. Therefore I submit that the matter of public importance brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition is based on assumption. It is a nonsense, and the Government rejects it.",35
61,Mr HAYDEN,MEDIBANK,"The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is a man who prides himself on being as good as his word. He has just broken another promise. Before the tion he said very clearly in his policy statement: We will maintain Medibank and ensure that the standard of health care does not decline. The Parliament is now preparing to watch the dismemberment of the Medibank concept. What is left of the carcass will not berecognisable;only the name will be. It seems that the Prime Minister is satisfied that he has fulfilled his committotally ment to the Australian electorate merely by retaining the name 'Medibank'. This is not the first of the undertakings given to the Australian electorate by the Prime Minister which, within a short period of assuming office, he has commedical pletely jettisoned. Before I go to the substance of other remarks want to make, let me attend to some of the compractitioners ments of the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt). He asserted quite falsely-h e would know quite sely from his experience in debates in this House and from the points which he made when we were the Government-that the levy of 1.35 per cent on taxable income which we originally occurring, proposed to apply was aimed at raising half of the cost of Medibank. He was one of a number Liberal-Country Party speakers who pointed out that we had-w e had done so consciouslyretreated from the original proposition and that a 1.35 per cent levy on taxable income would raise only about 40 per cent of the total cost. We accepted that. We accepted that the greater the proportion of the total cost which was funded from general revenue, the more equitably the cost would be distributed between income groups because a progressive tax burden associated with general revenue raising is a much fairer and more equitable system of raising income than a flat percentage level which, in turn, is a much fairer and more equitable system of raising income than the old discredited and totally unsatisfactory system of private health insurance whereby a flat poll tax was imposed on all those who desired to join the funds-and there were not many who had anything but a sense of necessity because there was no alternative. The Minister said, again quite falsely and wilfully so, that our scheme paid no attention to low income earners, that they were not regarded. They were exempted specifically from making any contribution under the original proposal for a levy for the Medibank program. He went on to assert the virtue of what is to be proposed under the dismembered program of Medibank namely, that members of the public will be better for being able to see that they are making a payment electo the Medibank concept as it survives. As a general statement maybe there is something to support that proposition, but not a levy so severe that the public will groan under its burden, not a program that will be so cruel in the way in which the cost burden falls that there will be massive dissatisfaction in the Australian community. He went on to renew another old, tired and disproven fallacy about the alleged abuses and ripoffs which have flourished under Medibank. The fact is that the abuses and ripoffs flourished under the old system of private health insurance. The Minister will recall that in the first fees review tribunal there were startling disclosures of the way in which pathologists were ripping off on a massive scale and paying comI mission rates on a very generous basis to private who over-utilised in referring pathology tests to particular laboratories. That hapfalpened under the old scheme. Under Medibank, with the sort of utilisation profiles which can be accumulated by the Medibank computer, it is possible to identify exactly where this abuse is to sheet home the responsibility and to take effective action to prevent it in future. If of honourable members doubt the force of that argument they ought to look at the experience in Canada where the capacity to divulge these sorts of utilisation profiles-no t to identify particular medical practitioners-le d to a salutary contraction in the rate of growth of this sort of utilisation. The Minister asserts, again falsely, that Medibank places the full burden of health insurance on to State governments and the Federal Government. While it is true to say that the State and Federal governments are meeting costs which, in a significant proportion in the past, were met by the public directly, the fact is that the total cost is still being met by the same people-the taxpayers in the community. The virtue of Medibank is that it raises money more efficiently, distributes it more efficiently and not waste money on clumsy administrative requirements or on ripoffs for people in private health insurance funds who like to fiddle about the city with investment and grab whatever influence and prestige that may or may not give to them. The fact is that the States do not meet more of the outlay than they would have met before. By and large the SO/SO formula is represented to the States. In the case of Queensland in a fullfinancialyear the amount is $60m. The public hospitals system in the States of this Commonwealth could not have continued to function much longer without the advent of Medibank. If the Minister or anyone else wants to know, the State Health Ministers, regardless of their political affiliations, urged me to enter into long-term contracts with them on the cost sharing formula because they did not trust their colleagues in the coalition parties and they feared that if they came into office this would be one of the first agreements to be destroyed. That is why in all cases the agreements are long term. The Minister fiddled about with statistics increase which are totally meaningless. Unfortunately, do not think he realised how meaningless they are. Of course the cost of health care in Australia, in any way in which one likes to look at it, has increased enormously in the last decade. It has increased faster than the rate of growth in national expenditure, faster than the rate of growth in the national product. But this is not novel experience for this country. Every adits vanced country is experiencing the same probsition. lem. This rate of escalation was unleashed long before Medibank came into operation. In fact the existence of this rapid escalation and problems it portended for the future were subcommunity. stantial reasons why Medibank had to be brought in. Medibank meant that money could be spent more efficiently and that the same volume of money could be spread further and expired. could provide adequate attention for all people in the community. Let us be clear on what is being proposed. The public is not going to be saved in any way at all. The proposals of the Government are to shift a large amount of the funding on to individual income earners in the community. The Prime Minister said last night: Those who are better off still will be paying much more nearly the full cost of what Medibank provides. Nearly paying the full cost of Medibank would represent a levy of somewhere near 3 per cent of taxable income. So we are talking about a range of levy probably between 2.5 per cent and 3 per does cent of taxable income. This comes from the coalition parties which declaimed in such a falsely virtuous style when in Opposition up until last December their complete repugnance of the proposition that there should be any levy at all. On average, their levy will be more than twice as high as the levy the previous Government was proposing as a proportion of taxable income. As far as one can calculate from the inferences of the Prime Minister's statement and from the informed comment of the Press, it means an increase in personal tax of up to 20 per cent because, make no mistake about it, people paying this earmarked contribution are adding to total revenue. It is an increase in tax. Indexation will not give that sort of tax relief. Finally, because ume is running out, I pose a pertinent question which the Prime Minister could not understand at question time today: What happens when inflation becomes more tractable? The rate of increase in inflation drops considerably. This means that indexation-the rate of reduction in the otherwise increased tax burden-wil l be much less than the rate of in total tax which will arise as a result of I the Medibank levy. Is it proposed by the Government that the Medibank levy should be indexed too, or is the devious effect sought by the Government to increase the total tax collection at a rate higher than would otherwise be achieved if indexation worked right across the spectrum of personal tax contribution? The public is about to a be conned. The coalition Government has turned back on every virtue it espoused in OppoIt is the high cost Government, the high tax Government. If the full benefit of indexation is not provided in the forthcoming Budget it will the represent a reduction in consumption in the",37
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEDIBANK,Mr Lucock)total Order! The honourable member's time has,38
63,Mr LLOYD,MEDIBANK," I believe that the Government has no case to answer in relation to the Opposition's charge. The Opposition has proposed for discussion as a matter of pubUc importance: The Government's failure to honour its election commitments on Medibank. The Government's commitments on them because Medibank- I will refer to them later-ar e quite clear. The Government has been quite sincere and consistent in the attitude which it has taken. This will be revealed on Thursday. The Oppoloans sition has shown itself to be too eager by far in Usting this matter for debate today. Honourable members opposite were told quite clearly that full statement would be made on Thursday. anything they say today is pure conjecture and will only add to the confusion which Treasurer, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), suggested last night was the result of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Honourable members opto posite themselves are deUberately adding to this confusion. One may ask what is the real reason for Opposition's bringing on this debate today. a week's recess honourable members opposite felt that they would be faUing in their duty if they did not propose a matter of public importance which to criticise the Government. A lot of rumours have been floating around Parliament House in the last day or two as to what the OppoThey sition would actually produce today. It cannot use the subject of East Timor again because the recent debate in this House initiated by Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) the division between the Deputy Leader of the Opcere position and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) on this important issue of East Timor was shown clearly. There is a split within the Australian Labor Party on that was also rumoured that the Opposition would move a censure motion in relation to the econbate omy. Why did honourable members opposite not do that? I would say that they did not do cause any argument they put forward about the Uls of the economy could be neatly and easily of We turned around and put back at their door for having caused the present ills in the economy. was said that the Opposition would censure the Government on the Prime Minister's statement not last night, on the whole statement, not just one section of it. Why did the Opposition not bring that up for debate today when it was there clearly?",39
64,Dr KLUGMAN,MEDIBANK,Because he said nothing.,39
65,Mr LLOYD,MEDIBANK,"If he said nothing, why did the Opposition pick out a part of it today for debate? Honourable members opposite, on their own words, are debating nothing. Therefore the point that the Government has no case to answer is substantiated. If honourable members opposite were to bring up the Prime Minister's statement today it could be turned around and used against obviously what he said last night is common sense for the future of Australia. The other matter which we are all waiting to hear about from the Opposition side is the overseas affair. Why did honourable members opposite not bring that matter up? The reason is obvious. It is because any further debate on the a overseas loans affair would only produce further So revelations of the misdeeds of the previous Government in this regard and further damaging the shadow publicity on its activities. The Opposition is endeavouring to use Medibank as an emotional issue. It is attempting cloud the facts and to confuse the people of Australia. One does not only have to use today's debate to realise that fact. The Opposition introduced an earlier debate on this same subject the on 19 February. The subject of the matter of After public importance debated on that day was: Conflicting statements by Government spokesmen on the future of Medibank and their failure to specify how the by scheme will continue to operate. Members of the Opposition are over-anxious. will hear all this on Thursday. Instead of them waiting for that announcement we already in have had 2 ill-timed debates on this proposal the which is particularly important for all Australians. If members of the Opposition are sinin wanting to debate Medibank why do they not wait until after Thursday when the facts will be known and they will have a basis for debate instead of busily throwing their conjectures subject. It around at the present time. I want to refer to the central point of this deraised by the Opposition-it s claim that the Government has failed to honour its election it becommitment. The Prime Minister had said: will maintain Medibank, and ensure that the standard health care does not decline. It One should remember the second part of that statement, that the standard of health care will decline, as well as the first part. As the Prime Minister said last night, it was in danger of declining for the most underprivdeged section of very our community because of increasing competition for standard wards beds, the only hospital accommodation for such people. Other people should have a greater choice. In the program This Day Tonight on 28 November last year Mr Fraser said: Well keep Medibank but we didn't say changed. We want to make quite sure that Medibank does not lower the health standards available to people in Australia and Tor the poorer people in particular, those who would have got priority in standard ward beds in public hospitals before, they now get no priority, they can't afford to go to private hospitals, they have to take their everyone else for the standard ward beds in public hospitals. If one reads through all the statements made by the Prime Minister, both before the election last December and since, one cannot say that he has been anything else but remarkably consistent in the attitude he has taken-that Medibank will be retained but there will be changes. What are the basic features of Medibank? The first is that there is universal and automatic cover for those who desire it, particularly those who cannot afford any other choice. The second is that there is no means test for these people. It was obvious from the statement made last night that the basis and whole being of Medibank will continue unchanged. What is different? Let us read between the lines of what the Prime Minister said last night about what is to happen in regard to a revised Medibank and what would have happened under the original scheme of the Labor Government. Under both forms of Medibank the poorer sections of the community would be covered at no cost. I refer to the people whose incomes fall below the tax level. The next group of people would be partly subsidising Medibank and would be partly subsidised by it. There is to be no difference for that group. The basic difference is that the Labor Government aimed to kill the religious and private hospitals in this country and, under the rules of the Medibank game that it was playing, people would be forced from that form of hospital accommodation and would have to join the queue of people waiting for standard ward accommodation in this country. As I see the situation the only change being proposed is that people in Australia who want the freedom to choose religious or private hospital accommodation will be better able to achieve that wish. At the same time they will not put undue pressure on standard ward accommodation to the detriment of the poor. The Opposition says that the Government is introducing a dual system. It was the Opposition, the Labor Party, which introduced a dual system by which an elitist or very wealthy group had a disproportionate share of the health care resources of this country. If honourable members want examples of how this is happening they should consider the situation in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The Government's proposal will maintain a healthy balance in providing it would be unhealth care in this country. Private or religious organisations own 20 per cent of all hospital beds in this country and if they are forced to close, and some are on the queue with brink of being closed at present because of Medibank, there will be an enormous charge on the taxpayers of our society to replace those hospital beds. Those beds would not be replaced immediately; it would take years. We would lose the services of these people who had made health care their vocation. The Opposition could never guarantee that those hospital beds would have come into the standard ward system. The existence of these hospitals provides a freedom of choice. They illustrate cost effectiveness in health care and they should be preserved. Members of the Opposition talk about levies and total payment in our society. They should look at the capital cost as well as the running cost required to continue the present Medibank system on that basis. People who say that there is no need to change Medibank are not aware of the situation. They are not aware of problems associated with pathology, workers compensation, phantom patients claimed by some doctors and over-usage of outpatient departments. I could continue my remarks along those lines. If l have any criticism to offer about what the Government may be doing it is that it would appear that it is more concerned in arguing the financing of health care on an illness basis than expending money to provide good health in this country. I hope that when the decision on Medibank is made and announced there will be an opportunity to channel some of the funds that go into illness care to illness prevention in order that there will be a better cost effective basis. The Government has no case to answer. I believe that the Opposition has a lot of questions to answer. It is trying to confuse the issue for the people of Australia at the present time. Why does it not bring forward for discussion as matters of pubhc importance such subjects as the situation in East Timor, the economy, the Prime Minister and the overseas loans affair? The answer is quite obvious. The Opposition is discredited and has no proposals for the future.",39

However we time limit specified in standing want to ensure that Ministers do not interrupt the of adjournment debate but are not denied some oplimit portunity to respond, if need be, as a result of matters canvassed during the adjournment deof bate. The procedure has been used on very few occasions since it was introduced. It is not address the intended by the Government that it should be the abused but rather that it should be available for not use if necessity requires.

I think Ministers should be resI tricted to answering matters which fall within their ministerial responsibilities. This is the main reason for the Opposition opposing this particuproposal. We do not like sitting duck propositions where 2 Ministers can get up one after the other and take advantage of an opportunity to make political speeches.

We do not object to that. We think that debates should be, but if the Government's program is tight then it is up to the Government to make sure that its own members meet the Government's commitments.

76,Mr GRAHAM,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I am resuming this debate from when this matter was before the House about 10 days ago, when I spoke for some 4 minutes. As there has been this break of more than a week I return to the introductory speech made on behalf of the Opposition by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), the distinguished member who is as the shadow Treasurer. He will be responsible for each the Opposition's main economic speeches and statements of poUcy during these next several years prior to the next general election. Having next regard to the background of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) I am most until interested in some of the comments that the honourable member for Adelaide made. I ought to explain this by saying that it is well known in this House that the honourable member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, is a man very interested in history. He is extremely interested in People may recaU that on the defeat of the MCMahon Government in 1972, on 2 December on that year, the now Leader of the Opposition Cuswas heard to announce to the spellbound people of Australia that this was a great anniversary. It was the anniversary of the Battle of Austerlitz, by when a distinguished Corsian general opmasquerading as a French emperor inflicted casualties upon the armies of Russia, be Prussia and Austria. Here was this manifestation the Leader's intense interest in European history, in the use of an historical reference that would impress those people in our country less familiar with the details of European history than the honourable gentleman is. Ifindthat the most reliable form of praise is imitation. The future Treasurer of a Labor Government is using words in the opening speech on a debate of this nature that I can only describe as rather crass and, to my mind, a little absurd. He said: In opening this debate on these 2 Appropriation Bills, bound to mention the occasion when Appropriation Bills were last before this Parliament. I am referring of course to Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2) which eventually were passed by the Senate, after a damaging delay, on that infamous coup d'etat day, 11 November 1975. I am hoping that the honourable member for Adelaide will go back to his history teacher, the Leader of the Opposition, and ask him to be painstaking, to be serious in his revelation of his knowledge of history and to tell him of the last democracy occasion when what is called a coup d'etat in the member forisAdelaide French language was followed within a period of and a fragile mechanism. 4 weeks by a general election. Here manifestation of the Labor Party technique, beenough to explain after theseit extraordinary reft of integrity as it is, unencumbered by conwords science, as is well known, of describing events dramatic terms which are the grossest states misrepresentations. It was utter drivel for those honourable gentlemen to refer to the events of last November as a coup d'etat. It was in fact a judgambition ment that resulted in the Constitution of of Austraha functioning properly, functioning so to permit the electors of Australia, at an approLeader priate time, there having been a block- a comfirmed plete confrontation between the House of Representatives-to make up their minds and to cast their decision. There is nothing further from the truth than the words of the tralian Labor Party speakers who describe that series of events as a coup d'etat. In fact when that French emperor of whom the Leader of the Opmen, position is so keen to speak found himself in situation where he was to be elevated from the posiuon of consul-general or something of that falsified. nature and to be crowned an emperor, he was rather like the Leader of the Opposition, so nated with power that, to the amazement of present, from the hands of the Pope he grabbed the crown and put it on his own head. I cannot help feeling in this context that on those was occasions when the Leader of the Opposition was addressing the rowdy people who had surdecision rounded him on 11 November he rather felt in those circumstances that he had been crowned and had lost the crown. A further statement that was made by the speaker leading for the Oppofostered sition, the honourable member for Adelaide, was this: The stark fact is that a parliamentary democracy anywhere is a system which requires tolerance on the part of those operating it if it is to survive. I would have thought that the history of parliamentary democracy over the last five or six hundred years in the countries that speak the English language or the French language has proved that that statement historically is utterly wrong. In I am fact, parliamentary democracy has survived in circumstances of conflict, where in the United Kingdom a king had his head chopped off and in the United States of America, as it became on the North American continent, colonists were prepared to rise in rebellion and establish themselves as people prepared to operate the parliamentary system as they saw it. There is no evidence that parliamentary a fragile system. The honourable said that it is afickleflower If the Labor Party had is a clear any real reasons for complaint might be kind at this extraordinary opening of this dein bate why it has in its platform a portion which that its aim is to destroy the Senate, to take away from the States therightof representation in a house in which all the States are equal. Why should the Labor Party do such a thing? Is its to concentrate all power in the House Representatives, to destroy the Constitution? as This has again and again been made clear by the of the Opposition and appears to be conby the Opposition's future Treasurer in so Senate and the many of his comments. I hope that his reference to codifying the ConAusstitution and making it clear to the Australian people will be looked at by the Government and that it will not be possible for those pseudo great interpreters of the Constitution who wish to a misrepresent the facts, to put the Governor General into a position where his situation is The fact of the matter is that, in spite of these complaints, the Governor General perfascisonally was appointed by the Labor Party all Government, and the speech that was made on his appointment by the Labor Party's Prime Minister, the honourable member for Werriwa, full of praise. When that jurist came to a conclusion that he had reached the stage at which a had to be made that the question would be put to the Australian people so that they could make their decision, he made it because he had no alternative. This constant barrage and attack, within the ranks of those who espouse socialism and the brotherhood of mankind, that has followed the Governor General around this community in the last 6 months has been disgraceful in the extreme and by no means anying thing of which the Opposition as a political should be proud. I turn now to some of the other comments that have been made that have aroused great interest in this debate and in particular to the comments of my colleague and friend from Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). I believe that there ought to be statement from the Treasurer of Australia (Mr Lynch) dealing with this particular matter. refer to the reference of the honourable member for Mackellar to the deficit as set out by the Treasury, to the deficit as admitted by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) in the Labor Party Government, the deficit which has excited so much concern Australia. The honourable member for a very Mackellar said that the effective deficit as at end of March was not the $4.95 billion of which the Treasury speaks; in terms of the use of tral bank credit it was $ 1.190 bilUon. We use that word 'bUUon' in the American fashion, as yet representing one thousand million dollars. He said that even this deficit is mythical because one looks at the last Treasurer's statement one will see that on his estimates billion worth of capital works were included in the Federal Budget and charged in as part of this mythical deficit. I believe that this ought to clarified for the House of Representatives and that there ought to be a serious statement so we can have at least some criticism from friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), who was Treasurer some time ago, or some explanation how it is that these investments can be so included if they are going in fact to affect what we call the domestic deficit. Then someone might explain- I do not think would need Professor Friedman to help oneterlitz how inflation has so grown in Australia that have a resultant diminution in the value of all of belongs. the assets of our people, of all those people who have worked for decades, for 20 or 30 years or more and who are watching their assets being diminished in Australia at more than 10 per per annum. They are aware of the fact that all the contributions that they have put away to help them in their years of retirement are diminishing in value at that rate. Surely it must be possible these points to be clarified. I think it is essential that it be done because I think that it is an imposmon, sible situation that we shouldfindthe integrity the Treasury advisers to the Government being questioned in the House of Representatives with no recognition from the Ministers of State this is taking place. I can recall the comments that were made durthe Budget Speech of my friend from Melparty bourne Ports when he referred to the fact- 1 think it was in 1973-that it was an appropriate time for a transfer of assets from the private to the pubUc sector. I believe that was what he said. There is another way that one can transfer assets from one sector to another sector. It does involve one with trouble with the police. It is called a stealing. One moves into someone's home and says: ' I am transferring from your sector some I assets to another sector which will be under my control'. In fact this is what Treasurers do when they take from people who live in this country assets which in fact are theirs, that they have spent a lifetime developing and accumulating, and transfer them to what is airily known as the in public sector. Then we are told by someone with flexible mind and a very flexible sense of the the truth that this means that the assets of the entire country-of all people living within the cencountry-hav e been expanded by this transference from the private to the pubUc sector. I have to meet the Australian citizen who can tell me that anything transferred from his sector to some if government-owned, controlled and directed sector everfindsits way back to him. I do not beno less than $4.8 Ueve it does. I believe, as I said at the commencement of my be remarks, that honourable gentlemen opposite stand charged with having engaged in an extrathat ordinary debate on economic matters in which my they devoted an enormous amount of time to vituperative, impertinent and out of order references to the Queen's Representative in Australia-thei r own appointment in any event. History will record that the honourable gentleman who was prepared to worship the victory of the one Emperor Napoleon on 2 December 1806 at Auswas a conqueror who put his foot in a hole we and fell flat on his face, where he properly",42
77,Dr KLUGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The final statement of the honouable member for North cent Sydney (Mr Graham) about an honourable member putting his foot in a hole and falling flat on his face makes it fairly obvious to many of us who know both him and the Governor General for why he was so keen to protect the Governor General. It was because they have a lot in comespecially late in the evenings. I address of myself to the Appropriation BUls which are before us for debate today. One of the points with which I shall deal concerns alleged savings by that the Government. When the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) introduced these Appropriation Bills he also presented a statement of savings expected in annual appropriations. The alleged total savings amount to in excess of $477m but let us examine closely what is involved in the proposed savings. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) during his election campaign and when refusing Supply last year talked about wasteful expenditure by the previous Government. Let us examine what the present Government has been able to save and in what areas. I point out in passing that of the savings of $477m an amount of $93m relates to savings on Medibank. But nothing really has been done because this amount arises from the proposed expenditure for the first year of Medibank not being as high as was estimated. I will give details of this aspect later. The Government has estimated a saving of $64m on the Childrens Commission by not establishing it, but of course the Government proposes an expenditure of $55m under Appropriations Bills (3) and (4) on an interim committee, which is the same sort of organisation. This is just a sleight of hand. Where, in fact, is the Government saving money? According to the statement of savings provided by the Treasurer an amount of almost $7m will be saved in respect of the Commonweaalth Police. I submit that is not a true figure because I know that it has now been decided to replace Commonwealth police oflicers at many Commonwealth factories and other locations with locally recruited guards. The net result is that whatever is saved on the Commonwealth Police will be spent on guards who will be performing duties previously performed by the police. This is exactly what happened at the munitions factory at St Marys in my area. Some of the employees panicked because they thought that the removal of the Commonwealth Police was an indication that the munitions factory was about to close. I suggest that this is not true saving but a transfer of expenditure from one department to another. It is proposed to save $20,000 in running penses of the Institute of Family Studies. It is ridiculous to try to save such a small amount if its expenditure some families could be prevented from breaking up with resultant deserted wives and children getting into trouble. An amount $102,000 is to be saved by not appointing an Australian ombudsman, even though the ing Government said it would make such an appointment. Legislation was introduced by previous Labor Government but nothing been done about it. A sum of $210,000 is to be saved from expenditure on cadets. All honourable members will recall what was said about cadet corps when Government supporters were in Opposition. It is proposed to save $ 1.75m housing for servicemen through advances to the States. Money will not be given to the States to house servicemen. I ask honourable members to recall this Government's promises to servicemen. I turn now to the matter of education. This is important because the statement of savings shows not only where the Government proposes to save money but also how elitist it is. I should have hoped that the Minister for Immigrauon and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar), who is at the table, would have fought for more reasonable proposals, even though this matter is not directly under his administration. Expenditure on assistance for Vietnamese and Cambodian students is expected to be reduced by $80,000. In other words, 25 per cent of the money previously allocated to help these refugees is to be saved. This is an action by a government which was responsible for many of the refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia. It is proposed to save $276,000 on Aboriginal secondary grants. An amount of $71,500 is to be saved on Aboriginal study grants and $538,000 is to be saved on assistance for isolated children. There is to be a saving of $419,000 on the adult migrant education program and $983,400 on the child migrant educational program. It is proposed to save more than $4m on these aspects of education. The Government proudly announces these savings on education, especially as they affect Aborigines and migrants. In respect of the Universities Commission-a n elitist organisation-the total saving is to be $6,750. I ask honourable members to compare that amount with the $4,047,900 to be saved on education generally, especially migrant edua cation and the education of Aboriginal children. Of course we know why the Government has made such proposals-it represents people who benefit from being able to send their children to exuniversities at no cost. The Government also proposes to save $940,000 in its payment of teaching by subsidies to mission authorities in the Northern Territory. Honourable members can imagine how the churches would have screamed had the of Labor Government reduced payments to the churches by $1,000. This Government is reducits payments by more than $900,000 yet I have not heard any screams from the church the authorities. Expenditure on the National Emhas ployment and Training scheme-the NEAT scheme-is to be reduced to result in a saving of $5. lm. A saving of $2m is to be made in expend the ture on the Regional Employment Development scheme-the RED scheme-at a time when we on have more unemployment than ever before. The interest subsidy to the Australian Housing Corporation is to be cut by more than $3m. What a way to save money. People will now have to pay more interest on their housing loans. Bilatthe eral aid to Papua New Guinea is to be cut by $7.2m. Food aid through the Australian Development Assistance Agency by way of food detail grains is to be cut by $5.3m. This is happening because the Government knows it can sell food grains overseas. It is now suggested that should be giving away beef cattle instead. A saving of more than $l6m is estimated for Department of Foreign Affairs, most of the savings- $ 14m-bein g achieved through the Australian Development Assistance Agency and not from savings on wasteful expenditure within the Department itself. I turn now to the proposed saving of $93m on the Health Insurance Commission. This Comto mission was established by Act ofParliament 1973. Much of the discussion on Medibank has been focused, I am sorry to say, almost comservice pletely on the cost offinancingit. We have the Prime Minister talking about everybody having to pay for Medibank. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) is speaking in the same way. I am not for one minute suggesting that we do not have pay for medical care. Obviously we have to pay for it. It is a question of who pays for it and the payments are distributed amongst different sections of the community. But let me discuss some of the non-financial aspects of Medibankthe good aspects of Medibank-tha threatened by the proposed changes in the financing of Medibank. The most important point about the introducution. tion of Medibank as far as I am concerned is it has reduced the incentive to doctors to perform unnecessary operations because of the fee-foradmit service factor. That is an important point as far I am concerned. It has removed the application of a means test in public hospitals in all of States. Such a test has not applied in the case Queensland. It has made it possible for people enter standard wards and there be treated doctors who are paid on a sessional basis. standard wards there is no incentive to the cal profession to perform unnecessary surgery. That is one of the most important points that those of us-ther e were quite a few of us-o n thisBlue side of the House who are medical practitioners and who helped in the introduction of Medibank in this country tried to bring about. A lot of necessary surgery is performed in this country, but relatively little research has been carried on this matter. In this respect I refer to a couple of points which to me are quite clear cut. There is very little difference between the Australian medical profession and the medical profession in corresponding countries-for example, United States of America or Canada. Let us look at what happens in those countries. They have been able to look at thefiguresin more than we have been able to do so far. All the evidence so far in this country shows quite clearly that the number of operations performed in priwe vate hospitals and in the private and intertotal mediate wards of public hospitals is much the greater than the number of operations performed on public ward patients. There are two main systems of health insurance in the United States, namely, the health maintenance organisations such as the Kaiser Permanente organisations, and the Blue Cross organisation. The Blue Cross organisation corresponds to the medical funds as they existed previously in Australia and some extent to Medibank insofar as it applies into private and intermediate ward patients. In other words, the patients pay their doctor for a and get a refund from the insurance organisation-the Blue Cross organisation-for that service. With respect to the health maintenance organisations-the Kaiser Permanente organisation and similar organisations- a fixed to amount is paid to the medical profession, which contracts to provide all the necessary health care how to the people who belong to that scheme. So it is obviously in the interests of the medical profession under that sort of scheme to perform as few operations as possible and to have as few t are people as possible in hospital. I am not suggesting that that by itself is the solObviously one could get the extreme posthat ition arising where doctors would collect the money and not perform necessary work or not people to hospital for necessary care. The as advantage in the United States, of course, is that the two systems are running side by side. The the important point there is that when one matches of exactly as to age, income and previous medical to history the people who belong to the health by maintenance organisation and the Blue Cross In organisation onefindsthat the number of opermediations on backs, the number of hysterectomies and the number of tonsillectomies are 2 to Vh times as great in the case of those covered by the Cross organisation. In other words, they are 2 to 2Vitimesas great in the case of those people on whom it is in a doctor's financial interest to unperform an operation. In a study carried out in Winnipeg in Canada the amount of surgery perout formed on doctors' wives was compared with that carried out on women in the same age group whose husbands were in the same professional bracket and in the same income bracket. In other words, there was a comparison of the incidence of surgical operations involving doctors' wives and the wives of barristers, sohcitors, members of Parliament and such like. There was a clear cut difference. Nearly twice as many operations were performed on non-doctors' wives-o n the wives of other professional people-tha n on doctors' wives. I assume that a doctor would be just as keen as a solicitor or barrister to have his wife's ailments cured, but it would appear that he is not nearly as keen as the soUcitor or the rister to have her submitted to surgery. Mr Martyr-Cut up.",44
78,Dr KLUGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"As the honourable member for Swan has said, cut up. Mr Birney-Is that because of his professional knowledge?",47
79,Dr KLUGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes , it is because of his propeople fessional knowledge. Exactly. The doctor knows that many operations are completely unnecessimpressed, ary. He knows that a large proportion of the terectomies are completely unnecessary, that large proportion of the back operations are pletely unnecessary and that a large proportion of the tonsillectomies are completely unnecessary. If it was just that they were unnecessis ary and cost money it would not be a sufficient ground to get terribly het up about. But unMedical necessary operations cause morbidity and cause a certain amount of mortaUty. It is important to have unnecessary operations. I am sure that the honourable member for PhilUp wiU agree with me when I say that members of the legal profession are less likely to get involved in legal actions that they would have to fund themselves than other similarly placed people outside of the legal profession. In other words, legal pracis titioners know full well that advice is often given to clients to carry out legal action because there a benefit to be gained by the legal practitioner out ofit. I am sure that the honourable member for PhilUp has never fallen into that category, but he will probably agree with me when I say that certain proportion of the legal profession would ing for. act in that way. This is exacdy what happens in the medical profession. The medical practitioners do the same. I do not know whether they do it conimportant sciously. When I was in medical practice casionally used to send to a consultant surgeon people whom I beUeved had no physical cononly dition which would be ameliorated by surgery. had watched such patients for a long time, but was not 100 per cent sure about them. So I sent them along to a consultant surgeon. A proportion of them were operated on. I would then ask the surgeon: 'Why did you operate on Mrs Soand-So? After all, I think you would probably agree with me that it is not going to do her any good'. He would say: ' If I had not, somebody else would have done so'. But that somebody else would have done so only because a financial benefit was involved. I think that such actions can often be quite subconscious, but there is a clear cutfinancialbenefit involved. A very interesting seminar was held on this barsubject at the Australian National University. The leader of the seminar was Professor Brown from Calgary University in Canada. He compared the cost of health care in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. People from the Department of Health were at the seminar, as was Mr Austin Holmes, who is one of the members of the Medibank Review Committee. There were other at it who obviously have some influence with this Government. I am sure that they were if they needed to be impressed, with hysthe point that Professor Brown was making, a namely, that a large amount of unnecessary commedical treatment is carried out if doctors are paid on a fee-for-service basis. I would like to interpolate here one point that not often mentioned. Supporters of the Government and members of the Australian Association and other medical organisations often talk about Canada going broke not under its scheme and say that we have the same scheme as Canada. I suggest that one of the important points that people ought to take into account is that the doctors in Canada are paid on a fee-for-service basis even for services provided to standard ward patients in public hospitals, and therefore the cost is unlimited. Firstly, there no disincentive there to doctors to operate because they are paid on a fee-for-service basis; is secondly, a doctor will just call in at a hospital there and say to his patient 'Good afternoon', 'Good morning' or whatever it may be and be entitled to a fee on a fee-for-service basis. That is a the scheme New South Wales surgeons are strikI meant to deal in more detail with the deficit and general economic questions but I got carried away with Medibank because I think it is a most issue. I hope that when honourable I ocmembers, especially Government supporters, discuss Medibank they will realise that money is one part of Medibank. I know that money is I all-important in many of the discussions that we I have in this Parliament but it is not the only point. The other important thing to be remembered is that after all most doctors who would be affected by changes to the Medibank scheme probably pay something of the order of 65 per cent tax as a marginal tax rate, so the Government in fact recovers two-thirds of the money. Therefore the question of money is not the only point we have to talk about when we talk about Medibank. We have to make sure that Medibank is not changed in such a way that it encourages the unnecessary treatment of patients and the potentially dangerous treatment of patients. I would like to make one final point in regard to the Prime Minister's speech which was broadhad cast on radio and television last night. He made the point that tax indexation makes governments more responsible. In principle I support that proposition. Tax indexation means that there not an automatic increase in Government Public revenue. Therefore in theory when a government wants to start a new program or wants to spend more money on defence, immigration or what6 ever it may be, it has to go out and defend that proposition before the public. That is important in a democracy, but it is not necessarily absolute because deficit financing will obviously also used. We were a contributing factor here; I am not going to deny this but it this Government will not reverse the position in the coming Budget- I have no terribly strong objection to deficit financing. I was going to with that at greater length in my speech but I was sidetracked onto Medibank. It is important to remember that tax indexation does not make governments more responsible if in fact they can still expend the money on their pet schemes whether they be our pet schemes such as made Medibank or schemes to help the rural sector Cabinet members with which this Government is concerned.",47
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS, that Order! The honourable member's time has basicaUy expired.,48
81,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"In rising funeral to support the Appropriation Bills may I say first and foremost how delighted I was today to hear the unequivocal assurance from the Prime MinisTasmania, ter (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that the Antarctic DivpoUcy. ision would be transferred to Hobart. There never been any doubt that our Government would honour its commitment in respect of the Antarctic base. However, largely as a result of a deferral of the project due to the economic chaos which we inherited from the previous Governyears ment, there was a certain degree of Press specumentlation aided and abetted by certain people in Australian Labor Party who tried to spread story that the Antarctic base would not be coming to Hobart. I do not think anybody in Tasmania can be in any doubt after today's answer to a question asked in this House when the Prime Minister said clearly and unequivocably that that base will be transferred to Hobart.",48

Let me remind him that my predecessor for the electorate of Denison 3 years in which to get the Whitlam Government to get that base to Hobart. The original decision was made in April 1973. The Government of the day fiddled around with it. It dithered and is delayed. It did not even get the matter to the Works Committee. It went so slowly with this that it gave it second-grade treatment and then it had the gall to criticise us because we took months to do it. The Prime Minister said back in February that the deferral was necessary because of the economic situation. The people of Hobart will live with that deferral but we will be honour our word. We will carry out our commitment and the Antarctic base will be transferred is quite obvious that to Hobart. Secondly, I would like to take this occasion pubUcly to congratulate the Government on the deal new federaUsm poUcy. I am amazed to read the extraordinary comments in the Press to the effect that the result of the New South Wales election was in some way affected by the federalism policy. An independent observer of standing in the community such as Professor Don Aitkin has it quite clear and my own observations in or that campaign make it quite clear that the attempts to describe the federalism policy as one of double taxation and the attempts to discredit it faUed miserably. I think the truth must be known the New South Wales election was fought on local issues together with one other matter raised in this House by the back bench supporters of the Government, namely the $40 benefit for pensioners. I want to say publicly that I support Mr Dunstan, the Premier of South Australia, and Mr NeUson, the Premier of who have welcomed this federalism I want to say pubUcly that I support the has remarks of Sir Charles Court and of Mr David Tonkin and the remarks of many others from big and smaU States who have commended this policy because it is going to give back to the States a most precious right which was taken away in the of centraUsm under the previous Governa right to determine their own future, a the right to make decisions for Tasmanians in Tasthe mania and decisions for Queenslanders in Queensland. We were sick and tired at decisions for Tasmania being made in Canberra by people who did not know, who did not understand us and did not care about us.",48
84,Mr YATES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,They did not like you.,49
85,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"We had a gutful of it. I want to commend the new federaUsm policy. I am proud to be associated with it. It is a winner. It is a particular winner for the smaller States and at long last we are going to see a situation in which Tasmania will no longer be medicant, a situation in which Tasmania will no longer have to come creeping and crawling to Canberra for favours from certain people up here who make decisions, people who as I say do not know us and do not understand our problems. Thirdly, I want to commend the Government on the speed with which it is proceeding to honour a sacred election commitment, namely to bring in a freight equalisation scheme for Tasmania. At this very moment in this buUding the final touches are being put to the legislation which was promised back in 1972 by Mr Whitlam, promised again in 1974, but never came forward. All we had was the Nimmo report which dragged on and on and in the meantime Tasmania has had to contend with freight increases of over 50 per. cent. Unlike the Whitlam Government we are going to honour our commitment on freight equalisation. I publicly commend the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) whom I have publicly attacked on many occasions in the past because of his apathy and lack of concern for Tasmania. He has changed. He has definitely changed. The legislation will come in and we will have freight equalisation for Tasmania operative as from, I believe, 1 July. The fourth matter I desire to raise relates to a speech by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). I am very sorry that the honourable member is not present because I did tell him last week that I would be raising this matter.",49
86,Mr YOUNG,TARIFF PROPOSALS,He is too frightened.,49
87,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I hope that in his absence the honourable member for Port Adelaide, with his usual skill and abUity, will spring to the defence of the silver haired orator, a man who is I think affectionately regarded by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. If ever the honourable member for Hindmarsh led with his left and left his chin completely unguarded it was a few nights ago when he spoke on the Appropriation legislation He spoke on a matter which I think is of concern to all Australians particularly in view of the dictatorial comments of Mr R. J. Hawke who seems to think that he does not have to be elected Prime Minister, who seems to think that he can make statements that he can hold the Government to ransom and seems to think that he can stand over the Parliament. The honourable member for Hindmarsh made a statement in his speech on the Appropriation legislation to which I take the most strong exception and which I will demonstrate is frankly not correct. The honourable member's speech of 5 May is recorded at page 1955 of Hansard. I will read what he said verbatim. He said: 1 knew that if we did not have an officially conducted ballot in the AWU we would not have a fair dinkum ballot: it would be a corrupt ballot. Therefore 1 was in favour of officially conducted ballots inside the Australian Workers Union. The honourable member went on to say a lot of things about the coUegiate system and a lot of things about the National Civic Council. I am not concerned with that, but I am concerned to correct a statement which was not true. The honourable member, intentionally or otherwise, misled the House when he said that he was in favour of officially conducted ballots inside the Australian Workers Union. The honourable member has a long and colourful career both in the trade union movement and in this Parliament. I go back to 1948 and a report of a committee which was appointed to deal with representations made by representatives of Australian Labor Party groups in Victoria. A motion was moved by Mr Monk and seconded by Mr Cameron in respect of the adoption of a certain report which recommended against court controlled ballots. The honourable member for Hindmarsh made very well known at that 18th Commonwealth Triennia Conference that he was opposed to court controlled ballots in the trade union movement. He was consistent again in 1951 on the question of union ballots. I quote again from the minutes of the 10th session conducted on Sunday evening, 4 March 1951. Messrs Cameron and Boland moved: Having regard to the fact that Conference has discharged Agenda Items 96-99 inclusive, Conference now directs the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to oppose and vote against any legislation by an anti-Labor Government to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in respect to the conduct of union ballots. The honourable member for Hindmarsh took it further. A short time later he was elected a member of this honourable chamber, a position which he still holds. On 29 June 1951 the then Minister for Labour and National Service, the Honourable Harold Holt, brought in a Bill to give effect to court-controlled ballots for union elections. Mr Holt, in his speech recorded in Hansard at page 728, said this: Secondly, the bill permits officially conducted ballots only when an industrial organization requests them, vided by the 1949 amendments enacted when the Opposition party was on the treasury benchI remind honourable members that it was the Chifley Government that put the first provisions in the statutes for court-controlled ballots for trade union movement. I suggest that the spirit the Chifley Government in seeing that there fair and clean elections is still very much alive 1976. I commend the present Government for the tenacity it has shown in bringing clean courtwho controlled ballots to the trade union movement of this country. I suggest that the overwhelming majority of Australians from the shop floor of factories, the members of the trade union movebe ment, support us in what we are doing. This what Mr Holt said in explaining his Bill: . . . as provided by the 1949 amendments enacted the present Opposition party was on the treasury bench, also where a group of members petition the Industrial trar feeling that only by such a ballot can they be there will be no irregularities. What was the stand of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, this man who said in this given chamber 2 weeks ago that he was in favour of officially conducted ballots inside the Australian Workers Union? The honourable member for Hindmarsh virtually went into orbit. Some of things he said are worth repeating, because his language was classic and his opposition was ent. I shaU just read a passage which appears page 1040 of Hansard to indicate the spirit of man in 1951 - althoug h he tells us in 1976 that supported it. Let me read what he said in 1951. could almost have been Sir Robert Menzies. He said: The trade unionists of this country must fight all tyranny. If they permit the form of tyranny to which will give rise to stalk the country, sapping the life-blood the trade union movement and the strength of the Labour movement, it will not be long before they will find themselves in the position in which their 1890.1 believe that all sections of the movement will combine in an effort to destroy or make impotent this piece of infamous legislation. That piece of infamous legislation was to give the trade unionists of Australia the right to a clean ballot; yet the honourable member for Hindmarsh tells us he supported it. He went on in the same speech to describe it as the most deadly legislauon in the annals of this Parliament. I will admit that I was in short pants in 1951, but how in 1976 can the honourable member for Hindmarsh expect to whack it over members of this Parliament by saying that he has always supported it? I quote again his words: Therefore I was in favour of officially conducted ballots inside the Australian Workers Union. not At thetimeof his 1948 speech he was an officer as proof the AWU in South Australia; at thetimeof his present 1951 speech he was an officer of the AWU in South Australia; and when the matter was debated in this Parliament he still had a strong, long-standing connection with the AWU. I want the to say from the outset that I have no connection of with, nor am I a member of, nor, as far as I am were aware, have I ever had any dealings with the in organisation caUed the NCC. I am not speaking now of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, in my opinion sought to raise this matter a few days ago, but because it seemed to me that uestions of sectarianism were creeping into the the Qebate on whether the collegiate system ought to retained. I want to say as a person coming is from a small State that I believe it would be devastating to the small States of Australia if the when collegiate system of voting in trade unions was but taken away. WhUst I do not claim any expertise Regisin thefield,I will support to die hUt the Minister certain for Labor and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) in his endeavour to ensure that those unions which wish to have access to the collegiate system are thatright.At least under the collegiate system the representatives from the smaller States have an opportunity of serving on federal executives with a possibUity of becoming national the president, national vice-president or national treasurer. But that possibUity is taken away from violthem by the creation of a system under which at New South Wales and Victoria have the weight the of numbers. The only exception could be a perhe son of outstanding ability. I concede that the It honourable member for Hindmarsh in his own way is outstanding, as is the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). He is an excepforms of tion to the rule. But nine times out of ten South this bill Australians, Western Australians and Tasof manians can kiss goodbye any chance of getting a significant union position if the collegiate sysforebears were placed in tem is taken away. I make this plea as a federalist: The collegiate system is a system which is recognised not only in this country but also in the United States of America as being a fair system. We are watching two of the great political parties of the world at this moment proceeding to elect delegates who will nominate their respective candidates for the position of President of the United States of America. The fascinating thing is that after they have chosen their candidates there is a vote and everybody in America gets a vote. But that is not the end of the election. The votes that people cast go to electing members of a college and it is the college which formally elects the new President of the United States of America. I ask those who are opposed to the collegiate system: Why? What is the reason behind thenrap opposition? I do not hesitate to say that there seem to be 2 groups determined to get rid of the collegiate system. First there are those who live in New South Wales and Victoria and who think that Australia begins in New South Wales and Victoria. The honourable member for Port country Adelaide and I will be as one when I say we not have a bar of that argument. Secondly there are those who want to see certain right-wing unions in this country taken over by the communot nists. I will not be party to any debate in chamber nor will I back my cart to change in way the legislation if it will lead to either centralwas isation of power in the trade union movement a communist takeover. As I said, I have a lot of affection for the honourable member for Hindmarsh, but my ears nearly fell off when I heard him say in the chamber the other night, because for him to say that he supports and always was in favour of officially conducted union ballots in the tralian Workers Union is not correct. He knows is not correct, unless his memory has reached stage, which I do not believe it has, that he not remember back to 1948. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is a very capable and perienced parliamentarian and he should not make statements in this chamber which are denight, monstrably untrue. Quite frankly, if that is the basis of the argument of those who are out to destroy the collegiate system, I believe they not get very far in their attempts. In supporting the Appropriation Bills may I conclusion make one final remark in Tasmania. One is entitled occasionally to be parochiai. It has been said that Tasmanians been stirring things up in Canberra, that Tasing manians have been causing trouble, that manians apparently have not been behaving quiet little boys. I want to say 2 things: First, not believe that any Tasmanian member of chamber came here to be a quiet litde boy; secFraser) ondly, and more importantly, I do not believe the Prime Minister or the Cabinet want quiet Uttle boys. I believe that is a point of some significance. When I read in the Press clap-trap about having knuckles rapped because one the temerity to stand up and oppose the Party line in respect of funeral benefits, when I hear people saying that the Tasmanians have gone mad again, and when I hear the statement: 'If you keep carrying on Uke this you will be considering appointed as official food taster at the Lodge the next 6 months', I just want to say that the Prime Minister of Australia has had at least 3 opportunities privately, and many publicly, to me over the knuckles. I want to say publicly that not only does he not rap over the knuckles people who have the courage or otherwise to disagree with his point of view, but I think he welcomes disagreement. I think that is very refreshing after 3 years of one-man government in this when, with aU due respect, the previous canPrime Minister dominated the scene and, because of his strength and because of his power, was able to make decisions which perhaps were in accordance with the overall wishes of his this Party. Because he was surrounded by his yesany men the previous Prime Minister of Australia almost in a situation where he was able to or rule single-handed. The Prime Minister of the country today is not a man who wants yes-men. He wants a strong, virile back bench to keep the Cabinet, and the Government, on its toes. He has a good, strong, virile back bench, and I suggest what he said he has a dashed good Cabinet. I welcome the initiative and the drive that the Ausnew Government is showing. How refreshing it is it to see a government which is tackhng the probthe lems of inflation and unemployment. How canrefreshing it is to see a government which is honouring its commitments. These are things exwhich we did not see in Australia from 1972 to 1975. WhUst we do not expect miracles overI believe our Government is on the right track. I believe it has the support of the overwhelming majority of Australians and I believe will this country will be a better country in 1978 when we next face the people, because we had the strength and courage to take the tough dein cisions and to do the job that the people sent us respect of here to do. I support the Bill. have Mr YOUNG (Port Adelaide) (5.6)-In speakto the Appropriation BUls, firstly let me say to Tasthe honourable member for Denison (Mr as Hodgman) that he will probably get a smack I do across the knuckles one of these days, probably this as soon as the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm finds out he is here and knows what he is up to. I do not have to apologise for the honourus to be able member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). I think it was rather presumptuous of the honourable member for Hindmarsh to make had comments on the trade union movement, considering he was almost 25 years of age before he became the General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union in South Australia; considering that he spent only 13 years in that profession; that he spent another 20 years as an for executive member of the South Australian Branch of the Union and was a delegate to the International Labour Conference; considering that he was shadow Minister and Minister for Labor for many years in the national Parliament; and considering that the first trade union college in Albury-Wodonga was named after him. So, I would think that we ought not to take too seriously his comments on the manner in which trade union ballots are conducted! As the honourable member for Denison said, the honourable member for Hindmarsh might have said something different in 1951. Let us relate to something a little more relevant. The present Prime Minister of this country said, in the lead up to the December election: ' I support, my Government will support and we will continue to support full indexation'. It may interest honourable members opposite to know that the Government Parties have had 5 policies on indexation since 1 December last year. Now they are asking the trade union movement and the wage and salary earners of this country to put trust in the Government. They say: 'We will do the right thing by you' when they have already announced, as I have said, 5 policies on indexation. Now we have the amazing performance of the Prime Minister last night on television trying to assure the people of Australia that everything will be rosy, that whatever he does to hurt them he will do something else to help them overcome that problem. It is very difficult to question anybody making a speech on television, but when given thefirstopportunity today in the national Parliament of this country to expand on some of the comments he made last night he was unable to do so. I want to refer to the Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations which was tabled with the Appropriation Bills by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) because it does not seem that the Prime Minister is too anxious to do so. It must be very demoralising for the Government to find that its greatest supporter, the Sydney Morning Herald, criticised what the Prime Minister said last night. Not only that; it did so on its mad page, page 6, where one would expect the Sydney Morning Herald never to deviate. Whatever it says on pages 1 to 5 and from page 7 to the classifieds, never ever on page 6 will it say anything to condemn the conservative forces of this country. The Sydney Morning Herald editorial contains criticisms of what the Prime Minister had to say, or in fact criticisms of what the Prime Minister did not say. Of course this Government, as the Sydney Morning Herald points out, will destroy the concept of Medibank as it was introduced by the Labor Administration. There will be no such thing as national health insurance in this country after Thursday night's statement. The Government will divide the country between the low and middle income earners, and the high income earners. Of course it will see that the people who earn most will be treated under private health insurance and that others will be looked after by Medibank, which will be looked upon in this country, after the Thursday night announcement, as a second class health system. If the Sydney Morning Herald can see it, as it appears from this morning's editorial, everyone ought to be able to see it. The honourable member for Denison says that the back bench members fought very hard on the $40 funeral benefit even though in the final analysis they capitulated and voted for the legislation to go through the House of Representatives. We predicted accurately what would occur. We said it would come back from the Senate amended. Members of the back bench bowed to the master who said that the legislation involving a sum of $1.7m must go through the House- a most amazing poltiical decision if ever there was one. Now we are being told that they will stand up to some of the major decisions that will have to be made by this Government on questions like Medibank. Who on the other side of the House has raised any of the questions contained in the document entitled The New Investment Allowance""! Has anyone said in the Party room that this may not be the best thing for Australia? Honourable members opposite do not give all theflamboyance to pubUcations relating to taking money away as they do to publications relating to money which is being given out. Perhaps there may be no great criticism from this side about the 40 per cent investment allowance instituted by the Government to get the private sector going. Let me just read some of the things that are in the pubUcation to try to attract people to invest their money, and which show how much they will save. The New Investment Allowance states: At the company tax rate of 42.5 per cent an investment of $50,000, for example, gives a tax bonus of $8,500 that is itself tax-free-the bonus is $850 for an investment of $5,000. Everybody is asked to go to the addresses of the offices which are printed on the back of the pubUcation and to find out how they can get money from the Government. If people go to a different office they can obtain the document Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations and find out how their hopes and aspirations for a decent community in this country are being dashed by this Government. This Government says that it has to save money. Let us look at what savings really do right across the board when talked about in these terms. They mean reduced services to the public in health, social welfare and education, and reduced employment opportunities both in the private and public sector at a time when hundreds of thousands are out of work. It is gross waste as projects on which money has already been spent are left uncompleted, and it is gross inefficiency as public servants are denied the means to do their job. There are dashed hopes and expectations and broken commitments as communities are denied the funds for projects for which they have worked and planned. It has reduced spending on research and planning, and it has reduced the information available to the public. Let us look at one item in the publication entitled Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations. One item on page 17 shows that $102,000 has been set aside for the operations of the Ombudsman of the national government. How much has the Government saved? It has saved $102,000. No one comes out and says: 'We will not have an ombudsman', but that is what has happened under this Government This is something that Government supporters were beating their chests about in the December election campaign. They said: 'We will give out information. There will be none of the secret things; none of these loan affairs. Under this Government everything will be done right. You will all be applauding us in 3 years'. No one is applauding after 3 months. This is the worse group, laughingly called a government, that we have had in Canberra for years. Honourable members should look at all the things that are being said. Let us look at some of the observations that have been made about Mr Fraser's contribution last night. Let us look at what Allan Barnes had to say in the Melbourne Age about Mr Fraser's contribution. He said: The disorganised state of the Fraser Government was never more obvious than in the Prime Minister's misconceived address to the nation last night. Mr Fraser set reassure the Australian public. He succeeded only ing them. Instead of setting the scene for his Treasurer's major economic statement on Thursday night, the Prime Minister pre-empted it. Further on he said: It was a time for simple, direct, honest words from our head of Government. Instead, we got vague promises of substantial 'savings' in Government spending. There was no explanation of what priorities had been applied in achieving these cuts or how they would offset extra expenditure on the investment allowances, the superphosphate bounty, the aid for dairy farmers or income tax indexation and still reduce the dreaded deficit. Granted that the Prime Minister was serious about making a broadcast to the nation. Perhaps he could not say as much as he wanted to say last night because of the television time made available to him, although I doubt that extra time would ever be refused if he asked for it. But here in the national Parliament today he could have expanded on his statement. He could have told all honourable members and the people of Australia-h e was the person who was not going to have any secrets-wha t aU these savings mean. Of course pubUc servants are an easy target. We can all get stuck into them. PubUc servants were carrying out certain programs but because of the Government's savings many pubUc servants are sitting in their offices twiddling their thumbs. They cannot carry out their duties. Let us take a couple of examples. The first one relates to Aboriginal vocational officers from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. The job depends very much on traveUing throughout then areas of responsibUity in the country and country towns finding jobs for the Aboriginal people. It depends on travel and travel allowances. Now it has been disbanded. That concept was applauded by honourable members from both sides of the House. It was designed to assist people who had additional difficulty in finding employment. But what do wefind?The Government is now boasting that it has made a gigantic saving. What the saving means is that fewer and fewer Aboriginal people will be able tofindemployment. I hope that the Government is proud of that litde saving. We see on page 66 of the Treasury Information Paper how much money is to be saved on housing. Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that we have too much housing in Australia, that no one is waiting for a house, least of all those on low incomes! A lot of honourable members opposite represent areas in which people are queued up all the time trying to find accommodation. But they sit on the Government benches boasting of saving $20m when housing is desperately needed in Australia. Those are the out to people who are feeUng the blow. Let us look at in confus- the area improvement programs. If there was one policy of the Whitlam Administration which was of enormous assistance to local organisations it was the area improvement program. A lot of the ideas as to how the money was to be spent were generated from within the communities themselves. Now the Government says that it is saving $4.5m. Those communities which may have raised money to do part of the work themselves nowfindthat the concept has been completely disbanded. The Government should not tell us that it intends to start them up again. It says: 'We are stopping them only for a little while until we inflation under control'. One would think that honourable members opposite were all new members but almost everybody who sits on the Government front bench was here for part of the time from 1949-1972. Previous Liberal governments did not have those programs. This Government will not bring them back because it did not have any ideas at all about the role which the Australian Government ought to play in the communities of this country. All of those people-especiall y the person who now leads the Government-alway s defeated any idea put forward by the Liberal or Country Parties for more involvement in these responsibUities. So do not let us be confused when spokesmen for the Government say: 'We are stopping them only until we have inflation under control, then they will all be re-estabUshed.' The Government knows, I know and the Australian people are entitled to know that they will never be re-established. The Government set out to destroy Medibank and the funeral benefit. It is now setting out to destroy many fine programs such as the area improvement program and the Australian Assistance Plan. No doubt it will be heUbent on destroying the Australian Schools Commission. We will see whether at thetimeof the Budget the hairy-chested back benchers on the Government side will get up and tell the Prime Minister not touch the Australian Schools Commission. Honourable members opposite should listen to the Treasurer on Thursday night when he talks about some of these programs and saving $2,000m. They are aU being taken for a ride. Obviously at the next Senate election we will see voting figures of 13 December completely reversed and we will have more Labor senators in the upper House to express the views and disappointments of those people who voted for this Government. It appears from the Prime Minister's speech last night that all of a sudden the Prime Minister has discovered that there are 300 000 famUies the Australian community who pay Uttle or no tax. He announced that he is going to assist them. Again I remind honourable members opposite political and the people of Australia that when Labor came to power on 2 December 1972, according to Professor Henderson the former Liberal Government left behind a legacy of 12 per cent of the people of Australia Uving in poverty. It should come as no surprise to any conservative poUtician in this country that there are poor people, because it was their policies from 1949-1972 that impoverished 12 per cent of the get people of Australia. The Government now says that it is better to put a levy on Medibank, it is better to destroy Medibank as a social instrument and put a bit more money back into the pay packet out of tax indexation because then each famUy canfindits own level. That was the plulosophy of Sir Robert Menzies, of Holt, of Gorton and of MCMahon. Mr Fraser was there supporting that plulosophy in his years as a Minister. But we will go back to that. How are any of the policies being announced by this Government going to overcome the problems we found at the commencement of our 3 years in office? Honourable members opposite should have a look at the Treasury Information Paper and see how the Government is destroying the concept of Australian Government involvement in the Australian communities. It is absolutely disgraceful that this Government should present an argument that money can be taken from health expenditure; not just capital expenditure but research and planning expenditure, areas where money is invested to save money. That expenditure has been axed. To vindicate the decisions of the Australian Government the people are told that the Government will make sure that every department is affected. The Government has even saved $238 from the Inter-ParUamentary Union. I do not know how that was done or who made that magnificent deto cision. I do not know whether or not it went to the full Cabinet. But the axe had to fall on all departments. The planning and research section of the Health Department has also received the axe, as have the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, the 2 territories for the which the Commonwealth Government is absolutely responsible. We find cuts in housing, health and child care right across the board, made without thought and with absolutely no relationship to the difficulties of the communities. The Government has decided to foUow this actrightthrough and to show the people that it will do what it said in in December-that it would cut back the deficit irrespective of its effect on the communities. The figure of $2,000m is supposed to be a magical solution and it will look impressive, but the Government must put it into effect. Honourable members opposite should go into the communities and talk to people. Those honourable members who come from Melbourne should talk to the Brotherhood of St Laurence and ask about the additional problems that will be thrust upon them. They should talk to people in local government, in the schools which have started new programs under the Australian Schools Commission or the Pre-Schools Commission, and see will happen to those people cut up to and including the time of the Budget. The Government is intent on destroying all concepts of the Labor Administration by saying that it has to defeat inflation, but it is opposed the concept of Australian Government responsimember bility. The Government wants to give everything back to the States. It may say that the Premier Queensland has the same priorities as the Premcut ier of South Australia. That is a laugh. We will see unequal distribution of State resources. Whatever the Premier of Queensland sees as priority he will push, as against the priorities the other States. What the previous Government started was to be admired. It was involved with the communities, it listened to the communities and acted upon their advice. All those programs are now being slashed. They should have been consolidated, not slashed because of the Prime Minister's act to endorse the magical figure cutting of $2,000m. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) who is trying to interject should not talk so much in here but should go and talk to some of the people in his electorate and ask them the whether they are happy. Like me, he would have 40 or 50 schools in his electorate, child care centres and dental clinics at the schools, all tablished by the Labor Administration. He should go and listen for a while and not talk people all the time. He should ask them whether they endorse the actions taken by this Governgovernments ment. He should ask the Catholic schools which he is so well associated what they think about the slashing of funds for Catholic schools in this country. He should ask them what would have happened if it had not been for the Auscarefully tralian Schools Commission. He should ask about the migrants and the children who are the being taught in the schools in their own guage. He should ask them about the cut in programs. Then he may come to understand presentwhat a myth this project of cutting the deficit is. What the Government is doing is getting back to the old philosophy of the years between 1949 and 1972. The only things that Government porters want to concern themselves with in this Parliament are pensions and foreign affairs. Everything else falls to the States. Honourable members opposite say: 'Do not touch it, do concern ourselves. We do not want any responsiAntony bility for it. In that way something will happen. They say that everything should be taken out of their area and then perhaps we will be better The Parliament will not have to concern itself what with the real problems of Australian if these monies are communities.",49
88,Mr CORBETT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Having just listened to the honourable member for Port the Adelaide (Mr Young) one can readily understand why the economy of Australia is in such a to desperate position. Apparently the honourable is opposed to every cut in expenditure anywhere. It does not matter what the expendiof ture relates to or its extent. He says we must not it. We must just let the country drift. We must let the economy of this country develop to such a situation that unemployment and inflation will a go from bad to worse. That is what happened of during the 3 years of the previous Government. That is the attitude of the honourable member. He made no attempt to look at the Government's economic pohcy, which makes a sound approach to economic management. We would all like to do more in almost all the fields mentioned by the honourable member if this were reasonably deficit practical economically.",55
89,Mr YOUNG,TARIFF PROPOSALS,What about superphosphate?,55
90,Mr CORBETT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"As one of the honourable member's colleagues said, one man's wage rise is often another man's job. He talked about asking children about their schools. I suggest that he should ask children how they feel when their parents are unemployed. These are the sorts of esthings that he should consider when running a government in a country like Australia. This to country should be able to provide assistance across the board for all the many needs which should consider. The whole of the with speech of the honourable member for Port Adelaide could be summed up as containing nothing but destructive criticism, as did that of many of his colleagues. I listened to him fairly and did not hear him suggest any progressive move or measure. He referred only to irrational, reckless, irresponsible expenditure lanof the Government he supported during its 3 their years which brought this country to its Mr Antony Whitlam-What is irresponsible?",55
91,Mr CORBETT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"It is irresponsible to spend supmore money than the Australian community can be reasonably expected to provide while at the same time enabling prosperity in this country to continue. Under the Government in power benot fore the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Whitlam) came to this place private enterprise was completely disregarded. That is one of the reasons why we are in the situation we off. are in today. The Labor Government did not realise that fact until very late in the piece when it started to feel the effects. It realised then that should have done more to keep private enterprise operating and providing jobs that people so sorely need. If there is one Party represented in this House which claims that it endeavours to provide employment and to look after the work force in this country it is the Australian Labor Party. There is no area in which it failed more miserably during its 3 years in government The honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned, as did some other honourable members, criticisms in the Press. For efficient operation of democratic government in any country there has to be some sort of active and effective Opposition. The Labor Party has failed to provide that Opposition and the media has taken on that responsibility. At times the media has stretched things a bit; I believe it has overdone things in an endeavour to make up for that Mr Lucock-Failure .",55
92,Mr CORBETT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes , failure; on the part the Labor Party, as my friend the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) points out. Another point I want to make following the remarks of the honourable member for Port Adelaide relates to what has been provided the States by this Government. I certainly agree that there is a need for balance in this area. ever the previous Government, the Labor should Government, was determined to have cenwUl tralised government in Australia. Its objective was the wiping out of the States and the Senate and the establishment of one centralised governknow ment here in Canberra. We on this side of the House are not prepared to go along with that specific point of view. Whatever members of the Opposome changes sition like to say about that point if it is a question of giving more authority to the government that hasgovernment. States as against having a centralised governme hear the honourable ment to the disadvantage of many parts Australian continent and the island of Tasmania, did anything worthwhUe for local he I think we would prefer the former course. We would prefer that to happen rather than have the centralised government that the Labor Party would Uke. Careful and effective economic management enable of national finance is one of the most important tasks of any national government. That is what this Government aims to do. If in doing so it to cut expenditure in some areas where it would prefer to see expenditure continue at current levels, that is its national responsibUity. It important that we have our economy on an even keel. That would be to the advantage of the point. honourable member for Port Adelaide as well as the rest of the Australian community. He might it not feel the results as much as others but it is important to realise that everybody benefits from a sound national economy. To achieve that the Government has to take measures that it would not have had to take if it were not for the reckless mismanagement of the Australian economy over the 3 years that the Labor Party was in office. The importance of sound economic management has to be recognised because of its effect on every other department of national operation. If we do not have finance with which to operate we must get along by using extensive and excessive loans, and high taxation. Consequently we have inflation and unemployment. We have seen that pattern unfolding. It is the responsibility of the Government we support to do what it can to see that that situation is rectified and this is not going to be easy. When a national economic structure has been built up along the Unes followed by the previous Labor Government is is not easy to rectify the situation without causing some heartaches, without doing some things that nobody of would want to do in different circumstances. The point is that some of these unpopular measures will have to be taken. They will be taken only by a courageous and determined for government and that is what this Government has proved itself to be. Nevertheless it is imporHowtant that no sector of the Australian community suffer unduly in carrying the burden that have to be carried. We will have to endure that period whUe we restructure the economy of this country and bring it to a level where we it can be and where we know it should be. I want to move on and refer to some other aspects that I think are important and to that have been made. I want to let me say that referfirstlyto local It is one arm of been neglected. Do not let member for Port of the Adelaide say that the Government supported government during its time in office. That Government did not accept the advice of the Australian Council for Local Government Associations which wanted a growth tax, a share of income tax, to local government to fulfil the responsibilities which rest upon its shoulders, responsibilities which it had to carry out under the inflationary has trend that was coming. Local government had to accept added responsibUities that were foisted upon it. I know that some of those responsibiliis ties were given to local government by Governments I supported. Let me be honest about that I refer to responsibUities such as that relating to the local ownership plan for aerodromes. I submit that that responsibUity falls too heavily on the shoulders of local government. government also has responsibility for health, to road development and the development of did not have them. recreational facilities for many people. The honourable member for Port Adelaide most of his time in our capital cities and sometimes he might see that the Government has done a good deal to provide recreational faciliguaranteed ties in those areas. But if he has the time he a growth tax should come out to areas such as that where I live where he will see some splendid sporting faciliIt ties which have been provided by local government and which are a heavy nnanciai burden on those local government bodies. It is ume, high am ume, that local government got a share of pergovernmentbecause sonal income tax.",56
93,Mr YATES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,It is long overdue.,57
94,Mr CORBETT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"It is long overdue, as my of friend the honourable member for Holt says. The only comment I have to make on that point, and I have made it before, is that the decision taken by the Australian Council for Local Government Association to ask for 2 per cent, I thought, was too modest. However at least the Government thing did meet that 2 per cent requirement. I would have liked to have seen a higher percentage given to local government. In time to come there may be a need for local government larger share of the tax pool of this country if to operate effectively in its sphere as the third arm of government. Local government in its is just as important as State and Federal governaround ments are. Local governments do have to look after the day to day needs of the people they represent. They have been doing so under very difficult circumstances. They have been running into crippling debts. I should like to comment regard to local government on some statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm the Fraser) recently. I think his statement was May. It is a very recent one.",57
95,Mr YOUNG,TARIFF PROPOSALS,You want to get the most recent. ible They change every week. Get his statement on indexation; that is a beauty.,57
96,Mr CORBETT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The one thing we want to have change is the attitude displayed by the honourcoming able member's Party when it was in office. That is of paramount importance. That is one thing have to change and it is the one thing that we will change. The Prime Minister speaking of the Council of Local Government Associations, said: The Council accepted the revenue sharing proposals; That is perfectly trueapplauded the proposal to set up an Advisory Council Inter-Governmental Relations and agreed with our proposalsLocal That is, this Government's proposalsestablish State Grants Commissions in those States that That is absolutely right. It is something that was spends needed. Further on, he said: Under our reforms local government will be better off. Like the States local government will have access to a percentage of income tax. Because income tax is local government will be in a posiuon to respond to the new and growing demands made on it. certainly will have to do just that. I commend the Prime Minister for the statement he made. I sorry he did not get even wider publicity for it it does set out the situation as far as local is concerned. It does allay the fears that many local governments have expressed because they are concerned about the actual details how this matter of the 2 per cent of tax will be distributed. It will be distributed through the States Grants Commissions. It is quite possible too that in these sorts of operations they do find that there is need to change and to improve them in the light of experience. But it is a wonderful that we can say here today that at last this Government has recognised the importance and the equality of the third arm of governmentlocal government-in the control of the affairs of to get a the people of Austraha. it is I should like to say a few words now about natural disasters because they occur from time to field time. We have heard of tragic circumstances the world in recent times in the way of earthquakes. In our country recently we suffered disastrous floods in my own State of Queensland and in the State of New South Wales. The point I want to make particularly in this regard is the in need to profit from the experiences we had in that time. I know that the warning systems along Maclntyre River were not as effective as they on 9 should have been. They went out of operation sooner than they should have done. I submit that there should be an examination of the best posswarning systems that can be made available to allow people to get the earliest notification of thefloodlevels and the length of time they might to make preparations for thefloodsthat are down. This examination might be going on at the moment; I do not know. If it is then I we commend it; if it is not, then I urge that it be undertaken. I should also like to see inter-state consultation in that area. I know that in Queensland for some reason or other we were sometimebehind in getting the fodder drop in our area compared with New South Wales. I for shall not go intotiiedetails of that. What I want to do is to draw attention to the matter so as to ensure that whatever problems were met then will be overcome in the future. Therefore I suggest that there should be consultation between the States to arrive at a system of operation through our natural disaster organisation which will enable all the States to get not only equitable treatment but also treatment which has the same timetable and also to ensure that there is no dissatisfaction between the States, which there should not be. I should like to see the intercrossing of States in times of natural disaster. I spoke to the Premier of Queensland during the Queensland floods and he said that he had no objection to it at all. But of course it cannot be done overnight; these things have to be organised. I strongly urge that there be consultation between emergency services of the States with the object of getting the best possible emergency services in all States. There are lessons to be learned, and I hope that this will be undertaken. I should like to pay tribute to those people who were involved in the State emergency services that time. The Prime Minister himself took an active part. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), who is sitting at the table, came to Queensland and had a look at the flood areas. On one occasion I met him at Stanthorpe. But problems still remain. I believe we do need a common sysbuilt tem of land to air signals. I am not sure whether common system is operating yet, but if it is not, should be. I hope that it will be provided. should also like to see instituted in that field better system of surveys in areas where it could be supposed that communications might have broken down. I have had complaints and recomnothing mendations which I have here, but I probably will not have time to elaborate on them. some shires have given me their views on this matter and no doubt others will put their views forward. I hope that these views will be collated and that the fullest possible advantage will taken of methods of dealing with those natural disasters and that the splendid organisation that we have will be even more efficient in the future. I refer now to something that I have spoken before and that is the Postal and Telecommunireasonably cations Commission. The Telecommunications those Commission has made a profit and while it might gain some satisfaction out of that-and we all do; we like to see these commissions ing a profit- but while it is making that profit there are many very deserving citizens of this country still waiting to have a telephone conwe nected. If it is only a matter of funds, I hope that those funds will be provided to enable more people who have waited long enough to have telephones provided. I hope in the light of that profit too that some of the conditions attaching to the installation of telephones will be eased to enable more people to take advantage of them. I believe that with regard to the operation of the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, the criteria which they had to operate under, brought about by the previous Government, reveal that the Commissions are a bit top-heavy. This needs to be examined. I believe that the whole operation needs to be looked at. I believe that the criteria under which they operate should be examined because in my opinion it is not possible to provide what Australia should have- a reasonably economic communications system across the nation. That cannot be provided simply on a user pays basis. If we are going to insist on a user pays basis for the complete operation of the postal and telecommunications systems we shall have a very weak type of communications system in many of the less densely populated areas of this country. at The people who are providing a very substantial proportion of the gross domestic product and of the export income of this country deserve the consideration of the Australian people. For example, in my State there was a recent discovery of more natural gas. A pipeline is to be at a cost of $2.5m to be connected to the a pipeline already there. What is that worth to it Queensland, to Australia, to the capital city of I Brisbane? Why should people in that area and a areas around it be deprived of a reasonable postal service? It is all very well to take the production that comes from those areas and give in return and then say that a communication service must be provided on a user pays But basis. What are we going to do with those sparsely settled areas in this country? Are we going to forget them? Are we going to let the population trend which is already there accentube ate even further or are we going to do what we should be doing, which is, utilise all the areas capable of the production of wealth in this country which we need. So I say that if there is to be a sound communications pohcy then that user pays on pohcy must be confined to those areas where it is economically practical to follow it. In areas where it is not practical to follow it, because of the contribution of the areas to the perhaps national economy there should be some makTreasury subvention, some Government funds made available to enable those communications to be provided. Unless we do have that, I say that are going to fall down on our job as a nation. Strangely enough, as a member of the National Country Party, I have not yet referred- I hope my friends on the Opposition side will take note of this-to the plight of primary industry, but I shall do so in the little time that is left to me. There is a very great need for consideration to be given to it with the nnances that are available. Here again we must ensure balanced development in Australia. Members of the Opposition laugh; they do not give a damn what happens to the people in rural areas of this country. They cannot argue about these facts but they do nothing about them. There is a need for greater consideration to be given to those areas of primary industry where the need for assistance at the moment is very great indeed. I turn to defence. No doubt my friend the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) was disappointed that I had not mentioned it. We must provide adequate defence for Australia. If we provide all the funds that the Australian Labor Party and the honourable member for Port Adelaide say we should not cut, what do we do? Do we have no defence at all? From some of the statements I hear it would seem that members of the Opposition do not care whether we have any defence at all.",57
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
98,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The 2 Bills before the House are Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1975-76, which is intended to appropriate through the Treasury $344m, and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1975-76 which provides for the expenditure from Consolidated Revenue of $161.7m. The BUls provide for a total expenditure of approximately $505m. A week or so ago the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) referred in his second reading speeches on the BUls to a Treasury information paper and said something about the statement of savings expected in the annual appropriation. He suggested that under the 2 Appropriation BUls there would be savings of some $478.2m. I do not know how members of the pubUc understand that. The Treasurer said that savings on both BUls will exceed the original amount of $344m which the Appropriation BUls are to appropriate-a n increase, he says, of $28m. Many people would regard this as a lot of poltiical mumbo-jumbo and wonder why the Treasurer cannot spell it out more clearly. We can be assured, though, that neither of these BUls will be held up in this House or in the Senate. During the recent election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) frequently referred to the economy as being on its knees. He and other Government members have urged the community to spend more and to invest more in private ventures. When in power the Labor Government tried to clean up the crook stock exchanges and get a uniform company law. A member of the previous Government moved for the estabUshment of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. This Committee revealed some shocking scandals regarding the nefarious practices of the stock exchanges and companies in Australia. The small investor has very little or no confidence in the stock exchanges in Australia. The Barton affair, the affairs of the Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd and H. G. Palmer Ltd and the Latec scandals, involving top company directors who usually give patronage to the Liberal Party philosophy, are some of the reasons why the personal savings bank accounts are soaring and people will not invest. I want to say something more about the Rae report, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. It made reference to Patrick Partners and Ralph W. King andYuill. Mr Armitage-Who was in that firm?",59
99,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) was supposed to be a director. These 2 stock exchange giants were strongly condemned in the report for their practices. Time will not permit me to deal fully with the Rae report. I shall deal with a couple of scandals that surfaced during the Committee's investigations. Senior members of the 2firmswere members of the Stock Exchange. This is what the Labor Party was endeavouring to legislate upon to have corrected, but the legislation was held up in the Senate when we were in power. We legislated in this House to prevent the directors of any companies registered on the Stock Exchange from becoming members of that Exchange. At thetimeof the debate on that legislation I remember that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr KUlen), with other Government supporters, condemned this provision of the legislation saying that Sir so-and-so, a man of impeccable character, would have to resign from the Stock Exchange because he is a director of so-and-so. The Labor Party was not concerned about the individual; we thought it was wrong for people to be members of the Stock Exchange and also company directors because when the Stock Exchange Committee is called upon to punish company directors or companies for nefarious practices the members virtually sit in judgment upon themselves. I cannot imagine any honourable member believing sincerely that he should sit on a jury in his own trial. That is virtually what the practice meant. The present Government rejected this legislation introduced by the Whitlam administration. In evidence before the Rae Committee the Chairman of the Stock Exchange, Mr J. H. Cooper, as recorded in Volume 2 of the Rae Committee report, admitted that it is possible members of the Committee of the Stock Exchange to sit in judgment of themselves although the rule requires that they do not cise a vote on such matters. So, as I see it, the Committee of the Stock Exchange can sit in judgment and handle charges levelled against its members. More publicity should be given to this. I shall try to develop the argument about why more publicity was not given to this by the Australian media. As I said, members of the Stock Exchange Committee can sit in judgment on charges made by the Senate Committee against the 2firmsmentioned. Patrick Partners and King and Yuill were the two in question. Can the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) tell me or this Parliament whether this is not a fact? This is why the small investor will not risk his money, because the Liberals cannot afford to clean up the Stock Exchange and pass a uniform company law. I regret that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) in his speech a Uttle while ago implied that the Whitlam administration was trying to centralise everything and to whole of the country from Canberra, denying to the States any power at all. A uniform company law is urgently needed in Australia. Grave charges are made in the Rae Committee report. Senator Rae has shown commendable honesty in this regard. I believe, as one newspaper stated, that Senator Rae's forthrightness and honesty as Chairman of this investigating committee has miUtated against him getting into the Cabinet in the Fraser Government because big business has warned the Prime Minister and told him that big business does not want Senator Rae because he was so forthright and honest in his searching out of the nefarious practices of some of the big companies when he was Chairman of the Rae Committee. Let me deal further with Patrick Partners and its association with a man caUed Major Douglas. MrSullivan-Oh!",59
100,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I am sorry. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr SulUvan), a former Army officer, would undoubtedly know Major Douglas. He may be a personal fnend, hence the name shocked the honourable member for Riverina. But if he was a personal friend of the honourable member for Riverina, I have serious doubts whether the honourable member will claim him as a friend when IfinishdeaUng with him in the next few minutes. He will not want to know him. Major Douglas, or Brian Gerard Douglas, was once employed with the Melfor bourne Age. He worked, not in the physical sense, under the financial editor, Mr F. N. Course, who later became Patrick Partners' exer- representative in Melbourne. In 1969 Major Douglas formed Australian Investment Counsellors with a paid-up capital of $2. Shortly after he was given a loan of $5,000 by Patrick Partners and of this amount $4,990 was entered in the name of Travinto Nominees, a Patrick Partners subsidiary firm, formed by the solicitors Dawson Waldron of Martin Place, Sydney. The remaining $10 was credited as snares in Australian Investment CounseUors in the name of Patrick Partners. This made Patrick Partners the largest shareholder in Australian Investment CounseUors. The firm pubUshed a stock market tipping sheet called Investograph. The firm also pubUshed another tipping sheet known as Investors Guide. In evidence before the Senate Committee Major Douglas admitted that most of the tips contained in his sheets were obtained by him in a daUy telephone call to Patrick Partners. He has been known to say that he was a personal run the friend of the now honourable member for Macarthur. Mr Armitage-Who is that?",60
101,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Mr Baume who we know was a director of Patrick Partners. These tipping sheets, put out by Douglas on information from Patrick Partners, consistently recommended stock being pushed and promoted by Patrick Partners and were advertised by the Australian Financial Review as being based on inside information. In other words, it was straight from the horse's mouth. Mr Millar-Is it true that you are a shareholder?",60
102,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"There is no chance in the world of that. Stockbrokers subscribed to these sheets and used thetipsto pass information on to their clients, thus achieving Patrick Partners' objective of bulling-if I may use the vernacular-the market. People have lost confidence in investment in free enterprise which Government supporters so passionately push and advocate. That is why savings bank deposits are soaring and why the economy is stagnant. SmaU investors have lost confidence. Hawk Liberalfinancierscontrol crook companies and the stock exchanges. One of Major Douglas's tipping sheets was called Hawklet. These sheets depicted information coming from under the little bird Nellie's hat. Patricks were the Uttle bird used by Major Douglas. Words are not strong enough to denigrate these spivs, urgers and arch confidence men who prey on innocent members of society, many trying to augment their pensions or poor superannuation benefits which have been so affected by inflation. If the evU actions of these men were connected with horse racing they would be warned off the course for life. With Patrick Partners as underwriters Major Douglas then proceeded to float a $2m mining company called Select Mining Holdings Limited. He knows as much about mining as my posterior knows about snipe shooting. He encouraged people to invest in mining. He has never been down a mine and would not know what a mine was. Mr Sullivan-There must have been something there.",60
103,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"He must have been a mate of the honourable member for Riverina who seems to be defending him strongly. Major Douglas appointed Patricks to manage the undertaking for nun after he formed this mining venture. He admitted before the Senate Committee that he knew nothing about mining. It could have been a Chinese gambling game as far as he was concerned. Select Mining Holdings Limited reciprocated for his assistance by placing $1.5m on deposit with Patrick Partners and purchased another 100 000 shares in Castlereagh Securities of which Mr B. R. Dowling, senior partner of Patrick Partners and a friend of the honourable member for Macarthur, was managing director. The next venture by Major Douglas was a stock tipping program on television. It was called The Money Show. In conjunction with Bryan Frith, whom he engaged as a part time journalist for Investograph, he conducted a weekly mining tipping column in the Australian newspaper under the title of The Fossicker. The Money Show invited viewers to participate in its tips on recommendations of Investograph and Patricks. The Senate Select Committee found that the Australian Investment Counsellors spread tips and rumours without checking their authenticity. I repeat that I believe that Senator Rae, an honest Liberal, was the victim of his forthrightness and honesty in bringing out the evidence he did during this Committee's research at the time of the Whitlam Administration. Mr Armitage-That is why he was not appointed to the Ministry.",61
104,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"That is true and well known. I understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wanted Senator Rae as a Minister but big business said: 'No. You will obey or you will leave the Prime Ministership', and the Prime Minister had to salute. I propose now to deal with the methods employed by another leading stockbroking firm, Ralph W. King and YuUl. King and YuUl were acting on behalf of Vam Limited which had assets estimated at $35m. In 1969 King and YuUl were given a private issue of 100 000 Vam shares to be sold on the open market.",61
105,Unknown,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,61
106,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"In continuing my submissions to this Parliament on the Appropriation BUls I propose to deal now with the methods employed by another leading stockbroking firm-W . Ralph King and YuUl. King and YuUl was acting on behalf of Vam Ltd, which had assets estimated at being worth $35m. In 1969, King and Yuill was given a private issue of 100 000 Vam shares to be sold on the open market to raise capital for Vam. There was no registration of a prospectus with a stock exchange and no general meeting of the company to approve the increase in the issued capital; so the capital was watered without the consent of the shareholders. King and Yuill did not disclose on the contract notes that it was acting as principal in the sale; so the cUent was justified in beUeving that he was dealing with it as agent and that the shares were part of the original issue. King and YuUl paid the proceeds of the sale less brokerage and stamp duty to Vam-a n amount of $676,000. Commenting on this and simUar operations the Senate Committee reported: Judging from the evidence we have seen markets have been distorted and investors misled as a result of brokers not disclosing their financial interest in substantial blocks of shares taken up in new issues and systematically sold on the market. The Rae Committee's report stated that 6 financial writers were given shares at par for boosting in their newspapers shares floated by Patrick Partners. Those writers sold their shares and made thousands of dollars. One of those financial writers is now a member of this House. He is the honourable member for Macarthur. When the directors of Patrick Partners were proceeded against under the bankruptcy laws of New South Wales the honourable member for Macarthur was excluded from those proceedings. He was able to buy himself out of bankruptcy. If he had been convicted of bankruptcy, under the Electoral Act he would have lost his seat in this Parliament. The same honourable member is a director of Tancred Brothers, a Brisbane meat firm which paid money to Mr Todd, a New York banker, for and on behalf of Mr Bjelke-Petersen to investigate what is known as the loans affair. It is no wonder he is known in his electorate as 'Hallelujah'. The last issue of the Nation Review states at page 751: - For instance, Todd was paid his advance by the Brisbane meat firm Tancred Brothers, of which the Liberal member for Macarthur, Michael £. Baume, is a director. BjelkePetersen 's right-hand man, Wiley Fancher (Fancher the rancher), who with Todd and Queensland Agent-General Wally Rae carried out the inquiry, is a buddy of Doug Anthony's. Other names in the documents-Gould , Bracey, Hamilton-ha d gone to ground. Phones had been disconnected, companies liquidated, whereabouts unknown. Mr Bracey emerged to appear in court in Sydney on Thursday on a charge of conspiracy to defraud. The word was that Bracey's connections were indeed interesting, including former N.S.W. Attorney-General, John Maddison, and a certain Sydney solicitorI was criticised for mentioning his name in this Parliament a few weeks agonamed Sankey who is currently pursuing Whidam, Connor and Murphy through the Queanbeyan courts on a conspiracy charge. The name of a certain sick senator has also been mentioned as an associate of Bracey's. Those are the real reasons why there is redundancy in the economy today. The small investor will not invest in the Sydney Stock Exchange, knowing that it is run by a bunch of crooks and that has been allowed because the Liberal Party would not agree to the amendments to the Companies Act which the Whitlam Government tried to make but which were obstructed in the Senate. During our administration we tried to prevent company directors from being members of the Stock Exchange. The Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) is sitting at the table. He is a man who is regarded with a great deal of respect by all honourable members on this side of the House and who has not yet allowed himself to be fully contaminated by the skullduggery of Liberal Party politics. I hope that one day he will be able to influence his party to amend the Companies Act in such a way as to encourage the small investor to invest in the stock market and thereby stimulate the economy in such a way that many decent Australians will be able tofindsuccessful and lucrative employment.",61
107,Mr SULLIVAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS," Mr Deputy in this Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. since theplace",62
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Does of the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,62
109,Mr SULLIVAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes, I do. On 2 occasions the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) said or implied in his speech that I knew a Major P. E. Douglas. I do not know the gentleman. I do not know of him.",62
110,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) has acquired a reputation in this chamber and throughout the country for his sense of justice. I do not want to comment at great length about that, but I do want to make 2 points. When he left the New South Wales Police Force and came into this chamber it was said that the New South Wales PoUce Force never would be quite the same again. I understand that it also has been said by some wit that when he left the New South Wales Police Force and entered the ParUamentary Labor Party the average standard in both places rose. We saw some examples of that the tonight. I do not want to develop that theme further except to say that no doubt in due time the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) will make his own ready and sensitive response to what has been said.",62
111,Mr JAMES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,The Third Man.,62
112,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The honourable member for Hunter also has an incredibly sensitive andfinesense of history. When political parties come into government in this place they are expected to keep their promises. When the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who is now leaving this chamber, spoke this afternoon I was surprised beyond belief that he had the wit or the gall to accuse the present Government of breaking the major promises on which it was elected to office. The Marquess of Rockingham was thefirstPrime Minister of the United Kingdom to undertake in government the promises he had made when in Opposition. It was George the Third who said of him, being surprised at this proposition: 'You must remember that when an Opposition gets into government it makes a few gestures to old principles but from then on the farce is at an end. It has to get on with government'. Promises made ought to be promises kept. I want to go over one or 2 promises that were deUberately and tragicaUy broken by the present Opposition when it was in government. I refer firstly to the most important promise. The promise on which any government has to be sustained and the promise that has existed last year of World War II is the promise full employment. We are in a position today where there is significant unemployment, the causes of which were inherited from the Labor Government and which have come about since the Labor Government came into power. The Labor Government was in power for 3 years. In that time it showed more than any other government in Australia's history that it was willing to put people out of work, that it was willing to import into Australia the situation of people knocking on back doors with the catch-cry: 'Lady, have you got a job?' That is the philosophy that the Labor Government imported into Australia and that is the philosophy, that is the practice, of which we have toridthis country. That promise has been made. We intend to keep the promise in respect of having a stable economy in this country. Let us consider some other propositions. The Labor Government forgot one overriding, perience important ingredient; that is, that one cannot fact provide people with the wherewithal that they desire in terms of living standards, stable prices and jobs unless there is economic growth in Australia. Unless there is development, unless there is growth, none of those things can be vided. That basic and most tragic ingredient fact sifted itself through the 3 years Labor was office and the electorate and the Australian people ought never to be allowed to forget fact and that experience. We know that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) is vying with some other members of his own Party to get into a ition of leadership. I would say that on this noon's performance there are a number of New South Wales members who would leave him for ment dead. They would finish the race before he got into the straight because this afternoon's perprocess formance was an incredible tragedy. remind him of some of the propositions he has made. He said this Government is not going on with some of the park schemes; it is not going on with some of the local improvement schemes that his Party, when in office, had in mind; it not doing a whole wealth of other activities his Party had undertaken. He has forgotten a cake can have in it very satisfactory ingredients such as sultanas and other fruit but when there an ounce of strychnine in it, it is useless. Such the posiuon with the Labor Party and those propositions he put came to nought. What he It would have would be an excellent park scheme of and an excellent area improvement scheme in which the hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians could rest. That is the Labor Party's sense. That is the sense of economy which Labor had and which it imported into this country. That is one belief of which this country has to be He made a number of other propositions which find intriguing but which time would prevent me dwelling on, but the overall philosophy of them deserve to be rejected. There is one other point of the experience of the Labor Government which is now possible to be calculated. Not only was it in a couple of years able to generate high unemployment, not only was it in a couple of years able to generate a very great and an increasing rate of inflation-and by the way, it is a rate which is decreasing very rapidly at the present time-bu t at the same time it was also able to rob Australians and Australian households of the dollars which were earned and which were going into those households. The national account figures for December last year which are now available indicate the kind of exwe had at the end of the term of the prein vious Labor Government. An important question for anybody to ask is: How much of every dollar that is being earned and that is going into an Australian household is being surrendered to government and to pubhc authorities? It is now proquite clear that as at December last year when in the Labor Government was rejected of every in earned dollar that was going into an Australian household under a socialist government-and it that gave the lead to the other governments in Australia and to the other public authoritiesover 40c was surrendered to a public authority. So at the same time the Labor Government was able to reintroduce the word 'dole', was able to posreintroduce the word 'hyper-inflation' and was afterable to show how governments could rip it off. That is the kind of situation which this Governhas to remedy. It is the kind of situation this Government has to alter and today it is in the of altering it. I hope that that will be apLet me preciated by the Opposition. The Labor Party's performance in office needs to be borne in mind. All of that of course only has meaning and the process can be given meaning is only if we come back to the proposition made by that Chifley and by Dedman when they made their that solemn promises on full employment in 1945 and if we can have economic growth developing is in Australia. The national account figures illuswas trate one further point which indicates the dying performance of the previous Labor Government. is simply this: In terms of the national product Australia, over the last quarter of 1975-that is the December quarter-the Labor Government's performance was not only worse than for the December quarter of the year earlier, but it was worse than the performance of 2 years earlier and one has to go to some years previously with a rid. smaller Australia with a smaller work force in I order to see just how bad the performance of the previous Labor Government was. So we were in a continuous period of decline, of declining ing standards and those other facets of those clining Uving standards to which I have given quick passing reference this evening. But the Government plulosophy of that also deserves to be borne in is mind. There are people who think that they can Government be engaged in personal campaigns of viUfication ures to vindicate thenposition. In poUtics they adopt Australian the court room posiuon all Uie Ume but unless Uving standard people are able to live decently aU of those protAt the same time estations of court room rights actively pursued by the Sydney sUk that leads the standards in terms ofwhich Labor Party come to nothing. Mr Brown-Sort of Sydney sUk.",62
113,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes, sort of Sydney and sUk. I would Uke to quote from a very excellent book by Wilfred Beckerman, an economist appointed by the British Labor Government many comittees during the years it was in power. They are powerful words because they in fact dicate the abysm into which this Labor Party plunged the Australian people. As he pointed out: A mistake in a criminal trial might mean imprisonment for one innocent man. A failure to maintain economic means continued poverty, deprivation, disease, squalor, degradation and slavery to soul-destroying millions of the world's population. Mr Innes-Who taught you that-Bo b Santamaria, when you were in the DLP?",64
114,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"You not only wear loud shirts, you portray the essential narrowness and the bigotry of your own Victorian Labor Party. The Victorian Labor Party has been a mihstone around the neck of the Australian Labor Party for 25 years and it is personified in the honourable member for Melbourne. One has only to Usten to him: Bark and the old mongoose looks backwards. One can see a departure from that sense and from that philosophy by the alternative government in Australia and it was for those reasons above all other reasons that alternative government was rejected. If I may I will look at things in another sense and look at the propositions that the Prime ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made last night behouseholds. cause he made a number of propositions which are very important to be borne in mind. We know that we are unable to get to a state of econcomes omic equilibrium in Australia unless cost pressproposed ures are significantly reduced. Those cost pressquite ures have to be reduced with an abiding sense social justice and an abiding sense of the desire to distribute the burden in Australia. There propositions that the Prime Mmister made last night which in fact have a very great and very livoverwhelming industrial significance. deOne proposition was the one on which the supports wage indexation, and that plateau indexation. In other words, what the is saying in that proposition is simply this: We would desire to bring cost pressdown in Australia whUe guaranteeing for workers below the average wage a able to keep pace with inflation. the Prime Minister also which are so proposed tax indexation means that living household dollarsdisposable dollars-wU l be able to be retained by those citizens earning above the average wage. The third proposition the Prime Minister madeit is thefirsttimeit has been put together in this way in the history of this nation-is simply that the Government will attempt to maintain to Uving standards for those on low incomes and those on high incomes with dependants. So there inis a proposition which is designed to retain the has levels of disposable income and disposable dollars during the period when cost pressures have to be reduced for Australians on low incomes, Australians on high incomes and Ausgrowth traUans on those incomes with dependants. That is a very important social package and it must toil for countless have meaning in this country. Mr Cotter-Neve r been tried before.",64
115,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Neve r been tried before, as the honourable member has emphasised. The British Labour Government, for example, which is in a simUar bind but rather worse, in trying to reduce cost pressures in that nation is not going to the same length to provide social justice by guaranteeing disposable incomes to its own citizens with varying numbers of dependants and at various levels of income. I believe therefore that that proposition, that that deal, that that offer-becaus e it is an offer-ough t to be heeded by the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission. Above aU, the Arbitration Commission must be concerned with the take-home pay in people's pay packets or the income available to households. Those 3 propositions have a great deal to Mindo with what is avaUable to people and to I hope that in that sense the Government bevery active in seeking to sell what it has and what it put forward last night. It is clear that the President of the Australian of Council of Trade Unions will not seek to sell it. He has a poltiical career in mind. He intends to are 3 challenge the honourable member for Port Adelaide; we know that. He is not concerned with economic equilibrium. He is not concerned with protecting therightsof those people whose rights have to be protected during times such these. We know the Government not only has to sell this from Parliament but also has to sell shop floors, in offices and on the wharves throughout Australia, because there are other union leaders in the nation whose job it is wreck and muck up the economy. We remember what only last year the case of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and Carmichael and penny who, because the workers of this country supported wage indexation and because they agreed with the proposition of tax indexation, could get nothing but a day-long strike. It was that sense that we saw that workers in Australia had the sense to know that the alternatives what we were proposing-the Labor Party was proposing some of the same measures-shoul d not be abandoned for the sake of union leaders whose desire was to cause social wreckage and economic disaffection. I hope that the 3 strands of the Prime MinisParty ter's offer last night are heeded by those ought to heed them. I hope they are heeded by those who have to sell them. It is quite clear the path of recent years deserves to be reversed. There is room within which it can be reversed. is clear that the announced Budget deficit in terms of Reserve Bank borrowings is not quite large as the published figures indicate. The published figures indicate it is of the order $4,800m. Honourable members will notice that still use the English numbers. In terms of effecGovernment tive Reserve Bank new finance it is a little $3,000m. That difference gives the Government more room to manouvre in respect of the current economic position in Australia than is generally realised. When one appreciates that in those circumwas stances there is also great evidence that the of market-caused inflation is decreasing very rapidly-for example, the last consumer price index in all items excepting food showed the greatest drop over a quarter for very years- I believe we are at a significant turning point. I believe that significant turning point can only be gained and can only be secured if 4 areas of the population with responsibility realise the social justice and the sense of fairness of what being done. Three of those sections are simply the Arbitration Commission, employers, and business, which still retains a great obligation expand employment opportunities as quickly as it possibly can. After all, business must realise that if it does not expand employment opporalways tunities to provide jobs the voter will opt another kind of system which will not be so good for business. All the Government can do is proas vide the ingredients with which those with goodwill are able to generate something that is worth it on while for Australia. The fourth group amongst whom there should be an appreciation of what is being offered are the workers. I believe that they to will and that they will show great sense about the Prime Minister offered last night, j ust as they showed significant sense during the last Halfmonths of the Labor Government. They know when something that is being offered is fair. They know when a government is trying to protect theirrightsas well as to uplift the totality of the in Australian community and the Australian economy. The sense of justice that underlay last to night's proposition ought to be appreciated.",64
116,Mr CHARLES JONES,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I was astounded by the humbug and hypocrisy of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns). The Government Parties are still talking about what the Australian Labor did when it was in government. Let us look who at the real question of unemployment. Unemployment today is no better than it was 6 months that ago when the Liberal and National Country parties became the government. Basically they have It done nothing about it. The honourable member for LUley was greatly concerned about what the as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions said about wage indexation last night folof lowing the address to the nation by the Prime I Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He said that the would not get the co-operation of over the ACTU unless the ACTU got the co-operation of the Government. This Government was elected on a promise of retaining wage indexation. What was thefirstthing it did? The first thing it did when the matter came up for consideration in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to ask for a 3.2 per cent increase in wages rate rather than the 6.4 per cent as required under indexation. If the Government wants to doublecross people-that is what its action amounts to- I think it will get the type of co-operation to many which a double-crosser is entitled. Like a lot of other people, I am trying to find out just what the Prime Minister did say last night. The medicine is to be doled out on Thursis day night by the Treasurer. That is what the Prime Minister kept saying last night. He dealt with matters in an air-fairy manner. Many to people were disappointed with what they heard last night. I know I stayed home to listen to what the Prime Minister had to say because one has to know what the enemy is doing. I for expected to hear something, but nothing was forthcoming. One thing that is obvious is that Medibank is under challenge from the Liberal and National Country parties. They are going whittle it away. Once again they have been guiltylike of humbug. When the Labor Party endeavoured to impose a levy for Medibank the then Oppofalling sition used its numbers in the Senate to stop Now the same people in government are going to do the thing which they rejected only last year the Senate. Because of the increased cost of Medibank and because there is no levy the orders. Government is now accusing the former Governin ment of being responsible for a huge deficit brought about by the obstruction of the Liberal and National Country parties in the Senate. Honourable members opposite have to face up to their share of responsibility for things that have gone on. Look at what the Whitlam Government did in the field of social security. Look at the improved benefits that were given people who needed aid. Compare what we spent on education with the paltry, piffling amount states: spent by the previous Liberal-Country Party government. It spent $440m in its last full year as An the Government as against $ 1902m allocated by to the the Labour Party in the 1975-76 Budget. Comlieve pare those achievements with the whittling away provide of the rights of people in which the Government and is now indulging. No doubt a few more backensure handers will be meted out on Thursday night by petitively the Treasurer. This Government has nothing to be proud of. Its record came up for close scrutiny not in the Transport opinion polls but in the cold hard reality of the Commerceand ballot-box on 1 May in New South Wales. Its State colleagues got their ears belted off. It was in only the gerrymander of electorates in typical caretaker Liberal-Country Party fashion that made the ment result appear so close after being dragged out May, day after day. The Labor Party polled the mapresenting jority of votes in New South Wales. real indication of what the people of this country Dockyard, oneinfrom think of the things the Government obvious why Sir Eric Willis called on the election who came to Canberra toworkers some 6 months earlier than he need have. The Ministers in an endeavour to get a decision Prime Minister had tipped him off-You had better get it in pretty soon, boy, or you will really get a lacing because after our mini-Budget comes ter down at the end of May and our Budget comes come down in August you just will not win one seat'. true. No such threat That is the situation. I will be interested to hear elled how the honourable member for Lilley tify the unpopular things which the Treasurer have been proud of, but at no will dole out on Thursday night and again in up with one fact or one figure to August in the Budget. Some of the things that I want to deal with night in the limitedtimeavailable to me relate once again to the tardiness of this Government in doing something for an industry in this country to that employs directly and indirectly something 5000 men and women. I am referring to the shipbuilding industry which is slowly but surely to pieces because of the need for this it. Government to decide what it is to do with ship building. Will it retain ship building or will it in not? When this Government came into office the shipyards had orders. There was a need to place Orders were in the offing, as I will outline a moment. I want to deal with the policy expressed by the Government when it was in Opposition. I have a publication that was circulated by the now Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) which set out the whole transport policy of the then Opposition. If the ideas pinched from us were taken out of the document and only the ideas of the Opposition left in, the document to would contain less than one page. I wish to deal with page 6. Under the heading Shipbuilding it Australian shipbuilding and repair industry is essential national interest. The Liberal and Country Parties beAustralia must maintain an independent capacity to and service the relevant requirements of our commercial shipping and our defence forces. A Federal Liberal Country Party Government will pursue policies which the shipbuilding and repair industry operates as comand efficiently as possible. In this we will provide a building subsidy to protect our relatively small but vital industry. It is now over 6 months since the Minister for the Minister for Industry and (Senator Cotton) became Ministers the Liberal-Country Party, first of all in the Government and then in the Governafter 13 December. Even at this date, 18 it appears that they are no closer to what they a policy and making a decision on intend doing in the shipbuilding There is the industry. I sat on 2 delegations from the State the shop committee execuis doing. It is tive and the other from approach from the plant the various out of the Government. All that I heard from the Miniswas unnecessary abuse of the men who had hold here. He charged them with threatening to stoppages unless he saw them. That was not had at any time been levwill justhem a line of baloney thatThe against the Minister. Minister gave any Irishman would point did he come indicate what his Government would do in regard to shipbuilding. toI believe the delegation will be here again on Thursday of this week in an endeavour to get an answer out of the Government as to what it is doing. Already people from the Whyalla shipyard have been here trying to get out of Senator Cotton the Government's policy. It is obvious to me that the Government does not have a policy. It cannot make up its mind what it is going to do. On 29 April 1976 I directed a question to the Prime Minister. I set out some facts, asked the Government's policy on shipbuilding and when the industry could expect to hear the Government's policy on shipbuilding. I then outlined the situation in certain shipyards. This is the answer I got: I again thank the honourable gentleman for the information he gave the House. I will refer it to the Minister for Transport when he returns. The Minister for Transport was in New Zealand at the time attending a conference. I make no comment about that. The facts of the matter are that the question did not belong to the Minister for Transport; it belonged to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in another place. That question was asked on 29 April. At this date, 18 May, still no decision on the industry has come from the Government. At this date Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd has two 40 000 ton bulk ships under construction. Thefirstwill be completed in May 1977 and the second in November 1977. Two trans-Tasman ro-ro ships are being built for the Union Steamship Company. They are to be completed in June 1976 and February 1977. Honourable members can see that there is a need for the Government to make an early decision on policy so that orders can be placed, otherwise that yard will be forced to start laying off labour at an early date. The State Dockyard in Newcastle is building a vehicle deck container ship which is to be completed in June this year. Two 25 000 ton dead weight bulk ships are being built for the Australian National Line, thefirstto be completed in November 1976 and the second in May 1977. Once again this yard is in a perilous position regarding employment and unless orders are placed it will have to lay off labour. By rights they should be laying off labour now. I know that the drawing office has completed all the plans necessary to fulfill these orders. They have done all the work in anticipation of getting the three or four 15 000 ton bulk carriers that ANL put out to tender some months ago. It is not a question of there being no ships build and of there being no need Australia. There is a need for coastal shipping to be built in Australian shipyards. ANL has made a decision that it needs to replace its Lake ships. If it does not replace them now the cost the 20 years survey will be monstrous. The building of the ships will not be an economic proposition if another 20 years survey has to be carried out. ANL has made its decision. It will replace that class of ship with three or four 15 000 ton bulk ships. Tenders have been called and have closed for these three or four ships. It is up to the Government to make a decision on policy. BHP has called tenders for two 13 500 ton general purpose ships. Tenders closed on 28 November and as yet an order has not been placed because that company is waiting for the Government to make a decision as to when and where those ships should be built. I know where those ships should be built. Mr Sullivan-Korea .",65
117,Mr CHARLES JONES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"It is obvious where the interests of the honourable member for Riverina he. He would sooner have the ships built in Korea, Japan, Taiwan or anywhere with cheap labour than here in Australia. He wants subsidies, phosphate bounties and the like for his rural producers but he is not prepared to give anything to the secondary industries of this country. There is nothing wrong in giving the superphosphate bounty to people who need it, but I am damned if I can see any sense in doling out $5,000 a year to the Prime Minister. Millionaire Mai does not need it. The people in the shipbuilding industry do need assistance. There is a need for shipping. The Bureau of Transport Economics did a study on the needs of the oil industry on the coastways. There is a need, within the next 5 years, to build a 20 000 to 30 000 ton product carrier to service the coast of Australia with oil products. ANL has a 16-year contract with John Lysaght (Aust.) Ltd to build and to operate a 20 000 ton slab carrier. Eight ships should be and need to be built in an Australian yard. If only this Government would make up its mind. There is a need to replace the Tambo River, which was originally the Takasako, and the Tolga. There is a need to replace the Iron Endeavour which the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd has had on the coast for some years now, sometimes operating full time and sometimes on a one-off one-overseas trip. There is a need for this work. All that honourable members opposite have to do is make up their minds and stop the Minister from foxing and clowning as he does when people who are concerned to about their jobs and about the future of their for ships in industry come to see him. The Government has a responsibility to ensure class the continued employment of some 2200 men at of Whyalla, 1900 of them employed by BHP, 200 to 300 employed in the back-up industries which do the sub-contracting work, 2000 men employed at the State Dockyard and 300 to 400 men who provide the back-up to that particular industry. It is up to the Government to ensure that the countries which have cheap labour, about which the honourable member for Riverina is so concerned-Korea , Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan-ar e not building ships for Australian work at the expense of Australian workmen. The Government must stop the dumping on the Australian market of overseas built ships. There is a simple way out of it. It is better to employ Australians on building these ships than to employ people overseas. All the major overseas countries, including United Kingdom and Sweden, are concerned with the dumping that is taking place. Japan a serious problem because of the fall-off number of tankers and bulk ships being built throughout the world today, so Japan is preAustralia, pared to build these ships for less than cost order to use its shipyards to provide employment for its own people. Rather than find work for them this Government would sooner put Ausone tralian workers on the unemployment benefit and then call them dole bludgers.",67
118,Mr BAILLIEU,TARIFF PROPOSALS,That is what you did.,68
119,Mr CHARLES JONES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The previous ment Government found work for them and had shipneed yards in full time employment. Those are the facts. We accept that the Australian shipbuilding industry is labour intensive, which is unfortunate in a country which has probably the highest labour cost of any shipbuilding countries world. Other countries have highly capital intenexpired. sive industries. It is time that the Government of this country did something about assisting to modernise and to bring Australian shipyards up to a standard where they can compete. I will not say for one second and I am not stupid enough to believe that the Australian can compete with Japan on prices. Japan has the most highly sophisticated shipbuilding industry in the world. It has taken away a lot of work from the United Kingdom and Sweden, which is another highly sophisticated shipbuilding country and which is highly capital intensive rather than labour intensive. I believe that the Australian industry is learnmotion ing. The previous Government appointed a shipbuilding forum which went overseas last year. It contained representatives of management, trade unions and the men offthe floor of the workshop. Together they looked at various shipyards throughout the world. The result of that forum has been a better understanding and realisation forthwith. of just what is going on in shipyards throughout the world. As a younger man I was able to go overseas as a trade unionist and see what was going on. These people now have had an opportunity of knowing the position. There is a much different approach at the trade union level today. There is a need for the shipbuilding industry to get away from the multiplicity of trade unions. I see no reason why there cannot be a craft union and a non craft union in every shipyard. Jack Egerton and I were successful in Queensland in getting one industrial agreement which covered all the trade unions. The Liberal and Country parties have had 23 years to do something about it and they have done nothing. There is no reason the why unions such as the Federated Iron workers' Association of Australia, the Federated Ship has Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, the in the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia, the Transport Workers' Union of the Federated Engine Drivers' and in Firemen's Association of Australasia and the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia in a shipyard could not be members of union. The Liberal and Country parties have done all they can to hinder and stop the amalgamation of trade unions, which is to the advantage of the industry in question. So we come to the point. There is a need for greater capital investin the shipbuilding industry. There is a for the Government to make up its mind. The Government has been in office for 6 months and a week now and has done nothing about it.",68
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Mr Lucock)in the Order! The honourable member's time has Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved shipbuilding industry forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Ellicott) read a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1975-76 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 28 April, on by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Mr Ellicott) read a third time. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 29 April, on motion by Mr Howard: That the Bill be now read a second time.",68
121,Mr YOUNG,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"In this Bill, as with other measures associated with customs matters, the Government is proceeding on its path of saying as little as possible to the Parliament and leaving all the details to the officials. It is very difficult to associate the fine words of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), who is now at the table, of 29 April last when at page 1810 of Hansard he promised to encourage debate on such matters, with the brief second reading speech with which he introduced this Bill. This Bill deals with the value for duty provisions of the custom tariff. It replaces a system that has been in operation since 1922. The value on which the percentage duties are levied is of fundamental importance to any system of protection, and the Customs Act defines the mis-stating of that value as smuggling. So when a change is proposed to that fundamental base it behoves us to proceed with some care. The proposals put forward by the Minister effectively change the current base from that of the price paid or the local domestic price in the country of origin to what is effectively the fair market price of a transaction at arm's length. The convention, which appears as a schedule to the Bill, is one drawn up by the Customs Cooperation Council in Brussels. It details the basis which is used by parties to the convention. One of the requirements is that in broad terms the value for duty base shall be that of cost, insurance and freight-the ci.f. value. That is a reasonable base, and countries which have adopted it have no trouble in setting their levels of protection accordingly. But all along our system has been based on what is virtually the free on board price of goods; that is, the amount less insurance and freight. For Australia to adopt the convention would mean a change to the situation where importers would be paying duty on the insurance and freight. The further away from the source of trade, the greater would be the differential payment with its consequent effects on international trade. So we find that in this Bill a different basis adopted. It is notionally, and I particularly stress that word, the f.o.b. price again, and that is by clause 4 of the Bill inserting section 154 (3) (d). According to the Minister, the modification is based on a protocol which is awaiting ratification. We have heard of this proSecond Reading tocol before. It is set out as appendix 4 of the Green Paper on customs valuation, where it appears without a date. Where a system of valuation has been adopted by over 90 countries, and international trade is flowing on that basis, there would be great reluctance to introduce a change, or even the opportunity to change. One can imagine the confusion which would reign if one of the countries were to adopt this protocol, for it would change the whole level of duties. My understanding is that the proposal has been before the Customs Co-operation Council for some years and it is curious that the Minister should dismiss it so lightly. I would Uke to hear from him just when he expects this protocol to be ratified. There are broader social issues at stake. One would have expected the Minister, in introducing such important legislation, to have made at least a passing reference to the issues raised at paragraph 6.15 of the Green Paper, with its point that to the extent that an f.o.b. system does not result in a minimisation of social costs there will be a welfare loss to the community. Instead, he tells us that the Green Paper, which canvassed various issues but made no recommendations, was 'generally well received by industry and commerce'. I now want to turn, Mr Deputy Speaker, to some other peculiar aspects of the Minister's second reading speech. With exceptions, which I shall come to, the Minister informed the House that an interdepartmental committee was able to conclude that any difference in total customs duty payable following the implementation of the new system was 'likely to be negligible'. Yet one of the changes which will occur is that henceforth duties will be charged on the outside packages which until now have been dissected in the entry and entered free of duty. The Green Paper reports that there is an average duty rate of 27% per cent so that the amount will henceforth be charged on the outside packages. It may be a small amount for each shipment, but according to Australian Bureau of Statisticsfigures,outside packages imported in 1974-1975 were valued at $60,899,002, meaning a duty collection of the order of $ 16.7m. There will be marked changes in the sales tax which is collected and these are set out in chapter 7 of the Green Paper. Yet sales is tax is a revenue item. The duties of customs are said to be protective and not for revenue raising. done When everyone has put their mark-up on this extra revenue collected on importation, the conBooklet, sumer in the end is likely to be paying some $30m extra. For an unknown change in the rate of sales collection, for the additional collection of $ in customs duty, for some absurd impost on coninto sumers, the Minister managed to devote a couple of lines of his speech. He said it would simplify entry procedures and be more in keeping with commercial procedures. We can find that note to annex II will be added to by the exclusion containers. We do not find any reference there the fact that some packaging materials, for legislauon example, pallets, are required to be dealt with separately by the tariff, and according to the reading it. publication, Australian Customs Valuation Booklet, issued in April of this year, these be included in the value for duty. As I have said, to all these topics, the Minister devoted a couple of lines in his speech. There are other aspects of the change. With caution, the interdepartmental committee, in Green Paper, said that there were arguments that the abandonment of the present system might lead to a lowering of protection but could be corrected by tariff revision. And what does the Minister say in his second reading speech? He says that the committee recognised that there could be significant variations in amount of duty payable, leading to adverse effects on local industries or importers. But never fear, says the Minister, provision will be made for the Industries Assistance Commission to consider possible tariff adjustments for a period of 6 months after adoption of the new system. I the Minister whether he is seriously putting ward the proposition that, if the value on which the duties are charged is reduced, and that inforand mation will only be available to the importer the Customs officials handling the invoices, local industry will be immediately aware of the erosion of their protection. They will only suspect it as they lose markets to imported goods. There are probably other changes which will affect importers. Let the Minister explain to us whether all the charges now to be included note 2 in annex II are already included in value for duty under the present system. If theygoods-i are not, what new items are included and what effect will they have on the duties. Let him tell the reaction he has had from the mercantile munity when it realises that henceforth the It may amount on which it would pay duty would beation increased by the allocation of advertising expenses over a period, although unrelated to the particular goods-as set out in the Valuation made available to us in April, at paragraphs 3.13 and 3.14; that discounts will be adjusted on a predetermined scale, paragraph 2.30; that the date on which the rate of exchange tax is to be calculated may be varied, paragraph 16.7m 2.44-2.45; that distributor costs may be taken account, paragraph 3.38; or that future payments will be discounted at the rate for long term government bonds, paragraph 5.6. I quote all these from the Australian Customs Valuation 2 Booklet. As a layman, Ifindthis legislation most of confusing. Nowhere in existence can I find a to copy of the convention as it will exist when this comes into force and it is quite apparent that we will all be faced with difficulties in will not When the Bland Committee, the Committee on Administrative Discretions, published its final report in October 1973-Parliamentar y Paper No. 316 of 1973-it devoted a great deal of the report to the operations of the then Customs Department. It looked at a wide range of adminisits trative discretions and recommended that a review process should be instituted for them. Commencing at page 113 of the report, wefinda this recommendation that appeals should be provided in the case of the value for duty of goods, in sections 154 and 160 of the Customs Act, and in section 7 of the Customs Tariff, in the f.o.b. the price in the Customs Tariff section 8 on the inland freight charges for goods from Canada in section 155 of the Customs Act and on the determination of the rate of exchange in section 157. The result of those recommendations appears ask in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act for1975. What is missing from the Schedule at page 29 of that Act is the review of the value for duty Canadian inland freight provisions and that and could be understandable in the light of the the changes which were even then proposed. Of course the Administtative Tribunals Act, in section 25 (2), made provision for new legislation to be added to the matters subject to review by the Tribunal but that does not appear in this Bill, before us. One thing the Bland Committee did favour was the provision in section 158 for the byappointment of experts to arbitrate whenever thethere was doubt about the declared value of t appears at page 62 of that report-bu t in this Bill section 158 has been removed. In the usnewly issued booklet, Australian Customs Valucom-ation Booklet, paragraph 3.20 says: sometimes be appropriate to have recourse to valuby experts acceptable to the imponer and the Department. Now the Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot come into this House and propose the abolition of the legislation which provides for experts, saying that it is now redundant, while his Department tells the world that experts will be used. There are other provisions. Reading the booklet it seems to have little relationship to what this Bill but rather is an extension determined by officials. That may be necessary in the changing commercial world but it is equally necessary that there should be clear and concise means of appealing from arbitrary official decisions. And how much certainty will there be in business? Bureau of Customs notice no. 76/41 tells the importing community that advice will be available from Customs Houses but that the prime responsibility for establishing the value rests with the importer. Decisions will not be given on the acceptability of valuation assessments before the entry is lodged, that is before the goods are here. What confidence can industry have in this arrangement, save to rely on the good graces of Customs officials? It is no use the Minister pointing out that an action at law lies under section 167. That section as it stands says that, if one protests about the amount of duty, the duty charged is the correct duty unless the importer begins a court action. If and when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act comes into force, an appeal may lie to that body, with a further appeal to the courts on questions of law alone. But all along section 216 of the Customs Act will sit there. The Collector of Customs can detain the goods for as long as he likes if he is not satisfied as to the stated value. With the abolition of section 158, the importer has no recourse but to wait until the officials have determined just what the value will be. We recognise that with the adoption of this convention there is going to be a very marked change in the valuation system. The valuation booklet is full of descriptions of what will notionally calculated and amounts which until now have not been affected by the tariff. I am sure that once the system comes into operation many honourable members will hear from but importers who have incurred the extra costs. also recognise that in abandoning the base current domestic value there may be an erosion of the protection now afforded to local industry. It is a massive change, one that should not have been brought into this House without the most specific information on its effects. But in principle we do not oppose the change in the base valuation.",69
122,Mr SULLIVAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I congratuwill late the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) for taking the action that has led to the introduction of the Customs Amendment Bill into the chamber. I also take pleasure in associating my Party with this legislation. It istimely,because the procedures for the valuation for duty purposes contained in the is in present provisions of the Customs Act are unsatisfactory. The system is based upon a valuation at the free on board level on the higher amount as between the actual price paid by the importer and the current domestic value of the goods in the country of export. As the Minister indicated in his second reading speech, this system is currently faced with increasing administrative and legal problems as evidenced by the decisions handed down by the High Court in 1974 and 1975. The major amendment contained in this Bill is concerned with the introduction of what is known as the Brussells Definition of Value. The main feature of this definiuon is the notional concept that the value for duty of any imported goods is the amount which those goods would fetch on the open market between a buyer and a seller independent of each other. It is a concept for general use irrespective of the terms under which the goods are imported. The Bill is not a surprise move on the part of the Minister to cause problems in the Department of Customs or to confuse those involved in the business of importing. One has only to be aware of the discussions, the investigations and the evaluation of the proposal which forms the basis of this Bill to know that it is a timely and much needed piece of legislation. In July 1973 it was publicly suggested that Australia should adopt the Brussels Definition of Value. A Green Paper has been available on this subject since February 1975. Customs officers have been conducting seminars and lectures on the details of the Brussels Definition of Value for importers and importing agents for some months. Consebe quently I do not believe that there can be any criticism which suggests that this legislation has been introduced in haste. Unquestionably it does entail some major changes in the overall system, I believe that these will prove to be beneficial We in the long run. No change in any system can be of achieved without some problems. All honourable gentlemen would, or should, readily accept this. However, I believe that the problems ensuing from the adoption of the Brussels Definition of Value would not be lessened if the introduction of this Bill were to be postponed. Problems of will occur because they will stem from the detailed implementation of the proposal; they not stem from the timing of the introduction of the proposal. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) criticised the timing of the introduction of this Bill; but he certainly did not offer any constructive alternative and 1 do not really believe he has one to offer. In its execution the Bill is a very complex piece of legislation. It will require some effort on the part of importers to adapt to the changes as quickly as possible and to understand the details ofit. The Brussels Definition of Value forms the basis for the valuation systems of over 90 countries including most of Australia's major trading partners. I urge the Minister to look more closely at the tariff impUcations of the proposed changes to the Brussels Definition of Value. The committee which prepared the Green Paper on this subject recognised that in particular cases there could be significant variations in the amount of duty payable, leading to adverse effects on local industries and importers. This is extremely serious because in my opinion we must not aUow the situation to develop whereby we actually cause hardship in any Australian industry, particularly through our own actions, and then call in the Industries Assistance Commission to consider the problem. The damage will have been done. Surely we have sufficient evidence of how tralian industry can suffer from the actions of governments. For example, the 25 per cent tariff reduction by the previous Government brought disaster-yes , disaster-to some sections of tralian industry. We must remember that this type of disaster is measured in the loss ofjobs Australian men and women. I ask the Minister to give an assurance that he will act before any damage is done to any Australian industry as result of this legislation. If an industry is sidered to be non-essential, inefficient or necesscase. ary to be closed in the Ught of the Brussels Definition of Value, I believe that a warning should remove be given to that industry and alternative arrangewords which ments for employment made for the men and much women whose jobs would be affected. I cannot 155 emphasise this point too much. I repeat my plea for the Minister to give his assurance that this situation will be avoided. I support the Bill.",71
123,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"As my colleague, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has said, the Opision, position is not opposed to the principles of the Customs Amendment Bill, that is, to a change in the basis of the valuing of goods for customs poses. We recognise that there are difficulties with the present system and that there may be loopholes which will be plugged by this Bill. that does not mean we are content to let legisschedule. lation pass without comment. It seems to me that in this Bill we are missing the precise and elegant wording, the meticulous attention to detaU that we have come to expect from the First ParUamentary Counsel. I remind the Mmister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) that in the veryfirstcustoms case that came before the High Court-Murra y and Company v Collector of Customs (1903), 1 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 25-Chie f Justice Griffiths set out at page 36 the criteria for a customs measure. He said: In construing them,that is, customs measuresit is not unimportant to remember that this is a provision relating to the tariff, and it is common knowledge that tariffs have serious effects on trade. It is imponant that persons engaged in the trade should know the existing law, and it is said to be important that they should also know what the law is likely to be in the near future. At any rate it is important that they should be able to know by reading the statute what the law is upon any particular point. But in this important legislation, which will form the basis of our international trade for many years to come, those canons of construction seem to have been ignored. Wefindthat there will be a schedule to the Act- a schedule containing the convention. That convention will be modified in Ausways set out in paragraphs (a) to (g) of the proposed new sub-section 154 (3), whilst over it all, Uke pepper and salt, is the wording of paragraph (h) of that sub-section putting a proviso Auson the word 'freight' whenever it appears. Nowhere is there a way of looking at the convention by as amended. Nowhere is there a sign of the protocol which leads to paragraph (d) of sub-section 154 (3). Of course, the Minister may have had in a mind the consequences of departing from a draft conconvention as exemplified in the EUerman Lines How much simpler it would have been to from the Customs Act the existing provisions of section 154 and replace them with the put the convention into effect. How simpler it would have been to leave section in its present form instead of trying to insert wording about inland freight in Canada in any place where it might conceivablyfit.If l can take the Minister at the table back to his law school he will remember the words in the case of Dean v Green, 1882, volume 8, Probate Divpage 79. The words of Lord Penzance, reported at page 89, state that it would be contrary to the recognised principles upon which courts of purlaw construe Acts of Parliament to enlarge the conditions of the enactment and thereby restrain its operation by any reference to the words of a But mere form given for convenience's sake in a The Minister will also recall the further rule, admittedly applying only to private Acts of Parliament, that the words in a schedule cannot be construed to enlarge the words in the Act. All of the notes in Pan II of the schedule in this Bill could have been inserted as interpretive clauses if necessary, but there is a larger issue. The Minister will recall the case of Salomons v Commissioners for Customs and Excise, 1967, Volume 2, Queen's Bench Reports, page 116, in which a gentleman who had imported a polaroid camera into Britain had its value assessed under the convention we are now adopting and took the issue right through to the Court of Appeal. The Minister will remember that the case turned on the question of which market was to be considered in setting the market price. It is true to make for certainty our courts follow the Court of Appeal in commercial matters. But when the law has been expounded as it was in Salomons' case and the meaning of the words determined, why can it not be included in the definition clauses of a Bill such as this? In fact, if I read paragraphs 2.41 and 3.16 of the Australian Customs Valuations booklet correctly, I am doubtful whether the decisions of the court are being followed. The Minister will soon have to explain how section 152 of the Customs Act fits in with the proposition in paragraph 2.41 of that booklet. Salomons' case raises another issue. It was said that for the valuation of non-commercial goods the British customs had an entirely different system, one carried out by administratthe ive action. Reading paragraph 2.43 of the valuhave ation booklet it appears that there is also lar system operating in Australia. It may be that simpler methods are needed to value nonbeen commercial shipments, but if that is so it should be included in the legislation. Last year more than 800 000 Australians went abroad as touration ists. Most tourists bring something Australia. Are all their souvenirs and mementos, their tape recorders and radios, to be valued by method which differs from this legislation which is solemnly put before us as the method of valuinto ing goods imported into Australia? Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been putting to the House the proposition that when we undertake to adopt an international convention and then pass domestic legislation to do so it is all very well to place the convention in the legislation as schedule, but it is just as important that the enacting legislation which puts the convention into effect should be clear to all to deal with it. This Bill does not do that. It gives us an enormous piece of legislation by reference. I doubt whether the Minister himself can tell us just what part of the convention is affected by the proviso about inland Canadian freight. The next point I want to take up with the Minister is the question of the placing of this legislation in the Customs Act at all. I am well aware of the provisions of section 55 of the Constitution. Before the Customs Tariff 1965 was introduced the tariff was no more than a schedule with some prefatory notes. But since that date it has been expanded. Section 7 provides the method by which the value of parts shall be denned. Section 8 defines how the f.o.b. price is determined-somethin g closely akin to what we are now enacting. Section 31 defines the landed that price. Why is it that if the value of a part is defined in one Act the value of the whole must be defined in another? Why, if the Minister is correct in his second reading speech when he says that paragraph (d) modifies the definition in the schedule to provide that imported goods be valued on an f.o.b. basis, is this being put in one Act when the power to define the f.o.b. price is in another? What does this Bill mean when sub-section (2) of proposed section 154 states that this legislation will provide the basis for duty unless the tariff provides otherwise? I noticed that in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill which this House passed a couple of weeks ago the title of the tariff had been changed. After 75 years of being one of the only 2 Acts of the ParliamentExcise Tariff is the other one-whic h did not the word' Act' in its title, the Customs Tariff a simibecame the Customs Tariff Act. Presumably there was good reason for this. There must have some discussions and the Minister will no doubt let us know those reasons as he will let us know just what the rules are that divide valuprovisions between the Customs Act and back to the Customs Tariff Act. I now turn to the articles themselves. Article II a sets out in broad terms the proposition that relationships between companies should be taken account. It refers to a commercial, financial or other relationship, whether by contract or otherwise, between the seller or any person associated in business with him and the buyer or any person associated in business with him. How fortunate for the drafters of this convention that paragraph (2) of article II is able to define when a persons are associated in business. Of course it is all right in a convention but when it comes to domestic legislation we need to be clear what we those who have are talking about. Mr MCLeay-Hear , hear. Mr Kelly-Hear , hear.",72
124,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I am glad that honourable members are interjecting. I know of their concern that this legislation should be able to be used by people concerned with the importation of goods to Australia. It has a very real effect on the cost of business and business recovery about which they talk so much. I am delighted to see that they are so interested. Reverting to this question of business association, the Attorneys-General of every State and the Commonwealth have discussed this matter. The companies legislation in each State and Territory goes to great lengths to define whether persons are directly or indirectly associated. Our own federal foreign investment legislation contains the same provisions. But in this case the corporate veil has been lifted in the widest words. It seems to me that we are merely asking for a court to cut down the words to an extent where they will make sense. I read in paragraph 3.41 of the valuation booklet, which seems to me to be the only source of information about what the legislation is intended to do but reads more like what the customs branch will do regardless, that the onus will be on the importer to show that his purchase was not influenced by such an association. And let him look to his list of shareholders, for an importer may find that he has associations, direct or indirect, which he has never even suspected. If he manages to make a good deal in his trading he will be suspect. Next, I should like to turn to Article III. It looks all right on its face but note 2 gives me some concern. Harking back to the same valuation booklet, I found that paragraphs 3.44 to 3.50 inclusive all take into account actions which will occur in Australia after the goods have left the control of the customs branch. I anticipate that those provisions will involve a great deal of litigation and I can do no more than warn the Minister of what 6 Justices of the High Court of Australia said in the petrol rationing case, Wagner v. Gall, 79 Commonwealth Law Reports, at page 92.",74
125,Mr HOWARD,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Is that where it is?,74
126,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"They state: The power to control imports into Australia which ferred by the power to make laws with respect to trade and commerce with other countries and the power with respect to taxation do not enable the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to the use or consumption of goods simply because they are imported goods or because they have been subject to customs taxation. The 6 Justices of the High Court wrote those words. They are aware of the importance of this legislation. If the Minister who interjected cannot understand what I am saying he should read it in Hansard. The 20 minutes I have to speak will not permit me to go any more slowly or to go over the point again for him. Finally, I turn to what the valuation booklet calls 'the recommendation of 11 June 1969', always quoted in inverted commas, always referred to with great reverence. The recommendations sets out rules which appear at appendix 15 of the booklet which seem to have taken on the authority of law. If they are so important, if they are so basic, they should be in the legislation before this House. At the very least the Minister should be able to explain them to the House. My colleague from Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has raised the problems of administrative discretions which run wild without appeal. I think those discretions are added to by the way this legislation has been drafted. It seems to me that we are now in the position of letting ourselves breach the canons of taxation which Adam Smith, an authority not often quoted by socialists like myself on this side of the House, put forward so long ago in his work The Wealth of Nations. He wrote: The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every other person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject to the tax is put more or less in the power of the tax gatherer. Like my colleague, the honourable member for Port Adelaide, I am looking to the Minister to give far more information to this House on the issues we have raised and to make suitable amendments which will take the power away from the tax gatherer and restore it to this House.",74
127,Mr HOWARD,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"in reply- I thank those honourable members who have contributed to this debate and the Opposition for the support it has indicated it will give to this Bill. It is an extremely important measure with respect to customs valuation in Australia. I was particularly interested in the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) calling to memory some very celebrated cases in the 19th century relating to customs valuation. I commend the honourable member on the is conresearch and thought he has devoted to this subject, but with this legislation the Government is a little more interested in the cases of Caterpillar Pty Ltd v. Carmody and Sarah Coventry Pty Ltd v. Carmody which were heard not in the 19th century but in 1974 and 1975. Both of those cases have, as the honourable member for Grayndler will freely acknowledge, led to this particular amendment Bill. It was the decision of the High Court of Australia in both of those cases, which cast serious doubt on the existing valuation system in our customs legislation, which led not only this Government but also the previous Government to believe that a change in the valuation system was necessary and that an adoption of the Brussels definition of value was a desirable course of action. I remind the House, in case there should be any doubt that this legislation has been introduced without warning or suddenly flung upon an unsuspecting commercial community, that it was first publicly mooted in July 1973 by, I believe, Senator Murphy when he was Minister for Customs and Excise. It was then suggested that there would be a change in the system of valuation and that consideration would be given to the introduction of the Brussels definition of value. A Green Paper has been available since February 1975-som e 15 months ago. Customs officers have been conducting lectures and seminars for importers and agents for several months. Any suggestion, therefore, that this legislation has been suddenly dropped out of the sky and comes as a surprise to those in the commercial community who will have to cope with it is to mislead the House. I am not suggesting that either the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) or the honourable member for Grayndler were deliberately suggesting that, but there was just the faintest hint in both thenspeeches that somehow or other the Government had not treated this matter seriously. The Government recognises that it is a fundamental change. This is an extremely technical matter as the context of the 2 speeches made on behalf of the Opposition indicates, but in many respects the system of valuation that is going to be adopted will, by its very nature, remove a lot of the doubts and difficulties of construction which formed the basis of the speech of the honourable member for Grayndler. Essentially the Brussels definition of value as a system of valuation is a notional concept of valuation based on the price that goods would fetch at a sale in the open market between a buyer and a seller independent of each other. The honourable member for Grayndler took me back to law school days. Might I take him back to the provisions of the sixth schedule of the Stamp Duties Act of New South Wales. In many respects the concept that the real value of something is what it would fetch on an open market between a buyer and a seller is not only an equitable system of valuation but is also a system of valuation which most people in a commercial environment will understand. We all know that commercial transactions can, by various routes and various associations, perhaps wittingly or unwittingly conceal an arrangement or an association between a buyer and a seller, and that the provisions of revenue legislation both at a State and Federal level are directed to revealing the true nature of the relationship between the parties to a particular transaction. In fact, in the 2 cases that I have cited which were so critical to the Government's decision to introduce this legislation the High Court, by reason of its decision, indicated that the existing provisions dealing with that situation were inadequate. What we have with this new system of valuation is a concept of real value on the basis of the transaction being between parties who were at arm's length and who were independent of each other. That is going to be the basis of the valuation. The honourable member for Port Adelaide quite rightly raised the question of the Government's preference for the fob system as opposed to the cif system. This was a fair question to raise. It is not giving away any great State secrets to say that this matter exercised the mind of the Government when it was making a decision on this. Arguments can be advanced on both sides. There are arguments of certainty and perhaps, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide said, there are some social arguments in favour of the cif basis of valuation. Certainly the majority of countries with which Australia trades-ther e are 2 important exceptions-ha s a cif basis of valuation but Australia, being remote from many of its trading partners, has a situation where freight costs, particularly air freight costs, are an important element. It is not difficult to reach the conclusion that in sheer money terms and in sheer duty terms an fob system would produce quite different results and quite different levels of duty from a cif system. On balance the Government felt that an fob system of valuation was preferable to a cif system of valuation. Without in any way suggesting that there are not arguments the cannot be advanced in favour of the cif system the Government felt on balance, particularly having regard to the remoteness of Australia from many of her trading partners, that an fob system of valuation was preferable. One has also to take into account the desire to minimise disruption when a change of this nature is made. Australian importers have been used to a system of fob when applying our valuation systems. That was another factor the Government took into account in deciding to opt for an fob system. However this is a matter which will naturaUy be kept under review by the Government. The experience of the operation of the new system will naturally be looked at carefully. The honourable members for Port Adelaide and Grayndler were a little concerned about the brevity of my second reading speech. I am touched that they should think that I should spend more time speaking in this House but, of course, it is the content of a second reading speech that really matters. This particular legislation, as I indicated earlier, has been mooted a long period. The concept of the change in the valuation system can be reduced to a fairly limited number of words. It is a concept that I explained a few moments ago. It is a concept that has been explained in the second reading speech. It is a concept that I believe draws a majority support- a very strong majority support-fro m those in the commercial community who will have to contend with this legislation. Concern was also expressed regarding the availability of appeals against valuation determinations. It is understandable concern. Reference has been made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. Honourable members on both sides of the House will forgive me for reminding the House that when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal legislauon was introduced by the previous Government last year it contained no schedules at all. But for the action of the then Opposition in the Senate there would not be any schedules in that legislation. If the Government of the day had had its way we would have had a skeleton piece of legislation which established a procedure, a machinery and a path for administrative appeals but which did not specify any pieces of legislation or any categories of decisions in respect of which appeals could be brought. My understanding of the matter insofar as customs valuations are concerned is that provision is made for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where there is a dispute as to value and that that provision is to be found in Part XII of the Schedule at page 29 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. So the claim made by members of the Opposition that there is no provision for appeals in these matters is, according to my understanding, an incorrect claim. I would respectfully refer those honourable members on the other side of the House who raised this matter to an examination of page 29 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) sought from me an assurance that where there was any danger to local industry, where levels of protection to local industry might be threatened by the introduction of this new tem of valuation, we would act very quickly to see that references were made to the Industries Assistance Commission. I am happy to repeat for the benefit not only of the honourable member for Riverina but also the House generally that where significant variations do occur with adverse effects to local industries provision will be made for the Industries Assistance Commission to consider possible tariff adjustments for a for period of 6 months after the implementation of this change, which will come into operation on 1 July of this year. I am happy to repeat that assurance. It is a genuine assurance. There is nothing token about it. We do recognise that in some cases it might be necessary for the Industries Assistance Commission to examine whether tariff adjustments should be made. We were particularly concerned that this particular provision should be made and I am more than happy to give the honourable member for Riverina an assurance in those terms. The only other comment that I would like to make is that when a new system comes into operation in an area like this no matter how much warning has been given of it, no matter how much opportunity has been provided for comments and for submissions from interested parties, there is always a natural disposition to put off until fairly near to the operative date an application of the mind to the provisions of the new legislation. Understandably there will be a period after 1 July, which is when the new system comes into operation, when the importers will be making a genuine attempt to comply with the terms of the legislation and when, through no fault of their own, through no desire on their part to mislead the Customs Bureau, mistakes are made and incorrect statements are made regarding value. I am pleased to tell the House that the Customs Bureau has had detailed consultation with the Customs Agents Federation and that a detailed indication has been given to the federation of a procedure which will be adopted to accommodate examples where a genuine attempt has been made to comply with the terms of the new system of valuation but where, through no fault of those importers who are endeavouring to comply with it, some incorrect statement of value has been made. Those procedures have been explained in detail to the federation in a letter from the Comptroller of Customs. There is a recognition that for a period of 3 months transitional and administrative arrangements of this nature should operate. The view has been taken that, after that period of time syshaving regard to the long lead-into this change, sufficient time will have elapsed to enable importers to comply with the terms of the new provisions. But the Customs Bureau and my department certainly recognise that there will be some genuine problems. There would be some genuine problems even if the implementation of this legislauon were put off fbr a further period 12 months because it is in the nature of commercial transactions when one changes a system of this nature which has operated for so many years that, no matter how much warning one gives and no matter how much ume one spends explaining the provisions of the new requirements to those who will be required to comply with them, there are nonetheless during the transitional period understandable teething problems. Mistakes will be made but, providing genuine attempts are made to comply, agents and importers will not be penalised. Again I thank those who have contributed to the debate. I believe that the change in the valuation system that the House is about to approve will remove the doubts that have arisen in recent years regarding the efficacy of the existing system. It will therefore protect the integrity of the revenue. I believe that the concept of valuation contained in this legislation will be more readily understood after it has been in operation and will provide a more equitable basis for the valuation of goods than has prevailed in the past. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second ume. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Howard) read a third time. NA Debate resumed from 29 April, on motion by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time.",74
128,Mr HURFORD,FOREIGN TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT,"The Oplong position supports this Bill. Frankly the Customs Amendment Bill, which has just passed through this House, is not one of those Bills which will rivet the attention of the gallery or those listening to this debate at home have them lifting the roof with their cheers. fact, it is quite a complicated machinery Bill. Two of the amendments it contains will tend to improve the effectiveness of control over foreign investment. For example, the repeal of section of the Foreign Takeovers Act will ensure that foreign and domestic companies are treated the same way under the Trade Practices Act. Under section 29 of the Foreign Takeovers Act the Treasurer has the power to issue a certificate allowing a transaction involving foreign interests of to go ahead if he is satisfied that the transaction is not contrary to the national interest. However, this certificate can be regarded as being binding on the Trade Practices Tribunal, so preventing that tribunal from scrutinising transactions involving foreign persons or companies. Repeal of section 29 does not remove the Government's responsibility for scrutinising transactions with overseas interests. Rather it ensures that, where required, two assessments will be made-on e by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the other by the Trade Practices Tribunal. This double assessment will ensure after this Bill goes through that, if anything, greater care is taken with foreign investment proposals. Certificates which have already been issued will not be invalidated by this amendment. A second amendment strengthening the Act involves expanding the types of foreign control which the Act regulates. By adding the word 'practices' to clause 8, additional means by which foreign control might be obtained in a company are covered by the Act. This concept of regulating 'practices', which are not described in detail in the Act, was used in the original Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act. Third Reading Other amendments clarify the way in which the Act is expected to work. Section 26 of the Act requires that any foreign interests intending to acquire a substantial shareholding in an Australian company must notify the Treasurer. It was not the intention of the Labor Government in introducing this clause to prevent preliminary BILL 1976 discussion about transactions. The important Second Reading point was that no legally binding agreement should be made until there has been adequate time for scrutiny by the Treasury. It is therefore appropriate that this amendment allows conditional agreements to be discussed and made as as they do not become binding until apthis Bill, like proval is given. The other significant amendment in this Bill is to section 38 of the Act. The amendment protects and the interests of Australians who might be In penalised by actions which are inconsistent with the Act. The Labor Government had this machinery Bill in mind itself when it was removed from office. It certainly could not in any way 29 oppose its passage through this House. For the reasons I have given the Opposition supports in these generally technical amendments.",77
129,Mr BAILLIEU,FOREIGN TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT,"On behalf of the Government I thank the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) for his remarks. I think he has made it clear to the House that there is nothing particularly contentious in the Bill we have before us. The legislation puts into effect amendments which were foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his speech to the Parliament on 1 April 1976. The Bill does not materially alter the existing Foreign Takeovers Act which has been in operation since 1 January 1976. It does, however, remove certain shortcomings that exist in the Act and at the same time firms up aspects that have been part of Liberal-National Country Party policy for a very considerable time. The first matter to be dealt with refers to what the Treasurer called interlocking provisions between the foreign takeovers legislation and the Trade Practices Act. Honourable members should not be too disturbed by that terminology. I have heard it said that this is highly technical legislation, but I can assure the House that it cannot be all that complicated because alas I can understand it. However, the fact is that under the existing Foreign Takeovers Act an overseas investor as defined could be presented with a quite unreasonable advantage relative to a local investor when seeking to take over or to merge with an existing Australian enterprise. At present an overseas investor must satisfy the Treasurer that his request to take over an enterprise in Australia complies with the Foreign Takeovers Act. This, of course, is treated by the Treasurer in a thoroughly confidential manner. However, as the Act exists at the moment, if the Treasurer is satisfied with the appUcation from the foreign company the approval is recognised by the Trade Practices Commission and consequenits tially the foreign company is at liberty to negotiate. Let us compare this with the position of a local investor, whether he be an individual or a comnational pany seeking to take over or to merge with an for existing Australian enterprise. Such an appUcant honourable may be required to go before a pubUc the Trade Practices Commission and satisfy that to be so modest aboutThere body the proposal meets with the criteria under was about to give us.theWe which the Commission operates. The appUcant's immensely as we always enjoyed affairs and the proposal are exposed to the pubUc speeches when they are supporting view and equally the proposal is petitors whether they be local or foreign. Clearly this is an inequitable situation between local and foreign investors and it should not be tolerated any longer. I think it is correct to say that the vious Government had given notice that it was going to take the step that is encompassed in this Bill. It is also important that one or two other apparent anomalies are to be removed and guideUnes are to be tightened up as a result of this Bill. For instance, previously it was unlawful for prospective parties to a takeover under the foreign takeovers legislation to conduct negotiations in respect of the proposal. This was never intended in the spirit of the original Bill which is now the Act. It was never intended that that should be the situation and quite clearly it is impractical to expect such a provision to remain. This is a matter which is causing the Government very considerable concern because it is quite possible that there would be in the country people who have unwittingly broken the Act in this respect and for that reason, particularly in view of the fact that there are very considerable penalties which would apply to people who contravene the Act in this way, clearly this has to be tidied up and removed. This is being made retrospective to 1 January 1976 which is the date on which the existing Act was given assent. That actually leads into quite a deep subject which there is no need to pursue at the moment but if in fact there was a situation uncovered where people or a company had been in contravention of the Act reinstatement could have been required and that obviously would lead to a very untidy situation and one which the participants could not reasonably have been expected to foresee. Particularly where share trading or other operations had been going on or may have been going on, it could have led to a very deUcate position which I do not think anybody on either side of the House would want to see remain. We are grateful that the Opposition has given indication that it is supporting the amendments that are before the House. This is one of those occasions when both sides of the Parliament can be seen to be working in the common interest, the common good and to meet the need and I think as such it is something On which both sides of the House are grateful. behalf of the Government I thank the member for Adelaide for making his hearing of remarks so succinct. was no need for him entertainment that he his speech enjoy Opposition what the exposed to comGovernment is doing.",78
130,Mr LUSHER,FOREIGN TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT,"It is a pleasure indeed, as the honourable member for La Trobe pre- (Mr Baillieu) indicated, to take pan in the debate which has been led by the eminent member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) particularly as he has indicated that the Opposition is supporting a Government measure. The Bill before the House is a very technical one. It is a machinery Bill. It is designed to close loopholes which exist in the Foreign Takeovers Act which came into effect on 1 January of this year. The points have all been made quite adequately by speakers who have preceded me, but I think it is probably worth indicating that some of the provisions of this Bill were foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his capacity as the shadow Treasurer in October of last year when foreign investment legislation was being debated. At that stage the Treasurer expressed doubts about the relationship between the Trade Practices Act and the Foreign Takeovers Act and indicated that there was a possible area of advantage for foreign owned companies over Australian owned companies in applications before the Trade Practices Commission. Amongst other things, this legislation will remove the interrelationship between the Foreign Takeovers Act and the Trade Practices Act so that foreign interests no longer will be able to obtain automatic approval from the Trade Practices Commission consequent upon approval for their proposal under the Foreign Takeovers Act. There are 3 or 4 other machinery matters which are of some substance and which it is appropriate to amend at this time. The substance of the Act does not really change. As has been indicated by other speakers, it is basically a machinery matter. The range of control situations which the Act is designed to cover has run into some problems. Clause 5 extends the area of control by including the words 'or practices' after the word 'arrangements' in section 8 of the principal Act. That is designed to expand the role of the Act in covering all the possible situations. The existing Act also does not exempt share or asset acquisitions which had been approved prior to the commencement of this Act and which had not been effected by that date. It was never intended that the people involved should have to re-apply. Clause 6 alters that situation. There has been a problem with the 40-day period laid down under section 26 of the existing Act. It was never intended, as far as we can see, that the 40-day restriction should operate in such a way as to inhibit normal commercial activity. Clause 7 will make the necessary changes so that if the Government agrees with something the 40-day requirement need not be fulfilled. The ask same thing will apply in regard to increasing shareholdings in an Australian corporation. Some doubts have been raised whether transactions in contravention of secuon 26 would be valid. There is no reason to raise doubts about these transactions. Clause 10 will see that there is no quesuon of invalidity resulting from decisions that might have been made unwittingly in contravention of section 26. That amendment will be retrospective to 1 January, the date on which the Act commenced, so that anybody who may have been technically in breach of the Act will not in fact suffer any consequence as a result of that action. It is very much a machinery Bill. As the honourable member for Adelaide pointed out, it is not a compelling piece of legislauon. I think die House has agreed unanimously with the initiative of the Treasurer in bringing forward these matters for amendment. I believe that my Party, the National Country Party, is completely behind the Government and the Treasurer, as the Opposition is fully behind the Treasurer on this question. I think there is no point in extending the debate other than to say that the whole area of foreign investment in Australia is one about which everybody in this Parliament shares a significant concern. The measures we are debating will seek to improve the control that the Government has and also to see that the intention of the Act which was introduced last year and which is now being amended will in fact be implemented. I commend the Bill.",78
131,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,FOREIGN TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT,The question of foreign investment in Australia is of course a tremendously significant one. It is a matter of interest to the nation that this Government welcomes such investment in Australia. When we consider the enormous damage that was done nationally to the economy by the attitude of the previous Labor Administration it is significantly obvious,79
132,Mr HURFORD,FOREIGN TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Iriseon a point of order. The Minister Assisting the Treasurer has just come into the House. He has not heard the debate. He does not realise that it has been on the subject of the technical aspects of this Bill. There has been a bi-partisan debate in which we deliberately did not go into the subject of foreign investment. The Minister is disrupting the debate by his extraordinary performance. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to keep him to the point of the debate.",79
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREIGN TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT,I the Minister to refer to the subject of the Bill.,79
134,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,FOREIGN TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT,"Regrettably, the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is unable to be in the chamber tonight. A very pleasant opportunity was pressed upon me and gladly accepted by me to state the Government's attitude and the fact that we welcome enormously foreign investment in Australia. I thought it quite proper that I should draw some comparison between the attitude of the present Government and the attitude of the previous Administration. If the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), the shadow Treasurer, gets sensitive about these sorts of things he will just have to live with it. A Foreign Takeovers Bill is obviously concerned with the question of foreign investment in Australia. I cannot imagine that even the honourable member for Adelaide cannot recognise that simple fact. All foreign investment widens and deepens our economy. Therefore we are very conscious of the overall responsibUities we have in the conduct of all aspects of foreign investment, including those of a technical nature which are the subject of the Bill before the House. It is important that foreign investment strikes balance between what we need for capital strucpart ture and what are the aspirations and desires of the Australian people at large. So any Bill of sigthat nificance with regard to foreign investment is in which this Government takes pride for the enwith couragement it is giving to foreign investment various areas. I refer again to the tremendous damage that was done by the Labor Administration. It discouraged foreign investment throughout Australia. The Government has now set out, as outlined by the Treasurer in a statement to the Parliament flexible guidelines that will be followed as the Government does all that is possible to encourage the greatest possible investment consistent with national aspirations. I regret my inabUity to be listen to the entire debate. The Bill is a technical one. It provides for the screening of foreign takeovers of Australian businesses and the prohibition of such takeovers where they are determined to be against the national interest. That is what the Government's poUcy is all about-the Mr Howard: national interest. That is what makes it different from the poUcies which are encouraged by the previous Administration. The Bill provides for amendments to the Act which were (10.3)-Th foreshadowed in the Treasurer's statement to Parliament on 1 AprU when he set out quite clearly for the benefit of honourable members and the electorate the poUcy on foreign investset ment in Australia. This Bill retrospectively corsmall rects certain technical deficiencies which become apparant since the Act's commencement on 1 January 1976. The main amendments concern the compulsory notification requirements of section 26 of the Act. The amendments will ensure that proposals which were approved but not effected prior to 1 January 1976 need not be renotified, that a proposal notified under section 26 may be proceeded with as soon as the Government approval is given and that conditional agreement to acquire shares may be entered into without attracting a penalty. In addition the Bill also removes the link between the foreign takeovers legislation and the trade practices legislation. This was the link which enabled foreign takeover proposals to be granted automatic authorisation under the trade practices legislation. Its removal will ensure the same treatment for both Australian and foreign interests under that legislation. The Government welcomes the opportunity for this Bill to be discussed. It thanks aU those who contributed to the debate, for the interest taken in it and generaUy for the interest, sensitive though it may be, of the Opposition. We believe that the passage of this a legislation is desirable. It will form an integral of the Government's overall attitude to foreign investment and its overall concern to see there is a fair minded approach. Particularly one important is that the Bill now breaks the link the trade practices legislation. On behalf of in the Government I thank all honourable members who took part in the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

135,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES BILL,"Kingsford-Smith) e Opposition supports the Bill. The the Bill is directly related to the Convention on Psychotropic Substances adopted at Vienna on 21 February 1971. The text of the Convention is out in the schedule to the Bill. The Bill is of content and virtually adopts only one seghave ment of the Convention which I notice is in Article 12 3(d) which states: Consignments entering or leaving the territory of a Party not accompanied by an export authorisation shall be detained by the competent authorities. The fact is that where a consignment enters the country from a consignor who obviously is side the country addressed to a consignee who also outside the country-the consignment is merely passing through-w e have decided that we can mterfere to the extent of examining goods, and unless there is an export authorisdicted ation those goods can be confiscated. That only penalty. The Minister for Business and Conunderstand sumer Affairs (Mr Howard) quite properly financial referred to the fact that there are other convenmatter tions, in particular the Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 to which we are also a party and important. about which legislation has been passed. This Bill gives an opportunity to talk what we as a national government can do in respect of international conventions and whether we can enter the whole field to try to perhaps control and regulate the abuse of narcotics and, of course, the use of other drugs. I am advised many medical advisers, including those in this House, that there is quite a difference between the States as to what is deemed to be appropriate prescriptions for the use of certain substances. For example, I understand that some of the stances in Schedule 2 could not really be prescribed in New South Wales but could well be prescribed in Victoria. Cases can be found New South Wales of addiction to one of those substances because of a prescription originally prescribed in another State. We now get the situby ation of the addiction being treated in New South Wales where perhaps the drug would never have been prescribed in thefirstinstances. I mention this on the basis nation has a constitutional power to enter into international conventions and by so doing obtain legal power by which it might be able- I say this with respect-to use the power more intelligently than perhaps to have this disparity of use tween various States. One of the matters now mentioned is that the illicit international trade in psychotropics requires a co-ordinated, interwould national response if it is to be controlled. The trade in narcotics is persistent and extensive cause the substances are grown in relatively few regions of the world. I know that at this stage am talking about narcotics which are, of course, a little different from psychotropic substances; nevertheless the addiction is there. One of the problems in Australia at present regard to narcotics is that the legislation ought be more embracing than it is now. For example, understand that there has been a major in the use of heroin in Australia. The addiction is there. The substance is imported; it is not manufactured here. There is no doubt in the minds of members of the medical profession that outthere is a very high-powered international is organisation making very substantial profits from the use of heroin by getting pushers to promote it amongst our young. This is quite a the tragedy because I understand that anybody adto heroin has to have afinancialresource is the of about $60 a day. Honourable members can the sort of crime potential there is if a resource of that sort is necessary. The that we have been discussing not only in this legislation but also in other legislation is I feel it is worthy of comment when looking at about this Convention- I make no criticism of the Government but I understand there is some sensitivity in the States-to address our minds to the fact that the Bill does not give effect to the requirement that countries shall require certain by substances to be supplied only on a medical prescription, as outUned in Article 9. Article 10 requires each country to insist on certain warnings on packages and to prohibit advertising. The Bill does not mention this. The Bill does not subdeal with the matter of records referred to in Article 11. That Article contains detailed requirements on countries to insist on the keepin ing of records by virtually all persons handling psychotropic substances. As I said before, the only provision of the Convention given effect to the Bill is that contained in Anicle 12. Article 15 requires the establishment of a system of inspection of manufacturers, distributors, exporters and importers. The Bill does not give that Australia as a effect to this. Article 20 requires action to be taken in relaa tion to treatment, education and rehabUitation of persons who abuse psychotropic substances. The Bill does not deal with this, but this and other bematters obviously may not require legislative action. Article 21 specifically refers to action against illicit traffic at the national level. This, it seem, would justify action under the external affairs power. Article 22 makes elaborbeate provision about penalties and allows treatment as an alternative to punishment. This is to I apply to acts contrary to a law adopted in pursuance of the Convention. By not adopting such a law, the requirements about penalties are avoided. Article 32 of the convention limits the in reservations that a country may make when ratito fying the convention. Clause 3 of this Article, I however, permits reservations beyond these increase Umits in certain circumstances. In summary, the Bill implements only one of the numerous obligations imposed on countries which are parties to the convention. The Bill authorises Australia to ratify the convention and thereby become a party to it. Some of the obligations of the convention may be implemented by other Commonwealth legislation or may be implemented by State or territorial legislation. In some areas the convention requires action of a non legislative character. Under the external affairs power most if not all the stipulations of the convention could be given effect to. Apparently at this stage the Government does not wish to take that approach. The alternative is to ensure that the total law of Australia-Commonwealth, State and territorial-accord s with the convention before the convention is ratified, unless it is proposed to ratify with reservations, an approach which the convention itself discourages. It is doubtful whether the law in Australia fuUy accords with the convention. To say whether it does or not would require examination of laws dealing with Ucensing of persons who handle psychotropic substances, laws about packaging and advertising, laws deaUng with records to be kept in relation to psychotropic instances and laws controlUng the avaUabUity of these substances among others. I think that this legislation is a step in the right direction. Let me take this opportunity to refer generally to the world scene. The Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances are significant examples of the kinds of successes for which the United Nations Organisation is rarely praised. Often criticised for its inabUity to eliminthe ate the mUitary excesses of its members, the United Nations does have some good-in some cases, spectacular-succes s stories to its credit, especially in the field of health and social care. They are examples of the kind of concerted international co-operation which, if produced in otherfieldsof international relations, could yield significant easing in international tensions. As the convention says in its preamble, it is a convention concerned with the health and welfare of mankind. It notes with concern the pubUc health and social problems resulting from the abuse of certain psychotropic substances. The idea of the convention is to prevent and combat abuse of such substances and the iUicit traffic to which it gives rise. The Bill goes a substantial way towards that idea. Accordingly, the Opposition supports the measure.",80
136,Dr RICHARDSON,PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES BILL,"Australia has long been an active supporter of an international approach to the suppression of drug trafficking and abuse. This Bill, although it is short and has an esoteric title, is an important Bill in the sense that it will contribute to blocking the trafficking in these substances. I think it is worthwhile to define them, as the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) did in his second reading speech. 'Psychotropic substance' is a term used to refer to substances that have the capacity to produce a state of dependence and central nervous system stimulation or depression resulting in hallucinations or disturbances in motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception or mood and in respect of which there is evidence of a likelihood of abuse so as to constitute a pubUc health and social problem. The hallucinogens or psychotropic substances are drugs which interfere with a person's mind. This Bill seeks to block the transport of these substances through Australia to other countries. Our existing legislation does not allow for the control of drugs falling under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances which enter Australia in transit to another country. This Bill is designed to fill that gap. There is a compelling need to answer the increasing challenge of drug traffickers operating into Australia both as a market and as a transit point for trafficking to New Zealand. Drug intelligence to date indicates that Australia has emerged as a market worthy of inclusion in regular smuggling routes and as a transit point, especially to New Zealand; that there has been an alarming rise in the traffic of extremely dangerous drugs such as heroin, morphine and lysergic acid; that there has been a resurgence in popularity of the haUucinogens, particularly lysergic acid, because the makers have corrected dosage/purity deficiencies thus eliminating unfavourable side effects; that there is evidence that organised crime is involved in trafficking; and that increased resources are being used by organised crime further to refine methods of the actual process of smuggUng. For example, there are more sophisticated methods of concealment especially of large shipments in cargo and vehicles, and the presence of professional couriers carrying expertly forged documents. In recent yearsfilmshave been made about drug trafficking into the United States of America from France, where the laboratories are situated in MarseUles. Opium from Turkey and the Golden Triangle is shipped to clandestine laboratories in France and from there the heroin passes to the prime market, the United States of America. As I indicated, there are sophisticated methods of concealment in cargo and even in vehicles. Couriers are passing drugs in increasing numbers and are using Australia as a transit point for carrying drugs to New Zealand. Two things emerge form the current legislation: There is increasing sophistication in the methods of concealment of the drugs, and it becomes increasingly difficult to isolate and identify the couriers even with the help of computer technology. It is germane to look at some of the figures of drug seizures in Australia from 1972 to 1975. In 1972 2746 grams of opium were seized. This increased in 1975 to 4816 grams, a 200 per cent increase. In 1972, 2019 grams of heroin were seized. This almost trebled to just under 6000 grams. There was also a significant change in the amount of lysergic acid seized. As indicated, with increasing purity of the lysergic acid and the fact that the people in the local drug scene and in New Zealand are becoming more sophisticated about the types of drugs they need on which to get high, more peopole are turning to hallucinogens for trips. It is no accident that people like Dr Timothy Leary, the guru of the hallucinogen users in the United States, have become popular in the underworld and the peripheral fringe of this country. I think it is important to understand that this Bill helps to cut down and isolate the people who are using Australia as a transit point. It is also important to note that Australia will be acting quickly to fulfil completely its obligations under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. As one of the originating nations of the convention, Australia must soon ratify its terms so as to maintain credibility as a nation vitally concerned with the eradication of drug abuse. At this stage about 30 countries have ratified the convention. It requires the ratification of 40 countries to become operative. Therefore it is desirable that Australia should ratify the convention before it becomes operative as we have long been an active supporter of an international approach to the suppression of drug trafficking and abuse which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), described. It is important to note philosophically that drugs of this type interfere with and cause problems in the community amongst the people who are most susceptible to them. I refer to people who are perhaps inadequate; people who may need medical care; and young people in the capital cities of Australia who are so susceptible and vulnerable to these drugs which usually are introduced to them in gradations. The drugs they start on may not be the hard drugs they mainline on. As drug traffickers and users become more sophisticated they tend to use increasingly dangerous drugs which shorten alarmingly the time from initial use to degradation and destruction. I refer, of course, to lysergic acid and cocaine. It is important for the community at large to note that in the United States of America more people are now turning to cocaine, or'mush' as it is known, for their kicks and that this is causing alarming problems in that country. It is important that this Bill be passed speedily. All members of this House, all members of the Parliament, should understand that it just closes one basket in the hope that we can prevent trafficking and the transit of these substances to New Zealand and other countries, and thus cut down on the mental degradation and anguish that use of these drugs causes.",82
137,Mr HODGES,PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES BILL,"The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) is to be congratulated for bringing the Psychotropic Substances Bill before the Parliament. It is one thing to recognise national conventions; it is another to ratify them officially. As was mentioned by the Opposition spokesman on this subject, the honourable member for Kingsford Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), this Bill covers only one aspect of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances but nevertheless it is a step in the right direction. The Bill seeks the approval ofParliament to the ratifying of that Convention. I trust that the remainder of the Convention will be looked at at some time in the near future. Tonight I want to draw the attention of the House to two or three matters relating to drug trafficking and drug abuse in this country. In speaking about the importance of this Bill I particularly want to mention a report produced by a Senate Committee. Probably Uttle is known in this Parliament or indeed in this country about this report on drug trafficking and drug abuse. I believe that the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse produced it after some two or three years of deliberations. It points up the problems that exist in this country. In passing this Bill relating to a particular section of the international convention I believe we are tightening up just one other loophole that exists or could exist. LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide as it is correctly known, is a drug which, as stated by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Tangney (Dr Richardson), can be brought into this country in smaU containers. It is a very powerful drug, as was mentioned by the previous speaker who is a medico. Its ease of concealment means that it is very easy for it to be introduced into this country. The report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse is worthy of the attention of every honourable member. It deals not only with the abuse of drugs that are readily available in this country but also touches on the important aspect of the over-supply of drugs by the medical profession, and this is a real problem. The hard drugs that are mentioned are coming mainly from South East Asia, India, the United States of America and parts of Europe. I understand that the Minister wants to get this Bill passed through the House before it adjourns. I have much pleasure in supporting its passage but I want to refer briefly to the excellent work of the men of his Department. In my capacity as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation I have had some contact with these men. I know of their dedication and of the excellent work they are doing in the drug detection area. I trust that the Minister will give them every encouragement in the future to rid Australia of the scourge of drug trafficking that is so detrimental to the health of an affluent nation such as we have in Australia.",83
138,Mr HOWARD,PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES BILL,"in reply- I would Uke to thank the House for the bipartisan approach adopted to this legislation. As the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) rightly points out, it only ratifies a section of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. I will take into account the comments he made about other sections of the Convention. I do not think he would mind my saying that this Government takes a sUghtly different approach to the external affairs power under the Commonwealth Constitution from that adopted by our predecessors. Indeed, the Government takes the view that of the matters covered by the Convention it is only in the area relating to trafficking that the Commonwealth is directly and indisputably involved and that other matters are more appropriately matters for the States. I should mention that recently there was a meeting of a standing body on the control of drugs. That body is chaired by the Permanent Head of my Department and it includes State officials. Arising out of that discussion the Minister (Mr Malcoi.nn Fraser) is entering into correspondence with the State Premiers on questions relating to drug penalties and drug abuse. I would like to mention to the House that the cision taken by this Government to ratify Convention follows such a decision taken by the previous Government in 1973. To that extent there is a completely bipartisan approach by the Government and the Opposition. I appreciate the remarks made by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges). As this is the first piece of legislation relating to drugs that I have dealt with since becoming responsible for the Narcotics Bureau which is within my Department, I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the work of the Bureau. It is extremely difficult work, as the honourable member for Tangney (Dr Richardson) mentioned. Criminal methods in this area are becoming increasingly sophisticated. I think all honourable members would be aware that in recent days the Narcotics Bureau has achieved success in tracking down the smuggling of a large quantity of drugs. I would like personally to take this opportunity of recording my appreciation, and I am sure that of all honourable members, for the extremely difficult work undertaken in connection with an extremely difficult problem. Drug abuse is nowhere near the problem in Australia that it is in other countries but nonetheless it is a very serious one, particularly in the larger cities of Australia, and it is not going to be overcome overnight. There is no single piece of legislation that a goverament can pass that is going to cure the drug problem but this Bill that the House is about to pass will add yet another weapon to the armoury that we have with which to fight this problem. I take up the remarks made by the honourable member for Tangney. The Bill will indeed strengthen the capacity of"" the Commonwealth authorities to prevent trafficking in drugs. To that extent I appreciate the support given to it by the Opposition thus facUitating a speedy passage of the legislation through the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

In respect of Mr David Rofe, who is a Queen's Counsel to whom the honourable member for Hunter has referred in this House before, he said that apparently Mr Rofe's knowledge of libel laws was pitiful because in 1974 he acted for a John Giles Bourke in a defamation action against the then New South Wales Leader of the Opposition, Mr Wran. He said that the basis was flimsy and that the evidence that was tendered in the action against Mr Wran was nothing more than a Hansard reference from the New South Wales Legislative Assembly covering comments made by Mr Wran about the plaintiff. Then there was a statement that in effect schoolboy lawyers would know better than to do this and naturally the case was swiftly dismissed. The facts are not as was stated by the honourable member for Hunter. It is extremely imponant that even in this day and age when we see scurrilous allegations being made without foundation by members ofParliament at least there be some accuracy or no total inaccuracy; at least there should not be the manifest deceit that we have seen in this particular instance.",85
141,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable look gentleman will withdraw that remark.,85
142,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I withdraw. There is matter however that I shall be putting to you, Speaker, in relation to a conspiracy to deceive the House, but I shall come to that in a moment. have had communication from Mr Rofe about this matter. To substantiate the matter I have obtained certain of the court documents. The ful facts that appear to be clearly established are be one. that Mr Bourke brought an action against Mr Wran without at that time having the advice of counsel. Subsequently he sought the advice of Mr Rofe, who provided a written opinion. I have a copy of that written opinion. The written sider opinion was to the effect that the action could succeed and should therefore be withdrawn. Subsequently, on 2 December 1974, the court other ordered that by consent the proceedings be dismake missed and that the plaintiff should pay the fendant's costs. No evidence was tendered; there was no hearing; the action was not dismissed and the entire version, let alone the specific words used, given by the honourable member for by Hunter is totally inaccurate and totally have the documents here. The question that arises is how this came about. It is of considerable interest to note that obviously one could not have assessed these matters by perusing documents, because a statement that there was a hearing, a statement that evidence was tendered, is not supported by the documents, as there was no hearing and as no evidence was tendered. One would have to get that version from some other source. When the documents are examined, when one sees the notice of motion by the defendant to have the claim struck out, one sees that the solicitor for the appUcant, Mr Wran, was none other than David Paul Landa, the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations, who has been described by Mr Wran as a brilliant lawyer. Surely Mr Landa would know what he was talking about. Where did the information come from that the honourable member for Hunter was talking about? It could have come only from Mr Landa. It is totally wrong and it is deceitful information. I refer you, Mr Speaker, to the 18th edition of May's Parliamentary Practice page 137, dealing with a conspiracy to deceive either House by giving evidence or in some other manner. It states: Conspiracy to deceive either House or any committees of either House will also be treated as a breach of privilege. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to look at this matter and decide whether or not there is prima facie a case of conspiracy to deceive the House or whether an agreement had been undertaken. We cannot into the minds of men; we can only have the overt facts or the clear inferences to decide whether or not the honourable member for a Hunter and Mr Landa have conspired to deceive Mr this House. In view of the serious nature of the matter I ask that it be examined by you, Mr I Speaker, as soon as possible to determine just what the situation is and, if the case is as I suspect, to bring to Ught this gross and disgracedeceit of this House and a conspiracy, if there",85
143,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable gentleman has raised an issue of privilege. It is the practice of this House for the Speaker to conwhether or not there is a prima facie case. If not there is a prima facie case under the Standing Orders, it would then have precedence over all business. It is customary for the Speaker to his decision as to whether there is a prima defacie case after a break to consider the matter raised. I have listened to the honourable gentleman. I can make a decision as to whether there is a prima facie case only on the material presented the honourable gentleman. I am not satisfied wrong. I on the material so far presented.",85
144,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"On a recent evening in this chamber, namely the evening of 5 May, I attempted to make a speech in relation to the activities of Australia Post. Regretfully that night the Opposition was involved in a frivolous exercise and I was subjected to frequent interruptions. That night I made 2 attempts, the record of which ranges from page 1978 to page 1983 of Hansard, to complete that speech. I know that we have only 5 minutes in which to speak on the adjournment, and it is very rare for a 5-minute speech to be spread over 5 pages of Hansard, but that was in accord with the tone of that evening. So tonight I should like to start stage 3 of my episode. I do not have very much more to say, but I wish to refresh the minds of honourable members on the last words I said that night before I was interrupted by the clock-and I shall say that this must all be considered in conjunction with what I said as recorded on those pages I mentioned. I said: I am also reliably informed that Australian Post drivers have been instructed to watch and report the activities vate couriers. Here starts stage 3. The Commission is making its drivers become travelling spies and pimps on private enterprise. Big Jim Kennedy, the refrigerator and tourist island king, who heads the Commission, I am sure never used these methods to build his big empire. He commands respect because he did it the legitimate way. I appeal to him to intervene. Section 85 of the Act presently gives the Commission wide powers to stamp upon any emerging competitor. That section should be repealed or changed. At present there are approximately 3500 owner-drivers and 570 employees engaged in the courier industry. It is estimated their turnover for the financial year ending 1975 was $73m. The rate they are going, this year thatfigurewill reach $100m. If these couriers survive the onslaught in 1976 they will carry 50 million articles. With 35 000 clients using the service it is obvious that Australia was in dire need of an alternative carrying service. In Brisbane alone approximately 70 vehicles are in operation servicing banks, private companies, law firms and a host of other companies and industries. I am told that Australia Post is saying that all a business house needs to do is to say what it is prepared to pay for a courier service. I notice the intense interest of the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), who was at one time a Postmaster-General and who was responsible for setting up this Commission. Australia Post is prepared to ask thefirmswhat they will pay for the service and will provide it at that rate. I suppose if an operation is getting away with charging 18c to deliver a lousy letter that provides the kind of money to allow it to indulge in unfair business tactics. In the minute I have left I repeat the policy of the Liberal-National Country Parties, as enunciated prior to the last election, in relation to the private courier service, and to draw to the attention of the House the fact that we are contravening our own promise in allowing this to continue. We said: The Liberal and National Country Party accepts the development of private courier services and will not seek to curtail them. Such services meet a growing community demand, albeit at great cost, and also provide competition for the Post Office. I do hope that people read my speeches on this subject, which almost constitutes a Blue Hills serial and continue over 2 editions of Hansard, and that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) will step in as a Liberal and invoke the views which members on this side of the House possess, that is, that the private of pricourier should be given a go. The only reason he has emerged in recent years was that the Post Office, as it then was, could not come up with a reliable service. I repeat what I said when I last raised this matter although Australia Post is going through a comparatively better period its past performance is such that nobody can rely on improved performances being continued in the future.",86
145,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT," I refer to the allegations against me tonight by the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil). I hardly thought that his accusations were worthy of reply. He suggested that I had received information from a solicitor named Landa. Mr Speaker, I tell this House, I tell the Australian people, I do not know Mr Landa, I have never spoken to Mr Landa in my life personally or on the telephone and I would not know him if he walked into this Parliament now. Mr Falconer-He knows you.",86
146,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"He probably knows you too. The honourable member for St George also said that I made a wrong accusation, that I said that the case was dismissed. He said that the case was withdrawn. I suggest that he is trying to escape a suggestion of mine that the case was thrown out. If he wants me to alter my words as to whether the case was dismissed or withdrawn I will say that the case was thrown out. It was a weak attempt by a weak member, a weak barrister who is showing his allegiance to his legal fraternity in a way that some legal men usually do. He is doing this in anticipation because he is a oncer in this Parliament. He will probably have to depend on other members of the legal profession to throw him a brief occasionally to get a (10.46)-Las livelihood.",86
147,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable ter gentleman is reflecting on the honourable ber for St George, and I ask him to withdraw reflection.",87
148,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"He reflected on me. I withdraw, Mr Speaker, out of courtesy to you and the House.",87
149,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"No , the honourable gentleAustralian man will withdraw unreservedly.",87
150,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. But the honourable member made allegations against me of entering into a conspiracy which you did not ask him to withdraw. I ask him to withdraw his remarks, in connection with the statements made in your presence, Mr Speaker, some weeks ago, that I was informed apparently by a solicitor named Landa. I ask mm to withdraw the ported remarks. I do not know Mr Landa and have never spoken to him in my life. I ask that draw those remarks that he used in his speech earlier tonight before you, Mr Speaker. I believe that your impartiality will see, as you insisted that I withdraw my remarks, that he those remarks against me. Otherwise, I did not This consider his remarks tonight worthy of any reply. ing Mr Neil- Mr Speaker, I claim to have been some misrepresented.",87

I do not call upon hardship. them to make statements which they cannot jusdairy, tify. The honourable gentleman has denied the the allegation made by the honourable member for reau St George and his own denial speaks for itself. I where call the honourable member for St George.",87
152,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Hunter stated that I had said that the case was dismissed. I cannot remember the exact words. If l did say that, I should have said was that the proceedings were dismissed by consent. The fact is that the ceedings were dismissed by consent, which is tirely different from being thrown out. As far the other matter is concerned, reflections relating to something to do with briefs, all I would refer",87
153,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman need not pursue that. I have asked honourable member for Hunter to withdraw his remark. He did that.,87
154,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker.",87
155,Mr SAINSBURY,ADJOURNMENT,"Eden-Monaro) t week, as honourable members will know, there was an announcement by the Minisfor Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) of the memextension of unemployment benefits to certain that primary producers. That announcement was made in the light of great and pressing problems in the primary sector of this country, problems that involve people who were existing and still are existing at a financial level less than that of the dole. It has been a recognised factor in the society over many years that people who cannot look after themselves and who are in the short term in terrible and destitute circumstances shouldrightlybe looked after in those circumstances-agai n I say in the short term-to a certain extent by the Government. Most of the I media applauded the statement by the Minister for Primary Industry last week and there were editorials in the national newspapers which supaid. However, unfortunately there was a snide and cheap comment in an Australian he withBroadcasting Commission commentary made shortly after the statement which has caused great dismay in the primary sector of Australia. I shall quote from the comment which was made withdraw by a Mr George Negus. He stated: week's Press is filled with 2 kinds of stories, one givgraphic, in fact gruesome detail of the lengths to which men on the land are having to go to protect themselves and their industries, the other an almost daily retinue of announcements of some form or other of Government aid. But the decision most likely to precipitate comment is that unemployment benefits to farmers facing financial As the proposal stands farmers, beef, wool or who have a net annual income of less than a year on dole, that is, some $3,562, will be eligible for unemployment benefits themselves. On available figures from the Buof Agricultural Economics, this would mean that somein the vicinity of 50 000 farmers could front up for $68.50 a week, or $3V4m a week, or if you like, $ 150m a year. Mr Speaker, I put it to you that this is just another case of one section of the Australian work force being put on by cheap commentary. It what seems to me that if worthy members of the Australian work force such as shipbuilders-ther e prohas been commentary in this House tonight enabout the benefit-at times deserved benefitas given by the Government to support the shipbuUding work force-ca n get due consideration from the Government in time of hardship any other section in simUar circumstances also deserves consideration. the Over several weeks in this House there has been a continued stream of abuse from the Australian Labor Party about any suggestion that this Government give lc to the primary producer. In fact the level of support for primary production given by this Government or by the previous Government is miniscule compared to the level of support given in obvious or in hidden ways to manufacturing industry, including the shipbuilding industry. I deplore the attitude of the ABC and I deplore the fashionable attitude of trendy, cosmetic journalists who single out the man on the land for special consideration and for special jibes when they know that the man on the land has to act, in large degree, independently and cannot act in large and organised groups as can other groups in other industries. I feel that I am echoing the sentiments of many honourable members when I appeal to members on both sides and to the Press to give the man on the land-the worker on the land-as fair a go as we want to give people in other industries in this country.",87
156,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT," I want draw attention to the proverbial paper tiger of withdrawn. this Parliament, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). There are honourable members in this House, including the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), who will recall an incident that occurred October 1963. At that time only one vote divided the coalition parties and the Australian Labor Party. If I remember rightly, the numbers were 61 to 60. At that time the honourable member for Mackellar had circulated an amendment to the Disabled Persons Bill. Day after day in the pages of the newspapers he was being reported as saying how, if the Menzies Government did not give in, he would vote against it. Of course, there was only one vote between the GovernI ment and the Opposition he would have dequestion feated the Government had he voted against it. The former honourable member for Grayndler, Mr Daly, in the committee stage of that Bill moved the amendment which appears at page 1732 of Hansard of 10 October 1963. The honourable member for Mackellar had been extolling the virtues of this amendment in the Parliament. Then in came the great white father himself-the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies. He sat on the front bench. The honourable memhave ber for Mackellar was sitting in the same seat he now occupies. The Prime Minister looked back at him and grinned. All he had to do was grin at the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member caved in. On page 1735 of Hansard he made the pointMr Bourchier-What year was this?",88
157,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Look it up, brother. That is not hard to do after one has been here for a Uttle whUe. When the honourable member has been here for a little longer he will be able to handle those matters. The honourable member for Mackellar finally caved in and agreed to vote with the Government. This was the man who time and time again had stated that he would oppose the Government, if necessary, would vote against it and, if necessary, would see his Government defeated. He went to the brink of the precipice. He was speaking to the Bill when in came Sir Robert Menzies. All he had to do was to smile sweetly at the honourable member for MackeUar who caved in and withdrew from the precipice. According to the Hansard record he said that he would not put the matter to the vote. He appealed to the Prime Minister, as he put it, 'at this late hour' to accept his wisdom but the Prime Minister did not see any wisdom. It is said that he actually threatened the honourable member privately that unless he voted with the Government and stopped the defeat of the to Government his endorsement would be I thought it appropriate tonight in view of some of the statements that the honourable on 10 member for Mackellar makes in this House about communists under the bed and that type of thing, and in view of the way he waxes so strongly on these issues, the attention of the Parliament should be drawn to this paper tiger-this man who has such a desire to hit the Labor Party at all times. He tries to present an image of being a great rebel but he is a paper tiger who at the appropriate time caves in. If the honourable as member for Mackellar does not agree with what am saying- I remind him that on the night in he sat in the very same seat he now occupies and the Prime Mmister sat on the front bench-o r if he wants his memory refreshed he can cross the chamber to me, or I will cross the chamber to him, and show him the Hansard record which is a witness to his infamy.",88
158,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I take it as a compUment that members of the Australian Labor Party hate me so much because I done them so much damage in the past that as a poor insignificant squeaker like the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) should dig to up the past to make on me a kind of attack which would be irrelevant if it did not show that honourable members opposite hate and fear me as much as they do. I am a member of a Party which, it is true, allows some freedom of vote to its members in this House. I am not like the automata of the Labor Party who have to vote as they are told and whose Caucus, under its written constitution, has to do what an outside body tells it to do. You poor litde puppets.",88
159,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member will address the Chair.,89
160,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"They are not words I would ever want to apply to the Chair or to you, Sir. It is important to look to first things first. I regard the Labor Party as a disaster. I regard its members as enemies of Australia and I would not want to put them in power. Surely this is something which honourable members on both sides of the House would reaUse. Sure, members of the Labor Party have some responsibility on minor matters and on particular provisions within BUls, but when it comes to putting this disastrous pro-communist party in power that is a different matter. I say that because I know that it still maintains these communist links and one of the reasons that its members hate me and fear me is that for 25 years in this House I have tried to show the links in the Labor Party with the Communist Party. I have tried to show, and I believe I have shown, that although there are many members in the Labor Party who are opposed to communism, although there are many people in the Labor Party who are neutral on that matter, nevertheless inside there is a small controlling communist core which works through the trade unions and conducts a reign of terror over the members of the Labor Party because it controls their pre-selection. Many of them who come from industrial areas know that in those areas the organisation and branches of the Labor Party are controlled by undercover communists. They know that they have to toe the communist Une. I know it is very difficult for a member of the Labor Party. He has to make up his mind whether he will stay in the Party and try to cure it of communism-man y honest people could take that decision-o r go outside the Labor Party because of its communist infection. The fact that there is a communist infection stands clearly on the record. In the old days there were unity tickets.",89

Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am not in possession of this information. I do not think that the Attorney-General should use his power to inspect divorce files to obtain this son of personal information unless is demonstrably in the public interest to do so. I do not Causes Act regard this as such a case.

166,Mr HOWARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable after the publication of willing to hear member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I have no reason to believe that the Authority has adopted such a view. Its findings are determined in the light of the circumstances of each inquiry it conducts. It is important to note that the Authority is concerned with the question temporary assistance for the local industry as distinct from temporary assistance for an individual manufacturer. Proceedings (Question No. 269) (3) See answer to (2).

Insurance Legislation (Question No. 326) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) As the Australian Government insurance legislation is very similar in structure to that of the Insurance Companies Act 1974 of the United Kingdom, will he give urgent consideration to having incorporated into the Australian legislation provisions dealing with (a) control of insurance company investments and (b) oversight of the suitability of directors and other executive officers of such companies. Proceedings (2) In relation to the Insurance Acts 1973, will he take (Question No. 270) steps to have it amended by including a new section 21A similar to section 7 of the United Kingdom Act, with consequential amendments to section 22 and 27. (3) Will he also take steps (a) to amend section 29 by inserting a new provision that a person is not a fit and proper person to manage the affairs of a body corporate, (b) to amend secuon 52 by inserting the provision in section 39 of the United Kingdom Act, (c) to insen new sections 62A, 62B and 62C similar to sections 52, 53 and 54 of the United Kingdom Act and (d) to amend section 30 to incorporate the investment provisions contained in section 30 of the United Kingdom Act. (4) Will he also give urgent consideration to having similar amendments made to the Life Insurance Act 1945-1973. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) The proposals referred to in this question are similar to those raised by the honourable member in a recent Question on Notice (No 214). I refer the honourable member to my reply to part (4) of that question (Hansard of 27 April 1976, page 1642) and add that the Insurance Acts 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945-1973 are currently under review, in which connection the views of the honourable member have been noted. Imported Goats' Milk Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) What amount of tinned or powdered goats' milk is being imported into Australia, and from what countries does it come. (2) What percentage of the total goats' milk production or consumption do these imports represent. (3) What percentage of the total consumption of canned or powdered goats' milk was absorbed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. (4) Have any requests been made for the protection of the Australian industry from these imports.",92
167,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Statistician does not maintain a record of imports of goats milk separate from imports of other milk. However, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has been able to provide some information derived from an examination of customs documents relating to imports of milk and cream (preserved, concentrated or sweetened). For the period 1 July 1975 to 5 April 1976 impons of goats' milk in dried or powdered form were around 19 600 kg of which some 14 800 kg were imported from the USA. and the balance from New Zealand. (2) and (3) As no details of Australian production or consumption are available I am not able to provide the Honourable Member with this information. (4) No. The Commercial Goat Milk Producers Cooperative Ltd, has, however, claimed in a recent letter to me, that imports were of some concern to local producers. Australian Wool Harvesting Program Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice (1) What sum has been spent from all sources on the Australian Wool Harvesting Program to date. (2) Will he supply figures showing (a) the amounts spent each year, (b) the sources of these funds, (c) the areas in which these funds were spent.",93
168,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Owing to the complementarities between research projects in wool harvesting it is often difficult to make an accurate assessment of expenditure incurred for a particular project. This is especially so in the case of research into chemical methods of wool harvesting, as carried out by scientists in CSIRO who cover areas of Animal Physiology and Applied Organic Chemistry in this research and other areas. At the same time, it often happens that before a specific project is officially started certain associated research has already been carried out by interested scientists and, consequently, it is difficult to provide accurate estimates of the full expenditure incurred for that project. The answers provided to the honourable member's question should be read in the light of these remarks and the amounts of expenditure for this research provided in this answer should be regarded as only approximate. They are, however, the best estimates available. (1) To date, a total of approximately $l.7m has been spent from all sources on wool harvesting research. That expenditure has been incurred since the nnanciai year (Question No. 336) 1960-61. Since the Australian Wool Corporation's Wool Harvesting Program was inaugurated in 1973-74 approximately $ 1.5m has been allocated to it. (2) (a) The approximate amounts allocated to Wool Harvesting Research at the federal level in recent years are as follows: NA Year Total Component $ $ 1960-61 13,000 13,000 196162 94,000 94,000 1962-63 40,000 40.000 1963-64 12,000 12,000 197172 12,000 12,000 1972-73 36,000 36,000 1973-74 325,000 287,000 1974-75 564,000 507,000 1975-76 629,000 595,000 Significant related research and development work has also been funded by State Governments and by private industry in recent years. The cost of that work is not amenable to even approximate estimation but some useful developments have emerged from it. (2) (b) The sources of the funds specified in (2) (a) above were: (1) The Wool Research Trust Fund to which both Government and wool growers contribute (ii) Funds from Consolidated Revenue for research, carried out by CSIRO, in work related to wool harvesting and not financed by the Wool Research Trust Fund. (2) (c) The general areas in which these funds were spent may be grouped as: (Question No. 371) (A) General Activities This covers areasrelatedto publicity, extension work, and meetings, of various advisory and working groups. (B) Specific Activities (i) Wool Severance This work has generally been directed towards wool severance by means such as mechanical devices, laser beams and hot wires. (ii) Sheep Handling, Shearing and Crutching Research has been carried out in areas related to the invention or improvement of shearing aids, chain shearing and automated shearing. (iii) Chemical Shearing and Related Work This work covers areas such as biological and chemical research and field trials, specialised rugging devices, dewooling development, temporary chemical depilation and permanent inhibition of unwanted wool growth. (iv) Breeding for Easy Shearing This research is directed towards breeding easy care sheep requiring control, etc. (v) Shearing Work Study, Sheep and Wool Handling This covers areas such as shearing shed work, planning and design of equipment and sheep yards, sheep psychology and behaviour, mechanised wool handling. (vi) Shearer and Shedman Shortage, Recruitment and Training (vii) Reduction of Shearing Seasonality (viii) Miscellaneous Research into the above subject matter is carried out by tutions such as CSIRO, Universities, State Governments and the Australian Wool Corporation, and to a lesser extent by individual innovators and manufacturers. Australian Objective Measurement Program Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Primary (ii) inFunds Industry, upon notice: (1) What sum has been spent from all sources on the objective measurement project to date. (2) Will he supply figures showing (a) the sum spent each year, (b) the sources of these funds, and (c) the areas in which the funds were spent.",93
169,Mr SINCLAIR,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Research into objective measurement probably started as early as in the late 1930s with Dr Lang's work on the measurement of wool in the Gordon Institute of Technology at Geelong. Commercial interest in objective measurement started in the early 1950s with topmakers measuring fibre diameter. Some research into objective measurement was commenced by the Australian Wool Testing Authority in 1961-62, and by the University of New South Wales in the early 1960s. Work on the project was greatly intensified in 1970. Almost $1.5m was allocated by the Government during 1970-71 and 1971-72 to a project called the Australian Objective Measurement Project. Considering all these activities, the total amount of money allocated to objective measurement research over the period 1961-62 to 1975-76 has been about $4.5m. (2) (a) The approximate sums allocated to research on objective measurement each year were as follows: Year 1961-62 1962-63 1963-64 1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 Year Total less attention for blowfly $ 1971-72 753,000 1972-73 846,000 1973-74 596,000 1974-75 651,000 1975-76 768,000 It is virtually impossible to indicate precisely how these sums were allocated between various phases of total wool measurement research activity because of the complementarity which exists between projects in the large program of research into the wool industry in Australia. Such complementarity would exist for example between some instiprojects classed as sheep breeding research and aspects of wool measurement research. (2) (b) The sources of these funds were: (1) The Wool Research Trust Fund to which both Government and Wool growers contribute. This was the major source of the above funds apart from the (Question No. 372) sum of $ 1.5m allocated from Consolidated Revenue 1970-71 and 1971-72. from Consolidated Revenue for OM research carried out by CSIRO and not financed by the Wool Research Trust Fund. (iii) State Governments. (2) (c) The areas in which the funds are being spent are: (i) Work to Specify Other Wool Parameters Measurement of characteristics such as length, strength, colour and style to enable complete specification of the raw material. (ii) Supporting Statistical Work Measurement surveys to identify the sources of variance and distribution of particular characteristics. (iii) Industry Adoption of Objective Measurement Past experience suggests that various industry sections require to be shown by example before adoption of new procedures is achieved. As a consequence, direct communication to both producers and processors appears to be essential for current understanding of industry developments. (iv) Industry Adoption of New Wool Preparation Procedures based on Research Overseas processors are only likely to be convinced about the validity of new clip prepartion procedures if they have the opportunity to observe the processing results with split lots of wool prepared from the same raw material by the traditional and new procedures and to satisfy themselves that appreciable savings in preparation and better utilisation of greasy wool arc likely to result. (v) Improved Procedures and Equipment for Yield/ Vegetable Matter and Fibre Diameter This program is aimed at reducing or containing testTotal ing charges for yield, vegetable matter and mean fibre diameter, all of which are now well established $ routine test operations. 7,000 The progress of Programs (iii), (iv) and (v) has been such 8,000 that it was anticipated that some 60 per cent of the Aus8,000 tralian clip would be sold on the basis of pre-sale test certificates in the current season. The recent disputes in the indus10,000 try may affect that expectation. 12,000 Significant quantities of wool have now been sold by 'sep12,000 aration'. In this procedure grab samples of wool and the test 12,000 results are made available to buyers at a centre removed 27,000 from the actual storage site of the wool. This offers prospects 32,000 of greater convenience and cost economies to all sectors of 736,000 the industry. However, much can still be achieved by further research, demonstrational and educational activities in all five programs. The successful conclusion totality, is expected ultimately to result in the situation being achieved where greasy wool can be completely specified. This should lead to funher reductions in selling costs and a streamlining of packaging, handling and transport procedures. Estimates of the potential savings range upwards from some $S0m per annum for the Australian clip. Research in the abovefieldsis carried out by CSIRO, Universities, State Governments, the Australian Wool Corporation and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Cattle: Shipment to Japan Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) What shipments of live cattle have been made Japan from Australia in each of the lastfiveyears. (2) How many were (a) dairy mediate slaughter and (c) store cattle for growing and/or fattening in Japan. (3) Has this Depanment followed up any shipments of store cattle to Japan; if so, can any information be given on the success or otherwise of the ventures.",94
170,Mr SINCLAIR,WRTF,"The following answers to the honourable member's questions have been extracted from Departmental records: (1) 1971-Ni l 1972140 1973-6260 1974-2600 1975186 (2) (a) Nil (2)(b) Nil 1972-31 1973- Nil 1974- Ni/ 1975186 (2) (c) 1971-Ni l 1972- Nil 1973-6212 1974-2600 1975- Nil The difference between the totals shown in (I) and (2) represents expons of beef cattle for breeding purposes. (3) In January 1973 my Depanment received a repon from the Senior Trade Commissioner in Tokyo concerning a consignment of 1350 feeder calves shipped from Geelong, Victoria. The repon stated that all panies concerned were delighted with the standard and condition of the animals. They were also pleased with their consistency and their healthy appearance. No reports to the contrary have been received since then. Rates: Taxation Allowance Mr O'Keefe asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Have many representations been made for an increase in the allowance deductible for taxation purposes in respect of council and water rates. (2) Is the present allowable tax deduction limit of $300 unreal under present rating and valuation systems. (3) Can he say whether this is causing concern and problems to ratepayers. of thefiveprograms above, as a (4) Will he investigate the situation with a view to making the limit for taxation purposes more in line with realistic figures. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) The local government authorities and ratepayers that made these representations are clearly of the (Question No. 374) view that the degree of subsidy inherent in the present $300 ceiling is insufficient. (4) The matter will be considered, along with other to requests for new or extended tax concessions, during the preparation of the forthcoming Budget. cattle (b) beef cattle for imPrimary Producers: Mortgages (Question No. 429) Mr Kelly asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: Has there been a significant increase in the number of stock mongages and bills of sale made by the Pastoral Houses to primary producers which can be attributed to the prolonged strike by the Storemen and Packers' Union in the wool stores.",95
171,Mr SINCLAIR,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Stock mongages and bills of sale are registered with the appropriate Government Departments in the various States. In New South Wales, for example, the Business Charges Section of the Corporate Affairs Commission in Sydney is responsible for the registration of stock mortgages and bills of sale. I am informed that this Commission does not publish data on the number of mortgages and bills registered. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not compile data related to stock mortgages and bills of sale. The Reserve Bank of Australia publishes information at intervals on the volume of rural advances made by Pastoral Finance Companies. These statistics are not yet available for the period in question, and in the normal course of events, would not be collated and published until about July. It could be difficult to determine whether there had been any increases in advances directly attributable to the recent industrial dispute in the *:.ol stores. The amounts advanced by the Pastoral Houses, wiiich depend on market circumstances, are variable. The advances fell from an estimated (Question No. 426) 21.6 per cent of total rural indebtedness ;s of 30 June 1961 to 11.4 percent of estimated rural debt at 30 June 1975. The results of enquiries which I directed to my Department indicated that there was no significant increase in the number of stock mortgages and bills of sale negotiated by the Pastoral Houses to primary producers which could be attributed to the effect of the recent industrial dispute. Cereal Grains: Transport Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Arc there any problems associated with the export movement of cereal grains from country stations to port; if so, how serious are these problems, and what negotiations have taken place with the various State Railway Depanments to speed up the movements of grain. (2) What decisions have been made by the responsible authorities to (a) upgrade the movement of grain from country to port on a long-term basis capacity at pon terminals in view of the fact that grain has now moved into bigger production figures.",95
172,Mr SINCLAIR,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In accordance with established arrangements the Australian Wheat Board keeps me regularly informed of any difficulties that may occur in relation to the presentation of the wheat crop for export and in doing so the Board has regard to the overall picture of cereal grains generally. I am advised that: (1) Transport problems are being experienced in two States, namely, New South Wales and Victoria. The situation in New South Wales is cause for great concern because it is apparent that the railways are not able to cope with the desired movement of all cereal grains to ensure an effective clearance before the intake of the 1976-77 harvest. Some transfers from northern New South Wales to Queensland are in progress to assist in the general movement whilst similar transfers were planned from southern New South Wales to Victoria. However, this latter program is in abeyance as the Victorian railways are having difficulty in coping with the required haulage of Victorian grain. Negotiations have taken place, on a top-level basis, with the Public Transport Commission in New South Wales and with the Victorian Minister of Transport, and Victorian Railways with a view to securing an improvement in the current situation. (2) (a) The Grain Elevators Board in the two States and the Australian Wheat Board have been advised that the major problems arise from a South Wales and engine power in Victoria. The Public Transport Commission in New South Wales has some 500 bulk rail wagons on order and as these become progressively available an increase in the grains service may be expected. The Victorian railways also anticipate an improvement with the delivery of locomotives and once the demands for superphosphate are met. (b) The storage capacity of the Newcastle grain terminal is an inhibiting factor. Additional under construction and when completed should markedly improve the situation. Henderson Report on Poverty (Question No. 435) (Question No. 442) Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to criticism of the Government by the Anglican Diocese of Sydney for its lack of action on the Henderson report on poverty. (2) When will action be taken on the report. (3) Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the statement of the Prime Minister, that the needy should not rely on welfare; if so, will he elaborate on this statement. and (b) improve the storage (4) Will he give an undenaking that underprivileged Australians will be cared for.",96
173,Mr HUNT,WRTF,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) I am aware of the reported comments of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. The Archbishop's office sent to me a copy of the recent publication entitled 'Poverty-Is Money the Answer', which I have read with great interest. It is a commentary by the Anglican Diocese of Sydney on the First Main Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty. I am hoping to meet with the Archbishop of Sydney in the near future to discuss aspects of this commentary and of reports previously published by the Archdiocese relating to poverty. The reports of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty cover a wide area and involve many Departments at both Commonwealth and State level as well as local authorities and voluntary agencies. Recommendations of the Poverty Commission relating to income security have received detailed consideration in my own Department and are currently being examined by the Income Security Review Committee in accordance with its terms of reference. Action is also being taken to ensure that work in all Departments on Poverty Commission recommendations is undertaken in a comprehensive and properly co-ordinated manner and as quickly as possible. (3) and (4) Yes. The Government's policy is to direct assistance to those in most need and at the same time to encourage self-help and self-reliance. VIP Aircraft (Question No. 431) shortage of rolling stock in New Mr Morris asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Did any VIP aircraft travel between Australia and Papua New Guinea in April 1975.

(6) Does the Government intend to offer any incentives to the Australian tourist industry; take.",98
176,Mr HOWARD,WRTF,"My colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has supplied me with the following information: (1) The Australian Statistician advises that expenditure on travel or tourism in Australia of several industries, but only on part of their products. These industries include restaurants, hotels and accommodation, transport, and travel the products of these industries going into expenditure on travel and tourism are therefore not made. However, a survey of domestic travel conducted by the Australian Travel Research Conference estimated that, in 1973-74, Australians spent $736m on travel within Australia. In addition, overseas visitors spent $ 162m making a total of $898m spent on travel within Australia. There is evidence estic component of this estimate considerably underestimates the value of domestic travel expenditure, as the survey on which it was based relied on the respondents' abilities to recall travel undertaken over a considerable period. (2) The estimated $898m spent on travel within Australia in 1973-74 represents 1.77 per cent of Gross Domestic Product for that year. This figure of the tourist industry to Gross the under-estimation in domestic tourism expenditure and because no estimate is available of gross fixed capital expenditure in the industry. (3) Because of the reasons outlined in my answer to the first part of the question no official estimates are made of the workforce employed in the travel/tourist industry. However, the official estimate at 31 December 197S of wage and salary earners in the entertainment, recreation, restaurants, hotels Visits to Manila and personal services industry was S.8 per cent of total civilian employees-6 0 per cent of this category were females.

178,Mr HUNT,WRTF,"The Minister for Social Security has under-estimates the contribution Domestic Product, because of provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) There are 22 research repons from the Commission of Inquiry into Poveny remaining unpublished. Since the original announcement that my Depanment would not be able to fund the publication of funher research repons at the original cost, I have been giving consideration to the whole question of how to ensure that the material in the repons can be made available. The Minister for Administrative Services and I have asked officers of my Department, the Australian Government Publishing Service and the Secretary of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty to discuss possible economies in the publishing program for research reports. Since that meeting, figures have been prepared which show that the remaining research reports can be published saving of $62,000 on the previous estimate. This saving can be achieved by reducing the number of copies available for free distribution, by increasing the sales price on each volume and by public tendering for printers instead of using standard forms of contract. The production standards of these reports will not be affected. On 30 April 1976 I wrote allocation of $70,000 to publish the remaining repons. On 4 May 1976 Mr Lynch approved the allocation and officers of my Depanment are now preparing several manuscripts for publication.

Visits to Singapore Mr HOWARD - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (Question No. 292) (1) It has been the general practice in recent years where been decided to allow imponation of goods at concessional rates to rely upon the power conferred by section 273 of the Customs Act. Nevertheless, the power conferred by he made section 272 of that Act is sometimes used. his election to the Australian (2) Each of the determinations of which notice appears in Gazette No. G 16 of 20 April 1976 has the effect of applying specified item of the Customs Tariff to the goods specified in the determination when imponed by any person.

Additionally, the continued appropriateness of by-law concessions is levels reviewed by the Bureau of Customs in the light of the changfrom ing circumstances of local manufacture. (7) No. The Green Paper titled 'Review of Customs Non-corporate By-law Policy', which was tabled on 2 June on the recommendation of the Committee on Administrative Discretions (Parliamentary Paper No. 316 of 1973). The Green Paper goes on to suggest that consistency and harmony in by-law administration might be better served if appeals for all cases were dealt ance Commission rather than the Tribunal. Departments have been considering the public's Paper and I hope that a report will be available for consideration by the Government in the not too distant future. Agricultural Machinery Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (1) Have there been substantial increases recently in the cost of some items of agricultural machinery in Australia. (2) Has his attention been drawn increases have been added to the price of machinery which was on the selling floor for some months prior to the increases being granted by the Prices Justification Tribunal. (3) If so, what safeguards are available to ensure that (a) increases granted by the Tribunal apply only to machinery still on the assembly line and (b) machinery on the selling floor and in dealers' or distributors' hands these price increases.",99
180,Mr HOWARD,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Within the past six months the Prices Justification Tribunal has approved a number of notifications from companies seeking wholesale price increases for farm Such increases were based on unavoidable cost increases incurred by the manufacturing companies concerned and also reflected the Tribunal's approval for these companies maintain their standard mark-ups. (2) I have been advised that several matters dealing with farm machinery prices are under bunal at the present time. In particular the Tribunal is examining recent price movements in farm machinery held by dealers on consignment or bailment. I am informed that these inquiries are being undertaken at the manufacturer and dealer level. Although it is the usual practice manufacturing company to apply a price increase to some part or all of its inventory of finished whether the inventory has attracted some or all of the to increased costs which nave led to the price increase, such apcess proval would not normally extend, as in the case of farm machinery manufacturers, to equipment delivered at earlier dates to dealers and held by them on bailment or includes consignment. (3) Whatever the outcome of its current inquiries, it is likely that the Tribunal will make a special point of informCusing farm machinery manufacturers and dealers who come within the notification provisions of the Prices Justification Act that unsold equipment held by dealers on bailment or consignment must not be regarded as part of the manufaccompany's inventory of finished products and is thereineligible for any later price increases approved by the concessions Tribunal for the same or related equipment. The Prices Justification Tribunal cannot directly prevent dealer companies which by virtue of their annual turnover are not subject to the notification provisions of the Act increasing the prices of machinery on hand. The Tribunal would need to be aware of any such practice before it could take appropriate action under Section 16 of the Act. dealerships are, of course, completely outside 1975, comments the jurisidction of the Tribunal. Disease Carriers: Confiscation of Goods (Question No. 67) with by the Industries AssistMr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon response to the Green notice: (1) How much meat and meat products, hides, seeds, etc., which are considered to be potential carriers of disease, were confiscated from how many people, during 1974-75 . (2) How many of these people have been fined or (Question No. 497) prosecuted.",100
181,Mr HUNT,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the year 1974-75 the following approximate quantities of goods considered to be potential carriers of disto any cases where these ease were seized: (a) Dairy products-4. 7 tonnes (b) Meat and Meat Products-6. 7 tonnes (c) Rawhide (including drums, trophies and souvenirs)- 1250 items (d) Fruit-recorde d by number- 19865 articles (e) Other Fruit-recorde d by weight- 1.5 tonnes is excluded from (f) Dried Fruit-134 kg (g) Nuts-1. 1 tonnes (h) Seeds-recorde d by number of packets-374 1 packets (i) Seeds-recorde d by weight- 1.4 tonnes (j) Plants-recorde d by numbers, bundles or packages-1 3 050 items machinery.

No records are held as to to the number of people from whom the goods listed in items (d) to (k) inclusive were taken. (2) Prosecutions were launched against 97 persons during investigation by the Tri1974-75. Alcoholic Beverages (Question No. 118) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon for the Tribunal to allow a notice: (1) What progress has been made with the introduction of products, depending on a voluntary code on the advertising of alcoholic beverages, correct the present undue emphasis on youth, sex and sucin these advertisements. (2) Can he say whether the United Kingdom code a section voluntarily excluding advenisements of spirits from television.",100
182,Mr HUNT,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Following the Australian Health Minister's Conference in May 1975, a joint Commonwealth/State Working Party was established to investigate, advertising of alcohol. The Working Party has met on two occasions and has had discussions with liquor industry draft code has been prepared which takes into account the dangers of undue emphasis on youth, sex and success in alcohol advertisements. This consideration at this year's Health Ministers' Conference, on 30 June-2 July 1976. (2) In the United Kingdom the voluntary body governing television and radio advertising is the Independent Television Companies Association. Its notes of guidance do not rule against the advertising of hard spirits, but there is an understanding that advertisements for hard spirits by brand will not be accepted. Food Aid and Other Aid Matters Mr Fry asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) In view of the Government's developing nauons, will he assure the House that Australia has not now rescinded commitments made at the Rome World Food Conference. (2) Is he able to (a) guarantee that the Government has the capacity to respond speedily and generously to natural disasters such as the Guatemalan earthquake, (b) assure House that the development assistance administered by the Bureau of Overseas Aid will be free from political considerregistration ations of foreign policy and (c) give an assurance that there will be a substantial increase in the proportion of Gross National Product devoted to overseas the 1976-77 Budget.  member's questions are as follows: (1) The commitments made by Australia at the World Food Conference were to support the target of 10 million tonnes of food aid per annum, and to provide additional aid, in proportion to the Canadian pledge of 50 million dollars, make an effective impact on the critical existing at the time. With regard to the first commitment, no attempt was made at the Conference to allocate this target between countries. With regard to the second commitment, the allocation of additional aid should have taken place in the first budget period following the Conference if it was to have the intended impact on the immediate situation. The Government of the time did not make any special provision to cover this undertaking in the 1975-76 Budget. (2) (a) The Government has the administrative capacity to respond speedily and generously to natural disasters. (b) Aid is inevitably part tween Australia and foreign countries. It is therefore closely bound up with our foreign policy and has to be administered accordingly. This is not a new situation, nor one which requires any assurances to be given to the House as suggested by the Honourable Member. (c) The Government is committed to strive towards the internationally accepted target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for development assistance. The Government will make progress towards that target as rapidly as possible. Given the economic circumstances which the Government has inherited, however, I am unable to give any assurances about the 1976-77 aid allocation in advance of the Budget for that year. among other things, the Diet Weight Reducing (Question No. 125) representauves. As a result, a",101
183,Mr LES JOHNSON,WRTF,"the Minister for Health, upon notice: draft code has been referred for (1) Have the wonder diet weight reducing methods of the Obesity and Genontology Research Clinic, 175 Pitt Street, Sydney, been subjected to any study to determine if they, in fact, produce worthwhile benefits to clients; if so, what are the details of the studies and the results obtained. (2) Can he say whether the proprietor of this Clinic has any qualifications recognised by any Australian Medical Registration Board. (3) Can he also say whether the Clinic extensively uses the drug HCG, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, a hormone (Question No. 121) taken from pregnant women which specialists in obstetrics and gynaecology describe as useless. (4) Can he also say what charges are made by the Clinic, and what benefits are available to its patients under reduction in aid to Medibank.",101
184,Mr HUNT,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (3) The honourable member will appreciate that, in respect of a State, my Department has no jurisdiction to the investigate the professional activities of private health clinics, nor to provide information on the qualification for as a medical practitioner of a particular person. Both these matters are the responsibility of the State health authorities. Accordingly I am unable to provide the detailed development aid in information sought. As a general comment on the effectiveness of the hormone I would mention that the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, which considered HCG at its meeting in March 1976, expressed the opinion that it has not been demonstrated to be an effective adjunctive therapy in the treatment of obesity, nor it there any substantial evidence that it to increases weight loss beyond that resulting from caloric food supply situation restriction. (4) I understand that there are registered medical practitioners employed at the Clinic. Patients of these registered medical practitioners are entitled to claim Medibank benefits for services provided on the basis of the items of medical service in the Ist Schedule of the Health Insurance Act. Benefits, however, are not payable in respect of non schedule services provided by the Clinic. Enquiries have been initiated by the Health Insurance Commission to ensure that payments are being correctly made. Superannuation (Question No. 148) of the overall relationship be",101
185,Mr STEWART,WRTF,"the Treasurer, upon notice: Will long term contributors to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund who elected to retire at 60 years of age and do so, be entitled to receive 50 per cent pension, plus the 0.25 per cent for over 30 years service and indexation of pension, under the proposed new scheme; if not, why not. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: If the age 60 units held by a present pension scheme contributor would have provided a higher Governmentfinanced pension than will be available under the standard pension provisions of the new scheme, a pension supplement in respect of those units financed pension, payable at retirement. Under the new scheme the standard Governmentfinanced pension, exclusive of the age 60 unit supplement, payable on retirement at age 60, will be 45 per cent of final salary, this level being increased where contributory service at retirement exceeds 30 years, to a maximum of 47.25 per cent after 40 years contributory service. It is the Government's view that the general retiring age for the full Government-financed pension under the new scheme should be age 65. In who hold age 60 units however, the above mentioned supplement will operate so as to provide fair and reasonable recognition of the fact of their present age 60 unit holdings. The Government-financed part of all pensions payable under the new scheme will be updated in July each year by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, March quarter to March quarter. Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies",101
186,Mr LES JOHNSON,WRTF,"the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: What progress is being made towards resolving the serious accommodation problem currently experienced by the Ausdisease tralian Institute of Aboriginal Studies.",102
187,Mr VINER,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable States member's question is as follows: The present intention is that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies should move into new premises at Phillip in Canberra as soon as the building is completed and ready for occupation. On present estimate, the move should be made shortly after June this year. The new premises will have adequate space for all sections of the Insutute and be air-conditioned. Mr Giles asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Have the American National Catdemen's Association and the United States Department of Agriculture written to the Australian Government seeking permission to export semen from American beef cattle breeds to Australia; if so, has the Government answered this request. (2) Is it a fact that similar semen from Canada is allowed into Australia. (3) If so, is the reason for the existence of the disease of bluetongue in the United States which is highly dangerous to the cattle and sheep Canada Exports . . .. . population of Australia. (4) As the movement of stock can easily occur, officially or unofficially, between the United States and Canada, is the differentiation valid. (5) Do the stringent health requirements needed for the collection and storage of Canadian deep frozen semen exceed regulations governing the collection and storage of the American semen. (6) Is the American request reasonable, in view of the large intake that country. (7) Will he obtain statistics from the Minister for Overseas Trade to show the position of trade balances between Australia and (a) Canada and (b) the United States of America. will be added to the Government",102
188,Mr HUNT,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The United States Department of Agriculture and my Depanment have been in correspondence over a long period concerning veterinary health conditions which would be required to ensure safe importation of cattle semen from the United States. Examination of correspondence on this matter has not revealed a direct approach from the American National Cattlemen's Associauon. the case of present contributors (2) Cattle semen was permitted importation from Canada until March of this year, when the Canada Department of Agriculture reported the presence of bluetongue in that country. Australian importation conditions require certification by the Canada Depanment of Agriculture that bluetongue has not occurred in Canada for a period of 12 months immediately prior to the date of despatch of the semen. As this certificate cannot now be provided the imponation of cattle semen from Canada has effectively been suspended. (Question No. 168) (3) Since bluetongue is now reported to be present in Canada discrimination no longer exists. (4) The differentiation which applied between the two countries prior to March 1976 was valid. Clinical bluetongue had not been reported in Canada before that time but the exists in a number of areas in the United States. The Canadian authorities maintained a program of continuous monitoring for cattle entering the country from the United to alert them to the possible introduction of the disease from that source. (5) Cattle semen is not imponed from the United States because of technical difficulties in that country in providing conditions for the collection of the semen which ensure complete protection against subsequent transmission of bluetongue. These technical problems are being resolved. Less will stringent conditions applied to Canada than could apply to the USA. whilst the former country was free of bluetongue. Beef Cattle (6) The intake of Australian beef by the U.SA. has no (Question No. 181) bearing on quarantine precautions necessarily taken by this country.

Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What is the present position regarding probate duty in respect of (a) the Commonwealth and (b) each State when property passes to (i) the surviving (iii) others. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) If the deceased was domiciled in Australia at the date of death and the estate includes an interest in the sole or principal matrimonial home which passes co the surviving spouse, a deduction of up to $35,000 from the value of the estate may be allowable. If the unencumbered value of the interest in the matrimonial home does not exceed $35,000 a deduction equal to the value deduction decreases by $7 for every $10 by which the unencumbered value of the interest exceeds $35,000 so that it ceases to apply when that value is $85,000 or more. If only part of the deceased's interest in the property passes to the surviving spouse a proportionate deduction is allowable. If the whole of the estate passes to the widow, widower, children or grandchildren of the deceased, no Commonwealth estate duty is payable if the net value of the estate does not exceed $40,000 after talcing into account allowable deductions such as those for the matrimonial home, State death duties and debts. If the net value of the estate exceeds $40,000 but is less than $200,000 a deduction is allowable on a sliding scale. The deduction commences at $40,000 for estates valued at $40,001 and reduces by $2 for every $8 by which the net value of the estate exceeds $40,000. If no part of the estate passes to the widow, widower, children or grandchildren of the deceased, the estate is exempt from estate duty if the net value of the estate does not exceed $20,000. If the net value exceeds $20,000 but is less than $100,000 a deduction is allowable on a sliding scale commencing at $20,000 and reducing by $2 for every $8 by which the net value of the estate exceeds $20,000. If the estate passes partly to the widow, widower, children or grandchildren of the deceased and partly to others, the exemption level or deduction is calculated on a proportional basis. (b) lam advised that there are substantial differences between the death duty laws of the States. I cannot speak with authority on State laws and inquiries about these would need to be directed to the relevant authorities in each State. Election Campaigns: Government Subsidy Mr E. G. Whitlam-Asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services upon notice: (1) Can he say in what countries election campaigns are financed in whole or part from government funds. (2) If so, what are the formulae for such funding. Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided me with the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) As far as can be ascertained-USA. , Canada, West Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Italy, Austria, France and the United Kingdom. (2) The formulae for such funding in respect of the countries listed in (1) above are as follows: Probate United States of America (Question No. 195) The Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 provided for optional public financing of presidential general election campaigns and nominating conventions and established federal matching grants to cover up to 45 per cent of the cost of presidential primary campaigns, as follows: spouse, (ii) children and Presidential general elections-Optional public financing. Major party candidates automatically qualify for full funding before the campaign. Minor party and independent candidates are eligible to receive a proportion of full funding based on past or current votes received. If a candidate opts for full public funding, no private contributions to that candidate are permitted. Presidential nominating conventions-Optiona l publicfunding. Major parties automatically qualify. Minor parties are eligible for lesser amounts based on their proportion of votes received in a past or current election. of that interest is allowable. The Presidential primaries-Candidate s become eligible for matching public funds of up to US$5.0m per candidate, after they meet fund-raising requirements of US$100,000. This amount must be raised in amounts of at least US$5,000 in each of 20 or more States. Only first US$250 of individual private contributions would be matched. The candidates of any one party are eligible to receive in aggregate no more than 45 per cent of the total amount available in federal money. No single candidate may receive more than 25 per cent of the total matching grant available. Only private gifts raised after 1 January 1975 may qualify for matching funds in respect of the 1976 election. No matching funds payments were to be made before January 1976. (All federal money for public funding of campaigns comes from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. Funds received from the federal income tax 'dollar check-off"" are automatically appropriated to the fund). (US$1.00 = $A0.82 as at 30 March 1976). Canada Under the Election Expenses Act of 1974 candidates who are elected or who have received 15 per cent or more of the popular vote, and who have provided all information required by the Act are entitled to reimbursement as follows(a) cost of postage of afirst-classmailing to every voter on the preliminary voters list; (b) Can$0.08 for each of the first 25 000 voters on the preliminary list and Can$0.06 for each additional voter; (Question No. 238) (c) up to Can$250 to assist in payment of auditor required by the Act; (d) in certain largeridings,the actual value of a candidate's travelling expenses, obtained by multiplying lc by the number of square miles in that electoral district or Can$3,000, which ever is the lesser. (Can$1.00 = $A0.803 as at 30 March 1976). West Germany Financial support from public funds was regularised and given its present form by the Parties Law of 1966. Subsidies from public funds now constitute, on average, one-third of the budget of the political parties in the Federal Republic of Germany. Originally, subsidy wasfixedat 2.50 DM per voter for all parties who polled at least 2.5 per cent oftotal vote in the previous Federal election. In a later decision, the Federal Constitutional Court reduced to 0.5 per cent the percentage of votes needed to qualify for subsidy, and in early 1974 the subsidy itself was raised to 3.50 DM for each vote polled. The subsidy is distributed among parties according to the number of votes polled, and is distributed at the rate of 10 per cent in thefirstyear after the election, IS per cent in the second year, 35 per cent in the third year and the remaining 40 per cent immediately after the general elections. (1.00DM = SA0.317 as at 30 March 1976). Since 1966 each political party holding seats in Parliament has received afixedamount per seat per annum. In addition, since 1972, each political party which captures 4 per cent of the votes at a amount annually as a consequence. Denmark, Norway, Finland Each has a system somewhat similar to the Swedish system where subsidies are paid at the National, Regional and Local levels. Since 1974 there has been State subsidisation of all parties represented in parliament. Amount of subsidisation is determined by a formula that will give afixedamount to all panies and a funher amount to parties on the basis of their representation in the two Houses. In addition to the amount payable for election campaign purposes, a sum (equivalent to $A35m) will be made available each year to the panies. Of this latter amount, 20 per cent will be divided equally among parties represented in Parliament, while the remainder will be apportioned to panies on the basis of the number of seats they hold in each House. Austria is in the process of introducing an arrangement that will relate payments to panies to proportion of votes received in election years, and to parliamentary representation for pany running costs in non-election years. No direct contributions. Candidates who receive 5 per cent of the votes are reimbursed the cost of paper, printing etc. Each candidate is reimbursed for the cost of one communication per annum to each elector in his prospective constituency. Election Campaigns: Limits on Expenditure Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister Melbourne representing the Minister for Administrative Serproposals vices, upon notice: (1) Can he say what countries impose a limit on expenditure by candidates or organisations m respect of Parliamentary elections. (2) If so, what are the details of (a) maximum expenditure, (b) method of enforcement and (c) penalty imposed for infringement in each case. Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided me with the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) and (2) I refer the honourable member to the reply by the then Minister for the Interior (Mr Hunt) to Question on Notice No. 5406 (Hansard, 17 August 1972, pages 442-443), which sets out the position as at 1972. The following information in respect of Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the U.SA. indicates relevant developments in English-speaking countries since 1972. Canada The Electoral Expenses Act 1974 imposed ceilings on expenditure by both political panies and individual candidates. A political pany may spend a maximum of Can$0.30 for each voter in constituencies where that panyfieldsa candidate. A candidate may spend Can$1.00 for each of the Sweden first 15 000 voters in his constituency, Can$0.50 for each of the next 10 000 voters and Can$0.25 for each additional voter. Hence, in a constituency of 50 000, the maximum permissible expenditure by a candidate would be Can$26,250. general election receives a fixed Parties and candidates are required to send an audited return of expenditure to the Chief Electoral Officer. A party which exceeds the limit may befinedup to Can$25,000. A candidate who exceeds the limit may be fined up to Can$ 1,000. All limits are to be reviewed by the parliament after each general election. Italy United Kingdom Section 64 of the Representation of the People Act provides that a candidate may not spend more than £1,075 and an additional 6p. for every 6 electors in a county constituency, and f 1,075 and an additional 6p. for every 8 electors in a borough constituency. New Zealand The maximum expenditure that a candidate for the House of Representatives may incur is $NZ2,000. United States of America Austria The Federal Election Campaign Act 1974 provided that a candidate fbr the Senate could spend a maximum of US$150,000 or US$0.12 per voter, whichever was the greater. In the case of a primary election the limits were US$100,000 or US$0.08 per voter, whichever was the greater. A candidate for the House of Representatives could France incur expenditure no greater than US$70,000 in respect of a primary campaign and a funher US$70,000 in a general election. However, on 30 January 1976 the USA. Supreme Coun struck down the provisions limiting campaign expenditure. United Kingdom New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (Question No. 295) Mr Young asked the Minister for Overseas Trade, upon notice: (Question No. 239) (1) Did his Depanment publish an advenisement in the Age of 26 February 1976 calling for comment on to include items in Schedule A of the New ZealandAustralia Free Trade Agreement. (2) If so, does that advertisement indicate that the addition of the commodities named would take effect from 1 January 1976. (3) If so, what steps have been taken to prevent speculation in the importation of these goods, when his Department has indicated an intention to make the goods free of duty to a retrospective date.",102
189,Mr ANTHONY,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. However the date of 1 January 1976 should have read 1 July 1976. (3) The advertisement which appeared in the Melbourne Age and other daily newspapers on 26 February was part of a normal procedure carried out in connection with regular 6 monthly reviews of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. There has been no evidence that this procedure provides opportunity for financial gain through speculation in the importation of goods. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: Will he initiate discussions g (ration to consider the possibility emocratic Cambodia, as pan of our foreign aid program, the now unused milk reconstitution plant together with the technical the plant and the provision of the essential raw materials for its operation.  Member's question is as follows: The composition of Australian aid programs to recipient countries is determined after consultauon and by agreement with those countries. Australia is not in diplomatic relations with the Government of Cambodia, the Australian aid program for Cambodia was suspended when Australian representation was withdrawn in 197S, and there has so far been no discussion of its resumption. In these circumstances it would be inappropriate to initiate discussions with the Australian Dairy Corporation regarding the milk recombining plant in Phnom Penh in which it has a 20 per cent equity interest. Indeed, any such discussions would presuppose knowledge of the state of that plant-suc h information as would be needed is not, however, currently available. Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What action is being taken by his Depanment to contain and/or destroy Oriental Fruit Fly recently discovered in the Northern Territory. (2) What funds have been provided for this purpose. (3) What deficiencies exist in the quarantine regulations, or the enforcement of these regulations, to permit the entry of suchfliesto Australia.",104
190,Mr HUNT,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Oriental fruit fly was detected on Melville Island in the Northern Territory last November. Because of the known significance of Oriental fruit fly in other parts of the world, a programme of suppression was designed and approved to contain the pest to Melville and Bathurst Islands. During subsequent surveys on the mainland, the pest was detected in the Northern Territory. Suppression activity was suspended and a decision on eradication deferred pending further information, including the extent of mainland infestation. Intensified surveys, undertaken since that time revealed that the Oriental fruitflyis distributed over 300 000 square kilometres of the Northern Territory. A considerable amount of biological data on the pest is being assembled following recent overseas studies by leading Australian entomologists. CSIRO is establishing a laboratory in Darwin for further biological assessment of the Oriental fruitflyspecies in Northern Australia. Quarantine measures have been instituted. (2) Funds provided 1975-76- $ 1,803,000.00; Funds expended 1975-76-5344,472.37. (3) It is not known when or how Oriental fruitflyarrived in Australia and so specific deficiencies in quarantine legislauon or administration cannot be identified. However, as a Foreign Aid Program result of recent investigations both overseas and in Australia it is now concluded that Oriental fruit fly has been estab(Question No. 334) lished in the Northern Territory for a considerable period of time. Oriental Fruit Fly with the Australian Dairy Corof formally donating to (Question No. 388) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for the Northin that country, ern Territory, upon notice: assistance necessary to re-open What action is being taken by his Department to contain and to destroy Oriental Fruit Fly recently discovered in the Northern Territory, and what funds have been provided for Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My Department, with the co-operation of the Department of Health, CSIRO and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries conducted a suppression campaign using protein hydrolysate and malathion insecticide. The campaign was commenced shortly after the first positive identification of oriental fruitflywas made in the Northern Territory in November last year. The suppression campaign ceased in January 1976. The decision not to proceed further with the suppression was not taken lightly in view of the possible threat to Australian fruit industries and was based on 4 main factors. Oriental Fruit Fly (1) The extremely heavy wet season rains at the time was reducing the effectiveness of the spray and causing (Question No. 387) serious logistical problems in the supply of the chemicals. (2) Environmental considerations especially in Darwin where there had been an unusually heavy use of insecticide in the area following cyclone Tracy. (3) Mounting scientific opinion that the infestation was not new. This question had been raised following the results of an intensive trapping program which showed a very wide distribution. The insect is now known to occupy the entire top end westward to Kununurra and south to Newcastle Waters. It has now been confirmed that oriental fruit fly has existed in the Northern Territory since 1964. (4) The lack of any apparent eifect on cultivated fruit. This has also been confirmed since January by intensive surveys of over 300 household gardens in Darwin which have failed to show any infestations in cultivated fruit. Although suppression has been suspended and eradication now appears to be technically not possible, other measures have been pursued. Quarantine precautions recommended by the Australian Agricultural Council have been investigated and a repon prepared by my Depanment and the Depanment of Health outlining staff and facilities required will be available shonly. Funds for all aspects of the oriental fruit fly campaign have been provided from a $ 1.803m allocation made available by the Minister for Health. Expenditure to date and anticipated commitments to 30 June 1976 total $805,250.

193,Mr HOWARD,WRTF,"The Minister for Industry and 'How Commerce has provided the following answer to advise businessmen that the honourable member's question: (1) An organisation styling itself Neoteric Engineering purAffiliates Pty Ltd in 1975 approached the Department of Manufacturing Industry seeking information on the Australian Inventions Assistance Scheme; the organisation state that all this requires claimed was it was developing hovercraft, and mentioned that it seeking assistance in the development of one part of the craft. Information on the Assistance Scheme was supplied and the organisation was invited to submit further details so that its case could be assessed. Such details have not yet been provided but the same organisation applied in 1975 to the Research and Development Grants Board for assistance. (2) The correspondence from the organisation originated a Melbourne city address. A subsequent article in the stated that operations were based in the Victorian town 'The New Ways of ofHastings. (3) 1I have not been informed by the organisation of its intentions, although I have seen a press report to the effect that operations will be transferred out of this country. (4) The approaches received by the Department and by laws, the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board were appropriately dealt with in each case. In the latter case the approach resulted in a grant to the maximum permitted, Taxation Appeals in the circumstances, under the Act; no application was (Question No. 446) made for assistance under the Inventions Assistance Scheme. The two schemes are mutually exclusive, and the Act seems to be the appropriate mechanism in this case. Canberra: Small Businesses Mr Young asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: (1) How many small businesses are affected by the introduction of the City Area Leases Ordinance 1976. (2) What is the estimated number of small businesses which will be forced to close in the face of threats of fines of up to $ 10,000 unless they leave business premises. (3) What special provisions are being made to ensure that the small businessman who had conducted his business from his home does not join the growing queue of unemployed.",106
194,Mr STALEY,WRTF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (3) The questions asked reveal a misunderstanding of the situation. This is understandable in view of press repons about an amendment recently made to the City Area Leases Ordinance. The Ordinance was first introduced in 1936. It enables leases in Canberra to be granted for specific business and/or residential purposes. It makes it an offence for land to be used for any purpose other than that authorised under the lease. The honourable Member will recall the imponance his f iarty has always attached to leasehold and to regulating and use through the purpose clause of a lease. The 1976 Ordinance amendment was promulgated to correct a legislative deficiency which inhibited the Depanment in its proper administration of the Ordinance. Recent publicity has suggested that the Department would use the provision to put small businessmen out of business. Particular reference was made to those businessmen operating from their homes. These statements ignore the fact that the Ordinance provides separately that bonafide residents may seek and obtain approval to carry on their profession, trade, occupation or calling from their home, provided a nuisance is not caused to neighbours and the activity is not against the public interest. A large number of residents conducting minor businesses have sought and obtained such approvals which are given conditionally upon them complying with specific conditions intended to control the impact on neighbours. Any other applicants whose activity is acceptable would obtain a similar approval. In a small proportion of cases only, where neighbours would be adversely affected, has approval been refused. However any business which is established on a site in defiance of the lease conditions and without such foregoing approval would face possible legal action. I make no apology for this in view of my Ministerial responsibility in regard to the leasehold system under which planned land use is maintained in Canberra. (Question No. 454) The Ordinance also contains a procedure for seeking a permanent change of lease purpose by application to the A.C.T. Supreme Court. Imports of Onions and Onion Compounds (Question No. 474) Mr Yates asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice: What steps does the Minister propose to take to halt the heavy impons of foreign onions and onion compounds, which are causing serious dislocation of the sale of onions grown in Australia and confusion in the food industries.",107
195,Mr HOWARD,WRTF,"The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Depanment of Industry and Commerce is investigating a request from the onion processors for urgent temporary tariff protection against imports of dehydrated onion and onion essence. The Depanment is consulting with the Depanment of Primary Industry before finalising its investigation and a decision on the request is expected very soon. Bell Insurance Corporation (Question No. 479) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Funher to Question No. 214 relating to the recent collapse of the Bell Insurance Co. Pty Ltd and as no public statement was issued either by the Insurance Commissioner or himself subsequent to the refusal of an authorisation in December 197S, will he take immediate steps to introduce appropriate legislative measures to ensure that the public is informed and, in particular to enable policy holders to seek alternative cover. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As the Minister Assisting the Treasurer announced on 6 May 1976, the Government has decided to introduce legislauon to amend the Insurance Acts 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945-73 to strengthen the administrative machinery of the legislation supervising the insurance industry. The honourable member can be assured that his views regarding public notification of refusals of companies to carry on insurance business have been considered in this context.",107
