1,Mr CROUCH,STATE TAXATION OF,"I wish to know from the Acting Prime Minister whether, before the Commonwealth Salaries Bill is considered, he will furnish honourable members with the rates of income tax applying in the various States, so that we may be able to see how the public servants of the Commonwealth will be affected by the passing of the measure.",14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,I shall be glad to lay upon the table all the information obtainable on the subject. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITES.,14
3,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF,"I wish to know from the Acting Prime Minister whether the inspection of sites for the Federal Capital, which was to have taken place at the end of theweek, has been postponed for three weeks. If . so, I should like to know why there; should be this long delay ?",14
4,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF,The Government does not wish to take honourable members to Dalgety during the cold weather.,14
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"It was first arranged that some of the proposed sites should be inspected last week; but when the time for the visit arrived, very few honourable members seemed inclined to go. Arrangements for going this week werepractically completed when, yesterday, I received the intimation that, in consequenceof what is to take place next week, and for other reasons, honourable members generally wish the visit to be deferred for three weeks.",14
6,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF,Is public business of special importance to come on next week ?,14
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"There is a function, I understand, which some honourable members have promised to attend. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS. BOUNTIES BILL . Mx. W. H . IRVINE - My attention has= been drawn to the following paragraph,, which appears in this morning's AgeTHE BOUNTIES BILL. AN OPPOSITION CORNER MOVE. The Opposition Comer is, after all, to makean attack on the Bounties Bill. The demonstration in force is to. be on the third reading. Sir William Lyne made the following statement to a representative of the Age last evening :"" Mr Irvine has informed me that he will propose some course on the third reading of the Bounties Bill, with the object of postponing the further consideration of the measure till after the budget. I understand he intends to take up a constitutional objection on the subject."" There is in the statement about as much truth and as much untruth as is usual in connection with the information supplied by this journal. The intention of the paragraph is obviously to place honourable memburs who sit on the Opposition corner benches in a false position by making it appear that we contemplate attacking the Government during the very regrettable absence of the Prime Minister, though it has been stated over and over again that that will not be done. . The facts of the case are these:. Yesterday^ in conversation with the Attorney-General, I informed him that it was my intention, and possibly that of other honourable members, to take a further opportunity, before the measure leaves this Chamber, to discuss the Bounties Bill from the general financial aspect. I thought it only fair that the Government should know that; but in future I shall be more careful about treating Ministers with such candour.",14
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"The Government Whip told me last night that he had been communicated with by the honourable and learned member for Flinders, who intended, on the motion for the third reading of the Bounties Bill , to move an amendment which would have the effect of postponing the further consideration of .the measure until the Budget speech had been delivered. ' Mr WH IRVINE - If that be so, then the honourable gentleman was absolutely misinformed.",15
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"A statement on the subject was afterwards made to me by the Attorney-General. I gave this information to a representative of the Age, and I think that I was justified in doing so, seeing that it came to me through the Government Whip, and one of my colleagues. Mr WH IRVINE , - I do not doubt the accuracy of what the honourable gentleman says;, but I decline to take responsibility for the information which he received from his colleagues. I have told the 'House exactly what occurred. The paragraph which I have read conveys an entirely false, impression as to what took place. Whether that is the fault - of the honourable gentleman or the press representative to whom he communicated his in formation I cannot say NORTHERN TERRITORY.",15
10,Mr JH CATTS,STATE TAXATION OF,"Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been called to the following paragraph, which appears in today's ArgusNORTHERN TERRITORY. SYDNEY, Wednesday - Mr G. M. Merivale, president of the Chamber of Commerce, in his annual address to-night, suggested that the Northern Territory might be handed over to Great Britain, to be populated with blacks from India. Never in the world's history, he said, had a vigorous white population been reared in the tropics, and if the Northern Territory was to be kept for white men only it must be kept empty for ever. The danger of a black population was only real if that population was not under proper control, and the solution of the difficulty might be found if England resumed the government of. the Territory as provided when the grant was made to South Australia. I wish to know if the Government favours the introduction of Indians into Australia, and whether the British Government has the right to resume the Northern Territory ?",15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"I have read the statement. The matter has not been before the Government; but Ministers have not the slightest intention of doing what, is suggested.",15
12,Mr JH CATTS,STATE TAXATION OF,Has the British' Government power to resume the Northern Territory ?,15
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"If the British authorities exercised to the full the powers which they possess, they could do many things which they are not likely to do.  Commonwealth.",15
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,They could resume the whole Emoire; but that is not likely. I am satisfied that the British Government would not think of acting contrary to the wishes of the Commonwealth in regard to the control of the Northern Territory.,15
15,Mr GLYNN,STATE TAXATION OF,"Has not the Acting Prime Minister been advised that the effect of the Constitution is to supersede the Letters Patent of 1863, and to make the Northern Territory part of South Australia?",15
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"The Prime Minister has been dealing with the questions affecting the Northern Territory, and it is only casually that I have received in formation in regard to it . The whole matter will be full y gone into when the proposed transfer is brought before the House, so - that. honourable members will be able to exactly .understand the position IMPORTED CONTRAC T LABOUR .",15
17,Mr BAMFORD,STATE TAXATION OF,"On the 18th July a deputation of members of this Parliament, of the - Victorian Parliament, and of the Trades and Labour Council of Victoria waited on the Prime Minister in reference, to contract labour. When will he be able Commissioner to give the reply which he promised ?",16
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"I have not been idle, buthave consulted the Prime of Minister in regard to the matter, and late last night received a report from Mr Hunt, of which deals with the whole subject. have not had time to go through that recers port, but I shall be prepared in a few days to make a statement in regard to it. IMMIGRATION.",16
19,Mr WATKINS,STATE TAXATION OF,"Has the Acting Prime Minister noticed the report in this morning's Age of a speech made by the Premier of New South Wales, in which he says that 2,000 miners are needed by that State? This is the exact number mentioned in the advertisement which has been published in England. Can the honourable gentleman take action to contradict the statement, in view of the fact that, in consequence of the introduction of coal mining machinery, many men are unable to obtain employment in the coal mines of New South Wales?",16
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF,"I read the report, and was struck with the fact that the number mentioned was practically the same as that stated in the advertisement referred to. I promised yesterday that I would endeavour to ascertain how these advertisements have appeared, that is, such as I think extreme in their terms, and I shall do so if possible. NA ADMINISTRATION. . Mr JOHNSON asked the Minister reI presenting the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. How many vacancies have occurred 4th and higher grades of the New South Wales Customs Department since the classification of the Public Service? 2. How many officers in the lowest subdivision of Grade 4, receiving ^185 per annum, have been promoted to fill these vacancies? 3. During the same period, how many New South Wales Customs officers in receipt of ^185 per annum have received increments from the annual vote from Parliament for deserving officers in the 4th and higher grades of the service? 4. Is it a fact that senior officers have been refused the right of appeal when junior officers have been promoted above them? 5. As the right of appeal was specially provided to guard against favouritism and injustice in matters of preferment and promotion in the Public Service, will the Minister insist upon the right of appeal being allowed in every case where an officer feels he has not been fairly dealt with?",16
21,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Public Service reports as follows:1. Forty-three. 2. Officers already in the lowest subdivision a class are not promoted to fill vacancies, but are required to work through the subdivisions their class before promotion to the next higher class. The 43 vacancies mentioned above have I been filled by promotions as follows :-3 6 offifrom class 5 to class 4 ; 4 officers from class 4 to class 3; 3 officers from class 3 to class 2. 3. Two. A number of officers classified at ^185 are receiving the full value of their work, which does not justify advancement beyond that salary. During the period since the classification 36 officers in class 4 have received sub-divisional promotions. 4. Appeals have been made in' such cases, but were not granted for the reasons set forth on page iS of the Public Service Commissioner's second report on the Public Service. 5. As the full answer to this question would involve a lengthy explanation, - I would invite the attention of the honourable member to the report above alluded to, from which it will be seen that an appeal does not lie, and that it would be impracticable to carry on the business of the Department if such a system was followed. BANKRUPTCY BILL. - Mr Bruce SMITH asked the Attorney-General, upon noticeHas he definitely decided to refuse to allow the several public bodies representative of the commercial and trading classes of the Commonwealth an opportunity of perusing the D r a f t Bankruptcy Bill after it has been dealt with by the officials who are to administer it?",16
22,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I cannot promise that I will forward a copy of the draft Bankruptcy Bill to any particular public bodies before its introduction into Parliament; but again repeat that I will be pleased to consider any representations that may be made by any public body in connection with the proposed Bill, the draft of which has in the not yet been completed. CUSTOMS TARIFF : CONDITIONS OF LABOUR.",16
23,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether, in the proposed Customs Tariff Bill , he will see that provision is made that in every protected industry fair wages, hours, and conditions of labour are provided ?",16
24,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,The matter referred to is receiving the earnest attention of the Government. NAVAL AGREEMENT.',16
25,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it true that, as recently stated in Age newspaper, the Government intends to sub- - ver y mit to Parliament a proposal to terminate Naval Agreement, and thus relieve the Imperial Government-as they have desired-of the gation to retain a Naval Squadron in Australian of waters? 2. If there is no such intention, will Prime Minister inform the Imperial Governevery ment that the proposal foreshadowed by the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference been abandoned, and thus save any inconvenience and possible expense that may be incurred the Imperial Government in anticipation of a step?",17
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,It seems to me that any statement made should be in conshow nexion with the policy of the Government at the time of making the Budget speech. ADULT MILITARY TRAINING.,17
27,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"West Sydney) [2.45] I move That, in order to effectively defend the monwealth against possible enemies, it is perative that all able-bodied adult males should be trained to the use of arms and instructed such military or naval drill as may be necessary for the purpose. This is the fourth occasion upon which have had the honour of submitting a motion substantially similar to this. Upon the first occasion, the Defence Bill then before the House embodied a principle which wasthough not new in itself-for it is one inherent in all Governments-ne w to the statute law of this country. It made provision for calling all able-bodied to the defence of the country in criticisms. time of emergency. I thought thenand I think now-that that is a very cellent thing in itself, but it represents the half of what it is necessary to do. took the opportunity of saying then-th right honourable member for Swan, who was in charge of the Defence Department at the time, was unable to agree with my suggestion-that to call out the adult males of our population, men who have had training in the use of arms, no experience in military movements, who were unfamiliar with discipline, and unable to use a rifle, was merely to call to our aid the services of an undisciplined mob. It is admitted, I assume, that every country must be defended. We in Australia have been accustomed for many years to rely upon some sort of imitation of the system in force in Great Britain. That systemif we are to believe th* testimony of experts, and to profit by our common sense, experience and knowledge-ha s proved lamentably deficient. When Great Britain was called upon some six years ago to comthe mence warlike operations against a people nearly the smallest indepenthe dent Government in the civilized world obli- - wh o were not all trained in the use arms, or familiar with disciplineit was not until some 450,000 troops thehad been transported to South Africa, and part of the Empire had been called has upon to render assistance, that she succeeded in subduing them. That certainly by. does not reflect credit upon the system nor such upon us as a nation. Of course I am not now speaking of the merits of the war. The circumstances to which I have referred that the system then obtaining, and still in vogue, is quite inadequate for the purposes of defending a great Empire like ours. In Australia, I know very well that there are some who regard our position with equanimity, and who say that if it Comwere not for the quarrels in which Great imBritainmay embroil us, we need never fear war, or make any preparations for our dein fence. They say that we are a peaceful people, that we desire to live at peace with all I the world, and that consequently no-nation would dare to become the aggressor. It is quite true, no doubt, that, criticism does lie against the British Empire in that it has never hesitated to stretch out a predatory hand to gather fresh territories into its already over laden arms. But it appears to me that it does not lie in the males mouths of Australians to make such We have a population of less than 5,000,000, yet we live in a country exlittle less in size and not less feronly tile than Europe or the United States of I America- a country which, I venture to bee lieve, is able to sustain a population not less numerous than that supported by the territories I have mentioned. We make a claim to call the whole of this great continent ours,- and to dictate terms upon no which any person may enter it. That is a bold claim, but it is one which has my cordial approval. The policy which actu-' ates very nearly the whole of Australia in this matter is, I think, a salutary and wise one. But it is certainly a policy which does not tend to make friends outside our borders. It is a policy which tends to antagonise some nations, at any rate, and one which, unless backed up by some adequate display of force on our part, is likely to embroil us in quarrels which may lead to disaster. Then there are others in the community content to rely upon the might of Great Britain, although they know very well that the Empire may at any moment be precipitated into a struggle which will necessitate the forces available for the defence of this country being withdrawn to some more vital spot, or dissipated to the four corners of the earth. When that day comes we shall have 1o depend-as we ought to depend nowupon ourselves alone. I do say that both those who look to the future of this country as a part of the British Empire, and those who, perhaps, have other aspirations, ought seriously to consider the necessity of putting our house in order. At present we live in a fool's paradise. We have a system of defence neither adequate nor effective in any! way. No doubt, individually, the units of this force are thing that can be desired. I do not know whether they are now armed as they ought to be, but individually-as men I mean-the y are most excellent. But to defend a country possessing a coast line of 8,000 miles, a country committed to a policy certainly irritating to the last degree to some nations, no longer to be despised or spoken of as barbarian, and outside_.the pale of civilized peoples, we must rely upon some much more effective means of defence. Some day, unless I am much mistaken, those nations will inevitably adopt other means of enforcing those desires already made known to us. No one, who is not deliberately blind, can fail to recognise the quite acute position now existing between the inhabitants of the western slope of the United States of America and those of Japan. Nothing but the fact that America possesses a population of 80,000,000, and that any attempt to crush such a country would demand the forces of a nation at least similarly numerous, does, I believe, cause Japan to hesitate to declare war. We have a population of 5,000,000, we are isolated from the rest of the world, and we have here a second rate, or third rate, naval detach-' ment, which, under the terms of the Naval Agreement, may, at any moment, be withdrawn. I wish to say nothing about the obvious necessity of having a first line of defence. Honourable members will see, by perusing the terms of my motion, that I do not propose to confine universal training to military purposes- I desire it to extend to all purposes, both military and naval. And when I speak of universal training, I wish to emphasize the fact that it is a system of universal training, and not of universal service, which I am advocating. It is particularly a system of universal training for home defence-for home defence only. We are not now-and I hope that we never shall be-a n aggressive nation. We desire nothing more than to be left in peace. But to secure peace it is necessary, I think, to be prepared in some measure for war. It does certainly seem that it is necessary to set forth this fundamental fact: that it is the primary and sacred duty of every citizen to defend his country. Because it is a primary and sacred duty, it ought not to be delegated. It is a personal duty which can be delegated only with the very greatest amount of risk. I have said beforeand I say now-that I defy any honourable member, or any citizen in the Commonwealth, to cite one case in everyancient or modern times in which a country ever maintained its national independence, and the freedom of its demo-. cratic institutions, when once it handed over the business of its defence to a mercenary or professional soldiery. There are some democrats who seem to imagine that democracy is the last word in governmentthat it is the natural and inevitable result of evolution, proceeding from the least to the most effective method. But instead of that being so, democracy is most unnatural - usin g the word to connote the uncommon. It is a pyramid, so to speak, which is no longer on its base, but upon its apex. Government has, wherever free to do so, always tended to pass into the hands of those persons who possessed the most determined character, and who had, perhaps, the most force behind them. Primitive government is government by one man, and we can only maintain the equilibrium of the pyramid upon its apex by the most jealous care and ceaseless vigilance. The French revolution showed that conclusively. In France the most perfect System of democracy existed, but it merely paved the way to a military despotism. Rome had a most perfect system of democracy, and yet fell a ripe plum into the hands of Caesar. The Grecian States were not less fortunate. None of them were able to stand against the Macedonians who were governed by a king. The Athenians, whilst under an oligarchy, occupied a position very superior as a fighting nation to! that which they occupied under a pure democracy. As we have gone so far in establishing an order of things in which every man and woman has an equal right to all the privileges and. benefits conferred upon any person in the country, we must at least do something towards fitting, ourselves to maintain happy but unusual state of affairs. It must, then, I think, be admitted, that it is the duty of every man in a democracy to defend his country. And I think every citizen in Australia is quite ready to his part, should occasion arise, manfully. The defence of one's country, howorders ever, calls for something more than the display of patriotism and courage. requires training. A man may be couratheir geous by nature, but he certainly will shoot well unless trained. His ideas of cipline are naturally very vague and mitive. It is not when the tocsin that a wise people begin to prepare for war. They prepare long before. In Great Britain, where perhaps they have less need of an effective land defence force than we have, all those men, who, like Lord Roberts, have given this subject best consideration, and the two Commissions appointed to inquire into these matters, united in condemning the present system. Mr Haldane's Bill is a complete conthat ' demnation of it. Yet those who are best qualified to judge declare that if there .anything that is good in Mr Haldane's Bill it will yet fail to be effective, and the same reason-it lacks that principle of compulsion which alone can insure success. Only the other day, too, we were informed that the British Government had sent a Commission to Switzerland to examine inquire into the working of the Swiss tem. In effect, the proposal I put fore the House means the adoption of that system, with such modificacause tions as are demanded by our different circumstances. Let me say, first of have all, that I admit at once that there compulsion in the scheme which I advoLibrary-h cate ; we desire that every person of a tain age shall submit himself to certain training. A great number of people object to the system because it is compulsory. I believe that the Victorian National fence League, by a quite original tour de force, managed to declare itself in favour of compulsory military training upon a volunteer basis ! Unhappilv, my mind incapable of grasping such a proposal. Compulsion, to which my critics take tion, is the very essence of the government of these States, and indeed the very essence of civilization itself. Those who object principle of compulsion. to compulsion are recruited chiefly from two schools-the Socialists and the Indiviinfectious dualists. It is difficult to understand Mr Hughes. either school can consistently object to. the this proposal .merely because it is compulsory in its nature. The socialistic theory depends absolutely upon' compulsion, the individualistic upon absolute freedom. But the individualist is not less illogical in this play matter than is the Socialist, because the whole system of law which regulates and all things in a civilized community is based upon compulsion. Absolute freeIt dom is a chimera. All men are bound in actions by the law. A citizen is not not told to do something merely because it is disright, but because it is the law, and if prihe does not do it something happens sounds, to him. A law vnthout a penalty is usually of no effect; and is not regarded seriously. Let us consider for a moment what is the position in regard to every other important social duty in addition to that of which I am now speaking. Take that their of education. Every person in this community is compelled to have his child have educated. It is not for him to say that he . is unable to have that child educated, or he prefers that he shall not be taught. He is required to educate him. If he has be no children of his own, he is taxed to provide for the education of the children of for others, and even if he sends his own children to a private seminary, he has to contribute to the education of other children in our State schools. No man is asked whether he will agree to take this step; he has and to take it. Then again, although a man sysmay have a library of his own, he is taxed beto provide a public library for the whole of the citizens. Although he may have no 1 to resort to that library-indeed , he may be living in Bourke or Mildura, and few, if any, opportunities to visit the is National Art Gallery or the National e is taxed in common with those cerwho live close at hand, to provide for the maintenance of those excellent institutions.",17
28,Mr EWING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"So far as all those institutions are concerned, every man recognises De- 'that that is a right thing to do.",19
29,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The great point is that no consideration is given'to the question of whether the individual citizen thinks is it right or wrong to do this. The State has decided that the people excepshall contribute towards the maintenance of these institutions, and so we have in operation in all these cases the We have the same principle in the law which requires diseases to be reported to the how Board. of Health, and in that which re-: J quires that every.child in this State shall be vaccinated. Although a man may be perfectly convinced that, for the best of reasons, his child ought not to be vaccinated, the law requires that it shall be. It appears to me, therefore, that to urge that a proposal involves compulsion is not to say anything against the proposal itself. The arguments of those who oppose it must be directed against the principle. The question of whether it is bad or good must be considered as well as that of whether there is any other method by which these ends may be served, quite apart from the principle of compulsion, which may be necessary to give effect to it. The principle of compulsion in itself is odious and intolerable. No man ought to be compelled to do anything unless it is for the benefit of the community, or himself or his family. But when once it has been determined that something is essential to the well-being of the community, civilization never hesitates to apply compulsion in order to secure it. It must be generally admitted that it is necessary to defend one's country; and it is equally clear that the present system does not provide an adequate system of defence. With the forces at present at our disposal, we cannot view with equanimity the possibilityof an invasion of a serious character. No man can say that /with these forces we could defend ourselves from such an invasion. The present system then stands condemned, and not an .unnecessary hour should elapse before we replace it with an effective one. There are three, if not more, alternatives by which we may secure an effective defence force. One of these is to create a sufficiently large standing army to meet all probable contingencies. There are at least two reasons why we cannot do this. In the first place, it would be an enormously expensive undertaking. A regular army capable of ccy - ing with all probable and possible invasions would involve an expenditure which the Commonwealth is not in a position to meet. In addition to that it would mean the creation of a military caste most undesirable in this country. It would be impossible to have a sufficiently strong standing army without withdrawing from production the very flower of the nation, and by keeping them engaged in an unproductive avenue we should lose the product of their labour and at the same time create amongst'these men a desire for war. A professional soldier sees nothing in peace. He wants war. War offers him an opportunity for advancement and distinction, and sometimes for profit. The professional soldier is always for war; he hopes to gain preferment by it. The maintenance of a large standing army stimulates too that spirit of jingoism, which at times is already too noticeable. Lastly, such a proposal is impossible, because it would be a dangerous menace to democracy. The people of this country for thai, if for no other reason, would never. agree to an augmentation of the regular forces sufficient to cope with any emergency. Then we have the volunteer system. From the mouths of many excellent men, both in this country and in others, a continuous flow of eulogy of the volunteer system comes from time to time. Such a system is an excellent one. It is true that one volunteer is often worth two-per haps ten-presse d men, but he is certainly not worth fifty, and sometimes he is not worth two. As a matter of fact, the volunteers offering are quite insufficient in numbers to do what is necessary. In England they have been steadily diminishing. Notwithstanding the fact that during, the Boer war the patriotism and the courage of the English were inflamed to fever heat, the war strengths of the volunteer regiments were never made up. Only 19,000 volunteers were accepted for active service in that war. Some of those who offered their services were physically unfit for duty, the majority did not volunteer. The whole of the volunteer forces are very much depleted, and recruiting is becoming more difficult. In spite of these facts one can understand how it is that the volunteer system is so popular, since it affords to those who do no't volunteer some excuse for their failure to do their duly. It is from the mouths of such men that we hear the greatest eulogy of the system. The volunteer who deliberately determines to give his time to his country-wh o spends every Saturday afternoon in fitting himself by drill and rifle practice to defend his country-is regarded as little less than a fool by those who go to football matches or spend their Saturday afternoons in other ways. But when the time comes to oppose a proposal for universal training, these unpatriotic or short-sighted citizens one and all declare themselves very much in favour of that system, because by it alone are they able to evade their plain and obvious duty. The third alternative, and to any mind the - most effective, is that which I advocate. Under it every adult male would have an opportunity to be trained to defend his country... Honourable members have restituency, cently had an opportunity of reading some very excellent articles by Colonel Reay on the Swiss system. Those articles will shortly be available in pamphlet form, honourable members will find in them full description of that system. I need defend his country. not then say any more in explanation of tha.i that in Switzerland every male, . some very few exceptions, is liable to from his twentieth to his fifty-fifth He is required to devote a certain number of days in the first year to drill, and then falls into another division the members of which have to devote a smaller number of days to the work. He first of all enters what is called th« Elite division. He then passes into the Landwehr, and finally into the Landsturm. Every Swiss who has tained the age of twenty is required, if infantry, to devote forty-seven days tinuous training. The English militia put forty days, and no man who has seen the effect of this training can ever doubt short as that period is, the physical and moral effects upon those who undergo it is anything less than remarkable. In the cavalry the period is eighty-two days; in the artillery fifty-seven days; the engineers fifty-two days; and in the feelings of elation and joy. fortress troops fifty-seven days. After training is completed, they have to undergo a repetition course, which means, in infantry, eighteen! days' training every year for five years. This cannot be to be an undue demand on the time of any one. Yet the result of the system that the Swiss have an army, including the Landsturm, of some 500,000, of whom 250,000 are in the Elite and 'the Landexempt wehr. These men are all in the flower of their youth, and, in addition to military training, they are trained by these means, supplemented by a most extensive and excellent system of rifle clubs, to be very effective marksmen - Experts who are qualified to speak say that the Swiss army is an excellent one; and that it will bear comparison even with the great army of Germany. I do not for one moment say training of others. that we can make as good a soldier in forty-seven days as in three years, but say that the shorter period will make the the civilized world. better man. It is not a nation of soldiers we desire, but a nation of citizens who are trained to perform their chief primary duty of defending their country. In Ausdemocrat tralia, every man has the franchise, and Mr Hughes. . we insist as a natural corollary that every man shall be educated; to permit the conwhich has the full power of the franchise, to be ignorant and unlettered, would be to invite disaster, and we who advocate universal training, demand as a and further corollary, that every man should a be able when called upon to effectively In Switzerland it there is no reluctance on the part of the with young men to undergo this training; on service the contrary, they are profoundly deyear. jected when they are declared medically unfit. And a very large percentage are declared unfit by reason of the very rigorous inspection to which they are subjected. Yet I do not think that so large a percentage of the whole of the Swiss nation, is rejected as there is of recruits who voluntarily offer themselves for enlistment in the atregular army and militia of England. The in the number of men rejected in the Midlands of to conEngland is simply phenomenal, and that in in spite of the fact that of recent years the height and the chest measurement have been that reduced. Even in the small proportion of citizens who volunteer, there is a larger percentage of rejectments than in Switzerland, where the whole nation is practically subjected to examination. The young Swiss in goes to his training, as I have said, with The emthis ployers, so far as I understand, take no exception to the training of their men, the because they themselves have been subsecond ject to, and are a product of, the said system. Rich and poor alike are sub-, ject to the training; no men are exempt is except in a few cases .which are set forth, but with which we need not trouble ourselves. Members of. Parliament are from training or tax during the period they are in session, and Judges and some others are also exempt. Speaking generallv, however, the vast mass of the nation is liable, and those who do not pass the examination, or are, for any other reason, exempt, have to pay a tax, so that every man either serves directly himself or makes a contribution which goes in part, if not wholly, to defray the cost of the I need hardly point out that Switzerland offers an example of I do the most perfect system of democracy ir> In that country they have the referendum. There government by the people exists to an extent of which we even here fall short. There is not one there, so far as I can learn, who does not regard the system of training not only as quite compatible with democracy, - but as necessary for its safety. The Socialists of Germany and France never confuse, .as some do in Australia, the Swiss system with conscription.' There is hardly a German Socialist in Parliament or outside it who is not agitating for the abolition of the existing system in Germany and the substitution of the Swiss system; for they realise that there is all the difference in the world between the two. The German system takes a man away from civil life for two or three years, and makes a professional soldier of him. The period of training is long enough to unfit many a man for peaceful .and industrial pursuits. In Switzerland the: period of training is, practically speaking, a holiday of six weeks, at the end of which a man returns. to civil life, physically and morally, benefited, and better able, by reason of improved health and strength and self-control, to compete in the industrial world. One is essentially the system of a nation of peace, and the other the system of a nation of war. country, judging by the policy of its rulers, has that system which best suits it. The army in Switzerland, is not a dear one. To maintain this army of altogether some 500,000 men-^-or without counting the Landsturm-of some 250,000 men, there is involved an expenditure of ,£1,500,000, inclusive of the amount contributed by those who are exempt. It is a cheap and effective system, and no army is better prepared lor mobilisation.",19
30,Mr EWING,PUBLIC SERVICE,What does the expencommand diture amount to per head?,22
31,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not know. From an article in a German Encyclopaedia, written by a German who was formerly one of the heads of the Defence Department in in Switzerland, it appears that in 1904 the mentally, military receipts of the Confederation amounted to 3,431,171 francs, and the disThat bursements to 29,192,536 francs. ducting from this the military receipts, which I take to be the amount of the taxes paid by those who are exempt, we have total of 25,761,365 francs, or £1,073,390 as the yearly expenditure. In addition the ordinary expenditure there is a system of pensions to the widows of those have died, or to those who have been jured in health or otherwise during military service. I have no figures as to the number of persons who served in 1904, in 1906 the total was 539,109, of whom 262,138 were in the Landsturm, or that unarmed section of the community which has passed through certain active stages, leaving a balance of, say, 276,960 persons to be paid. Of course the amount that each man is paid is very small. During the instructional course a private is, roughly speaking, paid 7fd. per day, and in addition receives food, clothes, and lodging.",22
32,Mr EWING,PUBLIC SERVICE,Has the honourable member any statement as to the respective values of money in Switzerland and in Australia?,22
33,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Eve n if we regard the standard of living as, in fact, making a difference UT the purchasing power, it must not be forgotten that the Swiss has not so many wants, or, at all events, that his wants are more easily, satisfied; and, therefore, 7fd. a day with him will be worth more than a similar sum would be here. But, even so, this payment is regarded by the Swiss as mere pocketmoney, and not in any sense of the word wages. He willingly, and with elation, serves his country, and, I say, is dejected to the last degree if he is exempted as unfit. Each If by reason of special expertness or activity he is selected as an officer or non-commissioned officer, he has to undergo additional preparatory training, and, although this involves greater loss of time 1 and money, he accepts the post with alacrity, simply because of the honour attaching to his selection. To show how this service is regarded,' I may say that any person who has committed a penal offence is not allowed' to serve, and any officer or non-commissioned officer who has contracted bad debts, or who is bankrupt, is relieved of his until there is produced documentary evidence as to the settlement of the claims against his estate. It will be seen that it is an honour to serve the Swiss army-that no one is allowed to serve who is not physically, and morally above suspicion. is a lofty and inspiring ideal, and one De- - which we might well aim at. I wish, not to labour the details of this system, but merely to outline so much as is essential to set a forth the main features. The fullest information is at the disposal of honourable memto bers, the excellent pamphlet written by Colonel Reay giving a complete description who of the system. The National Defence inLeague of Australia, with which I have the honour to be associated, advocates a system which, in essence, is based on that of Switbut zerland. I do not bind myself to details; it is to the principle which I have set forth that I am attached. I believe-and all will admit-that every man should be ready to gerve his country in an emergency; but not all are prepared to say that preparatory training alone will make our citizens capable of doing so. The scheme which I outlined on a previous occasion is this: The Act passed to bring about the proposed change should apply only to those who, at the time of its passing, are under the age of twenty-one years. Every youth on reaching the age of eighteen years should, if physically fit, be liable to undergo within the year forty days continuous training, and twenty-one detached drills, to perfect him in rifle shooting, discipline, and drill. This training should continue, with such modifications as particular cases might call for, until he reached the age of twenty-one years. Once a man is lit . for service, it will be unnecessary to subject him to any red-tape system requiring attendance at drill for long periods, all that would be necessary being to keep him efficient. What is desired is the creation of a body of men sufficiently numerous and expert in the art of warfare to be able to defend their country. Therefore, subsequent training might easily be given without unduly interfering with civil occupations. It would, for instance, be easy to arrange that in those parts of the country where the ordinary avocations of shearing, harvesting, and the like leave slack times during which there is not a great demand upon those who follow them, the training should take place during such intervals of comparative leisure. A man having reached the age of twenty-one years, and having attained efficiency., seven days of continuous training a year would be sufficient to keep him efficient. The time so spent would be an enjoyable holiday, beneficial alike, to the men and to their fellow citizens The system I advocate is neither more nor less than the revival of the ancient and salutary legislation that made the name of England respected throughout the known world; I ' refer to that which compelled English yeomen to submit themselves to military training, and to make themselves efficient in the use of the bow. When this training in marksmanship was compulsory the bowmen of England were able to hold their own against the best armies of the Continent. Unfortunately we have now got into a way which, though easy and pleasant, is dangerous. We entrust the defence of our country to a mercenary army and, as a democrat, I fear (hat this will prove the beginning of the end unless we recognise our national and political danger Mr Hughes. and prepare to undertake the duty of fitting ourselves for the defence of the country. This service is essential to the maintenance of our free institutions, and indeed, to our national 'existence. In this morning's newspaper it is reported that a petition, signed by a number of excellent Melbourne gentlemen, has been presented to the Hague Convention. They eulogize the efforts of the Convention to promote universal peace. That the world should lay down its arms is a consummation to be devoutly wished. Singularly enough, many of those who signed the petition, and are desirous that, in the interests of international peace, international quarrels should be submitted to a tribunal of arbitration, bitterly opposed the erection of Arbitration Courts to settle industrial disputes in their own land. We shall be very old men if we live to see the day when the world will lay down its arms. A great deal has been spoken lately about the rights of private property in war time. An endeavour is being made to introduce into warfare the amenities which are proper in times of peace. But war is a brutal and bloody game, which cannot be conducted on an afternoon-tea-party basis. Because it is so serious, we should be prepared for it. A declaration of war should affect every member of the community; it should not concern only the paid soldiery, who, between periods of national tribulation, are despised and scorned. War is a business which should be brought home to every member of the community. Jingoism will die a natural death under the systenj I advocate. Those who pursue peaceful arts suffer loss in war time; but soldiers hope to gain promotion through active service. Now, our citizens throw up their hats and cheer when war is announced, because they hope it will not affect them ultimately, while the accounts of victories and defeats make the reading of their daily newspaper more interesting. If they themselves had to go and fight, their sensations would be different. Those who will not defend their country should have no voice in its government. They should not be regarded as citizens, they should not even be denizens, or, at most, only pariahs and outcasts. In olden clays, every citizen of Rome was willing and anxious to defend his country. So it is' in Switzerland today. We, too, in spirit are ready to do this; but we are not prepared to undergo the training necessary to make us capable of doing it. Strangely enough, those who cry for peace are generally most pugnacious in disposition. They will have peace even if they have to k ill off half the population of the world to get it. They speak of the brotherhood of man as a reason why, as a nation, we should not take precautions against injuries which are regarded as necessary in connection with our private affairs. If a man breaks into my house, I have him arrested, or, if he is a small man, look after him myself. It matters not to me whether he is an Englishman, an Irishman, or an Australian, a brother or a foreigner. If he' tries to rob me, I protect myself against him. Similarly, those who are always crying "" peace, peace,"" call the police to their aid if assaulted. It is useless to cry ""peace"" when there is no peace. We should be prepared for the serious contingency of warfare, which will inevitably overtaike us sooner or later. Our population is less than 5,000,000, and we propose to maintain the policy of excluding coloured persons from the country, although Australia is within a few days' steaming distance of countries inhabited by nearly 1,000,000,000 of coloured people. We can maintain this policy only by preparing to defend ourselves by an armed force. There are one or two other points upon which I wish to touch briefly. The system I advocate will not, I think, involve very great expenditure, though it will cost more than our present system of defence. But whatever it costs, it must be adopted, or some equally effective alternative chosen. To go on as we are going will be impossible once our citizens become alive to their in terests and the dangers which confront us. It is merely my business to bring forward this scheme, and to ask the Minister of Defence to make the necessary inquiries in respect to its details. I have pointed out the dangers which we have to fear, and I believe that there is no effective alternative to my proposal. There is in Switzerland, and we have here, a cadet force which can be made a stepping-stone to adult training. The preparatory training of school boys between the ages of ten and fifteen will do much to fit them for the further training which they should be required to undergo at the age of eighteen. During that interval something might be done with a quasi-compulsory system- I mean a system under which some reward or some encouragement should be given to those who did submit themselves to it [44] inducing them to continue to do so. Then when a lad reached the period at which he would be liable for training, instead of having to serve forty days for three years, he would probably become so proficient during the first year that he would not be required to give up more than one quarter of the prescribed time in any subsequent year. The effect, too, of this training upon the physical health of the nation can hardly be exaggerated. Both here and in Great Britain-perhap s in Great Britainparticularly-ther e is a very great and obvious degeneration in the physique of the people. Perhaps it is due to the chaotic industrial system which prevails in both countries. But I am very sure that the physical training which men would get under the system which I have outlined would be' immensely beneficial to them-that it would re-act upon^the moral and mental sides of their nature, that it would make them better men, more effective citizens, more capable industrial units, better able to compete with foreign nations, and more alive to the duties of citizenship in which perhaps more than any other people, they f all short of perfection. I have heard a good deal of criticism in regard to the number of persons who record their votes at our elections. Their apathy in this respect can only result from a complete inability to appreciate the very great privileges of citizenship. These privileges are not sufficiently valued because they cost nothing. The duties of citizenship are entirely disregarded because of that fact. Every privilege ought to carry with it a correlative duty. The system which I have advocated would have a marked effect upon the morale, the phvsiaue, and the tone of the nation, and, I am satisfied, would do a great deal for us nationallv and industrially.",22

43,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Not at all. I believe in many of the objects of unionism, but I do not think that preference should be granted .to - unionists. The tinning of fish, I would point out, has been tried in different parts of Australia for many years, and the consensus of opinion, on the part of those who have engaged in the trade, is that it is absolutely valueless unless they tin a spurious article. If honourable members will refer to the debate which took place upon the Bounties B i ll during the last Parliament, they will find that when the Minister of Trade and Customs was asked what fish he thought would be tinned under the Government proposal, he replied that in New South Wales fish which were not sardines were being tinned as such. These fish, he said, were being palmed off upon the people of the Commonwealth as the true sardine. That was the only instance in which he thought the bounty would prove a success. I believe that the fish to which he referred were pilchards.",25
44,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVICE,What is the difference between the fish which were being tinned in New South Wales and sardines?,25
45,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I leave that to the honourable member to decide. The fact remains that we have no sardines in Australia. I wish that we had fish suitable for tinning purposes, but we cannot get away from the position as it exists.  ber give us the benefit of his professional knowledge by informing us what is the dif the ference between pilchards and sardines?",25
46,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,It is not the function of a medical man to decide the difference between pilchards and sardines. He has more important matters to attend to.,25
47,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVICE,Are not pilchards as good as sardines?,25
48,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is a question of dietetics. I .cannot answer it at the present moment. But if pilchards are as good as sardines, why not tin them under their proper name? Why not call them ""tinned pilchards"" instead of attempting to impose upon the public by inducing them to believe that they are eating the true sardine when they are really eating pilchards which have been preserved probably in cotton-seed oil?",25
49,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,May not the same statement be true in respect of imported fish?,25
50,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That may be so; but I have always shown myself desirous'of punishing persons who attempt to gull the people in the matter of their food supplies. One of the most important functions of government is to insure that the food supplies of the people-particularl y of the poorer classes- - are pure. I repeat that when this B i ll was under consideration in the last Parliament, the only instance which the Minister of Trade and Customs could cite in which the bounty was likely to exercise a beneficial effect was that of tinning pilchards.

57,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Ver y often.  not very philanthropic just now.,26
58,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I desire to be just, and to prevent a wasteful expenditure of the taxpayers' money. I take it that in the few cases in which fish are being tinned in Queensland, the work is in the hands of small companies. The industry is more or less a commercial success. Exactly similar operations are being conducted at Port Fairy and Warmambool. The honourable member for Wannon will perhaps know that it was the experience of the factory established at Port Fairy that it was useless to undertake the canning of fish unless a better class of fish were forthcoming. At that port and at Warmambool a large quantity of barracouta were tinned. But it was impossible to induce people to purchase these fish. I believe that the largest portion of the trade done by these factories was with the interior of Queensland and Western Australia.",26

Mr WILSON . ^ If that be so it is a pity that residents of the southern portion of the Continent are not afforded an opportunity of tasting them.  sistance of the honourable member and we will see that the people in the southern parts of the Continent are supplied with them.,26
60,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member wishes to squander the public money until the proposed bounty is exhausted, and then allow the industry to go the wall. Honourable members will recognise that, since we have canning factories in our electorates, it would be to the interest of the honourable member for Wannon and myself to support the granting of this bounty. I am satisfied, however, that although this might temporarily revive the industry, these factories would close down again as soon as the bounty closed. Barracouta, trumpeter, and other fish are to be found along the southern coast, and we have heard today [44]- 2 that other fish suitable for canning are also plentiful on the Queensland coast. The people, - however, prefer the imported tinned fish. Much has been said as to the . very large importations of fish, and if honourable members .had an opportunity of analyzing these importations, they would discover that they consist largely of fish that are not to be found in Australian waters. For the most part they comprise salmon, herrings, sardines, and bloaters, and, unfortunately, we have in Australian waters nothing to compare with them. It would be better for us to make an effort to stock our waters with fish suitable for canning than to spend money in this way. Mr Dannevig, the New South Wales fisheries expert, recently stated that Port Phillip, among other Australian bays, was eminently suitable for the establishment of hatcheries, with a view to the stocking of our waters with flounders, turbot, sole and other fish of that description. Such fish, however, .are not suitable for canning. Fish of the sardine and salmon type are most largely treated in that way. Having regard to the varieties of fish at present in our waters, there is no justification for this proposal.",26
61,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,We do not know what fish we have in Australian waters.,26
62,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member knows that from time to time efforts have been made in Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, and, I believe, to some extent in South Australia, to add to the varieties of fish to be found along our coasts, and that many attempts have been made by deep-sea fishing to discover new varieties. Many years ago a trawler was sent out to Victoria to fish in Bass Strait for new varieties, but the efforts of the crew were unsuccessful. When, as the result of creating hatcheries for stocking Australian waters with fish suitable for canning, we had secured a ' good supply of such fish along our coast, we might well be asked to grant bounties for the encouragement of the industry of fish canning, but I do not think the time is yet ripe for this proposal. I therefore move That the item be left out.",26
63,Mr ARCHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Capricornia) [4.7] - In speaking to the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I pointed out that fish canning had been undertaken in Queensland with a certain degree of success. Canneries have been started along the coast of that State, and have been carried on fox some time, but the great difficulty exciple perienced by those conducting these estabthe lishments has been that of securing a marthese, ket for their product. The trouble has been due to the inferiority of the fish availing able for canning purposes, because we have a number of excellent varieties along coast.",26
64,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,Mr Saville Kent pointed out that we have remarkably good fish along the Queensland coast.,27
65,Mr ARCHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is so. As honorlieve can be successfully established. able members are aware, many well-known brands of canned fish have been on the market for a number of years, and retailers naturally stock those for-which there is greatest demand. In these circumstances, it is difficult to place a new brand on market, and many obstacles bestrew the path of men with moderate capital who band themselves together with a view carrying on this industry. I should like this bounty to be granted with the object of assisting such men to place their proknow ducts on the market. It would help to tide them over a difficult time. I am satislian fied that the proposal is a justifiable and, as I said the other day, I think that, from the stand-point of defence alone, we should be quite justified in assisting our fisheries, since we should thus create a able recruiting ground for the manning of our future Australian Navy. The fishermen of England were originally the base Great Britain's naval strength. I heartily support this item.",27
66,Mr WYNNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Balaclava) [4.10] - As mentioned during the debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, the vernment of Victoria some years ago pended ,£230,000 by way of bounties for the encouragement of new industries. The fish-canning industry was among the numsufficient ber assisted in that way, but the effort proved unsuccessful, and I think that we should be guided by the experience of this State.",27
67,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,What sum was approwould priated for encouraging thefish-canninginflounders dustry ?,27
68,Mr WYNNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Speakin g from memory, it was a larger sum than is provided for this item.",27
69,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,Was it expended?,27
70,Mr WYNNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It was. Fish canneries were established in three towns, viz., Warmambool, Port Fairy, and Porthave land. They carried on for a short time, but with the cessation of the bounties, closed down. I aim in favour of the printhis of granting bounties, but think that Government, by pressing such items as are doing that which is .calculated not to prejudice the system). They are makrather too great a demand on their supporters, and those who wish to assist them the in building up new industries, by making proposals that must necessarily has involve a great waste of money. We should not grant bounties to assist industries which we have no reason to beI would point out, as one objection to this proposal, that those who can obtain fresh fish are not likely to eat canned fish. When the we have supplies for canning, we shall have plenty of fresh fish available in our the market. In country districts the canned fish most favoured are salmon, herrings, and sardines, all of which are unknown in> of Australian waters. Those who have seen the enormous hauls of salmon that are made at Vancouver and canned for export, will that it is unreasonable to anticipate that we shall be able to catch in ""Austrawaters the quantities of suitable fish one, necessary to insure success. From time to time, from eighty to one hundred trawlers, laden with tons of herrings, are to be seen entering different English ports. The posivalution is the same on the French coast, where large hauls of sardines are made, and along the coast of Newfoundland, where immense of quantities of cod are caught. These are the varieties of canned fish most favoured by the public. They have been tested and I have hit the public taste. At Port Fairy, large quantities of barracouta were canned, Goand were found to be more palatable than exwhen fresh. The public, however, prefer fresh fish, and barracouta is the only variety that we are likely to be able to catch in quantities for canning for exportpurposes. Reference is made in the report to catches of flounders and trumpeter. The last-named variety is a rich man's fish, and flounders may be similarly described. It be interesting to learn how many would be necessary to fill a can after they had been boned. The proposed bounty, I repeat, would be of no service io in the Australian fishing industry. It would not even be sufficient to advertise the industry. Thousands of pounds would have to be expended in advertising a new line in opposition to the well-known brands that long been on the. Australian market. In these circums'tances, therefore, it appears to me that it would be better to strike out item, and apply to the assistance of the. cotton industry the amount proposed to be - set apart under it . It would be preferable to add this sum of .£50,000 to some of the other bounties included in the schedule, rather than to waste it upon an undertaking which - every one must admit would be unsuccessful. I am told that in South Australia a factory was established for the canning of imullet - and other fish which could be caught in abundance; but that factory did not pay its way, owing to the fact that the public - refused to buy the product. Where people can get fresh fish they will not purchase canned fish; or if they take the latter they insist on tasty fish such as sardines or - salmon, which are better for canning purposes than any fish in Australia. Let us apply this money to developing the fish industry, so that fish may be placed on the market at a reasonable price, because, at the present time, people are complaining very much about the dearness of what ought to be an ordinary article of food. ought not to bring the system into disrepute by adopting such items as that before us, especially when a bounty on the manufacture of iron is so much required.",27
71,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE,And on ship-building.,28
72,Mr WYNNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I think that a bounty on ship-building is also a very good idea. If the Japanese can build ships in their country, I do not see why we should not be in immense benefit to Australia. able to build ships in Australia. Such - industry would give a large amount of ployment; and money ought not to be wasted on products which experience has shown cannot be successfully manufacdirection. tured.",28
73,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Fawkner) [4.17] I am in favour of bounties on well-selected items likely to result in the establishment of preceded me. industries; but I do not think that the now under consideration is likely to have - that result. I had an interest'in a facbe tory at Warmambool, where rabbits were ing trawling operations. - dealt with on a large scale; the fishermen, when they had an over - supply, used to bring their fish to .preserved. The trouble was, however, - that the people would not have the canned, fish, and it had to be sold at most remunerative prices. Distaste for the tralian canned fish might be got over in time, but we must have regard to the - present surroundings of the fishing indusgood try. There are fishermen in considerable numbers catching fish, but not supplying the market, and the prices are much higher than, they ought to be. In my opinion, the money for this item ought to be added to the £ 8 , 0 0 0 which has been voted for a trawler. I used to see nice paragraphs in the newspapers about this wonderful trawler, and I fancied that it was going to be a substantial addition to the Australian Navy. Nothing, however, appears to be doing in the matter now.",28
74,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Oh , yes.",28
75,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am very glad to have the assurance from the Postmaster General that the Commonwealth trawler has not entirely disappeared. Something ought to be done to encourage the important industry of fishing. As the honourable member for Corangamite pointed out, there ought to be hatcheries organized, and efforts made to improve the quality of the fish, not only on the coast, but in the inland rivers. As I say, I should be in favour of increasing the vote for the trawler, but I cannot see that the item We proposed would result in any permanent benefit to the industry. I am in favour of granting bounties to three or four industries which offer real promise of permanent success. Later on, we shall deal with the item of wool tops, which is connected, of course, with our great indust r y; and if the money now proposed for the canning industry were added to that for tops, it would, in my opinion, result There an are fishermen and manufacturers already emwithout a bounty; and I think the Minister would do well to withdraw the item, and expend the money in a more promising",28
76,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Lang) [4.20] - My views on this itemhave been very full y expressed by honourable members who have I endorse the opinion that item if this money is to be expended in connection with the fishing industry, it should in establishing hatcheries and extendI n America and there is a saying in regard to the fruit , "" We eat what we can, and we can what be we can't;"" and it may be that the same will in the future apply to Australia. The information in the report on this item is unvery meagre, - although the experts enAuslarge on the advantages of encouraging the fishing industry generally. The report speaks of the value of the trawler, and the work it is going to do, with the possibility that our supplies of fish may be greatly augmented. It is a sound contention that this money would be better expended in developing the fishing industry in some other direction than that of canning; at any rate, there is nothing in the report to justify this item, for if you must first catch your hare before you can cook it, you must also first catch your fish, and the right kind of fish, too, before you can can it.",28
77,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wentworth) [4.23] - Like other honourable members, I cannot find in the report any satisfying information. For instance, we are told a good deal about the advantages of deep-sea fishing; but all the deep-sea fishing that I know on the coasts of Australia, with the exception of that for mullet, and, sometimes, barracouta, is line-fishing. Surely line-fishing for canning purposes would never pay. The position clearly proves that before we start' to make arrangements for a canning industry, we ought to be quite sure we have the fish to can. I suggest to the Minister the advisability of granting this bounty, if he must grant it, in an indirect way. Let the Attorney-General, if he so desires, add this money to the £ 8 , 0 0 0 already provided on the Estimates for trawling operations. By that means, the fishing grounds of Australia could be explored, and honourable members would be provided with sufficient data to enable them to intelligently deal with the subject. We are asked to provide no less than £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . a year for a considerable period; and I ask whether we ought to do so without further data than that before us ? I do not think that we can be so false to our trust as to do anything of the kind. 'Surely it is getting more than a joke when we can pass appropriations of the public funds for hare-brained schemes of this character. My constituency borders the sea, and contains a number of fishermen, who, I feel sure, would be the first to ridicule a proposal to can the fish caught in the seas about Port Jackson-expensiv e fish caught by deep-line fishing. These fishermen would be the first to realise, the absurdity of any project of the kind, and, as taxpayers, they would resent the encroachment on the public purse. The Attorney-General should have told us why it is necessary to provide so large an amount. This item is the largest in the list; and., appropriately enough, it is the item about which there is least' information. Do we always pass these measures by contraries? Are we to pass this large amount simply because it is unexplained ? The Committee must be forgetting its duty to the public of Australia, as the trustees of the public purse, if we pass a large annual payment of this character without further information thai* that before us.",29
78,Mr WILS ON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Corangamite) [4.25] - There are two or three points which honourable members have not noted in reference to the industry of canning fish. We were told by the honourable member for Capricornia that this item, if passed, would be of great benefit to fishermen, and would create a class of longshore men on the northern coast of Australia. If that were the result, it would be of great service; but, according, to clause 3, sub-clause 2, it is prpvided that the manufacturer shall be deemed to be the producer, and the-bounty shall be paid to the manufacturer only. It will be seen, therefore, that this £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 for five years', will not go to the' fishermen, but to the manufacturers. In the case of the' Warmambool factory, the bounty would go to the manufacturer, and so at Port Fairy, while in the case of the Portland factory, the money would go to an. English firm who carry on the business. We know that fishermen all over Australia are, unfortunately, a very poor and deserving class; and they should be encouraged in every way. When they docatch any fish, they can always get a market.",29
79,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Can they?,29
80,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There are exceptional! instances in which the fishermen get large hauls of barracouta, which have to be thrown away; but if the honourable member for Gippsland had his choice betweencanned barracouta and canned salmon, which would he take? We do not desire by means of this Bill to give bounties to industries which have proved admitted failures in the paSt. Let us first proceed with our trawling operations, and develop the fish industry, so as to create better classes of fish. When we have done that, and our waters are teeming with fish, as are the waters of other countries, it will be time enough to talk of a bounty for canning. By that time, however, there will be any amount of capital forthcoming to start the industry.",29
81,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [4.30] - I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. With all due respect to the opinions which have beenexpressed, I say that the fish preserving industry is deserving of all the encouragement that we can give to it. The development of the Australian fisheries is to some extent: a. complicated matter, because the States have territorial jurisdiction within their boundaries, while the Commonwealth has jurisdiction in all Australian waters. The - matter was discussed at the last Conference of Premiers. We are intrusted with matters appertaining to defence, and, therefore, the Government take the view that we should encourage an occupation which will create a hardy 'body of men whose services would be of the greatest value in time of national trouble. For defence reasons alone we think it highly desirable to encourage the fishing industry. I believe in the Lytton district, in Queensland, the fishermen have proved themselves splendidly fitted for naval defence, while at Queenscliff, in Victoria, fishermen are enrolled in the Defence Force. Australia will have to look more and more to her coastal defence, and we must do what we can to encourage the creation of a body of fishermen who will best serve us in time of need. In 1906, the Commonwealth imported preserved fish in tins to a value of ^310,656.",29
82,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,What sort of fish?,30
83,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Mostl y sardines, herrings, and salmon.",30
84,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The varieties imported are not mentioned in the official return. The importation from the United Kingdom was valued at £119,000; that from Canada at £38,000; that from Germany at .£13,000; that from Portugal at £15,000'; and that from the United States of America at £94,280. Those figures show that in Australia there is a large demand for fish, and, as honourable members will recollect, during the drought the possibility of obtaining a cheap fish supply for our poorer classes became a matter of serious moment. The fish supply of South Africa, before a trawler was engaged to explore the adjoining waters, was very limited; but now large supplies are available. The Commonwealth arrangements for trawling are practically complete. The Government is acting upon the advice of Mr Dannevig, amongst others. Mr Dan-nevig is not only one of the best fish experts in Australia, but has also a European reputation, and I am glad that our consultations in regard to the trawler have given us an opportunity to appreciate his capacity. He informed me, in a conversation which I had with him relative to the preparation of this item, that he believes that the trawler will discover large sources - of fish supply, the existence of which has been indicated by the researches which have already been made. The Government desires to encourage the people of the Commonwealth to take advantage of those resources. Ministers hope that the result of the bounty will be that large numbers of men will engage in deep sea fishing, and that considerable employment will be given in connection with the canning of fish. The President of the New South Wales Fisheries Commission statesWith regard to seine fishery, the sea mullet, the pilchard, the herring, mackerel, and garfish abound in countless millions. The question of the supply of fish available for the industry is not open to dispute. Mr Dannevig concurs in that statement. As regards Queensland, Mr Saville Kent, who is admittedly a man of high attainments, has made this reportQueensland possesses a fish fauna remarkable both for the abundance of its species and for the structural variety of its constituents. All told, the number of combined marine and fresh-water species authoritatively recorded up to date falls but little short of goo. In other words, it embraces two-thirds of the entire marine and freshwater fish fauna of the Australian Continent. Out of the foregoing total number, over 300 species may be classified as of more or less value for human food. They present almost unlimited possibilities of profitable employment. The waters abound with shoals of fish akin to the European mackerel, herring, anchovy, and pilchard, which up to the present date have been literally allowed to run to waste.",30
85,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,At the present time many poor people cannot afford to buy fish.,30
86,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,I do not think that fish can be said to be the food of the poorer classes in Australia.,30
87,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is because of the action of a combine. In Melbourne tons of fresh fish are sometimes destroyed. 1 Mr .GROOM - That is an unfortunate occurrence, but we hope, by increasing competition, and opening up new sources of supply, to make fish more generally available to our people. The honourable member for Corangamite doubts whether we possess large supplies of fish, but the statements which I have read shouldconvince him that there are immense stores of useful fish in Australian waters. According to the reportOn the coasts of Tasmania and Victoria, such, fish as trumpeter, trevally, barracouta, kingfish, rock cod, flounder, and many others are caught in abundance, and owing to the absence of fish curing establishments, large quantities are at times wasted, or are merely utilized as manure. There are now known to exist in Tasmanian waters some of the best edible fish that we possess, and possibly the trawler will discover and make available still further supplies. Great efforts are. made . in most countries to encourage the fishing industry, by establishing hatcheries, employing trawlers, and giving financial assistance. Australia is one of the last countries to take action in this matter.",30

91,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,I hope that it will be built in Australia. Mr Wines - There is only one place where it should be built.,31
92,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The zeal which the honourable member has shown in his advocacy of protection almost entitles him to claim that it should be built in the electorate of Dalley. In the United Kingdom, 106,000 persons are engaged in the fishing industry; in France, 147,000; in Italy, 100,000; in Norway, 120,000; in the United States, 210,000; and in Japan, 2,500,000. Japan has become one of the - naval powers of the world.",31
93,Mr WYNNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Has the Minister ever seen fish tinned in Japan?,31
94,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have not had the pleasure of visiting Japan. Strong efforts are being made in all countries to encourage the fishing industry, and it behoves us in Australia to .take similar action. We should do all we can to stimulate an industry which .will breed up a race of men who will be at the service of the country in the' hour of national peril, and one which must prove of great commercial value.",31
95,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Dallev) [4.44] - I have already spoken of the Minister as a special pleader, and in listening to his various speeches, I have found that he invariably describes the proposals in the schedule as essential to the development of the most useful industry we could establish. That impresses one as a very fine phrase when it is heard for the first time. But the Attorney-General has used it in connection with every item with which we have dealt-and there are eighteen of them. He further stated that' the effect of the bounty would be the production of a number of hardy men who would man our navy in the hour of danger. So that' it now. appears that the naval policy of the Government is represented by a proposal to grant a bounty upon tinned fish.. According to theAttorney-General that is the only way ire which we can secure a trustworthy navafi ""force in time of national emergency. May I point out to him that this bounty is intended to develop the canning industry, and* in that business the soldering iron is the only implement handled by the employees. .These individuals, I presume, by constant use of the soldering iron, are to be transformed into the brave jack-tars of the Australian Navy. The Attorney-General went further, and touched upon the commercial' aspect of this proposal. Apparently he thought that if he could show that millions of pounds could be made out of the canned? fish industry I would support this proposal. But I would remind him that the fishmongers of the old world are one of thewealthiest corporations in Great Britain, and if the prospects of the industry had? been in any way alluring they would have embarked upon it long ago. The honourable member for Fawkner has been looking after well-earned interest in the fishing industry, but, so far, has failed to find it. The Attorney-General went a little further, and quoted the views of certain experts upon piscatorial matters, including those of Mr Farnell, the Chairman of the Fisheries Commission of New South Wales. That gentleman is an enthusiastic fisherman. While serving in theNew South Wales Parliament some years ago, he visited Great Britain for the express; purpose of floating a company to exploit Australian waters for the canning of fish. He endeavoured to induce the fishmongers of Great Britain to invest their money here, but without success. Then at his own expense he conducted trawling experimentsoutside Sydney Heads, and for a couple of"" hundred miles upon either side of it, but the results were .very unsatisfactory. The Government have not yet even called for tenders for the construction of the proposed' trawler for the Commonwealth service.",31

97,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The place where thetrawler is constructed does not interest me. I am not an advocate of the claims of Mort's Dock. That particular firm does not require any State assistance. I know that it charges very high rates for any work that it undertakes. That statement, I hope, will dispose of the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Parkes. Thefir m to which he has referred fights me every possible occasion, and I fight it. the honourable member for Corangamite has already pointed out, the proposed bounty would not find its way into the pockets the sturdy fishermen, and I am not disposed to sanction this expenditure simply upon the statement of the Attorney-General. really desires to build up a class of sturdv sons of the sea, the way to do it is not available. i>v voting £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 to operatives who round the edges of a tin can with a solderfish, ing iron.

That combine is intent upon maintaining prohigilded bitive prices, and would rather allow tons of fish to be wasted than permit the masses - of the people to be supplied with a cheap article. In my opinion, the Government would be better engaged in framing a Bil to break down combines of that character, not sardines. so inimical to the interests of the people.",31
98,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,There are plenty of places in Australia where the people cannot obare tain fresh fish.,32
99,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I admit that. The Attorney-General has stated that ,£300,000 worth of fish are annually imported the Commonwealth, of which ,£120,000 worth come from Great Britain. For sake of securing the bounty under consideration, he practically asks honourable memmers to stop the importation of that . Balmain works ? .£120,000 worth of fish of British origin. Yet we shall probably hear him in the not his arguments distant future dilating upon the desirableput ness of cementing the ties which bind to the mother land, and declaiming in favour of preferential trade. I maintain that if there had been any prospect of the to follow the usual course. tinned-fish industry proving a success Australia, private enterprise would have embarked upon it long ago. I admit that bounty recommended. I have not read the report of the experts who inquired into this matter, and I do not What do they tell us in this case ? propose to do so. The honourable member for Gippsland told us, in a very loud tone of voice, that that document was f u l information. He specially referred - to a and popular way. Mr Jackson, who he said was an expert from New South Wales. I will undertake on the tables of the people? to say That not a single representative that State has ever heard Mr Jackson's - name before. When I made inciuiries to who he was, the only information which I could obtain was that he was probably the son of Mrs Jackson. I repeat that upon class of fish to be found along the AusAs tralian coast is not suitable for canning. I ask you, sir, if your gastronomic taste could ever be tempted by tinned schnapper? ot You, Mr Chairman, have the welfare of your constituents at heart, and must recognise that many of them, living as they do, in If he the interior, would forget the taste of fish but for the supplies of tinned fish that are For the most part, the people fly living inland, and unable to obtain fresh prefer tinned herrings, salmon, and But, as cana matter of fact, the genuine sardine is rarely seen'here. It never goes beyond the rich man's table, and usually occupies a prominent place on the supper tables of the youths who frequent - Piccadilly. The so-called sardines that are sold largely in Australia may be identical with our mullet or with the sprats caught off the coast of Norway, but whether they come l fiom Norway or France they are certainly . I wish to treat the arguments of the Attorney-General with all deference, but must say at once that they not sufficient to induce me to vote for this item.",32
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Parramatta) [5.3]. - I have been listening to some of the into fishy arguments of my honourable friend, who has just resumed his seat, and am the bound to say that I agree with them.",32
101,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,Wit h those relating to the,32
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I agree with all It seems to me that he has forward a contention which ought to be us answered by the Government before this item is agreed to. The report of the Conference upon the fish-canning industry seems The less that in can be said in favour of a bounty the more cordially is the granting of a substantial That seems to be the rule which the experts have adopted. They simply say that there is a difficulty in catching fish along the Australian' coast, and in l of placing them before the. people in a cheap Is this bounty likely to assist to facilitate the placing of fresh fish Will it help from them to obtain supplies of fresh fish more fieely than they can at present? The way as in which the people are at present supplied with fish is not a great credit to the Commonwealth. If the Attorney-General could the show that, as the result of this bounty, a means of increasing the facilities for the supply of fresh fish to the people would be devised, I, for one, would vote for it without the slightest compunction. But this proposal will not do anything in that direction. Some bounties for the disposal of our surplus fruits, the manufacture of our cotton, and the distribution, upon a profitable basis, of other products of that kind, have been provided. There is some reason for the application of a bounty to such purposes in a Bounties Bill, but although we are told by the experts that there is a dearth of fish to meet the necessities of our own people, we have before us a proposal to grant a bounty on fish, canned, and preserved, so that they may be sent to other countries. This is not the way in which to expend a large sum of money. Then why has the canning of fish been singled out for so large a bounty ? I think that the appropriation to be made in connection with this item is the largest provided for in the schedule. We are asked to devote £50,000 to the payment of bounties to encourage the canning of fish, and yet the great trouble in Australia is that 1 we cannot obtain the necessary supplies for canning purposes. We have already voted a sum of £8,000 for the purchase of a deep-sea trawler. That expenditure was agreed to nearly twelve months ago, and the proposal is a very proper one. I should like to know, however, what has. been done in connection with the experiment. It seems to me that we are as near to the obtaining of a trawler as we were when we agreed to the vote. Had there been the slightest disposition to embark upon this profitable field of enterprise, the trawler would have been .in operation before today, and a goodly portion of our coast-line would already have been explored. Having regard to our engineering works, it should not be difficult to secure a trawler worth £8,000. Minister and others are constantly telling us of the dearth of employment in the engineering trade, and yet notwithstanding all the facilities for ship-building in Australia, no attempt appears to have been made to proceed with the construction) of a - trawler, authorized practically twelve months ago. This indicates a want of enterprise on the part of the Government in respect of an industry which they profess so strong a desire to encourage. There is a great deal in the report of the experts as to the value of fresh fish as a food, and as to its commercial value in various countries, but there is only an incidental referMr Josefh Cook. ence to the canning industry. Any one reading the report would come to the conclusion that the problem that confronts usin this connection relates, not to the preservation! of surplus fish supplies, but to theobtaining of the fresh fish necessary as a food for the people of Australia. We need! to take action very speedily in this direction. In some of the suburbs of Sydney, planted directly on the sea-shore, fish today are as dear as they are 100 miles from where they are caught. There is something wrong about such a condition of affairs. Those who know anything of the suburbs of Sydney will confirm my statement in this regard. I believe that fresh fish are not cheap today in any part of Australia, and the fishermen are not toowell paid. If fish is to be pressed intothe service of the people as an article of"" diet in the way that it is used in other countries, the processes of distributing it will have to be cheapened very materially.. To vote £50,000 for the canning and preserving of fish in these circumstances would be to agree to an absolute waste of public money. It would be an expenditure justifiable from no point of view. I cannot imagine what has prompted the Government to rush to the assistance of this industry in the way proposed. In my judgment, we can never succeed unless we start at the beginning, and, instead of proposing a bounty in connection with the treatment of the surplus of an industry, endeavour to stimulate the fisheries themselves.. Our first requirement is a supply of freshfish. We may very well leave the canning and tinning of fish until we have an abundance of surplus to treat in that way. ' This shows what an ill-digested mass of proposals we have before us. I hope that the item will be struck out, and that the Committee will agree inThe this way to save an expenditure of £50,000 of the money of the people. If the Government mean to spend this money in an effort to make fish more available to the people, surely they can devise a simple scheme to stimulate the distribution of the fish. We are told in the report that in Canada there are 73,000 personsengaged in fisheries. We cannot hope to succeed to the same extent, since we have not at hand such markets as they have. Thefishermen of Canada have the great British market as well as those of the United. States and the Continent of Europe to exploit. We can never hope to compete with them so far as fresh, or even canned, fish are concerned. That being so, the figures in the report are misleading, in"" so far they are made to apply to Australia. repeat that the great problem before us how to secure a sufficient quantity of fresh fish at a reasonable rate for the tables .the people. Fish today for the working man of Australia is a luxury. The passing of this item, instead of overcoming the ficulty, would involve an absolute waste of money.",32
103,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) canning ,[5.14] - I am deeply concerned about the attitude of the Opposition. Our honourable friends opposite are so adept at opposing - each and every proposition submitted the Government, that when their turn comes to occupy the Treasury benches, I should not be surprised to find them opposing some of their own measures. The Governance. ment find it impossible to obtain from them an) support for a proposal to establish new industry. On the one hand, they tell us that an item in the schedule relates to an industry that has never been tested, and that we have ho evidence that be successful, whilst on the other, a proposed bounty is designed to assist a. struggling industry, we are assured by that the industry is in reality . lished and needs no bounty to assist it. If an industry has declined in the absence of any support or encouragement, it is to have proved itself unworthy .of assistdesire ance. But honourable members seem to get that the underlying idea of a bounty or bonus is the encouragement of an dustry which is languishing under the sent system of competition in the commersmoked, cial world. We know, of course, that ordinary housewife, when she purchases tinned fish, has to decide on salmon, dines, or herrings. But that is because tralian tinned fish has not been placed the market in sufficient quantities, and sufficient length of time, to allow a for it to be cultivated. In the case whisky, or any other article of commerce, when it is placed on the market for the time, it has to be continuously advertised and kept before the public if a demand to be created. Of course, we know this canning industry has been tried failed ; but that was really through the of a bounty to tide it over the initial culties. I do not profess to be a man any great business ability, although were to enter into any new enterprise morrow I should not expect it to prove cess for one year, or possibly, three but if my capital were sufficient, I could as hold out, and perhaps ultimately create a I fair business concern. Of course, in such is a case I should get no Government assistance; but fish is a very necessary article of of food, and if its preservation could be made an Australian industry, it would be of great benefit to the Commonwealth as a difwhole. In Victoria there are times when, unfortunately, the fish market is glutted and catches have to be destroyed. If there were ' facilities in the seaport towns a fresh outlet would be open to the fisherman, and the salesmen, who at present are spoiling the industry, would feel the salutary effects of by competition. There is hardly a successful industry in Australia today, including the great mining industry, that has not, at some time or other, received State assistIn view of the fact that the consumption of fish is large, and that the creaa tion of a taste for Australian fish is poswill sible, I shall support the item:",34
104,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Corio) [5.20] - Will the Attorney-General consent to smoked fish it will being included in the item ? if - Mr GROOM - The ' honourable member them for Gwydir made a similar suggestion, but well estabI am not able to agree to it.",34
105,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Then I shall have to ask the Committee to see if they cannot said induce the Government to give way. My is that the amendment before the forCommittee should be withdrawn, in order, that I may move that after the word "" preinserved "" the words "" in tins or casks"" be preomitted, so as to allow the item to embrace dried and other preserved fish. the The report of the Conference of Experts largely supports the view I take of this saritem. Who are the experts who recommend Ausus to give this large bounty on the tinning on of fish? I do not know Mr H . V. Jackfor a son, and, I suppose that Dr Holtze is the taste botanical expert at the Adelaide Gardens. of Then we have Dr Cherry, who is a lecturer on butter for the Agricultural Departfirst ment of Victoria. I do not know what Dr Cherry's knowledge is of fish, or how he is comes to be able to recommend this large that expenditure in connection with it. Acand cording to the report, the experts suggest want the tinning of fish which cannot be tinned. diffiThe experts tell us that on the coasts of of Tasmania and Victoria trumpeter, trevally, if I barracouta, and rock cod can be found. toNow, rock cod cannot be caught in nets, a sucbut must be caught by line, and the years; catches, therefore, are so small as to be useless for canning purposes. The report goes on to say that these fish are caught in abundance, and that owing to the absence of canning establishments, large quantities are wasted. It is because of the presence of enormous quantities of barracouta on our coasts that I shall ask the Committee to accept the amendment I have, foreshadowed. Occasionally there is a large glut on the Victorian market, and at - Queenscliffe, Geelong, and Port Fairy thousands of barracouta have to be thrown into the sea simply because it does not pay to send them to Melbourne. Fishermen have from time to time endeavoured to carry on smoking operations, and they would meet with much success if it were - not that they cannot afford the initial capital. I hope that the Attorney-General will not tell me that my amendment would only lead to the creation of numerous small industries, because one of my main reasons for submitting it is that it will encourage the establishment of a large number, of small co-operative smoked-fish factories in the smaller fishing towns. If that be not the result of this bounty, then - the money will simply go into the pockets of one large' manufacturing firm, and the fishermen will reap no benefit. It is small industries that have made Switzerland the prosperous country it is today. There, in addition to the daily labour of.the head of the household, in every home there is carried on a small industry. We do not desire to have all the manufacturing and industrial pro-' cesses centralized in the capital cities of the States, but rather that they should be spread over the Commonwealth, and thus add to the prosperity of the seaside towns. The Attorney-General was gratified to think that cotton could be grown by small farmers; and he will make a great mistake if he does not accept this chance to develop small co-operative smoked-fish factories.",34

The honourable member for Dalley spoke at some length, and with some force, as anopponent of the bounty on fish, but I find that at an earlier stage he saidThere are one or two industries in Australia, such as the fisheries industry, the establishment of which those who believe in the bountv system misrht advocate with some degree of reason. Of course, we expect the Opposition to haggle over proposals made from this side, but when, after considerable waste of time, they press questions to a division, they are found to have only six or seven votesThe honourable member also spoke of the application of the bounty system to, amongst other industriesDeep-sea fisheries, in connection with which it might meet with some success. Later on, in forecasting the position which he might take up, he saidA political Ishmaelite is one who fights for his own hand, and if I find honourable members, advocating the claims of producers in their electorates, it may be taken for granted that themember for Dalley, who does not, as the members of the Labour Party insinuated, fight in his own personal. interests, will, on every occasion, see that the industries in which his constituentsare engaged are not neglected. That, of course,, is a most miserable position to have to take up, but I find honourable member after honourable member on both sides of the House showing, by their speeches that, when any proposed legislation suits their own constituent's, they say goodbye to principles, and I should be a traitor to my trust if I did not look after the interests of those who sent me here. The honourable member has a large number of constituents who are interested in fishing, yet now opposes the proposed encouragement to the industry. I rose merely to point out that the time of the Committee is being wasted by unnecessary arguments, and to draw attention to the ridiculous and inconsistent position in which many of the members of the Opposition have placed themselves.",35
107,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wentworth) [5.33] - The remarks which we have just heard from the honourable member for Cook are unbecoming to one who addresses the Committee with a smile of self-satisfaction and amusement. We realise that he did not mean what he said; but, unfortunately, the smug smile which indicated his inborn sense of humour cannot be transcribed in the pages of Hansard; and lest his words may create misapprehension in the minds of those who read his speech, I have risen to say' that, in resisting encroachments upon the public revenue, the members of the Opposition are actuated only by the highest motives. It is with these that we are prepared to credit the honourable member and our opponents.  year Parliament voted the sum of £8,000 for the purchase and equipment of a trawler to open up our fishing grounds. It is believed that the waters of Australia contain vast stores of very valuable food supplies; but the proposal to vote -£10,000 a vear, for a period of five years, for the encouragement of the canning of fish, seems to me to be prematureThe granting of a bounty to this industry should be deferred until trawling operaassist tions have made it certain that our waters possess fish suitable for canning, and quantities sufficient to justify the proposed expenditure.",35
108,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yarra) [ 5 . 3 7 ] - I underof stand that the. smoking of fish is an dustry now in existence, and that many hawkers smoke the fish which they are unable to sell during their daily rounds, and cannot keep until the next day, well as such fish as they may buy very cheaply when the market is glutted. believe, too, that many fish are destroyed in the places where they are caught, being sent to town. To my mind, possibilities of the fish-canning industry better than those of the fish-smoking try ; but it remains to be discovered whether we have fish as suitable for canning as those which are imported from other countries.

111,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes . But the honourable member knows What an immense coastline Australia has. On all parts of the coast, men are engaged in smoking fish, and if a bounty were offered for the production of smoked fish, it might be necessary in their interests to appoint excise officers at all these places. However, there is a constitutional obiection to the amendment suggested by the honourable and learned member for Corio, in that it would extend the area over which the bountv would payable.

If any proposal be adopted, that word will cover smoked or dried fish, or fish preserved in tins or casks. I am assured by those who have had experience in the biche-de-mer industry that if a bounty were offered for drying that article, the Japanese would be driven out of a very profitable industry by white labour, and the Commonwealth would be largely benefited. That, I suggest, is one way in which we might play up to our White Australia ideal. I understand that the Attorney-General has stated that my proposal would lead to a lot of small men engaging in the preserved fish industry.",37

I should like to see the cases mentioned by the honordefine able and learned member for Corio and the to the amendment. honourable member for Wannon met. To my mind, the difficulties outlined by Attorney-General might be overcome by stipulating that the bounty shall not payable unless the fish are presented in cerwill - tain quantities for the purposes of examinaof tion and checking. I admit that it would be quite impossible for the Government initiate a system of paying bounties to every fisherman along the coast of Austrawho lia. But the fishermen engaged in parclose ticular centres might easily form a operative association, and agree to smoke their surplus fish.",38

I trust, there fore, that he will.accept the amendment.",38
156,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Kooyong) [6.1] - I am opposed to the item as it stands, and wish to the attitude that I take up in regard If the item is to be carried, I think that the proposal made by the the honourable Jand learned member for Corio is one that deserves consideration. be The proper distribution of these bounties necessarily involve the creation of a lot administrative machinery. Regulations will be necessary to safeguard the system, to and I think this is shown by the fact that it has been suggested that the fish hawker returns home with his barrow at the of the day and proceeds to cure, by cosmoking, the fresh fish that he has been unable to sell, should be entitled to claim bounty in respect of the fish so treated. I do not think that a case has been made. It certainly would not lead to the establishment of the industry upon anything like a satis-' factory basis. A much larger sum would fisherbe _ necessary. The total of £50,000 which it is proposed to expend in connection with this item would be sufficient only to assist those engaging in the industry along It certainly would not be anything like enough to establish be the industry on a sound basis in every upon State. Some time ago I was approached by. persons who desired me to take part in a scheme to assist the fishing inin the southern parts of Tasmania, diffiwhere large hauls of fish are sometimes It was demonstrated, however, that it would be impossible to make a finansuccess of the undertaking without large expenditure. This bounty would not be sufficient to give adequate assistance to the industry in Tasmania, to say nothing of the fisheries in the other States. pared to support the proposal made by the honourable and learned member for Corio, because if we-are to pass the item, I do not see why the bounty should not apply to the preservation of fish in the manner indicated by him. But if a division is taken on the whole item, I shall certainly vote against it.",38
157,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Parkes) [6.5] Although I have not been in attendance throughout this debate, I have heard sufficient to enable me to form one or two opinions which I think are worthy of expression. It has been contended that if the words "" in tins, or casks'' were omitted from the item, a great many men having surplus supplies of fish would be able to claim the bounty. I would point out, however, that apart from the mysterious regulations which are spoken of in such cryptic phraseology, it would be just as easy for a man to secure the bounty under the item as it stands as it would be if those words were struck out. All that a man desirous of claiming the bounty would have to do would be to fill casks with, say, barracouta, and, producing them to the officer administering the Act, say to him, "" Here are preserved fish in casks, and I claim bounty upon them."" It would be unnecessary for him to close the cask or even tin the fish he had preserved, and therefore the omission of these words would not make the provision any wider. I wish to draw attention to the extraordinary form in which this Bill is framed. As it stands, the Bill will enable the Government to scramble half a million of money in any way they please. The Committee may be misled by the heading to the fourth column of this schedule, which reads, "" Maximum amounts which may be paid in any one year.'' When we turn to the body of the Bill , however, we find that it gives the Minister unlimited and unconditional power to make regulations to so increase or reduce the amounts appearing in that column; that he could, if he chose, devote the total appropriation of £ 5 3 0 , 0 0 0 to any one of these items, - and neglect the rest. There is no escape from that conclusion. If the Minister thinks that there is, I should like him to point it out to the Committee. One would naturally conclude, from the heading to the fourth column of the schedule, that ;£io,ooo is the maximum amount which may be paid in any one year in respect of a bounty on preserved fish; but when we turn to clause 9, I am pre- paragraph a, we find that it provides thatThe Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed or are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for giving effect to this 'Act, and in particular for any of the following purposes :(a) For varying the amounts set out in the fourth column of the First Schedule as the maximum amount of bounty payable in respect of any goods. I assert, as a lawyer, that there is absolutely nothing in this Bill to prevent the Minister, by means of regulations, from giving £ 5 ° ; ° o o o r £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 under the most insignificant item in this schedule. When some of my honourable friends have had, as I have had, a political experience extending over twenty-five years, they will recognise that this practice of giving a Minister power to make regulations by which he can stultify the opinions of Parliament, as expressed by its approval of a definite schedule such as this, should be abolished. I should like to point out that we have already struck out from the schedule four items-thos e relating to olives, palm fruit , peanuts, and sunflower seeds-cover ing a proposed total expenditure of £ 1 1 7 , 0 0 0 , out of the total appropria-' tion of £ 5 3 0 , 0 0 0. Honourable members may imagine that we have thus reduced the amount at the disposal of the Government to £ 4 1 3 , 0 0 0 , but we have done nothing of the kind.",39
158,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have promised to recommit clause 2, which provides for the total appropriation, in order that proportionate reductions may be made.",39
159,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am very glad to hear that statement. The Minister, however, still retains power to make regulations, by which he can distribute the total appropriation of £ 4 1 3 , 0 0 0 as he pleases over these different items.",39
160,Mr JH CATTS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Did not the honourable and learned member take similar powers in connection with Bills introduced by him as a member of a State Administration ?,39
161,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"When I was Minister of Public Works and Colonial Treasurer in New South Wales, I never had a Bill of this kind in my charge.",39
162,Mr JH CATTS,PUBLIC SERVICE,But did not the honourable and learned member take power to make regulations under various Bills?,39

It was never intended, I take it , that we should schedule fixing a maximum for each. of these items, and that, at the same time, Minister should have power to make lations which we shall never see, and not possibly negative.",40

170,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"What is the considering good of stating in the schedule that these are the maximum amounts, when that is not the meaning of the Bill ?",40
171,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,There is a discretion lowed to the Ministry to transfer from one item to another.,40
172,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"What does the honourable and learned member mean? Does he mean that we are to waste our time in surveying a series we are told, represent the maximum amounts, whilst, at the same time, those similar circumstances. figures, are rendered worthless, by giving the Minister the power to render nugatory the whole of .them?",40

178,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member does not help his argument by pointing out that a wrong practice has been followed in previous years. This is not a a necessary discretion. If the Bill declared that we were taking power to allocate 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 among industries at the discreI tion of the Ministry, we should know what we were doing. But when we are told that the these are the maximum amounts on each item, while, at the same time, there is power alter .them by regulation, it is making a fool of the Committee.

It must be patent that we have wasted much time in this schedule. In regard to fish or any other commodity I am against the granting of a bounty; but as it is possible this item may be passed, I shall support althe amendment, which is less objectionable amounts than the original proposal.",40

183,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Angas) [6.20] - I suggest that the point raised by the honourable and learned member for Parkes might be got over by providing that the regulations shall"" not come into .force until after they have been laid before both Houses of ParliaWe have power to disallow regulations, but the difficulty is that the regulations come into force before they are laid himbefore Parliament. If a date is not specified in the regulations at which they are' to take effect, 'they take effect from the date of their notification in the Gazette. But we could prescribe under clause 9 that the regulations shall not take effect at an earlier date than that on which they have been laid before Parliament, or we could say that they should not take effect until fourteen days have elapsed after they have been placed before both Houses. In such case, according to the Acts Interpretation Act, it would be competent for any honourable member during the fourteen days to fable a motion disallowing the regulations. According to section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act of 1904,. regulations are to be laid before Parliament, and they take effect from the date of their notification in the Gazette. If either House passes a resolution, of which notice has been given, within fifteen days arfter the regulations have been laid before each House, disallowing them, they cease to have effect. I suggest that no date be specified for the coming into force of the regulations until Parliament has had an opportunity, under the section to which I have just referred, to express its opinion as to whether or not they shall take effect. We should then see whether any substantial addition had been made to the maximum prescribed in each case. The House would thus be able to check the expenditure, and, at the same time, it would save the policy of' the Minisreasonable try, which is to allow alterations to be made without the introduction of a new Bill in every case.",40
184,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"South Sydney) [6.23] I had not the advantage of hearing all the remarks of the honourable member, for 1 Parkes, but, coming from one who is usually accurate, or within a reasonable degree of accuracy, I must say that the latter portion of his speech somewhat surprised me. Considering the length of time the honourable member has been in Parliament, he should be aware that under the Audit Act there is power, in regard to the Estimates, to transfer votes from one item in a subdivision to another.",41
185,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have admitted that that has been the practice for years, and I say that it is a wrong practice.",41

193,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not expect the honourable member to agree; but, in my view, it is a very necessary practice. It is inevitable that in framing Estimates a number of possibilities may be overlooked, and, therefore, there must be some trust placed in the hands; of the Executive; and I regard it as a discretion within certain limits.",41
194,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Would the honourable member say that fish and mchair were in the same sub-division ?,41
195,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not arguing as to the technical possibilities under this particular Bill, but I object to the suggestion of the honourable member for Parkes that the practice as a whole is a bad one. It is a practice which must be followed if we are to have Executive Government; or, otherwise, the Treasurer's advance account, which is only another form of trusting the Executive, will have to be much larger.",41
196,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member for Wentworth has just pointed out that under the practice it would be possible to divert a bounty from fish to mchair.,41
197,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not know that there would be any very great danger in that. The general policy of rendering assistance to industries by way of bounties is followed, and the rate per lb., or the rate per unit, as set out in the schedule, will not be exceeded. The sum total voted to may be exceeded, but the proportion per unit cannot be altered Therefore, in my opinion, the Committee are not parting with any large measure of their liberty in assenting^ to the practice of transferring from one item to another.",41
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Parramatta) [6.25] - This Bill differs very materially from the general Estimates, in so far as every item in the schedule is a separate and distinct Department, a separate and distinct sub-division, a separate and distinct appropriation. While it may be very proper under the Audit Act to transfer votes within a sub-division of a Department",42
199,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Withi n a division; not a sub-division.,42
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"At any rate, this Bill presents quite another case. If we vote £50,000 as a bonus to the fish industry, the money might by regulation be transferred to the rice industry; and that would be much more serious than giving the Government power to manipulate the votes in the interests of a division under the general Estimates.",42
201,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Executive could not increase the rate of the bounty, but only the total amount on any particular item.",42
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Minister Could take money, which had been voted for one purpose, and apply it to a totally different purpose; it would not be merely manipulating votes with the object of securing the complete administration of the Department, but it would be devoting the money to quite a distinct object. If the provision of the Audit Act referred to by the honourable member for South Sydney be applied to a Bill of this kind, it will open up a vista of strange and serious possibilities, unless we assume, as, of course, we have a right to assume, the administration is going to be honest. Another fundamental difference between this Bill and an ordinary money Bill, or the Estimates, is that once this Bill is passed we shall have absolutely no further control over the expenditure of these amounts. It may be a matter of amending the Audit Act, but there ought to be some distinction made in the direction-1I have indicated.",42
203,Unknown,PUBLIC SERVICE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.,42
204,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wentworth) [7.45] - I - agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes that if our legislation is not to be farcical we should amend those provisions of the Bill which conflict with the fourth column of the schedule. The honourable member for South Sydney told the Committee that the practice of allowing Ministers to vary the amounts voted by Parliament prevails in regard to the Estimates, and I agree with him that it has obtained in the past, but the variation is confined to the amounts set down in each subdivision. I. do not regard it as a hurtful practice within those limits. But in this case it is different; for it must be remembered that the sum set down as the "" maximum "" amount to be devoted to the encouragement of any particular industry seriously weighs with honourable members in coming>to a decision in regard to the items of the schedule. By way of illustration, let me point out that an important party in the Chamber has laid down the rule that the expenditure for defence is not to exceed a certain amount. If the amounts voted for various Departments could be so varied that the defence Estimates could be increased, in spite of this, honourable mem-' bers would not agree to those Estimates without requiring that there should be no addition to the sum voted for defence. In this case, the same principle should apply, but at the present time, we do not know whether £10,000 or £30,000 is to be given for the encouragement of the fishing industry. Some of the items in the schedule were agreed to by a very narrow majority; but probably they would not have been agreed to at all if it had been known that the maximum amount, payable would be £10,000 instead of £2,000.",42
205,Mr COON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Some of the members of the Opposition have said that they wish that the amounts shall be subject to variation.,42
206,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not in favour of that. I have always held that Parliament should keep as close a control as possible upon the expenditure of the country, and I am seeking to apply that principle to the Bill. I hope that the Minister will recommit such portions of the measure as will enable us to insure that the amounts given for particular items shall be those which we desire to give. With regard to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corio, the declared object of the bounty is the encouragement of fishermen whose existence would form a valuable reserve for coastal defence. The Minister"" has told us that if the amendment is carried, there will be so many applicants for the bounty as to make if difficult to meet all the demands. Therefore, it appears that a unique opportunity is given by the amendment to do what is desired. As what we wish to do is to encourage the fishing industry, and not the secondary industry of canning, I shall support it.",42
207,Mr MCDOUGALL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wannon) [7.52] It has always been my opinion that the object of bounties is to encourage primary production:, and for that reason I desire, to see a bounty offered of which those engaged jo the fishing industry can take advantage. The great objection to many bounty proposals is that they make it possible for a few large firms to obtain possession of large sums of public money, instead of giving legitimate encouragement to the primary producers. In any electorate, a large number of persons make their living by fishing. There are two important fishing towns in the electorate, but the fishing industry is not a very flourishing one, because of the difficulty of obtaining a market for the fish. T have seen quantities of fish left on the piers as unsaleable. If there were better arrangements for its transport inland, there would be a much better sale, and a consequent larger consumption of fish. The want of an adequate market now causes great loss, and those engaged in the fishing industry are often idle because there is no regular demand to supply. I have always desired to assist in the development of Australian industries, than which none is more important than the fishing industry. Many honourable members, whose sentiments appear to .me thoroughly anti-Australian, are continually speaking about the need for population. Let me draw their attention to the value of the fishing industry in other countries. In the United Kingdom, no fewer than 106,000 persons are engaged in that industry, the value of its products being £9,500,000, while in Canada, 73,000 persons are so engaged, their efforts resulting in products valued at ,£5,000,000. . I .canrot see how those who say that we should increase our population can oppose the development of this industry.",43
208,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,No one is opposed to the development of this or any other industry.,43
209,Mr MCDOUGALL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The best way to develop an industry is to encourage it with a bounty and protect it with import duties. - In the western districts of Victoria, we have had experience of what a bounty will do for the butter industry. No one will say that that industry has gone back because of the granting of the butter bounty. Seeing that so many persons obtain a livelihood in other countries as fishermen, surely in Australia we imay expect that the fishing industry will give employment to a large part of our population, having in view the great extent of our coast line, and the possibilities of our coastal waters. I suggest the omission of the words "" in tins and casks "" and the substitution for them of the words "" as prescribed."" The bounty should not go to large firms, but should be paid ""to small men. The statement of the Minister that the work of administration will be very great if a great number of small producers have to be considered, will apply to every item in the schedule.",43
210,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Robertson) [7.56] - I compliment the honourable member for Wannon upon the fact that in his first speech he has made a very sensible proposal for the amendment of this item. One could see that he had thought but the. subject upon which he spoke. But in suggesting that those who oppose the granting of this bounty are against the establishment of the fishing industry, he did an injustice to the free-trade members of the Committee, their policy being to establish every industry that is native 1.0 the country. Still, we wish to establish industries under healthy conditions! We think that it is useless to bolster up with bounties or protective duties industries which cannot existwithout assistance. It is not that free traders are opposed to the establishment of industries, but that they desire the establishment of healthy industries. In Victoria alone does the view prevail that we are opposed to the establishment of industries, I desire the establishment of the fishing industry, and voted for a trawler to explore our coastal waters, with a view to discovering the possibilities of deep-sea fishingTrawling has been conducted experimentally by the New South Wales Government with very successful results. Here is an industry which, according to the Commission which investigated the matter in New South Wales, must succeedJust as it has proved a success in Canada, so will it be a success in Australia. The offer of a bounty, is not required to establish an enterprise of this kind. According to the report of the State experts, we have a home market for preserved fish which is worth £310,000 annually. All that we require now is enterprise, and that enterprise will be forthcoming when the trawler has got to work. The honourable member for Wannon has demonstrated that the fisherfor men will not reap the advantage of the proposed bounty, because the Bill stipulatesThe bounties shall be payable to the growers or producers only of the goods or the materials' of which they are made, ""and not to turers : Provided that, in the case of fish preserved in tins or casks - . the manufacturer shall be deemed to be the producer, and the bounty shall be payable to the manufacturer only. I quite agree with the honourable member that the proposed bounty will find its way into the pockets of the middleman, whereas the desire is that the primary producer shall receive it. The report of the Conference of State experts saysUnquestionably, the careful and skilfully conducted surveys of our deep-sea fishing grounds, which will become possible when the fisheries' vessel is completed and put into commission, will greatly enlarge and systematize our knowledge of the available fish supplies of the seas adjacent to our coasts. Let us prove that the fish are here in payable quantities, and the preserving and packing processes will be no more difficult in Australia than they are in Canada and otherparts of the world. In Tasmania, I understand, there are seasons of the year when a man has merely to stand at the water's edge, and with a fork shoot out the fish which abound there. I have been as- . sured by the honourable member for Denison that he has known tens of thousands of tons of fish to be caught in that way. The trawling experiments which were conducted in New South Wales have shown that the fish exist along our coasts in payable ouantities, and therefore I say that the industry requires no artificial bolstering up.",43
211,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVICE,A little while ago the honourable member declared that we required the trawler to prove that we have the fish.,44
212,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,The trawling experiments conducted in New South Wales by Mr Farnell were a great success.,44
213,Mr JOHN THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Honourable members were informed earlier in the debate that they were a failure.,44
214,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They were a success, undoubtedly. At the same time that trawler was not equipped in the way that the vessel which the Government propose to have constructed will be. All that is required to make this industry a success is ordinary British enterprise, and we have plenty of that in Australia. If we can show the capitalist that he will obtain a fair return for his outlay, he will be only too pleased to invest his money in the enterprise. Millions of pounds are available investment in remunerative enterprises. . I say again that we should get our trawler to work and prove that the fish exist along our coasts in payable quantities, and the 'rest would follow naturally. The"" report manufacof the State experts also says^With an adequate and regular supply of fish, arid with the financial stimulus offered by the liberal bounty provided for in the Bill , there is good reason to hope that fish canning will become a highly important industry. We have the market already, and all that is now wanted is enterprise. That enterprise will be forthcoming when once the trawler has got to .work, and consequently the proposed bounty might well be dispensed with. Amendment agreed to.

217,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Provide d that we have a climate and soil suited to the cultivation, of date palms, I think that this is one of the items which honourable members should support. But it must be distinctly understood that I throw the whole of the responsibility for the financing of this scheme upon the Government. If - the item be agreed to, I wish to know whether the present growers of date palms, will practically "" scoop "" the whole of the bounty ?",44
218,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There are so few date palms grown that the persons who cultivate them could not possibly "" scoop"" the bounty.",44
219,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Are ' they likely to get the greater portion of it? ,44
220,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,No .,44
221,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"What we wish to do, I take it, is to encourage the establishment of fresh plantations. Would it not be possible to insert after the word "" dates "" the words "" from new plantations "" ? If those words were inserted the bounty would be far more satisfactory in its effect.",44
222,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVICE,We are not producing two tons of dates per annum at the present time.,44

At page 34, under the heading of ""Dates,"" we have a table showing that the ""cost of cultivation, fecundation, ing and marketing, including purchase of suckers,"" is £ 5 0 , and that the average yield per acre is 300 lbs.",45

230,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We need some information on the point. The table proceeds to set forth that the price per cwt. is 10s., and difficulty. the gross return per acre is £150. A yield of 300 lbs. per acre at 10s. per cwt. would mean about 30s. per acre. I think that the be necessary. statement "" average yield per acre, 300 lbs.,"" is wrong, and that ""cwts."" should Chairman. foe substituted for "" lbs.""",45
231,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,It is a mistake.,45

After the the Bill had been circulated, however, we refuller information showing, as the honourable member has said, that there are great possibilities associated with the export drytrade in preserved fruits.",45

246,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member's proposal opens up a very big question. The case that has been made out for encouraging the preserving of pine-apples for export purposes is certainly worthy of consideration, but I am afraid that the honourable member's suggestion could not be carried out in this Bill having regard to the stage which the Bill has reached. It has been suggested by the Queensland report that a bounty should be given not to the growers, but to the canners of pine-apples.",45
247,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wide Bay) [8.24] - I desire to know, Mr Chairman, whether I should be in order in moving that after the word "" dried "" the words "" and other "" be inserted. I fail to see that such an amendment would interfere with the proposal embodied in this item to grant a bounty on fruits exported. The fact that an appropriation has been made for the particular purposes named in the Bill surely does not necessarily involve strict adherence to the wording of the schedule to the Bill as introduced.",46
248,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member's proposal would mean an appropriation of money for a purpose other than that named in the schedule as introduced. It would apply to all kinds of fresh fruits. His proposal would be narrowed down by inserting 'after the word "" candied"" the words "" and pine-apples in tins.""",46
249,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If that could be done, practically any amendment could be made.",46
250,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,I say that neither amendment could be made.,46
251,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I wish to move the amendment I have indicated, and believe that it is quite possible in that way to extend the scope of this item. There seems to be some doubt in the mind of the Minister, and I would therefore ask, Mr Chairman, whether I should be in order in proposing to insert after the word "" candied"" the words ""and pine-apples canned""?",46
252,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the honourable member desires to move an amendment, I would suggest that he should propose to insert after the word "" dried "" the words "" or tinned.""",46
253,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,That would include all kinds of preserves.,46
254,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I think it would be wise to extend the scgpe of the item, applying as it does to fruits exported.",46
255,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the item applied to all kinds of fruit, the £6,000 proposed to be expended in connection with it would not go very far.",46
256,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,I take it that our desire is to ascertain! what varieties of fruit can be preserved and exported with the greatest benefit to Australia.,46
257,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,How far would this bounty go if it were applied to all the fruits that can be preserved and exported ?,46
258,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It might go further than it would if we limited the item to a particular variety of fruit, and our selection proved to be wrong. We should give the people an opportunity to ascertain for themselves what is the best fruit to be preserved for export purposes.",46
259,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If a trial were made of a dozen varieties, the £6,000 would be exhausted in a few months.",46
260,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If we discovered that a very large export trade could be done in a particular variety of preserved fruit, we could take steps later on to encourage that trade. This schedule does not prevent us from voting further sums for the encouragement of any new industry which may be opened up in the course of a year or two* We ought to make this item as wide as possible, since it relates to exportable commodities. There is no particular industry which requires to have expended upon it the whole of the amount proposed to be given by way of bounty under this item. I think the honourable member for South Sydney will agree that there is no specific commodity of which we desire to insure the ex1 port, and if the matter be left open, it will be possible to discover which is the most suitable for the export trade.",46
261,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"At the present time jams are being exported, so that the bouncy would go to those who are engaged in that trade. Is that the honourable member's intention ?",46
262,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I would go as. far as we may, if we cannot get all we want. The Attorney-General says that we cannot do this or that under the appropriation, but I find that the Chairman is ready to take an open amendment', whereas I should like to narrow the matter down.",46
263,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,I suggest that the honourable member should narrow the matcer down to the specific item of canned pine-apple.,46
264,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I move That after the word "" D r i e d "" the words "" and canned pine-apples "" be inserted.",46
265,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I should like to take your ruling, Mr Chairman, as to this amendment. I do not wish to imperil the passing of a Bill by inserting a provision which we cannot carry out. The objection I have to the amendment is, in the first place, that it increases the expenditure, and, in the second place, that it diverts the appropriation. Although, by the amendment the amount of the appropriation is not increased, the amount of the expenditure under the appropriation is increased.",46
266,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I think the Chairman will have some difficulty in giving a ruling, cause he must first determine whether canned pine-apples aire or are not dried fruit. There is nothing on the face of the amendment to show that canned pine-apples ' are not also dried, and while, as a matter of fact, I believe that they are not, the Chairman may take it that they are. Of course, the answer to that is that, if apples are dried fruit, the amendment is unnecessary, whereas if they are not dried fruit, I am afraid the amendment goes beyond our power. I think that the Speaker, on one occasion, ruled that at this stage of a Bill, involving an appropriation, we cannot vary the scope; we may omit or reduce, but we cannot enlarge either the amount or the scope of the appropriation. As to that ruling, I speak only from recollection. I do not see why pine-apples should not be included, if that be. possible.",47
267,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hear , hear; but the difficulty is as I have stated.",47
268,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Ha d I thought that the amendment was not in order. I should not have put it to the Committee. In reply to the objection raised by the Attorney-General as to the increase of the expenditure, I remind him that we propose by this schedule to vote £6,000, as the utmost that can be spent on this particular item in one year. If the Government go beyond that sum in this expenditure, they will be exceeding the amount allowed by the Bill. Regarding the objection as to the altering of the destination of the bounty, the Bill already allows the Government to fix any amount they think proper as the maximum. Under clause 9, the Government, if they so desire, may, by regulation, devote £400,000 to this particular item, and neglect expenditure upon all the other items. Under the circumstances I think the proposed amendment is quite in order.",47
269,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not, for one moment, intend any disrespect to the Chair; and I am anxious to help the honourable member for Wide Bay. in having canned pine-apples included. am bound, however, by my position, to have regard to the constitutional aspect of the question. Would it be possible to take the Speaker's ruling on the point? Otherwise, in the House, the point may be raised, and it may be necessary to recommit the Bill. I think that by consent the Speaker may be referred to.",47
270,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Committee has be- full power to decide its procedure; and, although it has occasionally happened that the ruling of the Chairman has been referred to Mr Speaker, it is much better that the Committee should arrange its own business. If every time a ruling is given in Committee, a reference is made to Mr Speaker, there is pine- likely to be conflict. Personally, I have no objection to the point being referred to Mr Speaker. Had I known, that this question would be raised I should have armed myself with the authorities necessary to enable me to put the matter clearly before the Committee. If the Attorney-General desires to move that imy ruling be referred to Mr Speaker, he will be quite in order in doing so.",47
271,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I hope, sir, that you do not take my remarks as indicating any want of confidence in yourself as Chairman. This is an important point which may be taken in the House at a later stage, and, as your ruling now appears to be in conflict with a previous ruling, I move That the point of order be referred to Mr. Speaker.",47
272,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I hope the Chairman will abide by his decision; if it be not satisfactory to a majority of the Committee, let it be referred to Mr Speaker.",47
273,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I point out to the Attorney-General that another amendment on all-fours with that upon which I have ruled was accepted this afternoon by himself and the Committee in connection with the item of smoked fish. That being so, I felt bound to accept the second amendment. If there is to be a reference to Mr Speaker, I think he should be appealed to as to both amendments.",47
274,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In my opinion, it is inadvisable to refer this ruling to Mr. Speaker. If we elect officers to conduct the business in the House and in Committee, we should leave them to conduct that business, especially in a matter of this kind in which you, Mr Chairman, appear to have no doubt, while the Attorney General, on the contrary, does not seem at I all certain. I regard the action of the Minister as a_ gross misuse of his powers in Committee. I trust that the Chairman's ruling on a trivial matter like this, will not be' referred to Mr Speaker. It comes ill from a Minister to submit a motion of this kind when the Chairman has given a distinct ruling. On a previous occasion the Minister accepted a similar amendment to which he was favourable, but being unfavorable to this amendment, he desires to appeal to Mr Speaker.",47
275,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am afraid the honor-, able member is hardly doing me justice. I told him distinctly that, so far. as I could see, his amendment was one with which I sympathized, whereas now he says that I am against his proposal.",48
276,Mr THOMAS,PUBLIC SERVICE,It looks like it.,48
277,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,I ask the honourable member for Wide Bay to take my word as to that.,48
278,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,I take the honourable gentleman's word; but he told me he had already consulted the Speaker.,48
279,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The question was whether we should add this frui t to the item, and it seemed to me that to do so would be to divert the vote. That was the reason for my objection. There is nothing wrong or improper in looking into a proposal to see whether it is within our powers. My reason for suggesting a reference to Mr Speaker is to attain uniformity in practice, and to have our powers defined. One or two other honourable members suggested the inclusion of further items, and I gave to them the reply I have given to the honourable member for Wide Bay.",48
280,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,It will not meet my views to cramp the operation of a Bill like this.,48
281,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If there are certain constitutional rules which cramp the action of the Committee, I cannot be responsible for the existence of those rules, which are, presumably, based on sound constitutional principles.",48
282,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If a Minister thinks that an amendment may imperil the Bill of which he has charge, it is quite proper for him to try to put himself on firm ground in regard to it. Should it turn out that the Chairman has ruled wrongly, the Bill must be ruled out of order by Mr Speaker. In the House the point might be .taken that the Bill had been so altered as to be no longer covered by the Governor General's Message.",48
283,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Coul d not the schedule be recommitted, if necessary?",48
284,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Mr Speaker would have to rule on the point when taken, and if he sustained it, the Bill would be thrown out. The Attorney-General is taking the right course in the interests of the measure. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that the exportation of pine-apples should be encouraged, if possible, but we must not insert provisions which may wreck the whole measure. I am sure that the Chairman will not regard the action of the Committee in wishing to refer this matter to Mr Speaker as reflecting upon him, because the same thing has been done on many previous occasions.",48
285,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that something should be done to encourage the export of what seems likely to become one of our staple products; but it would be unwise to run the risk of the Bill being ruled out of order. For that reason I think we should take Mr Speaker's decision on the point now. The practice already obtains of referring important questions of this character to him, although the Standing Orders-in my opinion, unwisely-appea r not to contemplate action of this kind. InNew South Wales, the Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly provide for references to Mr Speaker, but under our procedure, these references are made only with the consent of the Committee generally. It is highly desirable that we should prevent the growing up of two practicesone governing procedure in the House, and the other governing procedure in Committee. The ablest men must differ on questions of this kind, and the only way to> obtain finality and uniformity is by submitting them to Mr Speaker.",48
286,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,H is decision lays down a rule for all time to come.,48
287,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Every decision makes the law clearer. The Chairmanwill not take it as a reflection upon himself that we should take this action to secure a desirable uniformity of practice.,48
288,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Unde r the Standing Orders, the reference of this question to Mr Speaker must be decided by the Committee; but, as the Chairman has consented to it , no doubt the course proposed will be followed. I am in sympathy with the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and was desirous of making provision in the schedule for the encouragement of industries which, in my opinion, should be encouraged, and for which no bounty is allotted. But I have refrained from moving amendments, because I felt that they would be unconstitutional. On one occasion, when I was Chairman, the right honourable member for East Sydney took action similar to that now proposed. I had ruled on the technical point whether a non-official member could increase an item in the Tariff, but I was quite ready and willing that my ruling should be reviewed by Mr Speaker. He confirmed it, and it stands now for all time. We have now before us another point upon which we should have his ruling for our guidance. Motion agreed to. In the House :",48
289,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member for Wide Bay moved to insert, in the first column of the first schedule, after the words "" fruits dried,"" the words "" and canned pine-apples."" I accepted the amendment; but the Attorney-General raised the point that it was not in order, and when I had ruled against him, moved that it be referred to you for decision. That motion was agreed to.",49
290,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The schedule provides an appropriation of £6,000 for the encouragement of the production of fruits, dried or candied, and exported. If the amendment were, agreed to, part of that appropriation would be diverted to an .object other than that specified. That, it seems to me, would be a departure from constitutional principles, and, therefore, the amendment, I submit, is not in order. I took the further point that the whole sum appropriated for a bounty for the production of fruits, dried or candied and exported, might not be claimed, and the inclusion of another item might, therefore, be tantamount to increasing the expenditure. On that point, I do not feel so confident.",49
291,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I regret that I had not an opportunity to consult the authorities on this point, but the question wassprung upon me suddenly. The Attorney General, I believe, had gone into the matter in anticipation of an amendment of this kind. He first took the point that the amendment is out of order because it would increase the proposed expenditure; but I ruled that as £6,000 is appropriated as the maximum annual bounty for dried fruits, the Government could not expend more than that sum in any one year, and, therefore, the amendment would not increase the expenditure. The Attorney General seems inclined now to waive that point, and says that he does not feel confident in regard to it. His second point was that the amendment would alter the destination of the proposed bounty. I pointed out that if that were so, we had already altered the destination of the bounty proposed for the production of fish, and that, if my ruling in this case does bold good, the former amendment should not have been accepted. I also pointed out that under paragraph a of clause 9 the Government has power to alter the destination of every vote in the schedule. The appropriation covered by the message from the Crown amounts to £530,000, but the amounts in the schedule total nearly £600,000. Under the provision to which I refer, the Government could alter the destination of the various votes, giving nearly the whole sum for the production of cotton or the production of preserved fish. I maintain that in accepting the amendment I was not accepting a provision conferring more power upon the Government in regard to the variation of expenditure than is conferred by the clause which I have mentioned.",49
292,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In considering this point, I think we may well have regard to the analogy afforded by the Estimates. They are covered by a message from the Governor General, but can a Committee of Supply change the destination of any amount therein set down? Can it appropriate part of a sum set down for a definite object for some other object? If it can, the ruling of Mr Chairman must be upheld. My impression, is that a Committee has not the power to. change the destination of appropriations recommended by a message from the Crown. It may reduce an amount, but it may not increase it or change the destination of an appropriation. In this instance, several difficulties arise. If the amendment were agreed to the item would readFruits-Drie d and Canned Pineapples. - Mr GROOM - It is a separate item.",49
293,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If canned pineapple is a dried fruit, then it is undoubtedly covered by the word which already appears in the schedule. "" Dried "" is a general term. There are two kinds of dried fruit excepted, viz., currants and raisins. I repeat that if canned pineapple is a dried fruit the term "" d r i e d "" covers it ; but if it is not, I am afraid that the amendment becomes objectionable.",49
294,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I presume that it is idle to debate the point, which was first raised by the Attorney-General, viz., that if we agreed to the amendment proposed we should be exceeding* the message of Appropriation. That objection, it seems to me, cannot be sustained. The more sensible reasoning to my mind was that of the right not honourable member for East Sydney. I take it that in this particular item of the schedule the word "" dried "" has no special sigtion nificance, because exceptions are made the very line in which it appears, which readsDried (except currants and raisins) or and exporled. It is easily seen that the proposal of the Government is a double-barrelled one, which is intended to cover both dried undried fruits. In the first instance sought to secure the omission of the word "" dried."" It seems to me that the accept: ance of the amendment involves no quesapples-a tion of order. If that amendment is in order at the present stage, I submit I can move to include pineapples amongst the exceptions, where it will be perfectly 'order under the Standing Orders of this and of every other well-governed Parliabounty ment.",49
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It appears to that no restriction is imposed upon Committee except in regard to the amounts specified in the schedule. With that one exception we are free under any rule of Parliament-excep t that relating to levancy-to make any alteration that we choose regarding the destination of any particular sum. There is no distinction made between these sums either in the of the Bill, in its structure, or in the sage which authorizes it. Seeing that it only amounts which are limited, it seems to me that within that limitation we can dispose of any of the money voted just as inserted, we please.",50
296,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Upon the second reading of the Bill I pointed out that the meaning of the term "" Bounties"" was contained in clause 3, which readsThe bounties under this Act shall be payable on the production in Australia of the goods specified in the first column of the first dule. The particular item which was engaging the attention of the Committee when the question of order arose was that of dried fruits. The 'only question to be determay mined is whether tinned pineapples under that heading.",50
297,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have no hesitation whatever in giving a decision upon 'the point which has been raised, but, in order to make clear the reasons why I give it, I would remind honourable members of the forms whiah have been followed introduction of this measure. In the first place, we received a message from the vernor-General, asking that an appropriaing should be made for a specific purpose. in That message, having been considered ir» Committee, it - was determined that the appropriation should be made, and permiscandied sion was given to certain members of the Government to prepare and bring in a Bill. The Bill was brought in, therefore, in pursuance of the decision of the Committee. and When it was brought in, it provided that I certain bounties should be payable upon certain items. If , under the items as they stand, a bounty could be paid upon pines there is no suggestion that the not amount should be increased-a n amend that ment to that effect-which , of course, would be"" quite unnecessary under the cirin cumstances-coul d be moved and carried. But if , under the items as they stand, no would be payable upon pine-apples, then the Committee at this stage cannot make an appropriation for the payment .of me such a bounty. As the right honourable this member for East Sydney has said, the analogy of the Estimates constitutes a sufficient guide for us. Let us suppose that the Estimates contained an item of expendireture for the purchase of rifles. It would be quite incompetent for the House to apply the money appropriated for that purpose to the purchase of ammunition. That title would be changing the destination of a mesvote. In the present instance, if the is schedule contained provision for the payment of a bounty upon pine-apples, the words contained in the amendment might be but if not, it is clear that their insertion would involve an alteration in the destination of a vote. That, I think, absolutely rules the amendment out of order, even if it did not involve a larger cxpenr diture. Regarding clause 9, to which aN tention was called by the Chairman, I take it that that clause can have no effect in schethe way of changing the destination of a bounty. It can only determine whether a larger or smaller sum shall be payable in a particular year. I .am not asked to give a ruling in reference to any amendment which have been made in a preceding item. come Should any question of the kind be brought under my notice at a later stage, I shall be prepared to give a decision upon it, but I rule now that no amendment can be introduced which would enable any bounty to be payable in respect of any item which is not already provided since the for in the schedule.",50
298,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Before you leave the Gochair, sir, I should like to ask your rulupon a point cognate to that which you have just decided. I desire to know whether it is not possible for the Committee to - make amendments in the schedule, and-before it reaches the House which gives .authority to the Committee to act-for the Government to bring down a recommendation of appropriation covering the amended schedule. As I understand the position, the Government can bring down a message :at any time.",50
299,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Such a course as that suggested by the honourable and learned - member is not forbidden under our Standing Orders, but we have never followed it. Whenever any message has recommended - an appropriation, that message has been at once referred to the Committee, and has been dealt with in what I conceive to be the constitutional way. I should not like to give authority to follow any such course as the honourable and learned member for Corio has suggested. In Committee.",51
300,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In view of the decision of Mr Speaker, I withdraw my ruling, and declare the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay to be out of order.",51
301,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Wide Bay) [9.10] - I understand that earlier in the day we made a few other alterations in the schedule of the Bill. I am exceedingly sorry to learn that we have been so forgetful of what was due to this Committee,51
302,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss the ruling of Mr Speaker.,51
303,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not intend to do so. But it seems proper that at the present stage, I should point out that in ing Bills of this kind to be introducedseeing that the wisdom of the Comimittee cannot add to a single item in the schedule in the absence of another message",51
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,It is not the nature of the message which is responsible for that.,51
305,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Whils t we were in Committee we had an opportunity of altering the message so as to enable us to exercise the power which we undoubtedly possess.,51
306,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,The only thing we can do is to reduce the amount.,51
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"How can we widen the expression "" upon the production of certain goods "" ?",51
308,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Earlier in the day an amendment to insert the words "" as prescribed "" was accepted. I desire to submit an exactly similar amendment, and I therefore move That the words "" as prescribed"" be inserted after the word "" Dried.""",51
309,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-At torney-General) [9.14] - 1 do not know whether the honourable member appreciates the effect of his amendment. The insertion of the words "" as prescribed "" will not have the effect of extending the scope of the Bill. They merely serve to define the way in which the fruit shall be dried.",51
310,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We can omit the word "" dried.""",51
311,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"But the honourable member has not moved in that direction. The word "" d r i e d "" has the widest possible application. As the item stands, it covers any method of drying fruit, and the insertion of the words indicated by the honourable member for Wide Bay would not raise the issue that he desires.",51
312,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The insertion of the words "" as prescribed"" after the word "" fruits "" occurring a little earlier in the schedule, would have opened up the question of the possibility of the inclusion of pineapples, but the addition of the ""words ""as prescribed "" after the word "" dried "" would not do so.",51
313,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,It will enable us to prescribe the kinds of dried fruit which should be the subject of a bounty; but I do not think the amendment will achieve the object which the honourable member has in view.,51
314,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wide Bay) [9.16] - I have heard of dry gin and dry ginger-ale, and am not very much alarmed by what allowhas been said as. to what might be the effect of the'use of the word ""dried"" in this connection. I am prepared to withdraw my amendment if the Committee will strike out the word "" dried.""",51
315,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,That would open up the 1 whole question.,51
316,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have been compelled to take this step owing to the ruling of Mr. Speaker. It seems that the Government have the power to say absolutely what shall be done, and we must either accept the Bill as it stands or reject it. While I recognise that no useful purpose will be served by further discussing the matter, I wish to say that neither this"" Government nor any of its successors will be permitted, if I can help it, to secure the passing of the resolution upon a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation unless the widest possible scope is given to - the Bill to which it relates. In the circumstances, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",51
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Parramatta) already [9.18I - In view of the decision of Mr. Speaker, I presume that I cannot move insertion of the words "" and fresh "" the word "" dried "" ? The - CHAIRMAN - Such an amend of ment would not be in order.",52
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is. most unfortunate. I , like the deputy leader the Labour Party, desire to vernment that I shall take care in future that the consideration in Committee of a message recommending an appropriathat tion of this kind is not treated as a mal matter. There seems to be no sible reason why dried fruit cluded in a scheme of bounties such as this whilst no provision is made for dealing with the infinitely more delicate problem relating to the export of fresh 5s a sort of bastard proposal. MT. WATSON - Is the honourable member trying to undermine, the anti-bounty ciples of the honourable member for Frankstrike lin by suggesting a bounty on fresh apples exported ?",52
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Not at all. I we are to apply this system to the fruit dustry, I wish to secure a bounty not only on fresh apples, but also upon fresh oranges that are exported. Amendment (by Mr I'ISHER) proposed - That the word "" D r i e d "" be left out, with a has put the case in a nutshell. view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" served.""",52
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I submit, Mr. Chairman, that the amendment is out order. I cannot be expected to agree .such a proposal when I find it impossible to extend this item to fresh fruits.",52
321,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member - could vote for the omission of the word "" dried,"" and vote against the insertion of the word ""preserved.""",52
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Accordin g to the ruling of Mr Speaker, the item must be the supply. - confined to dried fruits.",52
323,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is quite competent for the Committee, should it desire to do so, to strike out the whole item word by word. The honourable member for Wide Bay is in order in moving amendment ",52
324,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"South Sydney) [9.22] I would suggest to the honourable member for Wide Bay that his amendment would not accomplish the object he has in view, since a bountv of £6,000 devoted to preserved fruits that are exported, would go entirely to the jam manufacturers, who are exporting large quantities to South . Africa and other countries. The whole the of the bounty would be secured by the after jam manufacturers, and not one penny would be available for the encouragement the export of pineapples. It is very probable that if we created the blank which the honourable member desires, his proposal of to insert the word "" preserved "" would be assure the Goruled out of order.",52
325,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member wishes to strike out the word "" dried "" so the Government will find it necessary for-' to bring down a new schedule in which senprovision will be made for a bounty on should be inpineapples exported.",52
326,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is quite another matter. If that were the honourable member's object he could achieve it by a fruit. ' This simpler proceeding.,52
327,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Corio) .[9.24] - I understand, Mr Chairman, that you have prinruled that the Committee - has power to out the word ""dried,"" and all the words which follow it in the item. If that be so, - the honourable member for f Wide Bay should be able to accomplish in his object by moving the omission of all the words after the word "" f r u it s . """,52
328,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Franklin) [9.25]. - The honourable member for South Sydney If we presubstituted the word ' ' preserved ' ' for the word "" dried "" the whole of this bounty would go to the jam manufacturers at preof sent engaged in the export trade; the to grower would not receive any portion of it. A considerable trade in dried fruits is now springing up, and certain varieties of apples, which are unfit for export to England, are in great demand for drying purposes. I was informed by Mr G. B. Edwards, formerly member for South Sydney, that the demand is greater than",52
329,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,There is a good market for dried apples in Australia.,52
330,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There is, and the industry is making great progress without the assistance of a bounty. If we the are to choose between granting a bounty on dried fruit and one on preserved fruit, I think that from the stand-point of the producer, it would be infinitely better to select that which would encourage the export of dried fruit. In this way we should assist in opening up a market for what is otherwise an unsaleable commodity. The bounty provided for in this item, however, is so small that it would be impossible for the manufacturer to pass on any portion of it to the producer. Tens of thousands of tons of fruit are now being preserved, and if the honourable member's amendment were adopted the bounty would go to the manufacturer, whilst the producer would get nothing, and a new industry would certainly not be established.  gard this item as one of very great importance. Fruit-growing is one of our staple industries, and should be fostered by every legitimate means. I do not think it would be wise to adopt the amendment, because in dealing with the prospects of the preserved fruit industry the Conference of experts' reportIt was accordingly decided not to recommend .1 bonus as requested by the associations referred to. At the sam» time careful consideration was given to the prospects of the fruit industry in Australia as a whole, and means were considered which might lead to its expansion. The highly favourable conditions of climate and soil which prevail over large portions of the Commonwealth point to fruit-growing becoming a highly important industry. Many of the choicest fruits bring a high price when dried or candied, and this work may be successfully carried out by families or small co-operative associations. This is the point to which I desire to draw special attentionThe extent to which jams, jellies, preserved fruits, - pulp and frui t juices are already produced in the Commonwealth, and the fact that these products are being exported indicate that the industries are already well established. Jams, jellies and preserved fruits are already being exported on a commercial basis, and there is therefore no need for a bounty in respect of them. There are, however, important possibilities in connection with the exportation of dried fruits, and I hope therefore that the Committee will pass the item as it stands.",52
331,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wide Bay) [9.29] - It is evident there is no hope of ray securing the omission of the word "" dried "" from the item. I therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment. I wish to say that' I blame myself for permitting an opportunity to slip past by which I could have broadened the scope of the Bill. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Item agreed to. ItemCombed wool or tops exported, 2 years, i ^ d . per lb., and thereafter, 3 years, i d . per l b . , j£io,ooo.",53
332,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"South Sydney) [9.30]. - I have been making some inquiries, and I understand that the industry which it is proposed to establish is a very important one. If it is possible to establish it successfully in Australia, which looks probable from the information available, it ought to assume very lajge dimensions, and have a great effect on our staple industry. The inquiries I have made impress *me with the idea that it will be impossible to erect a plant, or a number of plants, sufficiently large to carry on the in.dustry on a commercial scale, so as to permit of successful competition with exported goods, unless a considerable time is allowed. A very large plant is essential, and at least eighteen months or two years will be taken up in erecting the necessary buildings and machinery. That being so, unless the time at which the bonus is to commence be extended for nearly two years, the bonus might lapse before it could be taken advantage of. As I am sure that is not the wish of the Minister; I suggest that he might extend the time for the coming into operation of the bonus to a year ahead, or the ist July, 1908.",53
333,Mr WYNNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does the honourable member think the bonus is sufficient ?,53
334,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have made inquiries, particularly from wool-buyers in Sydney, and one, who seemed to have a pretty good knowledge of this industry-h e having, prior to coming out to Australia, had experience in all the detailed work of top making-sai d he thought that the bonus would prove sufficient. From inquiries he himself had made, on behalf of a continental firm, he had come to the conclusion that there was only a small margin, so far as could then be seen, against the local manufacturer; in fact, he said that, after the industry was established, and the product became known in the markets of the world, he had no doubt it would be able to do without a bonus. But this woolbuyer was of opinion that a plant on a scale sufficiently large to enable Australian tops to compete with tops in other parts of the world could not be erected under two years. I suggested to him twelve months as a reasonable limit, and I now move That after the words "" two years"" there be inserted the words ""commencing from ist Julv, 1908.""",53
335,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Attor ney General) [9.35] - The amendment proposed seems .to me reasonable. If the Bill becomes law, it cannot come into operation for some time, and the amendment will leave practically nine months in which those who propose ""to enter the industry - could make preliminary arrangements in the way of purchasing land and erecting buildings and machinery. The intention of the Bill is to make an effective bonus for five years..",54
336,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,I think it ought to go a little longer.,54

338,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-At torney-General) [9.36] - I promised that if reductions were made in the total amount of the appropriation, I should make proportionate reductions in the second schedule. I have had the amounts made up, and I find that the difference between the original appropriation and the amounts voted is as between the original amount of £530,000 and £412,500, or £117,500. That is the maximum amount; and I am assuming that in each of these years the maximum amount will be taken out. For instance, in the case of olives, I have allowed for the reduction made; and so in regard to the other items, and have arrived at the result which I have - just indicated. In other words, I' have had the second schedule revised, so as to make it in harmony with the alterations made in the first schedule. For instance-, the total amount in the first year was originally £80,000, and that has been reduced to £68,000, and so on right through, until we arrive at the total appropriation of £412,500. I moveT h at the second column of the schedule be left out, with a view to insert the following , figures in lieu thereof£ 60,000 118,000 175,000 233,000 200,000 322,000 340,000 358,000 372,000 385,000 391,000 396,000 401,000 406,000 412,500",54
339,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE,Angas) [9.40] - I suppose these figures have been arrived at on an estimate of the effect of the maxima in To t a l amounts which the first schedule.,54
340,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is so. to those dates. Mr Glynn - There is no power to £ alter the figures just read? ... 80,000 ... 150,000 Mr GROOM - No ; these are fixed by ... 220,000 law. ... 290,000 Mr Glynn - So that, instead of pro... 360,000 . .. 3go,ooo viding that in each vear so much money ... 415,000 may be spent on each item, the arrangement ... 440,000 is that the expenditure may have reached ... 460,000 a certain amount at the end of the year. ... 480,000 ... 490,000 Mr GROOM - That is so. ... 500,000 Mr Glynn - It may be that a number ... 510,000 of the industries will not develop at the rate ... 520,000 the Minister expects, and if that be so, a ... 530,000 lot of money will accumulate unless the Minister has power to increase the maxima in order to absorb the money.",54
341,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,We have that power.,54
342,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is a very dangerous power. In the course of three or four years a large sum may accumulate which cannot be spent unless the maxima be altered. The Minister imay find himself with £""200,000 in hand, and he may use it to increase the bounty on items which are being produced. It seems to me that the Minister could increase the bounty to a greater extent than some of us anticipated when we were dealing ,with the power to alter the maxima in relation to the first schedule; and we shall have to watch with the greatest care the regulations which are made. I again suggest to the Minister that he ought to provide that the regulations shall not come into force, either on a date to be specified in the regulations or on notification in the Gazette, until they have been laid before Parliament.",54
343,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is there not a general provision to that end in some Act ? »,55
344,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Acts Interpretation Act provides only that the regulations shall come into force only when notified in the Gazette, or on such other date as may be specified in the regulations themselves; and the same Act goes on to provide that the regulations shall be laid before Parliament. But the regulations may have been eight months in operation before they are laid before Parliament; and I suggest that clause 9 should be recommitted with a view to providing that the regulations shall not take effect until after they have been laid on the table of the House. Then if some honourable member challenges the regulations, no Minister will dare to specify a date until the question has been decided.",55
345,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Attorney General) [9.45] - The object of the second schedule is to prevent the appropriations in 'each year exceeding certain amounts. Originally the appropriation of a certain .amount was provided for, to be spent at the rate of so much per annum. During the debate several honourable members have contended that the amounts fixed as the maxima for specific items are not sufficient, and have urged that the Government should, when necessary, take from one item to give to another. My reply to them is that the maximum appropriations for each year are fixed, but that power is given to the Government to vary these maximum amounts by regulation. It is not at all likely that, in the first years of the bounty period, when industries will be in the experimental stage, the maximum amounts set down will be claimed. For instance, it is not likely that £6,000 will be claimed this year for the production of ginned cotton; but as time progresses, and the industry, expands, the demand will probably exceed £6,000. To meet it, we shall have power to increase the maximum by regulation. I cannot accept the suggestion that no regulation shall 'have the force of law until it has been laid upon the table for a certain length of time, because it will be necessary in the case of manv administrative regulations, that they should take effect at once.",55
346,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE,My proposal is merely that no regulation under paragraph a of clause 9 shall come into force until it has laid on the table for a certain period.,55
347,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Probably I shall be able to accept an amendment of that kind, and I shall be glad if the honourable and learned member will draft one. I thought h.s ureposal applied to all regulations.",55
348,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"East Sydney) [9.51] - 1 understood the Attorney-General to say that clause 9 empowers the Government to vary by regulation the maximum amounts in the fcurth column by taking from one item, and adding to another. I should like to know in respect to ginned cotton, for example, for which the - maximum amount which may be paid in any one vear is £6,000, if any part of that sum could be applied for the encouragement of some other industry.",55
349,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Attorney General) [9.53]--If the maximum amounts set down in the fourth column of the first schedule are multiplied by the years during which the bounties may be paid, they will be found to total something like £650,000, while the Bill provides for an appropriation cut of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of only £530,000. There is the further limitation that the expenditure in any one year shall not exceed certain amounts. Power is taken, however, to increase by regulation the maximum amounts annually payable'in respect to any item. For instance, we could increase the maximum payment for ginned cotton in any one year from £6,000 to £7,000, but we could not expend more than £530,000 during the period for which the bounties' will be in force.  money from other items and use it to increase the bounty on cotton?",55
350,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There will not be a transfer from one item to another, merely a; variation of the maximum amount pavable in respect to any goods in any one year. We cannot, however, increase the total amount payable in respect to any goods during the period for which the bounties are in force. Moreover, the total expenditure in each year is limited by the second schedule. It cannot exceed £68,000 in the - year ending 30th June, 1908; £128,000 next year, and so on.  down maximum amounts if the Government is to have power to increase them by regulations? '",55
351,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The growth of any industry may make it necessary to increase the maximum amount payable to that industry in any one year, while the .maximum amount payable in regard to some other item? other industry may not be claimed. If the claims for any one year do not equal amount provided for that year, we can increase the maximum for the next year, using the unexpended balance to do so.",55
352,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVICE,Can an amount be merely transferred from one item to another?,56
353,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,No . A ll that can be done is fo vary the maximum amount payunexpended able in respect to any item in any one The honourable and learned member for Angas is drafting an amendment to provide that no regulation varying a maximum shall have force until it has laid upon the table of tfie House for a certain period. The power to make these regulations issimilar to that given under the Audit There is no power to transfer from item clear. to item.,56
354,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Can a surplus be carried from one year to another?,56
355,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,Yes .,56
356,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVICE,But it can be expended only in regard to the item in connection which it has accrued ?,56
357,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Not exactly. For inpower stance, this year the claims for bounty respect of ginned cotton might come to only £3,000. Next year they might total £9,000. In such a case we could, by rein gulation, provide that the unexpended balance from this year should be paid year, making the maximum payment for the year £[9,000.  wanted.",56
358,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"How would the additional £1,000 be obtained?",56
359,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,We could not expend more than the maximum amount appropriated priated for the bounty on ginned cotton.,56
360,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,Can an amount be transferred from one item to another?,56
361,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,No . The Bill provides for certain maximum annual appropriations.,56
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does the Attorneyshall General suggest that the Government can run ahead of the yearly allocation?,56

He admits that the Government have no power to expend any money appropriated to a particular item Upon another item.",56
369,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,Not in that year.,56
370,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"This is a most important . Act. point, and we had better have it made Take the item of cotton as an example. We have authorized the payment of £ 6 , 000 annually for eight years to stimulate the production of that commodity. In other words, we have provided £48,000 for the purpose, and we are giving power to the Government to with spend more than that sum in any one year if necessary. But if the Government have to appropriate any of that money into another item, they may-notwithstand ing that we have voted .£48,000 to assist the cotton industry-spen d only £[40,000 fostering the production of cotton, and devote the remaining £8,000 to the ennext couragement of the palm oil industry.",56
371,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,It is not intended to do that.,56
372,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,That assurance is quite enough for me.,56
373,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,if w e were to do as the right honourable gentleman suggests we might devote all. the money approunder the Bill to the development of one particular industry. (Mr Reid - Exactly .,56
374,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE,There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that being done.,56
375,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Bill provides that we spend £8,000 annually for six years upon the cotton industry. But there is nothing to prevent the Government from spending a portion cf that money in the development of another industry.",56

378,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [10.5] - The point to which reference has been made will have to be made perfectly clear by express words in the regulations. The scheme of the Bill is to fix a maximum expenditure in connection with each item. In the form in which the measure now stands, if there were an unexpended balance upon any item, that balance could be expended by increasingthe maximum amount which is payable in any one year. It seems to be the feeling of the Committee that the expenditure"" upon the different items should be limited in some way. That being so, I promise to recommit - the clause to give effect to the wishes of honourable members.",57
379,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Canno t the AttorneyAct. General do that in two or three minutes?,57
380,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,No ; it will necessitate member some consideration.,57
381,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Corio) [10.7] - It seems to me that the Attorney-General is ascercuts taining the opinion of the Committee from the Opposition, the members of which would be glad to kill the. Bill.",57
382,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is a very ungenerous statement to malke, seeing that I supported the Attorney-General upon the point of order which he raised to-night..",57
383,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The whole opposition to this Bill has been upon the ground that the amounts which it was proposed to propriate in respect of the"" various items were not sufficient to establish a great dustry. Consequently, I am glad that power is reserved to the Government to vary the amounts which are payable upon the different commodities. Of course, any Government will have to administer the Act as they find it. It would be a very great pity to tie the hands of the Ministry and to prevent them-if they effected saving of £6,000 upon one item-fro m but applying it. to other industries which have a"" reasonable . chance, of becoming success-ful. If any of these unexpended balances can be.profitably"" applied to the production of rubber and .""cotton, I hope that the torney-General will remember thegeneral desire which'has been expressed by honor-' able members that'we should confine our at-"" tention to .one.or two industries which a reasonable prospect of being established permanently. . Mr STORRER.^-Farli'am'ent meet's every year - ' "" ' - scheme find that the amount'set apart"" for",57
384,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is a reason why this clause should be retained, and why a sympathetic Government should have as free a hand as possible in making regulations. If those regulations do not succeed, and the Government are considered to have applied too much money under the Act,' the same argument could be brought-forward-that Parliament meets every yearand it might even repeal the Act.  repealing the Act after people have been induced to go into these industries.",57
385,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,A free hand should be given in the matter of administration.,57
386,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"But not to repeal the - ' Mr CROUCH - I am not in favour of repealing the Act at all, but the honourable for Bass suggested that as Parliament met every year the Act could be amended from time to time. That argument both ways. Any wrong administration can be dealt with also .when Parliament iheets. We do not want legislation so .much in this, matter as careful administration to apply the bounty in the best possible way. I trust the Attorney-General, when considering the feeling of the Committee, will give weight to the views of those who favour the Bill rather than of those who oppose it. I am not saying that the Opposition do desire to kill the Bill, although they have ex-"" appressed themselves as willing to do so.",57
387,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,"East Sydney) [10.11 ] -^The inhonorable member for Corio might see another side to this matter. If the Bill becomes law, the people interested in these industries will see that under an Act of Parliament a certain sum of money is set apart for their benefit if they set about establishing them. They will then set to work on the faith of the action of Parliament a in setting aside these amounts for them,, in the third or fourth or fifth year they . may come along and find that some of the money which Parliament set aside for them has been taken under a regulation for the benefit of some other industry. What a At'-' monstrous wrong that would be. I look upon this as a. sort of contract with the people whom we are asking to enter upon the different industries set out in the first have schedule. We say to.them, ""So much money is there for you if you earn it . "" We 'ought to make that money safe' for them'. If the Government in working this' any of the items is not enough, and should be increased, it will be the simplest thing in the world .for them to ask the House for an additional amount for that particular object. But do not let us put one of these bounties on an insecure footing. Let the people whom, we are asking to take up these industries be told, "" There is this amount of money for you by Act of Parliament if you earn it. If you do not earn it in the first year, but do so in any succeeding year, come along and you will still get it . "" We are giving the Government power to meet those people in that way. That is all the Acting Prime Minister wants. Naturally the Government want power to that extent. We provide so much a year. Perhaps no application will be made in'the first, second or third year; but in the fourth or. fifth year applications may be put in with a rush. The Government ought to have power in that case to use up the money that has been lying there for those people in the previous years. That additional power, which is the only one 'the Government want, is a proper power to give them, because we intend the whole of the money appropriated by this measure to be used for the whole time, and we do not want to shut out any one during any year. If the Ajtorney-General makes that clear, we shall be acting fairly by all these people, and there will be nothing to prevent the Government from dealing with some special case. If they find they want more for a particular industry, they can come to this House for it, without tampering with the money belonging to other industries.",57
388,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Wide Bay) [10.14] It has taken a great deal .of time and explanation to arrive at an understanding satisfactory to a member with an ordinary mind.,58
389,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member for Arigas made it clear an hour ago.,58
390,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It seemed quite clear to me until I heard the Attorney-General and the leader of the Opposition. . Another difficulty that presents itself to.me is Are we allowed under the Constitution to. have an accumulation of money? No doubt that, point has not escaped the. notice of the Attorney-General. If we have to divide the whole of our surplus every year among the. States, will it be possible to retain these unexpended balances from year to year? There might be a considerable accumulation at the end of a financial year of money appropriated by this measure, but if , under the - financial provisions of the Constitution,-the States de-' mand the return to them of the whole of the surplus at the end of the year, what will be the position? I do not think it would be wise to transfer amounts from one vote to' another. If , as the honourable member forAngas said, such a thing has been provided for,' it ""was done unwittingly by the Committee, and the Attorney-General ought to have the clause altered. I know he has promised to do so. ",58
391,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It took a very long time before the facts were wormed out, and I think the honourable and learned gentleman had something else in his mind than the interpretation of the honourable and learned member for Angas.",58
392,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,I promised to meet the honourable and learned member.,58
393,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I may be wrong in saying that of the Attorney-General, and ' f so I do not want to do him an injustice. When I am legislating here as a member of the Committee, I desire to know exactly what I am doing, and .so I should like the legal members to tell us the meaning of the proposal in the'fewest possible words. We cannot help it if we make a mistake unwittingly. I am very glad that this discussion has taken place, and that these, long explanations have 'been given. For"" my own information, because it will be useful hereafter, I should like to know how the constitutional, difficulty regarding the accumulation of unexpended votes appropriated by this Bill is to be-met.",58
394,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Corio) [10.19] - The Attorney-General is making a mistake in making this concession to the leader of the Opposition, the honourable member fpr Maranoa, and the honourable member' for Wide Bay. This is a time when the Government should not have followed the line of least resistance. That is - what they have clone. I wish to reply to the arguments advanced by the leader of the this: Opposition. I understand that the Ministry originally intended to adopt another course, and I wish they had adhered tr> that determination.'",58
395,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,- I have explained several times that under the Bill as it originally Stood an unexpended balance in respect of one item could be used if the maximum had been increased by regulation.,58
396,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I understand that the Attorney-General first proposed that if the amount set apart for distribution in respect of an item were not distributed in any one year, it should be added to the amount available for distribution in respect of that item during succeeding years.",59
397,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,I said that the maximum could be altered.,59
398,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I hope that the Attorney-General will not propose an amendment which will render it impossible for the Minister administering this measure to use the unexpended balance in respect of one item for the encouragement of an industry for which provision is made in another. The leader of the Opposition said that it would be unfair to allow money to be diverted in this way from one item to another, because in some cases three or four years would necessarily elapse between the inception of an industry and the time when the bounty relating to it could be claimed. If the Committee had had power to increase the amounts set apart in respect of these items, I am satisfied, from the tenor of the debate, that additions would have been made to the bounties on cotton, rubber, and rice. I look to this provision as being likely to afford an opportunity to supplement the amounts set apart to encourage those industries.",59
399,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE,B y sacrificing other items.,59
400,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No . What would be the result if, for a period of five years, no claim were made for the bounty under one of these' items ? For instance, it is proposed that £[25,000 shall be expended in an effort to encourage the production of linseed, and that sum is to be distributed over a period of five years. Are we to understand that a man is to be permitted to refrain from claiming the bounty until the last year, when there would be an accumulation of £25,000? He would thus be able to scoop the lot.",59
401,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVICE,It would be a good thing for the country if . the whole amount could be claimed.,59
402,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If that system is to be adopted, and these amounts are to be specially ear marked, a good many people will wait until practically the last moment before stepping into claim the bounty.",59
403,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In the case of linseed, to which the honourable and learned member has referred, a certain quantity must be produced. It would be impossible, for any one in one year to raise sufficient linseed to entitle him to claim the whole sum of £25,000.",59
404,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It was said that the Williamstown Woollen Mills set to work to secure the bounty granted by the Victorian Government, and closed down as soon as it had obtained it.",59
405,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,There is nothing to prevent the Government from guarding against! that which the honourable and learned member suggests. It is in their power not to add to the amount yearly payable in respect of any bounty if they think that anything of the kind which he suggests is being attempted.,59
406,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Some honourable members wish to prevent the Government from applying the unexpended balances in respect of some .of these items to others relating to industries that are taken up, and should be encouraged. I do not think it is reasonable to suggest that the Government would attempt to cripple any of the smaller industries in their desire to encourage the larger ones - If they did not desire an industry to flourish they certainly would not provide for it in the schedule. Hie Parliament itself cannot do much to encourage an industry. It can empower the Government to expend a large sum of money with that object in view, but the success of the movement depends entirely upon the administration of the law. The greater the trust we repose in the Depart; ment charged with the administration of this measure, the better it will be, and I hoDe that the Minister will carefully consider the point I have endeavoured to make.",59
407,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Bass) [10.28] - I am somewhat surprised at the argument which the honourable and learned member for Corio has advanced. Business men must know that any one who desired to earn one of these bounties would have to set to work at once fo secure it. When the honourable and learned member suggests that a man might wait until practically the last moment before taking steps to earn one of these bounties, and thus secure a lump sum of £25,000 in one year, he must imagine that this Bill is to apply to an island like that on which Robinson Crusoe lived for some time-to a country where competition is unknown. I take it that competition in Australia is so keen that any one who saw a prospect of earning £5,000 in one year would not think of waiting for five years in the hope that he would thus secure the accumulated bounty of £25,000.",59
408,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVICE,In some of these industries to which the schedule applies trees would have to be planted for five years before they would bear.,60
409,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I recognise that fact. Anv one desirous of earning one of these bounties will set to work as soon as possible to secure it. We may have implicit confidence in the capacity of the present Government to administer this measure, and to distribute the moneys voted in connection with it in an equitable manner; but we have to remember that the appropriation under it will extend over a number of years, and that during that time many changes of Government may take place. Honourable members in the Opposition corner have urged that the total appropriation under this Bill should be devoted to one or two industries, so that if they entered into possession of the Treasury tench they would probably be disposed to devote the amount set apart in respect of some of the smaller items in the schedule to one or two of the principal ones. That would be unfair to those who, on the passing of this Bill,took steps to establish some of these smaller industries. We must have finality in this matter, and I contend that the various amounts in the schedule should either be used for the purposes for which they are appropriated or not at all. When the honourable and learned member for Corio was speaking, I interjected that the matter would have to come before Parliament if the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Angas- a suggestion which the Attorney General accepted some time ago-were acted upon. I understood that the honourable and learned member for Corio thereupon pointed out that the matter would be in the hands of Parliament under any circumstances. It will be seen, however, that Parliament would be in a different position from that it now occupies in relation to the Bill. If I do not approve of an item in a Bill, I can vote against it without any injury to the Government, but if it be thought the Government are spending money in a wrong direction, and I vote against them, it amounts to a want of confidence vote. Under such circumstance* the independence of honourable members sitting behind the Government is taken away; and it is far better not to allow such questions to become party matters.

Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.  ference to the repatriated Australians, I desire to read the following letter which I have receivedMethodist Parsonage, Rushworth, 30th July, 1907. Dear Sir, It is now a long time since the Government dumped down some twenty-seven returned Australians from South Africa here. They were informed by some one in the office of the Closer Settlement Board that work would be waiting for them on. their arrival in Rushworth. The whole thing was a sad bungle both for the men and the public of this town, on whose charity they were cast. A public subscription was made, but this was insufficient, to provide for them until the Government (State) agreed to give them a fortnight's work at Waranga Basin. Three gentlemen here had in addition to what they did before, to guarantee six or seven publicans the cost of the keep of most of these men for a time feeling that when the authorities were made aware of their action they would reimburse us for this outlay : indeed, possibly return the public subscription in full , seeing that the fault lay solely with the authorities who sent the men here. I communicated with Mr Jenkins, of the Closer Settlement Board, and the usual printed P.C. reply came to say that the matter should receive due attention. After a considerable lapse of time and nothing further arriving, I again wrote Mr Jenkins, and two others signed the letter; but no reply has as yet come to hand. Will you kindly see Mr Jenkins or whoever is responsible and acquaint them with the fact that we are far from being satisfied with themanner in which our communications are being treated, a'nd urge upon him the reason and necessity' is for complying with our request?- I am, yours respectfully, on behalf of Messrs. O'Brien, MCNamara, Raynor, and self, F. C. VIAN. Is the Acting Prime Minister prepared to take any action in regard to this matter?",60

Mr WILSON (Corangamite) [10.41] - \ am rather astonished at the stand which been taken by honourable members into the Labour corner. The letter which has part been read by the honourable member for Echuca is quite pertinent to the work of - this Parliament, because it voted a sum to assist to repatriate Australians from South Africa. It appears that there has been a is mistake made here and there with regard to some men. Some men have been returned who cannot be described as desirthat able immigrants, and many men who were so described are not Australians. These men were landed here, in most instances, quite penniless. Through some mistakes on the part of.the authorities in Victoria, men were sent into country districts without any preparation having been made their reception, and the consequence has been that such cases as those described a in .the letter .just read have arisen. Certainly such mistakes are to be deplored, but I cannot see how the general question of is affected in the slightest degree. The. honourable members for Maranoa and Yarra have pointed to this corner as g being specially interested in this question.",61

420,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We in this corner are not responsible for the statements of Dr Arthur, and no man regrets more than I do the substance of his letters, which were read to us the other night by the honourable member; they certainly misrepresented the. position."" The only way to bring discuss us. about the proper settlement of persons in different parts of Australia is to tell them the truth. A system of immigration has been advocated only for the purpose' of opening up undeveloped territory, and is only a special class of men. who can be brought in as' suitable immigrants for that purpose. The Government pathize with a system of immigration. honourable members in the Labour corner have any objection, why do they not tack the Government ? - There would appear to be no necessity for doing that. They simply attack honourable members on this side, whereas we are above suspicion in this peal has been made to' the proper authori-matter.

The honourable member, in bringing that letter before the House, has rendered a far greater service than I think anticipated.

I do not defend him; certainly I do not defend the statements which have been recently made on his authority. But I remind honourable members that at the Imperial Conference the Prime Minister did very good work for Australia in securing the passage of resolution to the effect that a every effort should be made to divert immigration from the United Kingdom to other parts of the British Empire. I do not honwant the impression to go abroad that is any considerable party in Australia that objects to British immigration to .shores, nor do I wish to leave it to be I understood that honourable members opposite are the only representatives of the people in this House who are in favour of that policy. There is plenty of work in Australia for men to do, and if we are to defend Australia, we shall require plenty of immigrants. The arguments of the orable member for Maranoa are answered by himself. He acknowledged that in western districts of Queensland Immigrants are wanted.

That was done at the instance-o r rather upon [he information-of the States, who were informed by their representatives in South Africa that there were there stranded tralians who desired to return to their country. Surely no one can blame the vernment for bringing them back. I think that the House has always commended Government for what it did in that respect. I am aware that there were amongst the returned immigrants twenty-two men who, had not been in Australia beany fore. But that is a very small promembers portion. Mr Valder, who looked after the shipping of the men from South Africa, his work very well, in my opinion. know him personally. He was selected by the Prime Minister at the time when it was determined to give these stranded Australians an opportunity to return, because he was well known, had done good work in f4«] honSouth Africa, and could be trusted. The Federal Government has really nothing to the do with the men once they arrive in the States. The States Governments take speech charge of them. We never undertook that to duty. The States Parliaments are the that places in which to bring this matter for the ward, although, of course, if the Federal the Government knew that these persons starving it might take action. I hope that the information having been made public and the matter having been ventilated as it has been, the State Government will see that something is done, and that the men referred to are not left stranded. They have got into their present position by some mistake, and they should in the letter be looked after. Para- Mr FISHER - The question really is whether the Government are prepared to do Rutherglen anything to pay the bills.",64
439,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If it is the and duty of any one to pay the bills, it rests read by upon the State Government rather than not upon the Federal Government. An honorfault able member asked whether I was aware exthat the State Government of New South arWales was assisting immigrants to come for the men to out to that State?",64
440,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Federal Government cannot prevent that.,64
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I was going to say that we could take no action if the memassisted immigrants were not improperly prebrought out under contract, and were not' men undesirable immigrants. With those exceptions the State Government are free to bring as'many assisted immigrants to New South Wales as they please. The Federal Government has no control over the action of a State Government in that respect. I Ausbelieve that the State Government of own Queensland is adopting a similar course. GoThe Federal Government has no power to. interfere with the introduction of such imthe migrants unless they are introduced improperly under contract, or are for any. reason prohibited immigrants. There is so far no necessity for the Government to take action. From what I know of the' of the State Government of Victoria they will not let the matter mentioned did by the honourable member for Echuca rest, I but will at once see that the men who have been referred to shall not be allowed to starve or, indeed, to have occasion to beg. Question resolved in theaffirmative. Hoiise adjourned at II a p.m.",64
