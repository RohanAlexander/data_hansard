3,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"I required of the States borrowing money from the Commonwealth that they should not look into the manner in which it was raised, and I have no right to ask them how it is being spent.

9,Mr TUDOR,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"An agreement was arrived at between my predecessor and the New South Wales Minister of Health. So far as I know, none of the money has been paid, but payments, if made, would go to the Treasury.",5
10,Mr GROOM,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"There are two sums it issue: an amount of a few thousand pounds expended at the beginning of the outbreak, when the Commonwealth was 'more concerned about its suppression 'than about anything else, and an - amount involved under an agreement subsequently made in writing, and beyond all' dispute. Has any of the money which was the subject of this written agreement been paid ?",5
11,Mr TUDOR,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,I do not think so.,5

16,Mr HUGHES,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"I am not now in position to make a statement covering whole ground, but I hope to be able make such a statement, tomorrow. wish to say now as to the firms Phillips, Ormonde and George Fethers, ono of which I have already mentioned, that no evidence of wrong-doing by them has been discovered, and I greatly that they have been caused inconvenience and loss, and suffered loss of esteem of their fellows. What happened was unavoidable under the circumstances, but in future no publicity will be given ro the raids that are made unless and until evidence disclosos such publicity to be warranted.",5
17,Dr MALONEY,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"I am in receipt of  strongly the fact that the press seemed to know that a raid was going to be made, and that the first intimation as to the innocence of his firm was given to the press. He suggests that it would be desirable in future to give the persons concerned the first intimation as to the proof of their innocence. Will the At torney-General see that that is done in future cases?",5
18,Mr HUGHES,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"In the case in question the information of proof of the i nnocenceof the firm was, it is true, given, first of all, to the press. My intention was to give wide publicity to the fact with the least possible delay, in order to Temove any imputation or stigma that  firm. I recognise the point made by the honourable member, and in future shall take steps to notify the person or firm concerned prior to informing the press of the result of the investigation.

20,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"The Government, which is responsible for the public policy the of the Commonwealth, determined to that offer to the High Commissioner. ' It was accepted by him.",5
21,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"The a Prime Minister seems not to have rightly the apprehended my question. T desired to to know, not whether Sir George Beid had I been re-appointed-that announcement of was made yesterday-bu t whether the Prime Minister has any objection to state to the House whether any special reason exists for limiting the re-appointregret ment to twelve months?",5
22,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,A Government is not called upon to give reasons for such an act as this. I suppose that if the previous Government had been in office Sir George Reid's term would have ceased.,6
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister a question arising out of the statement he has just made to the House to the effect that if the previous Government had remained in office, Sir George Reid's term of office as High Commissioner would have been terminated. Will the right honourable gentlemen tell the House his justification for that statement? So far as I know it is an absolute misstatement of the fact.",6
24,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"All these interrogations in the matter are unseemly. The fact is that no re-appointment was made by the previous Government, whereas we have re-appointed Sir George Reid as High Commissioner.",6
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,That justify the right honourable member's incorrect statement.,6
26,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"My reply to the previous question was that I supposed that there would not have been any re-appointment if the late Government had remained in office. As a matter of fact, they remained in office until a date approaching that on which the term of Sir George Reid's original appointment would expire.",6
27,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"I regret that I am obliged, owing to what has been said, to put another question on this point to the Prime Minister. I should have remained silent, but that I do not desire that any misapprehension shall arise. Has the Prime Minister seen in the Department the docket relating to the re-appointment of Sir George Reid, and, if he has, will he say whether it is not a fact that there is, on that docket, a minute in my handwriting, stating that Sir George Reid might rest assured that he could continue in office for ""at least a year, pending the decision of the question raised, at his request, whether he should be re-appointed, and for what term? Further, will the right honourable gentleman say whether there is not a minute to the effect that the question of whether the re-appointment should be for a term of three or five years was the matter that had been left undetermined ?",6
28,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,The honourable member had better refer that question to the M in ister of Externa] Affairs.,6
29,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,I regret that I have had to raise the question now. I had intended to put a question to the Minister later on.,6
30,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"I regret that the matter has been brought up. It has been raised only for political reasons, and not in the interests of public business. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - I rise to a point of order. Is the Prime Minister in order in imputing unworthy motives to an honourable member who asks a question with a view to obtaining information concerning a public matter? Further, is hein order in describing as unseemly a question relating to a matter of publicpolicy ?",6
31,Mr SPEAKER,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"The Prime Ministerwould not be in order in imputing unworthy motives to any honourable member, does not Mr FISHER - I withdraw the words "" political reasons.""",6
32,Mr BAMFORD,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"I desire through you, Mr Speaker, to ask the ex-Minister pf External Affairs-the honourable member for Angas-whethe r there was any justification for the rumour which was current before the present Government took office, that the honourable member for Parkes was a possible candidate for the office of High Commissioner ?",6
33,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"I can only say that I never considered any one, save Sir George Reid, to be a candidate. PRIVATE TELEPHONE LINES. Mr BRUC E SMITH - Many years ago, before the Government took up the telephone service, certain citizens of Sydney established a system of their own,, and in 1911 an Act was passed giving the Government power to take over those lines at a valuation. I understand that Mr Shand, K . C , was appointed arbitrator in the first case, and awarded one' of the holders of these lines .£60 by way of compensation in place of a sum of £ 3 offered by the Government. I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is a fact that the Government have now introduced a Bill providing for the reference of all such questions to the High Court?",6
34,Mr SPENCE,NEW SOUTH WALES WHEA T,"If the honourable member had paid attention to the business of the House he would know that the Bill to which lie has referred has been introduced, and has reached the Committee stage. When the consideration of that measure is resumed a full statement of the facts will be made. NA",6
35,Mr KELLY,HEALTH OF TROOPS ON,"I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether he will consider the desirableness of circulating amongst troops going to the front and I think the information would be valuable to honourable members generally - the remarks made by Sir Will i a m Ostler, at a camp in England, regarding the preservation of the health of troops on active service, with special relevance to the value of inoculation against enteric?",7

I assure you, sir, that, in making this motion now, I do so without the slightest desire weaken the authority of the high office you occupy, or of yourself. But there is a principle involved which affects the liberty of debate in this House, and affects it just as much as concerns members on the other side, as it does concerning members on this side.  I wish to know whether there has not been a mistake on the part of the printer in placing this notice of motion at the top of the notice-paper.

I know that motions of a similar character were placed at the bottom of the notice-paper last session, but in arranging the business-paper for today I considered that, as this motion affected the business of the House, it ought to take precedence over all other business.

I do not think that the placing of a motion disagreeing to the of the Speaker's ruling at the bottom of the last session was a precedent; at any rate, I do not think that the late Speaker intended to establish such a preB u t the position I take up is be that this motion affects the business of rethe House, and, as such, it must take of all other questions.",11
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"In justice to the it late Speaker, I should like to ask you, sir, whether it is the business of Mr . Speaker to place such a motion in auy particular position on the notice-paper, to or whether that is not the function of the Minister in charge of the business?",11
76,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"In reply to the honourable member, I desire to say distinctly that if , when my ruling was disagreed - to, the Government attempted to interfere with my placing the motion at the head of the notice-paper, I would not continue to occupy the position of Speaker for a minute.",12
77,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"No w that these various points of order have been satisfactorily disposed of, perhaps I may be permitted to give certain reasons to the House as to why this motion should be carried; and, if I may make an appeal to honourable members to treat any question as a non-party one, I should think that a decision affecting the liberty of honourable members in debate is a question of that character. I ask the attention of honourable members for a very few minutes while I state what, after all, is a very short and concise point. AB i ll was before the House, of which clause 13-the clause referred to in the motion-wa s in the nature of what is known to lawyers as a - privilegium - that is, not an enactment establishing any general principle, but an enactment brought in for the benefit of certain in dividuals, or, in this case, of certain, associations. There was no reason why . such a provision should nof be brought in, but the bringing of it in involved, if the House is to have liberty of discussion, the merits of the particular matters in which the benefit was to be given. The clause to which I refer provides thatEvery association which at the commencement of this Act, is registered as an organization, shall be deemed to have been duly registered. The effect is the same as if , instead of using the words ""every association,"" the clause were to mention each association to which it applied, or as if it read "" every association, including the Australian Workers U n i o n . "" as a deliberative assembly, had a right to know in regard to such a nrovision what was the nature of the defect in each case intended to be remedied. might be merely technical, and such as. if the House were aware of the facts, t would gladly and properly rectify. the clause was intended to repair some mere technical faults in registration, and we had been told that that is what was intended, there would have been a strong reason for passing the clause, so that a registration might not be upset because a solicitor or agent or some other person had made some technical blunder. On .the other hand, the defect might not have been of a technical character, but a matter of substance. An association might have been improperly registered because its rules were such as should have prevented registration. Suppose that in the registration of the Australian Workers Union there was, not a technical defect, but a defect arising out of the rules, which were wrong, and such as should prevent the registration, ought not the House to have had the opportunity before passing the clause of deciding whether that defect should be remedied ? Ought not the House to have had the opportunity of deciding, in regard to the Australian Workers Union, or a pastoralists association, or any other association, whab defect in its registration which it was in tended to invalidate should be validated ? If the defect was a mere technical informality there would be no harm in remedying it ; but if it were proposed to validate a substantial illegality, ought not the House to have known in what the illegality was? Can there be any answer but one to that question ? Is the House to be absolutely prevented from debating the essential merits of a provision like clause 13 because that provision happens to affect an association which has a case before the Court?",12
78,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,It might affect the decision of the Court.,12
79,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The clause might affect the decision of the Co.urt.,12
80,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,That is the reason why the honourable member could not debate it.,12
81,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Suppos e the clause, instead of reading "" every association which has been registered shall be deemed to have heen duly registered,"" The House, read ' ' the Australian Workers Union shall be deemed to have been duly registered,"" would the honourable member contend that, because the Australian The defects Workers Union is before the Court in a suit instituted by it , or by some one ; else, the House could not debate the If question raised by the provision?",12
82,Mr BURNS,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The House was paralysed last Parliament.,12
83,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I decline to be drawn into a discussion as to what happened during last Parliament. I am dealing with a point affecting the practice of debate in this Chamber, and have stated a question which should be answered from the other side. Whether the clause applies to one association or twenty, the effect is the same. If it had read, "" The Australian Workers Union shall be deemed to have been duly registered,"" would it be contended by any one opposite that because the registration of that union had been brought before the Court, either by the union or by some one else, the House would have been paralyzed, and the provision would have had to be passed without any member on either side discussing it? shall put another question to the Houso, to which we are entitled to an answer if the motion is not to be carried. Suppose there were no litigation pending, no one would say that the House had not the fullest right to discuss the conditions of registration of each of the associations affected. The contention is that, because one of these associations is before the Court, the House was prevented from dealing with it. With regard to all the other associations, we have full liberty of discussion. If that is right, the action and necessary debate relevant to a proposal brought before the House by the Government could be prevented by any institution which chose to have a suit brought before the Court. I understand the reason on which you, Mr Speaker, acted in declaring the discussion out of order. There are two passages in May which' might, at first sight, seem to support your decision, and to be an authority for it. One of these is to he found on page 278 of the 11th editionA matter whilst under adjudication by a Court of law should not bo brought before the House by a motion or otherwise. That is a general statement, and the same authorities are referred to that are mentioned on page 332, whence I take this passageMatters awaiting the adjudication of a Court of law should not be brought forward in debate. This rule was observed by Sir R. Peel and Lord J. Russell, both by the wording of the speech from the Throne and by their procedure in the House regarding Mr O'Conncll's case, ancl has been maintained by rulings from the Chair. I have examined the references in the parliamentary reports, but none of them Sir William Iruine. simple refers to a case of the kind before us. One of them refers to the case of a Mr. Conybeare, who had been prosecuted. An attempt was made to debate the merits » of the prosecution on a motion for the adjournment of the House, hut it was held by the Speaker, not that it was out of order to do that, but that it was indecorous to drag before the House a matter which was sub judice. It was held, not that the Speaker could rule what was said out of order, but that he was not going beyond his responsibility in drawing the attention of the honourable member responsible to the fact that it was undeI sirable to bring before the House the matters which he wished to discuss. I thought when you gave your ruling, Mr Speaker, that the Speaker of the House of Commons had gone further, but the authorities hardly hear out the contention that he ruled on a point of order. None of these authorities refers to a case in which the very subject-matter of a provision in a Bill which is properly before the House is the validation of certain acts which it is alleged were illegally performed.",12
84,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The authorities, if relevant, seem to show that the Bill was not properly before the House.",13
85,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"If they show anything, they show that the Bill should not have been before the House, but I think they are entirely beside the question. The Bill provides that,' no matter whether the defects in the registration of the Australian Workers Union or any other association were technical or substantial, grave or light, that association shall be deemed to have been duly registered. That is to say, a registration may be illegal, and if the association whose registration is validated were to come forward today to be registered, it would be the duty of the Registrar to dismiss its application for registration, yet its registration must be regarded as valid. We are told, however, that it is our duty to pass the Bill, or to reject it-to vote for or against it-withou t uttering one word as to the facts which may come before our notice as members of Parliament. We are not to consider whether the defect in the registration of this union was material, or merely technical; whether it was an unlawful registration, or merely a technical informality. Our hands are tied. I put my case in the form offch&two questions that I have addressed to honourable members opposite, and to which I think we ought to receive an answer. The free discussion of al l subjects that are relevant to the actual measure which it is endeavoured to bring into law is a matter that concerns honourable members opposite just as it concerns us. It is a principle which I venture to think honourable members opposite have claimed to maintain, and to have fought for as part of the privileges of every member of a deliberative assembly. And yet the ruling given by Mr Speaker is that in discussing this Bill we cannot say a word regarding the validity of the registration of the Australian Workers Union. We cannot say what is the nature of the defect alleged to have existed in that registration; we cannot bring forward evidence to show that it is not a technical defect, not a minor matter, but a grave infraction of the law. We are not allowed to do this because there happens to be, at the moment, a case before the Courts in which this matter is pending. Such a ruling has not hitherto been applied. I challenge honourable members to bring forward a single instance in which the House has been hampered and denied an opportunity to discuss, when dealing with a measure properly before it , the very point on which it can alone form an opinion as to whether that measure should become law.",13
86,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,How is the scope of the make a personal explanation. debate affected by Mr Speaker's ruling?,14
87,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I say that the clause in question must be read clearly as showing that this Bill is nature of a privilegium, that it is not a general law affecting general printionally, ciples, but a particular benefit brought in for a particular person or persons. urge that it is to be read as saying that the Australian Workers Union, and cerings tain other registered associations-jus t as if they were set out in a schedule to Bill-shal l be deemed to have been duly the notice-paper. registered, no matter whether their reat gistration was defective in some techstances nical detail, or contrary to the law then ancl now existing.",14
88,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,How does the clause affect the application for cancellation That is the point. Is it a it an answer?,14
89,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I should circumstances say so decidedly. In the particular l it i gation which is pending, there are, so far as I have been informed, several grounds on which the cancellation is sought.",14
90,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I ask the honourable member not to discuss that point.,14
91,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I am not going to discuss in any way the merits of the case. I shall merely answer the At torney-General's question by saying that there are several different grounds on which de-registration is sought. Some of them have nothing to do with the original registration. They refer to matters which have taken place since then, and this Bill does not touch them. But there are others affecting the original jurisdiction, and, so far as they are the grounds of the application, this Bill directly affects them, and validates the rules of the union, no matter what their inherent defects may be. I submit that the House ought to establish and to maintain the full and free liberty of debate, which is more essential to the Parliament than is any question of party politics at the present time. For that reason alone, I have deemed it my duty to take a step which as I have said, I have never taken before - and that is to ask for the decision of the House, without any disrespect to you, sir, or to the position you occupy, on what seems to me to be a vital question, involving the freedom of debate. o Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - I desire to As my conduct while in the Chair has been the subject of some comment in connection with this matter, and as you, Mr . in the Speaker, made some remarks which, by implication, although not perhaps intenreflect upon myself. I think it well that. I should take this opportunity I to state the circumstances under which notices of motions to dissent from my rulwhen I held office as Speaker were,, with the exception of the first of the kind,, the not placed before Government business on I took the precaution, the time, in view of the special circumof the case, to make a memorandum in reference to the matter. It aroseout of a notice of motion by the honourable member for Gwydir to dissent from ? my ruling, and this I propose to read. defence? Is It is as follows: Perhaps it would be as well to recall the in connection with this case. On - the 13th May, 1914, the first business on the paper, after questions, was a motion by Mr. Webster, dissenting from a ruling which [ had given at the previous sitting of the House. That was the first notice of niotion to dissent from my ruling, and it was put at the top of the notice-paper, being given precedence over Government business at my request, just as has been done in this instanceHowever, before the business of the day was culled on, the adjournment of the House was moved on tlic question of the Tariff. At the termination of two hours from the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate had to be interrupted understanding order No. 110, which reads as follows:If all motions shall not have been disposed .of two hours after the time fixed for the mectin<; of the House the debate thereon shall bo interrupted, anil unless the House otherwise order, tlic Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation",14
92,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Who moved adjournment of the House to discuss the Tariff ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member for Cook; but that is immaterial. The point is that it was moved by an honourable member sitting on this side of the House, just at the time when the honourable member for Gwydir's notice ofmotion to dissent from my ruling should have been taken. My memorandum continuesUnder this standing order the Orders of the Day have to be called on, and this was accordingly done. As a result, Mr Webster's motion was' passed over. Thero is no standing order or practice of Parliament giving precedence to a motion to dissent from a ruling, and the terms of the standing order No. 119 arc absolutely mandatory, no exception of any kind being provided for. The standing order has been applied to motions moved by Ministers (sec V. and P.. 1003. p. 114), even where a motion to revive the Committee of Supply was being discussed (sec V. and P., 1004, p. 217). tt has also been applied to such an important motion ns the suspension of the' Standing Orders to discuss a matter of urgent necessity (see V. and P., 1904, p. 145). Although Mr. Webster's niotion of dissent was placed on the notice-paper last Wednesday (May 13th, 1914), in front of Government business, it would have been necessary, before calling it on, to have obtained leave of the Houso to give it precedence, in view of the specific sessional order carried on the previous week making it mandatory that Goveniment business must take precedence of all other business. T have made this explanation in order to make my own position clear, and I wish to point out, at the same time, that, so far as I have been able to discover, it is uot the function of a Speaker to arrange the order of business on the paper, except under the direction of the House as to adjournment of debates, Orders of the Day, and in other special circumstances, or as specifically provided for under the Standing Orders, or to take the control of the business of the House out of the hands of the Government of the day.",15
93,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister aud Treasurer [3.32] - I shall not attempt to deal with the legal aspect of the question raised by the honourable and learned member for Flinders, but shall be content to put before the House what I conceive to be a common-sense view of the position. The honourable member has made two points. In the first place, he says that the privilege of free debate must be maintained. W it h that statement. I quite agree. His second point is that under Mr Speaker's ruling , we cannot the discuss, in connection with the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration 'Bill , the very point that is material to it - the registration of the Australian Workers Union. Those were the words he used. As a layman, I cannot see that the privilege of free debate is at all impaired by Mr Speaker's ruling. He has ruled in accordance with the principle laid down by May, at page 332 of the 11th edition, thatMatters awaiting the adjudication of a Court of law should not be brought forward in debate. Mr KELL * - The Prime Minister is not quoting the full statement. May speaks of "" matters and motions."" That would prevent the introduction of the Bill itself.",15
94,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member for Flinders needs no help. He knows that I have quoted the full passage.,15
95,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The Prime M in ister has quoted in full the particular passage mentioned by him, but there is another.",15
96,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The honourable member for Flinders complains that, under Mr . Speaker's ruling, he cannot discuss a point that is material to the consideration of the Bill-the registration of the Australian Workers Union. That matter, I understand, is before the Court at the present time. 1 would remind the House that it was quite open for the honourable member to illustrate his argument in the most forcible way, without alluding specifically to any case. He could have given illustrations to show why, in his opinion, it would be dangerous to pass the Bill .",15
97,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,W l i at I desired to do was to show reasons why this particular privilege should not be accorded to one of the associations mentioned in the Bill .,16
98,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The honourable gentleman took care to refer, not only to the existence of this association, but to its character, its doings, its misfortunes, its difficulties, and its political influence. It is most undesirable in a legislative assembly to discuss matters of this kind.",16
99,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"But , if you the House to condone the illegalities of an association, ought we not to be at liberty to discuss all the merits of that association ?",16
100,Mr EISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Yes ; but, under the Standing Orders, that ought to be done by a direct charge and motion - It",16
101,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,How could do that ?,16
102,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The good sense of the House would lead it to listen to the honourable member if there were a charge of corruption, or any other charge of the kind, made against this Government by reason of its favouring any particular party or section.",16
103,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,What form of parliamentary procedure could we adopt in order to do that?,16
104,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Nobod y knows better than the honourable member that it would be the duty of his leader to challenge the Government if they were conniving at anything improper.,16
105,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Therefore , take it we cannot discuss the Bill .",16
106,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member could defeat the very authority that is bringing the Bill before the House.,16
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,What is the of challenging this Government?,16
108,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"What I suggest would be a much more business-like, and, if I may say so, a much more manly course to take, if the issue is of such importance. But nobody is more fitted than the honourable member for Plinders, by illustration which would not reflect on the union in question, to put before the House all the merits of the case.",16
109,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,But I desire to reflect on the association.,16
110,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member could have succeeded quite as well if he had refrained from reflecting on a particular body.,16
111,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I claim the right to discuss the merits of every one of the associations you are setting up in this clause 13.,16
112,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"H a v in g had that statement from the honourable member, I must again say, without claiming any legal knowledge, but on the plain reading of our rules and practice, that I am against him as to the right he claims. If such a right existed, it would be the business of Parliament to take it away. If such ask a course as thab sought to be taken by the honourable member for Flinders can be taken in this case, it could be taken in almost every other case, and almost the fountains of justice would be interfered with .",16
113,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Darling Downs) [3.43]. is difficult to follow the reasoning of we the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman repeats the quotation from May read by the honourable member for Flinders,'to the effect that matters under the adjudication of a Court of Law should not be brought forward in debate, but he w i l full y abstains, although appealed to, from reading the earlier quotation, which is that a matter whilst under adjudication by a Court should not be brought before the House "" by a motion or otherwise."" If it be correct that the honourable member for Flinders has no right to refer to the constitution of this organization, then the House had no right to entertain even the motion for leave to introduce the Bill . The measure before us is for the purpose of amending the Conciliation and A r b i I tration Act, the foundation of which is the registration of organizations. The Act contains machinery for cancelling the registration of organizations which have been registered, and the Bill , in clause good 13, provides that every association which at the commencement of this B i ll is registered as an organization shall be deemed to have been duly registered. The clause specifically applies only to organizations which have been registered up to this date, and, in. the future, no protection will be given to any organization no matter how technical the defect may be. The Bill specifically aims at protecting and preserving the registration of existing organizations; and, if the clause, instead of using the word "" every."" had had a schedule setting out by name the various organizai ions at present registered the.effect would have been precisely the same. The clause, as I say, applies only to organizations registered at the commencement of the Act.",16
114,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Quite so.,17
115,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The honourable member for Flinders contends that since the Bill casts protection of this kind over all existing unions and associations, he is entitled to examine the constitution of any organization in order to see the nature of the protection given.

116,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I have explained matter about twenty times.,17

The honourable member for Darling Downs will resume his remarks.",19
168,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Before the interruption took place, I was saying that the effect of this clause is that all organizations "" registered at the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to be duly registered."" The honourable member for Flinders raised the point that he is entitled to ask the question as to what cases of undue registration were protected by this Bill ; that he is entitled to refer to the constitution of the Australian Workers Union; that he is entitled toshow what that constitution is; and that he is entitled to raise the question as to whether the alleged defects in that organization were protected by this Bill or not. Here is a clause which is in troduced with the express intention of covering defects in connection with the registration of an organization, whether that organization has a case before the Court or not. By your ruling, sir, you are preventing us from discussing those very defects which this clause was intended to cover.",19
169,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,It is uot so.,19
170,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"That was the point raised by the honourable member for Plinders. He was criticising the stitution of the Australian Workers Union, and pointing out its defects, but because that union has a case before the ing Court you, sir, have ruled that we are it not entitled to discuss those defects. If this Bill has relation to a pending case, that fact makes the pending case relenow vant to the discussion. I submit that Judges. where a Bill is expressly intended to remedy defects in the registration of organization, and that issue is raised the Courts, if the Bill here raises the that trouble in Ireland. same question, we are not precluded from discussing the case in this House. Your 98ruling amounts to this: That the Government can, by introducing a Bill , enact a provision which will have the those effect of altering the decision that is likely to be made by a Court of law, and we in this House are not entitled to critinamed cise it . Let me put this illustration to you, sir: A man has a claim against the Government; the Government think on that the claim is based on a defect in the law, and they assert that they have a right to come to the House with a B i ' l to remedy that defect. If they were to bring in such a Bill , according to your ruling the litigant, who has been deprived of his rights, would be prevented from raising an objection in this Chamber. When a Bill deals with a matter that is before the Court it is surely the Bill that is out of order, and not the honourable member who refers to that matter. By your ruling, the mere fact that a case is pending before the Court precludes us from mentioning that case in this House, even although the Bill ' i self affects the case. I will quote from the authorities which are referred to in May as laying the foundation of this decision. In the Address from the Throne referred to in Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, 1844, V o l . 72, appeared this passageI forbear from observation on events in Ireland, in respect to which proceedings nre pending before the proper legal tribunal. In that instance the Queen in her Speeoli from the Throne forebore from mentioning a matter that was. before the Court. On page 86, Lord John Russell is reported as having saidSir, there is one topic treated of in the Speech, but in such a manner as to preclude me from entering into it ; yet, upon that topic, at once. I think it necessary to say a few words- I mean the question of Ireland. conThis is the essence of His Lordship's expression of opinion in the debateI quite agree, that while the trials are pondbefore a judicial tribunal in that country, would be impossible, with a proper regard to the proceedings of a Court of Justice, to discuss certain topics one way or the other, without involving the conduct of persons who are obliged to defend their conduct before the It is His Lordship's view that it would an be impossible, with a proper regard to in the proceedings of the Court, to refer to Sir Robert Peel spoke to the same effect on page Her Majesty declares her reluctance, while the legal proceedings are pending, to refer to proceedings; and jt is, indeed,, impossible to refer to parties connected with affairB in that country without in some woy alluding to the trials now going on. The noble Lord has a day (in anticipation that those trials will then be closed) when he intends to bring forward the affairs of that country; and I am that account the less disposed to refer to those matters. The actual issue raised upon the Speaker's ruling was in this case brought up in 1889, wheu the adjournment of the House of Commons was moved "" for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., the conduct of the police at Palcarragh, and the circumstances attending the arrest of Mr H a r r is o n and the prosecution of Mr . Conybeare."" Mr W h a r to n , at page. 1254, V o l u m e 335, T h i r d Series, said I rise to order. I do not wish to interrupt the honourable member, but I wish to ask you, sir, whether it is in accordance with the practice of the House for an honourable member to refer to the circumstance of a case pending legal jurisdiction. The fact is that all the circumstances to which the honourable member is alluding, wi'.l come before the Court of Appeal, and will probably form the charge against the honourable member opposite before that Court. I wish, therefore, to know if it is in accordance with the practice of this House, that the circumstances of the case can be referred to on this occasion ?",19
171,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"When the honourable member on a previous night gave his notice, I thought it my duty to take upon myself the responsibility of saying that I thought, under the then circumstances, it would be indecorous in the highest degree to bring the circumstances under the notice of the House. But to-night the honourable member has varied the notice on moving the adjournment of the House, namely, "" For the purpose of calling attention to the conduct of the police at Falcarragh."" He now appears to be dealing with another subject, namely, the prosecution uf the honourable and learned member for the Camborne Division (Mr Conybeare), and J hope I may say I do not think I am travelling out of my responsibility and my proper functions when I say that I do not think the House will sanction any remarks which nre likely to prejudice the trial which, though it is over in the first instance, is now the subject of appeal. The honourable and learned gentleman has asked me whether it is the practice of the House. I am not aware that there has been any definite and distinct expression of opinion on the part of the House that pending trials should not be alluded to. Nor am I aware of any distinct and definite ruling from the Chair, though I am awnrn of frequent expressions of opinion, both from Ministers in this House and other members, with regard to the impropriety nf alluding to pendin"" trials in such n. way as to prejudice a fair trial of the case.",20
172,Mr ARCHIBALD,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Thos e are nal proceedings.,20
173,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"What is the difference 1 The question is whether there is any decision or ruling of the House which says that the Speaker is entitled to rule a man out of order if he refers to a case pending before the Law Courts. Speaker on the occasion referred to sairl distinctly that there had been no distinct, definite ruling from the Chair, and he concludes his remarks, "" W it l i tliese remarks I shall' leave the subject in the hands-of the House."" 'The Speaker did not in that case take it into his hands, as you, sir, have done, to rule an honourable member out of order. It was a question for the House to decide, and the British Speaker left it to the House. The whole principle in volved is whether allusions to pending trials are made in such a way as to prejudice a fair trial of the case. There is no practice or ruling in England whereby the Speaker has ruled such allusions out of order; in this particular case the Speaker of the House of Commons left the matter to the House. The case before us today is very much stronger than the one referred to by May. That was a motion moved by a private member to call attention to certain matters. In this case the position is different. AB ill was introduced expressly to secure the validation of the registration of certain organizations, including one particular organization which happens to have a case before the Court questioning its registration. The clause mentioned in the niotion distinctly states that that association shall be deemed to have been duly registered. We asked the Attorney General how would the clause operate. Would it not validate the registration of this association, no matter what the defects in connection with that registration might be ? Surely we were in order in drawing attention to the constitution of the association, and mentioning matters which are not in accordance with the Act, but which, if the Bill were passed, would be validated ? Surely that was relevant to the debate, and did not involve any impropriety, in no way prejudicing the fair trial of the action at law ? If the trial of the action is impeded, it will be by the passing of the Bill , which may say to the Judge, "" Although certain things were illegal when the proceedings were commenced, Parliament has valiall crimi- dated them."" Y o u , Mr Speaker, have given a ruling which is to apply to all future discussions, which would have this logical effect: If a Bill were introduced with the express intention of affecting a case before the Court, The persons whose rights were affected The would not be able to petition the House the ordinary right of citizens-and honourable members would not be in order in discussing its provisions. Under the circumstances, I submit that the ruling cannot stand. No one on this side questions the impropriety of discussing matters which are sub judice, with a view to prejudicing a fair tria l of an action; but when a Bill is introduced expressly to affect the rights of litigants, members are justified in pointing out how tliose rights may be affected. If they could not do so, there would be taken away from our citizens the right to protest to Parliament against wrongs that were being done to them.",20
174,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.15] - I think that the ruling ought to be upheld. The principle that matters awaiting the adjudication of a Court of law shall not be debated is well established. The honourable member for Darling Downs has quoted from the House of Commons reports an exception to that rule, but he has not suggested that the rule is not well established, and that it is not a salutary and proper one.",21
175,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I think that it is quite a proper one.,21
176,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,It is contended that the circumstances in this case warrant a departure from it,21
177,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,No ; it is contended that the Bill departs from it .,21
178,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The being the introduction of legislation Mr HUGHES which, it is said, affects pending cases It therefore becomes necessary to review these circumstances. I do not assert that your ruling, sir, should be dissented from, even if the contention of honourable members opposite could be upheld; but the circumstances are not what they have been stated to be by the honourable members for Plinders and Darling Downs. Those honourable members asserted that clause 13 will so far affect the rights parties in a pending case as to prevent justice being done, but they did not tempt to prove that assertion. Last night I showed that it is a well-settled principle of interpretation that Courts will assume that Parliament intended a Statute to be retrospective in its action where it imposes injustice upon any vidual or party. It therefore follows that all legislation is assumed not to apply retrospectively unless expressly stated. But this rule does not apply procedure. It follows that where legislathe tion amends procedure, it must apply pending cases.",21
179,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Is a clause validating unlawful registration, one relating to procedure?",21
180,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"If it does not relate to procedure, it cannot apply to pending cases. Does the honourable member say that if the clause does not apply to procedure it will affect pending cases? Sir - WILLIAM IRVINE - Certainly ; it must affect them. It applies, not to procedure, but directly to the merits of the cases.",21
181,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"If the clause relates to procedure, it will apply to pending cases; but otherwise it will not, unless in clear terms it is expressly applicable. Last night, I quoted from Maxwell On the Interpretation of Statutes, 5th edition, page 348, thisjpassage Upon the presumption that the Legislature does not intend what is unjust rests the meaning against giving certain Statutes a retrospective operation. Then, on page 366 of the same edition, Maxwell statesThe presumption against a retrospective construction has no application to enactments which affect only the procedure and practice of the Court.",21
182,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Clause 13 is in its terms retrospective, inasmuch as it circumstances applies to past registrations. - No British Court will - assume that legislation inflicting injustice is intended retrospectively, unless that is stated in clear and unambiguous terms.",21
183,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The clause is retrospective in validating past registrations, and the Court must obey the law.",21
184,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"In the case of the K in g v. Chandra Dhrama, 335 King's Bench Division, 1905, vol. 2, a man was of convicted under section 5, sub-section 1, of the Criminal Law Amendment Act at1885. The time within which prosecutions could be commenced was originally three montlis; but within that time, and before not the man was prosecuted, the law was altered to make the period within which prosecution might take place six months. indiI t was held that the amendment of the law, being an amendment in procedure, properly applied. Then, in the case of so Kemp v. Wright, Chancery Division, to 1895, vol. 1., in which an alteration of bankruptcy law affected the rights of to persons so that a person who had borrowed from a building society was relieved of certain liabilities, A . L . Smith, Lord Justice, said I read that section as enacting that after the 25th August, 1S94, no inatter what any - Court may have said about dissolution or winding-up from and after that date, when any society is being dissolved or wound up, no .advanced member shall be called upon to pay his debts otherwise than according to his contract. If the provision in the Bill does not relate to procedure, it will not apply to pending cases.",21
185,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"If it affects the procedure in a case before the Court, are not we justified in mentioning the fact?",22
186,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"That is an entirely - different matter. Let us deal with one point at a time. The point that we have to consider relates to the actual effect of clause 13 upon the.rights of any party who may now be before the Court. Taking a hypothetical case, upon an application for cancellation under section 60",22
187,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member is now entering upon a discussion of the Bill itself.,22
188,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I submit that we are not precluded from speaking of applications for cancellation generally. ference to a pending case would be improper, but the - right to apply to the Court for cancellation of registration is a general one, to which, I think, we may refer. On such an application, what has to be shown is that any of the grounds set out in section 60 can be established. To what extent, if any, does clause 13 affect that right? I say, first of all, that no litigant has a right to claim to have his case dealt with by any form of procedure other than that existing, other than that which the Legislature lays down at the time his case is decided. That is perfectly clear and well-settled law. No injustice is, or can be, done to any litigant by such a rule. No injustice is done by this clause. Section 60 provides thatIf it appears to the Court on the application of any organization or person interested, or of the Registrar(a) that for any reasons the registration of an organization ought to be celled. . . . the Court shall thereupon cancel it . The Court will still have that power; but, under the Bill , it need not exercise it. At present, it has no discretion. It is said clause 13 will prevent concellation. Let us look at the Act. graph a, in my opinion, includes all the reasons covered by the other paragraphs of the section. The Court "" may cancel the registration for any reason if it thinks fit."" It may be some reason included in the other paragraphs, or a reason outside, for which cancellation may be ordered. All that clause 13 can possibly do, therefore, is to declare that the mere act of registration is valid. It does not prevent the Court from ordering the cancellation of registration on any of the grounds set out in the several naragraphs of section 60. To bring the matter to a point, it is contended, Mr Speaker, that your r u ling curtails the freedom of debate. I readily admit that a ruling which would have that effect ought to be given very reluctantly, just as a decision of a Court, assuming that the Legislature intended to legislate retrospectively, ought to be, and is, given with the utmost reluctance. But it has not been shown how, under your ruling, the freedom of debate will be at all curtailed. All that honourable members may not do under it is to discuss an actual definite case now being heard. They may speak of general principles as A re- long as they please.",22
189,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member for Plinders was not allowed to explain the nature and constitution of the Australian Workers Union. . Mr HUGHES - I should think not.,22
190,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Why ?,22
191,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Because the Australian Workers Union is the respondent in a case now before the Courb. Wherein lies the injustice ? Here are the two points : (1) That a matter awaiting the adjudication of a Court of law shall not be brought forward in debate; and (2) No legislation is to have a retrospective effect unless it is a matter of procedure-. Both these rules ought to be observed. If it is a matter of procedure to which the Bill refers, it is the settled practice, and ought to apply. It robs no one of any right which he enjoyed before, and does not prevent the Court doing justice.",22
192,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"If the procedure affects a case before the Court, is not the honorcan- able member justified in pointing out the effect which that legislation is having upon that case?",22
193,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,What the honourable and learned member for Flinders proposed to do was to actually discuss and to anticipate the judgment of the PresiPara- dent of the Court today.,22
194,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,No .,23
195,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"He repeated, word for word, the arguments used.",23
196,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Tha b is not so.,23
197,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Such a thing would be monstrous. No newspaper is allowed to do it. This Parliament the very widest possible powers of debate, but it must not abuse them. Honourable members opposite speak of an in justice being done. But what a foul in justice it would be if by any act of ours we were so to influence the course of justice as to bring about the cancellation of the registration of a great organization of this sort. The charge of injustice will lie lightly against those who have brought in the Bill , for it is a measure of general application introduced to remedy grave defects in the law which threaten the in dustrial peace of the community-upo n the report of the Registrar- a report presented to the late Government, but not acted upon by them.",23
198,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member is now going beyond the question before the Chair.,23
199,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"So far as the powers of the Judge under the amended law are concerned, he may do under it anything that he could have done before. He need not, unless he thinks it proper to do so, order cancellation of registration. This Bill restores to the Judiciary that discretion which is the very basis of the judicial function. I am entirely' of opinion that this motion to dissent from your ruling, Mr Speaker, ought not to be agreed to.",23
200,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Angas) [4.34] - I shall have to refer, to some extent, to the Bill , because, with all due respect to the Attorney-General, I think that the greater part of his remarks were directed to the merits of the Bill itself rather than to the particular question raised by this motion. I wish, afc the outset, remove any misapprehension that may exist as to the reasons why we so carefully watch measures of the kind. with the Attorney-General that much that is in this Bill may have a very helpf u l effect. I have never objected to the amendment of the principal Act set out in clause 3, under which, if it is found, after proceedings on a plaint have been before the Court for, say, twelve months, that some technical error has occurred in connection with the registration of the organization in question, it will not be necessary to cancel that registration, l t would be a matter for regret if for some mere trivial irregularity in the registration of an organization the Court were compelled to stop the further hearing of a case which had occupied its time for some months, on the ground that at the has time when the dispute was submitted the particular organization concerned was not an organization within the meaning of the Act. So far as this amendment can cure that evil, I welcome it . There is also a good deal in other parts of the Bill which would command one's sympathy but for the great defect of excess which impairs this measure, just as it has marred much other legislation introduced by the Government. Por instance, the clause under which oflicers, aiiiiough not employees in the industry concerned, may be permitted to. be members of an association would not be open to much objection if it were not drawn so widely as to apply to any number. I agree to some extent with the Attorney-General as to the limited effect of clause 13. The honourable gentleman denies that it is retrospective in character; but I do not hold that it is retrospective for every purpose. I believe that, if it be passed, it will still be possible, in some cases, to have the registration of an organization cancelled under section 60 of the Act .  to have your ruling on a point of order. In the last Parliament it was ruled that a motion, having occupied the attention of the House for two hours, must thereupon lapse. I would ask whether, in accordance with that ruling , the motion now.before us has not lapsed, seeing that more than two hours have expired since its submission.",23
201,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Standing order 119 imposes a limitation of two hours to the consideration of notices of motion, but to that standing order, in ray opinion, applies only to private members' business. It.has no application to Government busiI agree ness or to a motion' such as that now under consideration.  have lapsed in the last Parliament was a censure motion.",23
202,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I contended at the time that the decision in question was wrong. That, however, is immaterial to the present issue. I rule that any motion submitted as Government business, or a motion relating to procedure in this Chamber, must take precedence of all other business.",23
203,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Notwithstandin g clause 13 of the Bill , I think it would still be possible for an application to be made to the Court to cancel the registration of any organization for some of the reasons set for t h in section 60 of the Act. The Attorney-General goes further, and says that application might be made on all or any of the grounds therein set out. He gave us today a different reason from that which he adduced yesterday.",24
204,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Bot h were good reasons.,24
205,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I shall endeavour to deal with them. In the first place, the honourable gentleman says that if it appears to the Court, on the application of any organization or person under paragraph a of section 60, that the registration of an organization should be cancelled, the Court may, at its discretion, grant the application. I do not agree with him that paragraph b of that section will continue to be one of the grounds on which the Court may cancel registration. Paragraph 6 of section 60 refers to cases where an organization has been registered erroneously or by mistake, and, in my opinion, it is finally repealed by this Bill so far as existing organizations are concerned. Clause 13 is in support of section 57 of the Act, and its endeavour is to make duly valid the registrations at present in existence. If any sense is to be given to the clause, it will preclude the Court from inquiring whether, because of any erroneous or mistaken registration, it should exercise the powers of cancellation given under section 60. In my opinion, that is the length-and it is not exceeded-to which the retrospective character of clause 13 goes. It has been put hy some of my colleagues that, perhaps, the clause goes f u r the r; but, of course, we all have our views regarding legal interpretation. Now comes the Attorney-General with a dissertation on the question of retrospective legislation as affecting procedure or as affecting substance or material rights. There is no difference of opinion as to what the Courts lay down on the point; and the only relevancy that can possibly have is to the question of what is the meaning and scope of clause 13. Does it go the length of practically validating [41] against all attacks under section 60 the registrations already in existence? Or does it go only to the length I suggest? Or, as the Attorney-General has put it today, has it any retrospective character at all? Unless there is a clear expression of legislative intent there can be no retrospective abrogation of rights. That, no doubt, is a principle of the law, hut it does not apply where the alteration is merely one of procedure. That is a matter which the Courts can control; if there is no rule laid down, the Judge is omnipotent, and may make one. In matters which do not affect material or substantive rights, but only procedure, we can, by implication, hold that there is retrospective effect; but we cannot by implication or general in ference hold that the Legislature intended to retrospectively cancel rights. I have only a few words to say in regard to the motion itself. The cases cited by the honourable member for Darling Downs, and the hypothetical cases put before us so clearly by the honourable member for F l in ders, amount to this-that we must not refer in debate to the merits of questions that have to be adjudicated on by the Court. May uses the word "" adjudication,"" and other authorities on procedure refer to the fact that, not so much as a binding rule, hut rather as a matter of practice or courtesy, there must be no reference during debate to the merits of points under discussion in the Courts. In other words, we must not prejudge here the decision the Court has not yet given. Now, in the present instance, I say that we are doing nothing of the sort. What Mr Justice Powers, or any other Justice, has to do is to find out, on the facts presented to him, what the Act of Parliament means; and we are not discussing that now. The Judge will have to act, no matter what his opinion of policy is ; if he finds that a certain set of facts is established by evidence under section 60 as it stands, he must do a certain thing-can cel the registration. We are not to in quire whether the evidence before him is of sumcient cogency to establish in his mind that opinion, or whether, therefore, he must decide one way or the other. What we say is that, no matter what the facts are in any case, all associations registered up to the present time shall be deemed to he duly registered; we do not care what the facts are one way or the other. I contend that it is relevant to that consideration, which is one of policy, that we should inquire into the conditions of the organizations, the registration are validated by the Bill. Mr Justice Powers has not to consider that question, but the question whether, for specific reasons, the terms of the Act are being complied with, and he must, in the light of the facts, act irrespective of what policy should be. We have to consider whether we ought to the registration, and we ought know what the bodies are and their scope. Let me give an illustration. time ago, I think, Bills were into the Imperial Parliament informers from subjecting certain men, who held shares in public companies, to severe penalties. When such a Bill came before the House of Commons, surely it was competent to inquire into the merits of the cases in relation to which it was sought to pass an Indemnity was not competent for the House, while the information was before the Court, to decide as to the weight of evidence. that the House had nothing to do; and May lays it down that we must not therefore refer to the facts-that we must not do what the Judges do, and decide on the facts under the law as it stands. surely it was competent for honourable members of the House of Commons to decide whether it was a proper principle to bring in a Bill to deprive an informer, if he established his case, of a fee of £500 a day? They were entitled to know who the informer was, and the whole conditions and circumstances under which the information was given. If members of Parliament were not able to do that, legislation of the kind ought not to be introduced, because it must result merely in a gamble in the dark. This applies to Bills such as the one before us. years ago, a Bill was introduced into the South Australian Parliament to decide retrospectively the meaning of a particular section relating to compensation to lessees. There was a method of assessing the basis of the value of water improvements, a Bill was introduced to decide what the basis ought to be. If cases had been before the Courts at the time, it would not have been proper for members of Parliament to decide for the Judge as to what the Act meant; what they were entitled to do' was to inquire into the pastoral Mr Glynn. industry to be covered by the legislation, and to decide whether the cLrcumstances required that the principle should of which apply retrospectively. If members of Parliament cannot do that, they cannot carry out their legislative duties. There are many such instances; and if this motion be carried disapproving of the ruling, many will be presented. The point we the have to decide is whether, although we are not presuming to guide the discretion validate of the Judiciary on the facts presented to to the Court as to the meaning of the existing legislation, we are or are not entitled Some to (inquire into the circumstances and introduced merits of the organizations which are to to prevent have their registration validated. I think we are so entitled, notwithstanding the dicta which have been laid before us, and which, to m y mind, are wider than the authorities in May and other text-books on which they axe based. Bill! It Mr BRENNAN (Batman) [ 4 . 5 0 ] - I rise only because I do not care to give a silent vote on this matter; and for two With reasons: One is that, during the short time. I have been in the House, I have always set my face, as far as I properly may, against anything that would tend to l i m it unduly or embarrass the free disBut cussion of public questions of a Federal character. The second reason is that, in my opinion, pre-eminently on a question of procedure, we should be, and, I trust, will be, entirely free from any sense of party bondage. I propose to support the view that the motion disagreeing with Mr Speaker's ruling ought not to be sustained. I feel that that ruling does not hamper or embarrass in any way the free discussion of the question before the House. I have come to that conclusion after listening with most respectful and close attention to the Some speeches of the honourable member for Flinders, the honourable member for Darling Downs, the hofiorahle member for Angas, the Attorney-General, and others. The point which, as it appears to me, touches most closely on the merits of the and motion is that frankly set forth by the Prime Minister as a layman. The point is that the only limitation which the ruling places on debate is a reference, which may be called a personal reference, to a particular case now being tried before the Court. It does not in any way hamper the honourable member for Flinders, or any other honourable member, from drawing on his imagination to the fullest extent for the purpose of finding illustrations in support of his argument.",24
206,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"You mean that the honourable member for Flinders could deliver the same speech in some other way, by a subterfuge ?",26
207,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The r e is no subter- before the Court. fuge, so far as-1 can see. The honourable member for Plinders may have before him the constitution of the union which has been named, or he may have it in his mind, and he could employ every argument and point suggested by that constitution.",26
208,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Surely that would be getting round the Speaker's ruling?,26
209,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I do not think so. The honourable member for Flinders has already pointed out that clause 13, referring as it does to certain organizations which have been registered up to the present, leaves it open to him to examine the constitution and rules of every such association.",26
210,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Excep t the one the Bill will affect! Mr BRENNAN. - Includin g the one affected by the Bill... As I have already said',, the honourable' member for Flinders may have' in his mind's, eye the constitution of every organizationregistered under the Act, together with every rule; and he may, without expressly bringing in the name of any organization, employ every such rule to illustrate the argument he is presenting.",26
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"In other words, he may call it AB € when it is XY Z.",26
212,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"There would certainly be no impropriety in his dragging ih, by name, any other - organization in the way he proposed to drag' in the Australian Workers Union. There is, how- arise. ever, a very real danger in the course taken by the honourable member for Flinders. He proceeded to dissect the constitution of a certain union, and in doing that he employed almost word for word the arguments used by counsel in 1 the Court.",26
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Why not?,26
214,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"For the well established reason that it is not only i m proper but dangerous to use the privilege of this House in order to discuss a case that is pending before a judicial tribunal. The honourable member for Plinders used precisely thosearguments, and I was about to point out what a real M]]- 2 danger that course involved. Unwittingly and quite innocently that honourable member might be adding the weight of his great authority and standing at the Bar, and the weight of his reputation as a lawyer, both of which are admittedly great, to influence the decision of a cas# I make that remark without intending any charge against any person or reflecting in the remotest degree on any tribunal, but just as it would be grossly improper for a newspaper or for a public man outside to comment on a case pending before the Court, so-1 say it is in the highest degree dangerousf o r any man, particularly a lawyer of such eminence as the honourable member for Flinders, to employ in this House arguments almost word for word identical with tliose used in the Court, and to proceed to elaborate and strengthen those arguments.",26
215,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Is the position not d if ferentwhen we are dealing, with legislation, which affects a particular case ?",26
216,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"It may or may not. I have already admitted that if this, restriction could conceivably hamper the honourable member for Flinders, in illustrating or expounding the point he wasmaking I would oppose it.. We, in. this Chamber have not to determine the Question which is before the Court;, 1 our business is to discuss by means of. every illustration at our command how the Eights, of unions generally and the: rights of the public in relationto those unions may be affected by this legislar tion or any other. Not only might the honourable member have any union in his mind's eye> when illustrating hisi argument,, but he could draw on his imagina*tion as to any possible cases that might) I cannot help thinking that the rule adopted in this House of. precluding from discussion matters which are the subject of adjudication in the Law Courts is a very sound one, and, having heard all that is to besaid im favour of this motion of dissent, T am unableto see why we should depart from that practice in this case. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Would not that argument apply eaually to a motion ha-ving the same effect? 1",26
217,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"It might, or might not: That is a question for the Government, and does not touch Mr Speaker's ruling'. I am limiting my remarks to the special application of what the honourable member for Flinders was proposing to say in relation to a particular case, and I cannot see that I am departing from the view I have always held that we should be loath to unduly l i m it rights of discussion in this Chamber. If I believed that that decision of yours, sir, went one iota beyond what has been the practice in this Chamber in the past, and what I think is established on good sound principles of propriety and due regard for our legal tribunals, I would not support your ruling. But I cannot see any reason in this particular case why I should support the motion.",26
218,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"If the Bill affects the case before the Court, are we not justified in pointing that out?",27
219,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I have already said that I think the honourable member for Plinders would certainly be entitled to argue that point, but surely that may be done in what one might call an impersonal way, without dragging in , word for word, the arguments used in the Court in dissecting the constitution of one of the parties to the case.",27
220,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,How can you criticise an organization without doing that?,27
221,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"It is not a question of criticising an organization; it is a question of principle, and any organization might be used for purposes of illustration.",27
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Parramatta) [5.2] - I have listened to the discussion, and every argument advanced in favour of your ruling, sir, seems to me to be an argument against the introduction of this Bil l at all. The position is brieflv this: You have ruled that a Bill which legislates on a matter which is being discussed before the Courts may be introduced and is in order, but to refer to the reasons for its introduction, and the particular case which the Bill contemplates, and which is the very reason for its introduction, is out of order. That is equal to saying that this Bill is properly before the Chamber, but it may not be properly and thoroughly discussed. salutariness of the rule which you, sir, have laid down, and which has been the practice of this House from time immemorial, that we should not discuss cases which are pending before the Courts; but if it is dangerous for the House to discuss them, it is surelv more dangerous for the Government to introduce them. is infinitely more dangerous to deliberately bring these matters before the Chamber",27
223,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,It is immoral.,27
224,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,27
225,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Certainly ; I withdraw it.,27
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,It is infinitely more dangerous for a Government to legislate on a matter before the Courts than it is for us to discuss a matter whioh is before the Courts.,27
227,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"If there are any defects, it is our duty to remedy them. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Our talk will not do one-tenth as much damage to a case before the Court as this legislation will do. Our talk goes into Hansard, and there it ends, but the legislation continues, and that legislation is for the purpose of modifying anything that the Court may do.",27
228,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Order ! The honourable member is now getting beyond the scope of the motion.,27
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"(No . Clause 13 of the Bill says that "" every organization which, at the commencement of this Act. is registered as an organization,""and therefore every organization which is now before the Court-is a valid organization. If that is not infinitely more dangerous than anything we may say in drawing attention to an organization, I should like to know what is dangerous and what is safe ? This is the whole .test: If it is improper to discuss the case, it is much more improper that the Bill , which refers to the case, should be here. Your ruling, sir, brings us to this farce, that legislation may be put through this House without proper discussion. If there be one element of discussion that is more proper than another, it is to challenge the necessity for the Bill being here at all. The preliminary inquiry must always be into the validity of any legislation before the House. Is this legislation properly before the House, and is it a I admit the proper thing to do? How can we answer that question, unless we discuss these organizations and their registration, and unless we can go into details for the purpose of finding out what is wrong or r i g ht about them ? I say that the detail of this matter is all-important. I take it that the Bill is brought here so that we may It investigate every detail surrounding this clause, and to say that we can do that but we must not mention what we are doing, seems very extraordinary. talk of a case in the clouds is right, but to talk of a fact that is on earth and is concrete is wrong and improper.",27
230,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The employment arguments used by counsel in a particular case is what I object to.,28
231,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Is discussion this House to be limited by what counsel say outside?,28
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"All that has been done is to discuss, under clause 13, the details of the registration of organizations. No reference has been made to the Court at all.",28
233,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member for Flinders referred to the Court.,28
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I defy the honourable member to find anything in the speech of the honourable member for F l i nders which refers in any way to the case before the Court.,28
235,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,He proceeded to make an address to the President of the A r b i tration Court under cover of the privilege of this House.,28
236,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,That is unfair.,28
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I respectfully submit that Mr Speaker ought not to permit the honourable member for Batman to make that statement.,28
238,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I say it without offence. That is the effect of what the honourable member for Flinders did. I do not say that he intended to do it .,28
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Her e is an in timation to the Court that, no matter what they may do, no matter that they may say the registration of an organization is invalid, the Attorney-General says it shall be valid. The honourable member for Plinders never went so far as that. This Bill says to the Court that is adjudicating and inquiring into these matters, "" No matter what you may do in any particular case, and no matter what your judgment may be, this Bill contains what the law is going to be.""",28
240,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member is now going beyond the question before the House.,28
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,In what way?,28
242,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The honourable member is discussing a question now before the Court, and he must not do that under cover of his motion.",28
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"My remarks apply to any case. I am stating this matter in what the honourable member for Batman called an impersonal way. To My point is that this particular clause of the Bill brought up these matters. What was the reason for this clause? Evidently, according to the Attorneyof General, some of the rules and regulations of some of the organizations and associations had been called in question before in the Courts, and on this account the registrations of these unions were sought to be proved defective. The Attorney-General told us that the purpose of the Bill was to make these registrations valid. He told us that the very purpose for which this legislation was introduced was to cure some of the defects.",28
244,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"What would be the position if the case was over, and the Court was not sitting? Could we then discuss it?",28
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"That is not the point. The point is that the Attorney General said that the very purpose for which this legislation was introduced was to cure some defects in the registration of some associations which had been revealed in the Court. If there be any reflection on the Court, then the Attorney-General was reflecting on it . He was certainly, by this Bill , taking the most effective means of trying to influence the Judicature.",28
246,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member is not discussing the ruling. He is discussing a totally different question.,28
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I understand that the ruling was that this Bill was properly before the Chamber.,28
248,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"That was not the ruling, and it is not the question before the House.",28
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"You said that the honourable memher for Flinders was not in order in discussing the constitution of the Australian Workers Union on the ground that a case for the cancellation of the registration of that organization was pending before the Courts. I am not objecting to that r u l in g ; I contend that it should have carried you further, and that you should not have ruled that the Bill was properly before the Chamber.",28
250,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,That point is not now before the Chair. The question is the motion submitted by the honourable member.,28
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The motion relates to this particular organization and its registration, and I contend that not only is the discussion of the union before the Chair, but also it is embodied in the very Bill itself. The Attorney-General told ua in his speech that the B i l tended t.o cure a defect in regard to this particular organization. ""Would the Bill have been before the Chamber at all but for the Australian Workers Union?",28
252,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I cannot inform the honourable member. I simply say that the honourable member must confine himself to the question now before the Chair.,29
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Since you have ruled that the Bill dealing with the registration of this organization, among others, was properly before the House, discussion of the details of these organizations and tlieir registration was equally proper. Both must go or both must stand. If a Bill purporting to cure something wrong in the registration of this organization was properly the subject for discussion in this House, then what was wrong with the organization and what the Bill contemplated setting right was also proper subject for discussion.",29
254,Mr BKEJTNAJT,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Was there any reference fo the Australian Workers Union in the Bill?',29
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,No ; but every association was affected.,29
256,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the matter before the Chair.,29
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Surely the question of the Australian Workers Union is before the Chair,, as also the ruling that the association could not be discussed, because a case relating to it was before the Court ;- and all I am doing now is to point out that a case which was specially to be validated by a Bill , notwithstanding that it was before the Courts, was either improperly before the House, or discussion upon it was relevant.",29
258,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable memshould ber should have taken that point at the time. He cannot discuss it now. He must confine himself to the question fore the Chair as to whether my ruling was wrong.,29
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The last honoperations orable member who spoke roamed all over the place, and discussed the Australian made. Workers Union and everything else, yet I mm wrong in answering him.",29
260,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member is entitled to answer another honourable member.,29

262,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Wimmera) [5.16] - I think that we all should be jealous of the privileges of the House, and in this matterI agree with the honourable member for Plinders.",29
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I want to dissent from this new ruling. I shall have to fight for my rights.,29
264,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The honourable member sat down, and another honourable member has commenced his speech.",29
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I sat down because you would not allow me to proceed.,29
266,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I did not prevent the honourable member from proceeding. The honourable member distinctly said* that he was going to sit down. I do mot wish to accuse the honourable member of deliberately making a misstatement,, but he certainly sat down of his own accord.",29
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I sat down because you would not let me proceed.,29
268,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member sat clown of his own accord'. It is* too late now for him to dissent from my ruling. I call on the honourable member for Wimmera.,29
269,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I think that every one should be jealousof the privileges of the House , and that any matter set down 1 for discussion this session should be discussed in a dispassionate manner. We lia-vre heard the put in a very able and conscientiousmanner by three eminent, lawyers who> have addressed the House; but I wish to say a word or two, from a layman's point of view, in dissent from the ruling and in support of the motion submitted by the honourable and learned member for Flinders. It strikes me that if we were to discuss clause 13 of the Bill , which stated that every association which at the commencement of this Act was registered as an organization be deemed to Have been duly registered, as it should have been discussed in order to ascertain whether it should bebe agreed to or rejected, the fullest,, freest, and most searching investigationinto the constitution and rules and of all of the organizations, registered under the Act should have been It should be the inalienable p r i v i and lege of this House to make the most thorough investigation into the operation of every one of these organizations; otherwise, how would it be possible for honourable members to come to a proper determination upon the matter ? This particular clause may have dealt with the registration of every organization registered under the Arbitration Act ; and, in order that we should adequately and freely discuss all the operations that would be .governed by the provision, it was necessary for honourable members to go into the fullest details. I tliink that view is common sense. I am not concerned so much about precedents that may he laid down in May, but I am seriously - concerned with the preservation of the privileges of this House. If ing given by Mr Speaker is to be maintained, the probability is that hardly - any Bill can be brought before the House that will not infringe, in some way or another, on some case before <our Law Courts. If the ruling is to be persevered in honourable members are to be deprived of one of tlieir most cherished privileges, seeing that there may be litigation before the Courts, or pending, dealing virtually with legislation at the time under discussion in the House. To now refer to the rules of debate as laid down in May. The quotation from that authority which has been referred to isA matter whilst under adjudication by a - Court of law should not be brought before the House by a motion or otherwise. If that precedent is to be followed, then the faul t lies in the fact that the Arbitration Bill was improperly before the House. There can be no possible doubt about the two positions. They seem to - be thoroughly plain. Once the Arbitration Bill was brought forward, the fullest and most searching investigation into all the operations of all unions registered was vital to the particular clause, and tliey should have been discussed without any restriction, and if any case before the Courts restricted that full discussion of the various matters governed by the clause, even to the extent of a letter, the fault lay with the Government in in troducing the Bill at this particular period. If the Bill was properly before honourable members they should have had the right to discuss it freely, but if we are to be told that it could not be discussed freely in consistency with the Standing Orders and certain Court proceedings, the f a u l t lay in the fact that the Government brought down the Bill improperly. The Government are not immune from the ruling that matters. Hinder motion or otherwise, shall not be discussed while particular litigation is before the Courts; in bringing forward a niotion or a Bill they are no more immune from the operation of the rule than any private member who brings forward some matter already before the Court. The honourable and learned member for Flinders yesterday simply took the rules and constitution of the largest organization registered under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act in order to show that the particular clause of the Bill the r u lbefore honourable members should not be passed, and to show that if it were passed a very serious injustice would the 'done. I consider that these matters were open to legitimate and proper discussion, and that they should have been full y and exhaustively discussed in order that the House might do justice to the provision in the Bill . The House should have been permitted to discuss the clause in all its effects and their ramifications in order that it might come to a determination as to whether the provision should be passed.",29
270,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,But do you think that the honourable and learned member for Flinders should in this House give the weight of his argument in regard to a case that is pending in the Courts?,30
271,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I do not admit that the honourable and learned member for Flinders was, as the honourable member contended a little while ago, employing arguments that were being used before a Court. I understood that the point of the honourable and learned member for Flinders was that he was showing from the constitution and operation of the largest organization that would be governed by the clause of the Bill that the provision should not be passed. I hope that the House will rise superior to party considerations in dealing with this important question, and that the privileges of honourable members will be preserved. I hope that the Government will be honest, and say that this matter should have been open to the fullest and freest debate representative of the combined wisdom of the House, which is necessary before legislation is put on the statute book, or else that they will admit that the Bill should have been withdrawn while a certain case was before the Court.",30
272,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Wentworth) [5.25] Perhaps the best way of avoiding heat and irritation in the consideration of the motion would be to take a hypothetical case bearing upon the inatter at issue. Let us put altogether from our minds the case which has been, if it is not still, before the Courts of the couutry, and let us for a moment pay no attention to the Bill which has caused the present trouble. Let us assume that a Government in some other Parliament than this had in troduced a Bill amending legislation in regard to matters about which litigation is threatened. Let us assume that that Government could have introduced that legislation a month or two earlier than it did, and that it stated, when introducing this measure, that there were grave and urgent reasons why the Bill should be passed without delay. Under such circumstances, the members of the Parliament would naturally ask, "" What are the reasons for urgency, and to whom is the legislation to apply?"" If it were found that the legislation applied to a particular union, would it be f a ir to prevent the Opposition-whic h has its duty to the country, just as the Government havefrom searching the merits of the union, for which the Government was deliberately interfering with a case before the Courts? I am grateful to the honourable member for Batman for the lead that he has given me in this matter.",31
273,Mr BKENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member is showing what the honourable member for Flinders might have done.,31
274,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I ask honourable members if they think that it would be fair to prevent discussion by an Opposition of a case such as I have assumed ? ,31
275,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,If that is the spirit that organization. is behind what is being done-and I believe it is,31
276,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Order !,31
277,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I admit that I was wrong in taking notice of the interjection. The argument addressed to the House by the honourable member for Batman was that we should have been perfectly in order in dealing with the rules of every other union but that particular union whose case is before the Court, to which alone the reason of urgency applies. The honourable member said, in effect, that had that particular union been mentioned specifically, we could have discussed all its affairs, so far as the Bill related to them; but that, because it was not specifically mentioned, and was interested in a case upon which the Bill would have effect, we could not refer to it . Y e t the Bill specifically refers to the Australian Workers Union, amongst other associations.",31
278,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Inferentially , not specifically.",31
279,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Specifically . Clause 13 declares thai)Every association which, at the commencement of this Act, is registered as an organization, shall be deemed to have been duly registered. The Australian Workers Union has been registered, and my honourable friends hope that its registration will hold good after the Bill has become law.",31
280,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,I think that it will.,31
281,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The merits of the quarrel in the Arbitratio n Court do not concern me; but, as the Australian Workers Union is a union which is to be deemed a duly registered organization when the Bill has become law, it is specifically named. It is to obtain exemption from the results of mistakes made by its omcers or others, and yet this Parliament is to play second fiddle to another tribunal, and is not to inquire into what it has done. We are to give the union all that it asks, and not to satisfy ourselves whether it is entitled to get what it asks. The application of such arguments as we have heard from the other side would turn this Parliament into the laughingstock of Australia. I believe that this trouble would not have arisen had it not been for the peculiar relationship existing between the Australian Workers Union and some honourable members opposite. A Minister is the head of this great I submit that when the House is asked to pass legislation affecting organizations specifically referred to, and one of those organizations is to immediately benefit by that legislation, the affairs of that organization should be open to discussion by honourable members. We ought not to discuss the merits of any particular argument placed before the Arbitratio n Court, and we ought not to prejudge the verdict of that Court; but the introduction of the Bill is, in itself, a prejudging of the verdict of the Court. H ad not the verdict of the Court been feared, would the Bill have been introduced? The in troduction of the Bill proves that honourable members opposite were afraid of what the verdict might be. If a thing is, or is not, in order, according as it does, or does uot, prejudge a legal issue, I submit that not only must all reference to the Australian Workers Union in this case be ruled out of order, but also that the Bill itself must be ruled out of order.",31
282,Mr FOWLEE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Perth) [5.35] - I wish to remind you, Mr Speaker, that on more than one occasion when in a position to speak more freely than you can speak now, you have drawn attention to the fact that May is a somewhat elusive authority. As to that, there is no doubt in the minds of those who have had to study that authority. Time and again May lays down a law very definitely, and then proceeds largely to explain it away. That is what is done in the cases that have been - cited. May says that a discussion of any .matter pending before a Court should not take place in Parliament, but, as the honourable member for Darling Downs has pointed out, it is noted that in certain instances the discussion of such matters is permissible. I respectfully submit that if there are circumstances in which the discussion of matters before the Court is - permissible, the present are such circumstances. The Bill that has caused all this trouble is admittedly an extraordinary one. It has been brought into deal with a matter before the Court. That being so, I submit that it is permissible to refer, in the way in which the honourable member for Flinders proposed to refer, to matters arising directly out of its introduction. We have been chosen and sent here 'to discuss, freely and without challenge or threat from outside, such affairs as may be brought under our notice. I feel sure, sir, that if you look at the matter in its common-sense relations, you will see the honourable member for Flinders was not - going beyond the bounds of legitimate criticism of the clause which it was our duty to consider fully and carefully.",32
283,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Richmond) [5.39] As a lay member, I have a certain amount - of hesitation about intruding into an argument which has been conducted for the most part by the legal members of the House; but of all the extraordinary arguments that I have heard in this chamber, that brought forward this afternoon 'by the honourable member for Batman, who is himself a. legal member, was the most extraordinary. He said that the honourable member for Flinders might have used all the arguments which he intended to use last night, that he might have used the very words which were used in the argument before the Arbitration Court, that he might have quoted word for word the rules of the Australian Workers Union, if he had merely referred to the Australian Workers Union as "" X,"" and not by its proper title. The honourable meinber for Batman said that the honourable member for Flinders might have done that, even though every member of the House knew exactly to what he was referring. In such circumstances, .what can we think of the honourable member?",32
284,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,What he suggests would mean making a farce of Parliament.,32
285,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"An absolute farce of the proceedings of the House. The honourable member frankly admitted that Mr. Speaker's ruling would mean a grave limitation of the rights and privileges of the House, if under it these rules could not be quoted; but he contended that it would be perfectly open to an honourable member to quote them provided that he referred to them as the rules of ""Union X . "" Was a greater subterfuge ever suggested by a public man? It was a pernicious and absolutely immoral argument to use in this Chamber. It is enough to raise the wrath of an honourable member that public men, who are supposed to be men of honour, should advocate resort to a subterfuge of that description so as to be able to justify a vote which they intend to give in this House.",32
286,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Is the honourable member for Richmond in order in stating that the honourable member for Batman has. resorted to a subterfuge?,32
287,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable member would not be in order in attributing unworthy motives to an honourable member.,32
288,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I recognise that had I done what the honourable member for Herbert suggests, I should have been out of order; but, as a matter of fact, I did not. I made the absolute statement that the honourable member for Batman had suggested that we should adopt a subterfuge. That was the gravamen of my attack upon him. I have for you, Mr. Speaker, and the position you occupy, the greatest respect; I am sure you will admit that no occupant of the chair is always infallible, and I suggest that in this particular instance you have been in error. If the Government had seen fit to bring down a Bill of one clause relating to the cancellation of the registration of any organization, and if , for the sake_ of argument, the Australian Workers Union had been the only union registered in the Court, then, under your ruling, Mr . Speaker, that Bill would have had to pass this House without one word of debate upon it . That is the logical outcome of your ruling, and, in the circumstances, it is an utterly impossible ruling for this House to uphold. The whole blame for what has occurred rests with the Government. There is not the slightest doubt that they got their orders and proceeded to put them into effect.",32
289,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,The honourable memmember ber is not in order in attributing worthy motives to the Government.,33
290,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Then I shall not so. Is it right that honourable members should be limited in this way ? Is it right that, although the Bill refers, in general terms to all organizations registered the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, we cannot refer to each one in particular ? If this ruling is to. stand, then there will surely come a time when we shall be retheir duced to the position I have indicated. I admit full y and freely that all pending litigation should not ordinarily be matter for discussion in this. Chamber ; but when he was entitled to do so. the Government of the day bring down Bill which does affect pending litigation, there can be absolutely no l i m it whatsoread ever to the debate which should properly take place upon it .",33
291,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"Wilmot) [5..47.] - 1 do not care to cast a silent vote upon this question. I have listened very carefully own argument. to. the arguments that have been adduced on both sides, and have no doubt, M Speaker,, that your ruling is wrong. eay so with all deference to y o u ; but the privileges of the House are more or less at stake, I think it righ state frankly how I view your decision. This is not a party matter, and I regret that, during its consideration, we have not. had a larger attendance of supporters, of the Government.",33
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"They have not wise. heard a word of .tjhe argument, and, - therefore, will' give an intelligent vote-!",33
293,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,In such circumstances it seems to me that honourable members simply troop in and vote according to direction.,33
294,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,Will the honourable member deal with the question before the Chair ?,33
295,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I am sure, sir, that Lf you were on the floor of the House you would urge that we should approach the consideration of this question free from all party bias. That is what I am trying to do. If your ruling be upheld, we may be debarred from adequately discussing, any Bill brought in by the Government. If we are to have anything approaching free speech in Parliament, it should be permissible to full y discuss any measure, submitted to us. The honourable member for Darling Downs having moved that the Bill be recommitted for the reconsideration of certain clauses, the honourable for Flinders, speaking to that unmotion, proceeded to allude to certain facts relating to an organization which do would be affected by clause 13. I submit that he was entitled to discuss the constitution of an organization to which the Bill directly refers.

I have come to the conclusion that this motion should be supported, believing that the honourable member for F l i nders was perfectly in order in discussing the constitution and registration of the Australian Workers Union. not, then we can have no chance of debating the Bill . Indeed, when any measure of the kind is submitted, the Go-vernmenfc need only say that a case covered by it is before the Court, and - our mouths will be promptly closed. If that be so, the Government should not have introduced the Bill ; but, as they have introduced it , any facts relevant to its proper discussion are perfectly admissible. If the ruling of the Speaker is upheld, then that salutary principle will be swept aside. I do not contend for one moment that we are entitled in the discussion to say anything that would prejudge a fair hearing of any case; but certainly nothing was said by the honourable member for Flinders that could have that - effect.

301,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The very presence of clause 13 in the Bill , referring as it does to the Australian Workers Union nnd other organizations, shows that there is a danger of the registration of those organizations being cancelled. If , because a case is before the Court or pending, there must be no discussion on a measure of this kind, then Parliament is rendered silent and useless as a legislative body-legislatio n is reduced to a farce. The more authorities are consulted the stronger the case appears for the motion of the honourable member for Flinders. I listened most attentively to the Attorney-General, and also to the Prime Minister, but in neither instance did I hear anything relevant to the issue. I Mr HANNAN - There may be, perhaps, some party bias in that.",34
302,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I am sorry that the honourable member for Fawkner should attribute party bias to nie, because I am endeavouring, as I hope and trust all honourable members will endeavour, to deal with the question dispassionately, so that we may have a fair expression of opinion from the Chamber. My chief objection to the ruling is that, if it be allowed to stand, it will seriously curtail free speech. All the best authorities in for m us that if a question is raised by a If he was Bill the House is entitled to adequately discuss that question; and nothing that was said by the honourable member for Flinders could be held to violate that rule.",34

305,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"If similar circumstances were again to arise, I should take the same action with a great deal of pleasure. The Bill , especially clause 13, deals specifically with the registration of organizations, and it apjDlies to every organization which is registered at the ""present time. It should not be a matter of much moment to us that any one of those organ1 could izations has at the present time a case before the Court; the very fact that the Bill has been introduced by the Government-and they must have known of the case before the Court-make s it a fair subject for debate. We do not know what legislation may be introduced in the f u t u r e ; ancl if , because some case affected by the Bill is before the Court, discussion is to be restricted or stopped, great harm may be done. We all agree that under ordinary circumstances cases sub judice should not be discussed; but we should in sist, in special circumstances, sueh as the present, on the privilege and right of free speech. There is no doubt that clause 18 affects, to a great extent, many of the organizations. Section 60 of the Act veiry clearly states that organizations must not make rules which would prevent new members from joining, or rules that are tyrannical or oppressive; but, under clause 13, all the present registrations, whether or not the rules of the organizations are tyrannical or oppressive, are to be validated. Under the circumstances, there ought to be full liberty of discussion of clause 13, even if it does apply to the Australian Workers Union, or any other body. Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - On the question of whether rules are tyrannical or oppressive, our mouths are shut.",34

307,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"The question before the Chair is my ruling, and the honourable member is going beyond it .",35
308,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA N WORKERS,"I was merely discussing whether the honourable member for Plinders was justified in mentioning the Australian (Workers Union, and pointing out that the rules of that body, which, under clause 13, will have the effect of law, may be tyrannical or oppressive, and altogether contrary to the spirit of the Arbitration Act. We are making a precedent; and the decision of the Speaker today, if upheld, may be acted upon three years hence by another Speaker, with very grave results. I am sure honourable members would not like to feel that they had done anything to interfere with free speech; and it is sible, if the ruling be upheld, that in the future some Government may introduce legislation from the discussion of which honourable members will be debarred. Under the circumstances, we should have the fullest right to discuss, not only the Australian Workers Union, but any other organization which may be registered under clause 13.  layman, I shall endeavour to approacli the question from a common-sense point of view, divested altogether of legal technicalities and quibbles, with which I have nothing to do, and of which I have no knowledge. A Bill has been introduced which may have a very important bearing on pending litigation; and this very fact invites discussion from every point of view, impelling and compelling honourable members to take into consideration the conditions under which every one of these organizations is operating. The ruling prohibits honourable members from discussing the most essential point whether any one of these organizations has adopted rules which are contrary to law, and which would render its registration illegal. The position is an extremely dangerous one from the point of view and welfare of the privileges of this House. If the ruling is upheld it will be possible in the future to initiate legal proceedings in a way and at a time which would block the proper discussion of any Bill. It may be said that such a thing is not likely to be done, but I point out that it can be done; and here is a case in point. Members and the general public would like to know if the design and object of this Bill is to interfere with litigation which is before the Court.",35

I am contending that, inasmuch as a Bill is before the House, which, by common consent, is supposed to have some influence on pending litigation, if we areprevented by the decision of the Speaker from discussing the merits and the particular conditions of the organization concerned, we shall be frustrated in our purpose of putting the facts before the publicand Parliament as we desire to do.

It does prevent honourable members making clear to the House certain facts which ought be disclosed.

I have not the book to refer to at the moment, but that is the effect of the law as laid down By Maxwell. other words, in order to bind pending litigation, Parliament in its legislation should specifically refer to such litigation, and so place beyond all doubt the intenlength. tion that the pending litigation is to be affected. It is admitted that clause 13 retrospective in character, and, though no specific reference is made, affects pending litigation. If i affect any pending litigation, necessarily a righ t to discuss that particular litigation. Bill attempts to in any way prejudice or affect pending litigation, it invites the House to discuss the merits of that litigation. If the Blouse were not at liberty to discuss that litigation it would be competent for any Government to introduce a ill and to stop a pending suit at law, to for reasons which they might think proper, yet members of the House would not have the right to discuss the merits the particular question directly affected by the Bill . If there is pending litigation in which the question of the registration of an organization is involved, clause 13 must affect that litigation. The Every Association which, at the commenceof this Act, is registered as an organization shall be deemed to have been duly regisdoes not mean, as the Attorneyto General says, that the clause is to be primd facie evidence of registration. It means that the registration is absolutely valid, and, assuming that the question of to registration is involved in any pending suit, it is obvious that that suit is affected by clause 13, and therefore we have a right to discuss it . The passage in Maxwell to which I was referring In general when the law is altered, pending an action, the rights of the parties arc decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless the Statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights. If , therefore, clause 13 shows a clear in to vary such rights-and it is admitted by 'the Attorney-General that the I would clause does affect the rights of parties in litigation-the necessary connotation is that we have the right to discuss i - that particular litigation. If such discuswere not allowed, it would be comi t i - petent for the Government to introduce * reB ill seriously affecting a law suit which was then pending, and doing one of the parties an injustice, and honourable memI n bers would not be permitted to discuss the merits of the Bill , or the merits of the pending litigation.

In accordance with that principle, I ruled that it would not be in order to as refer specifically in the debate to the W it h regard to Australian Workers Union. Sir Willia m Irvine urged that if it was out of order to refer specifically to the Australian Workers Union, then clause 13 was out order, as it dealt with the registration I considered that the point as to how far clause 13 dealt with the union referred to was a question of law, and that it is not the duty of Speaker to decide such niatters of law.

The Trading with the Enemy Aet was introduced and passed through all its stages in one sitting only a short time ago, but practical experience has proved that its provisions are insufficient for our purposes. The British Parliament has found it necessary to amend the Act on which our Act is based. We have cabled for the full text of that amending legislation.

While the question of the Leader of the Opposition may be fairly put, it is not easily answered. It is because of the difficulty of proof that the term ""enemy subject"" has been given so wide a definition. At this juncture, it should be sufficient that the welfare of the community demands that certain firms and companies, about which there exist doubts as to their being controlled or influenced by enemy mbjects, shall be controlled directly by Hie community through the agency of the Government.

Under the Act , the powers of the controller are those of a receiver or manager That ought under the laws relating to bankruptcy or insolvency in force in the State in which the firm or company carries on business. The duty of a receiver or manager is to carry on the business placed in his hands in the interests of the creditors or persons interested. H is powers may not go to the extent of discontinuing that business, but it may become the duty of a controller under this Bill to discontinue the business placed in his hands, and it is proposed to enable him to do so.

I am well acquainted with the limitations that have been placed on the words "" arising out of or in the course of "" in connection with Workmen's Compensation Acts. Different meanings have been given to them by different Judges. In one case a Judge will hold that the claimant, when injured, had not actually commenced operations, although he was at his work, and is therefore not entitled to compensation. Other difficulties of the kind have arisen from the use of such words, and I think that they should not be employed in this case. The phrase "" results from "" is as wide as any we could use. It would, cover the case of a soldier or sailor who, while on duty, sustained whafc he believed to be at the time only some slight in j u r y, but. who subsequently developed an ill ness which could be traced to that in j u r y . It is the intention of the Government, and I think it is the desire of the House, that the Bill shall cover every possible in j u r y that may be bond fide sustained by soldiers or sailors while following their employment from the time that they are sworn in .",41

NA BILL (No. 2). Motion- (by Mr HUGHE S) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for Act to amend the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914. Bill presented and read a first time. Standing Orders suspended.,41
369,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [8.33] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. Unfortunately,. I have been able to secure he only a very limited number of copies of the Bill , which I have; distributed as well as. I am able. In continuance of the explanation I have already given, I direct the attention! of honourable members to the verbiage of clause 2, which is sub* stantially what I have already indicated Clause 3 enlarges the warpower of the Comptroller so far as to make it unnecessary to resort to the W a r Precautions Act to enable him to serve it and to do all those things that an aui n thorized officer could have done under that Act . He may impound books as well as search premises, and he is not confined to business premises, but may search any premises where he has reason to believe documents or papers of any sorb are to be found. Clause 4, which amends section 8 of the principal Act , is very wide, and it Jaas been further widened by two subsequent amendments which I ikave put in writing on the margin. This extends the power to appoint a Comptroller to cases where it is deemed necessary to the safety of the Commonwealth that such an appointment should be made. That, of course, is a very wide power .; but I assure the House that it is not wider than is required. Clause 5 deals with the payment of moneys by a subject of the K in g to .any enemy subject, and this is a very .desirable provision to which, I think, no objection can be taken. Clause 4 provides that the Governor General may make regulations for the effective carrying out of the measure.",41
370,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Darling Downs) [8.37]. - It is somewhat difficult to criticise a Bill that has only just mow been placed in our hands, but there are one or two observations which I should like to offer. Under the principal Act , section 3, any person who, during the continuance of the present state of war, trades or has, before the commencement of the Act, traded with the enemy, is guilty of an offence punishable either summarily or oa indictment. By ""enemy subjects"" does the Attorney-General mean the enemy subject within the definition that has been introduced ?",42
371,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,No ; that is certainly not the intention.,42
372,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"An enemy subject practically means a person who has traded with the enemy within the meaning of subsection 2 ; that is to say, a .person is deemed to so trade if he performs any action which is prohibited under the measure. As to the other points, the Bill practically does three things. It provides a definition of ""enemy subject"" so as to enable the Department to have wider jurisdiction over those persons whom it thinks it necessary to control in the interests of the Empire; in the second place, it gives wider power to control businesses which under the present law may be seized by the Comptroller-Gener a l ; and, thirdly, it enables debts due to enemy subjects to be discharged by the debtor on payment to the Comptroller, who will be able to give a complete discharge. In regard to the first, it seems to me that very wide powers, in deed, are being taken. Of course one has, to a great extent, to take the assurance of the Minister in regard to the difficulties that have 'been encountered, or otherwise one would be apt to criticise in detail sub-clause b, which has reference to any person, firm, or company - which is managed and controlled directly or in directly by or under the influence of enemy subjects. What is the exact meaning of that provision, and how far does it .carry us ? Influence may be exercised is mamy different ways. For instance, there may toe an incorporated company, the shareholders of which are foreigners.; or there may be a company, incorporated in six different places, and having connection with Australian or English companies, and yet with Australia as its real place of origin; or there may be a company which could exercise influence by contractual arrangement to .supply certain material.",42
373,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Where the influence 'has the effect, or probably will have the effect, of diminishing the resisting powers of the Forces of the K in g , or of replenishing the credit or coffers of the enemy and thereby prolonging the war, that will , prima facie, be influence under the Bill .",42
374,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I understand that the Government have taken a general power which is oidy to be exercised in cases where there are clear indications that, although a company may be incorporated, and, apparently, a genuine British company, such influence is at work. As .to the question of control, I see no object i o n ; and the third power sought seems to me a very satisfactory one to possess. Claims may arise, perhaps, in connection with shipping, where debts are due to foreign firms, and local debtors desire to discharge them. Debts may be due by the creditor to local merchants here. In those circumstances I think it is highly advisable that any money that can be retained here should be held, with a view to possibly meeting any contra account that may subsequently arise between the merchants. I presume that the Attorney General has some such intention in view, and, in the circumstances, it seems to me that the powers which he seeks should be granted.",42
375,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [8.46] - I believe that this Bill is based on an I m perial amendment. I have closely followed up the Imperial legislation, and have noted the reasons why some of their measures have been introduced. I think bhat we in Australia had better do what the Home authorities are doing in these matters. I notice that in their clamations and Acts enemies are defined to include, not only persons who can be colloquially defined as enemies, but also persons who, though not residents of an enemy country, are carrying on business with the enemy country. In other words, I think the enemy character is deter-' mined generally by what is known as domicile, and I find in one of the latest books that has been published as to what is an alien in connection with that in some cases it is not really necessary for a person to have residence in an enemy country in order to become an alien. I do not desire to quote at length from a book by Arthur Page, as late as August last, on what is an alien enemy, but I think I am correctly stating the substance of a number of cases he mentions when I say that the enemy character depends, not on ordinary citizenship, but on domicile in the country. A person carrying on business in Germany must be regarded as an enemy subject, at all events for the purposes of trading, and it has been held that one may acquire domicile in a country without personal residence. seems to approximate very closely to what the Attorney-General is proposing in this Bill. If there is a company in Germany controlling the operations of a company doing business in Australia, and registered under our Acts, it is only right that we should give that company character which it would acquire through domicile. I take it that that is the principle of this legislation, and, if so, it ought to commend itself to our approval. In regard to the power to appoint a controller, I notice that power taken now does not seem to go as far as the power taken by the original section of the Act, because I see that in paragraph b of section 8 of the original Act, there is power to appoint an inspector or controller to carry on the business of a firm or corporation, in the opinion of the Comptroller-General, it may be necessary to carry on, although that firm or corporation is committing an offence, or supposed to be committing an offence, in the terms of the Act. This Bill does not go as far as that, because it provides that business must be carried on by an enemy subject through an agent or directorate. Mr Glynn.",42
376,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I intend to move an amendment to add the words, "" o r it is pro- necessary for the safety of the Commonwealth that a controller should be appointed.""",43
377,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I take it that the At torney-General is not going beyond what has been done already, but is particularizing certain cases, and in the circumstances I think we ought to support the measure. Question resolved in the aflirmative. Bill read a second time trading, In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Section 2 of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end of sub-section (1) the published following definition:"" ' Enemysubject' means(a) any person who is an enemy within the meaning of any proclamation by the King or by the Governor General, referred to in sub-section (2) of this section; or (6) any person, firm, or company, th© business whereof is managed or controlled directly or indirectly by or under the influence of enemy subjects, or is carried on wholly or mainly for the benefit or on behalf of enemy subjects, notwithstanding that the Arm or That company may be registered or incorporated within the King's Dominions.""",43
378,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [8.50] - The honourable member for Darling Downs raised a point as to whether this definition will affect the scope of section 3 of the a original Act. "" Trading with the enemy,"" I suppose, means trading with an enemy subject, because we are using the definition of an enemy subject in this Bill .",43
379,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I think that excludes it the from the definition of enemy subject, because it says that it is an offence for a person who is not an enemy subject to trade with an enemy subject.",43
380,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"It would not do to create an artificial enemy by this Bill , and to hold that a person or firm carrying which, on business through an agent in our midst with a firm the control of which is in Germany would be liable to be charged under the principal Act with having traded with an enemy subject. For in stance, a Melbourne agent of a company controlled in Germany might be carrying the on business with a number of persons, but those persons would not be trading with the enemy.",43
381,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"The mere fact of a person doing that would not create an offence. Mr Glynn"" - I hope that point is covered, hut the drafting does not seem to be quite clear.",44
382,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.53] - The case instanced by the honourable member for Angas will not arise through the application of clause 2 to section 3 of the Act. I think that section 3 deals with persons who are not enemy subjects trading with persons who are enemy subjects.,44
383,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Tradin g with enemy,"" not "" enemy subjects.""",44
384,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I am inclined to think that the intention of section 3 is to deal, not with persons who are either enemies or enemy subjects, but with those subjects of His Majesty who trade with the enemy. Trading with the enemy is a term generally confined to trading with the enemy outside the Dominions.",44
385,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"That is so, but you might be artificially altering it.",44
386,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Whateve r the construction of this amendment may be, I can assure the Committee that by the administration of this Act, over which the Government will have control, clause 3 will not be so applied as to deal with persons who would not be liable under section 3 of the Act in such a way that they are brought in as enemy subjects under clause 2.",44
387,Sir EOBERT BEST,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Kooyong) [8.55] - I agree with the Attorney General that the definition of the words ""enemy subject"" cannot by any construction be placed on the word "" enemy "" alone. Clause 2 purports to define two words which are joined together, and used in the Bill, namely, "" enemy subject,"" a particular class of enemy. Those words together occur in the original Act, and in section 8, ancl in section 8 as amended, the only possible result could be that this meaning would attach to the words "" enemy subject"" wherever they occurred, but I do not think that by any construction that interpretation could be placed on the word ""enemy"" alone. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Clause 4Section 8 of the Principal Act is amended(o) by inserting in paragraph (1) before the words "" firm or company "" (first, second, and last occurring) the word "" person "" ; (b) by inserting in paragraph (b) of subsection (1 ) , after the first word "" that ,"" the words "" (in the case of a Arm or company)""; (c) by inserting in sub-section (1) after paragraph (b), the words: "" or (c) that the business thereof is controlled or managed directly or indirectly by or under the influence of enemy subjects, or is carried on wholly or mainly for the benefit or on behalf of enemy subjects "" ; (d) by omitting from sub-section (1) the ""the words "" shall be those of a receiver and manager under the laws relating to bankruptcy or insolvency in force in the State in which the firm or company carries on business, with such modifications, restrictions, and extensions as the Court thinks f it "" ; and inserting in their stead the words "" may include any powers of controlling, conducting, continuing, discontinuing, extending, restricting, or varying the business and operations of the person, firm, or company "" ; (e) by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section:"" (3) Where the Minister is satisfied, in reference to any person, firm, or company, that the business thereof is managed, controlled, or carried on as mentioned in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section, he may, before applying to the High Court under that sub-section, appoint an interim controller of the firm or company with such powers and subject to such conditions as he thinks fit; but in that case he shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, apply to the High Court under that sub-section.

What would be position of the Australian creditors of foreign corporation trading here whose debtors have paid the money they owe the corporation, and that money is held by the controller and handed over at the followstermination of the war to that foreign corporation, if the firm should financial difficulties in its own country? Apparently, the money collected from the debtors in Australia must be paid over to the corporation, and thus may not be available for its creditors here. The firm may be a large shipping company to whom sums of money may be due for freight. This money has to be collected, but the money so collected will have to be paid over to the company, though, at the same time, it may owe money in Ausbinding; tralia for services rendered here.",44

391,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs) [9.9] I wish to say one or two words upon.some further points before the Bill leaves this ""Chamber, and to draw attention to several new and exceedingly novel principles executive which have been introduced into it . refer particularly to clauses 3 and 11. The Attorney-General has told us during the progress of the debates upon this B i that the measure has been rendered necesof sary in consequence of the High Court judgment in the Tramways case. He has referred rather full y to various techniany other day. decalities, and, as one is rather hampered by having to refer to purely newspaper reports of the Tramways case before the not High Court, it is regrettable that he has the not been able to make available the full a text of the judgment of the High Court in the matter. When the Bill was in to Committee, a new clause was inserted at the instance of the Attorney-General, as 3A. After section 19 of the principal Act the be in following section is inserted:19A. A plaint by which an industrial dispute is submitted to the Court shall be deemed to have been submitted by the organization by which it purports to have been submitted unless evidence is given on behalf of that organization that the plaint was not in fact submitted by that organization. What does this most extraordinary piece of new procedure mean ? It would appear that the mere fact of a plaint having been submitted to the Court is to be absolutely and the plaint is to be deemed to have been submitted by the organization by which, on the face of it , it purports to have been submitted. And then the progoes further, and says, in effect, that unless evidence is given on behalf of the discreorganization concerned to show that the plaint was in fact not submitted by it , the respondent cannot dispute the authority of the person submitting the plaint. The only party allowed to dispute the matter with is some organization, which can come in afterward sand say that, although the plaint had been instituted in its name, it is the organization referred to, and did not authorize it . The party made the respondent to the plaint cannot take any exception to it . The only reason I can find for this new provision is in some remarks made by the Chief Justice in the Tramways case, in which he criticised the action of the organization that was before the Court. He saidMr A. C. Warton described himself as general secretary of the claimant organization from February 10, 1911. He also deposed that the consent of the organization to the submission of the dispute to the Arbitration Court had been given by a body calling itself the of the association passing a resoluI tion to that effect at a duly convened meeting on September 4, 1911, of which resolution an alleged copy was set out, which he swore to foe a true and correct copy. A book purporting i l to be the minute-book of the association and its executive was put in, which did not contain any record of the meeting of the executive on September 4, or of the passing of any sueh resolution as that sworn to on that or No explanation had been offered of the absence of any original record of the resolution, if it was ever passed. The minutes of a meeting of a body calling itself the Federal council, held on August 29, contain a record of three resolutions, two of which arc of to the same general eifect. Then he addedI t will appear that neither the so-called Federal council nor the persons who call themselves the executive had any authority under the rules of the claimant organization to act on its behalf i'n bringing the alleged' dispute before the Court. The proposed new section appears to meet this case. If a body calling itself an executive of an organization, when it is not,, can file a plaint to which a respondent cannot object, then an extraordinary position is created. In this case, if. the tramways organization had not repudiated the step taken, the respondent organization, which was dragged into the tribunal by the plaint, could not dispute the authority of those who filed the. plaint. It seems to me that attempting to bring in legislation, to meet a case like that is going to great extremes, and that, if we do this, we shall find that we are creating legislation which will be of a doubtful character, and dangerous in its operation. The same remarks, will apply to clause 11, which amends section 5 8 A of the principalAct. Section 5 8 A provides that an organization may in the prescribed manner, ont compliance with the prescribed conditions, change its name, and the Registrar shall thereupon record the change of name in the - register upon the certificateof. registration . It is now, proposed toalter t h a enabling the organization also-to change its constitution, including the. description of. the-industry, in, connection, with which, it is registered.. Now,, dealing with a similar point in the Tramways case judgment, the Chief Justice< saidAt a meeting of the association held on November 22 it was, resolved that the rules be amended by the addition of the Federal Constitution. The Court during the argument announced on June 22 that, in its opinion, the attemptedamendment was. ineffective; and that the. constitution of the claimant organization, consequently remained as declared by the original award until altered in accordance with the rules. In my opinion, it follows from the provisions of the Act that the constitution and powers of an organization when incorporated are, at any rate so far as regards matters as to which rules are imperative, such as are defined by the rule on the faith of which registration and incorporation is obtained. Such an> organization, therefore, cannot make any alteration eitlier in. its constitution or its powers with respect to the matters which are required to be contained in the rules as a condition of re-registration except in the manner prescribed by the rules themselves. I tliink, further; that any such alteration must be made by the corporation itself after it has been incorporated. In any other view, an association formed for one purpose might,, after the application for registration, be converted into an association having quite a different object, of which no notice had been given us prescribed by the regulation, and the provision of the regulation requiring 30 days' notice, which is a conditionprecedent to registration, would be nugatory. The Attorney-General has introduced in to our arbitration law provisions which will enable an organization to completely change its object and purposes. I hope, therefore, that he will see that due provision is made for the public notification of any objection as to constitution. When the constitution of an organization is changed, there should be the same right of objecting to the change as existed in regard to the original registration-. Finally, I wish to fire a parting shot at clause 13. The Attorney-General referred to the fact, that under section 57, when the Registrar has issued to an organization a certificate of registration in the prescribed form, that certificate shall, until proof of cancellation, be conclusive evidence of the registration, and proof that the organization has complied' with the prescribed conditions entitling it to registration. In the Federated Enginedrivers' case, it was expressly decided that a certificate of the registration of an organization thus given is not conclusive t by evidence of the validity of that registration.",45
392,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,That is. so.,46
393,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"But clause 13 says that an association which, at the commencement, of the Act , has been registeredas an organization, shall be deemed to have beenduly registered. Is it intended to go beyond the decision of the High Court in this Federated Engine-drivers' case? In that case-, the Court held that, as the law then stood, an organization must be an organization in connection with an in dustry, and that an association which in cluded among its membersother than persons, in the. industry with which it was connected, could not be validly registered. Would not the Bill have validated such a registration ? The law was altered to providefor craft organizations. Suppose, now, an association includes amongit s members, not only members of the craft with which it is concerned, but others who are not connected with that craft, the point that it is not a proper organization, and should not have been registered, cannot in future be raised as regards existing organizations, because clause 13 declares that any association which has been registered as an organization must be deemed to have been duly registered. The clause clearly covers paragraph b of section 60, which deals with registration erroneously or by mistake. But is not the provision so wide that, if an association is registered which includes among its members persons who aTe not employees in an industry, and have no relation to it, the registration will be valid ? Would it be possible to attack the registration of an organization on the ground that the organization was composed of persons other than those employed in the industry? Is the effect of the clause to validate such a registration ?",46
394,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,It does not validate the registration.,47
395,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,It prevents the registration from being questioned.,47
396,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,It will prevent any one from succeeding in questioning it.,47
397,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"I admit the distinction. An objection could be raised, but would not be considered. The effect of the clause is to strike at the basic principle of our conciliation and arbitration law, which is intended to settle disputes between employers and employees within an industry. Under the Bill protection will be given to an organization which has within its ranks hundreds, or even thousands, of persons not connected with any industry. Thus a decision as to a dispute or the submission of a plaint may be brought about by persons in the organization not connected with the industry concerned. That will be a dangerous state of things, and will not tend to promote industrial peace. We, on this side, raise no objections to amendments of the law which will make the machinery for securing industrial peace more effective. Our wish is that technicalities of procedure and the cost of litigation may be reduced, and the settlement of disputes expedited. We have no sympathy with delay in procedure, which creates ill-feeling. desire is that machinery may be devised which will enable disputes to be settled quickly and promptly, and that thus the industrial peace and welfare of Australia may be secured.",47

399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Yea ; and what has the decade which has since elapsed brought about? Strikes have multiplied, tension has increased, class-feeling has become more acute. Every one of the results predicted for the establishment of the Arbitration Court has been falsified. My complaint is that the spirit of arbitration does not prevail in the Court, but is as far from it as Heaven is from earth. Prom year's end to year's end nothing takes place there but fierce and contentious litigation. Every Act that we pass seems an incentive to further litigation.",47

404,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,There bas never been a violation of a Commonwealth award by a union.,47
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,That is contrary to the fact.,47
406,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,The Registrar tells us that it is so.,47
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"No ; he could not truthfully say so, because the facts are all against him. The Attorney-General has had to settle many a strike.",47
408,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,He is a very conciliatory person.,47
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes ; but as fast as he settles one dispute some one Our pushes up another. And so this feeling develops. There is no arbitration about the whole business. The spirit of compromise is as far removed from the combatants in this Court as it is just now fro m the combatants on the battlefield. Each is trying to beat down the other. There is no attempt in this Court to do that which is the very essence of arbitration-to look, for one moment, at each other's point of view. Y e t here is my honourable friend the Attorney-General again engaging in a most praiseworthy attempt-and I congratulate him on his persistency-to secure industrial peace in the Commonwealth. I am an unbeliever, at this time of day, in these efforts to bring about industrial peace.",47

417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Whil e I have been addressing public meetings, I have heard the cry, "" Three cheers for Mr . Justice Higgins,"" and they have been given. Ask the same men to give three cheers for the Chief Justice, and there is no response. Every one knows this. The point I wish to make is that the Government are setting up a Court to centralize all industrial troubles, and that those troubles will multiply as you give them facilities. That, after all, is human nature, and must be so t ill the end of time. The Government are going to overload this Court until it will not work at all. One Court can never overtake half the industrial ramifications of this great continent. They are becoming more complex every day, and can never be dealt with in a satisfactory manner by being centralized in the one Court. They are not being overtaken with satisfaction today. The Attorney-General tells us that the Court is already two years in arrears with its business.",48
418,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,Because of the time spent in discussing legal technicalities.,48
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,And there are going to be more legal technicalities in connection with this measure. This Bill will not remove the difficulties.,48
420,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,If we carry our referendum proposals we shall remove them.,48
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The blessed referendum! That blessed word ""Mesopotamia"" was never in it with the referendum. The referendum is to be a cure for all your ills. It is the Morxisonian pill over again. I am afraid that when honourable members opposite obtain this pill with its sugar coating, the trouble will only begin. I hope they will believe that there is nothing I would not do to bring about industrial peace. I cannot, however, see any hope of industrial peace in this legislation. This is the fifth attempt, the Attorney General tells us, I think, to make the original Act a workable one, and we are no nearer a solution of the difficulty than ever we were. The Court is two years arrears with its work, and when honourable members opposite carry their referendum proposals, and give it everything to> do it will be twenty-two years behind. I cannot understand what seems to me to be the fatuity of my honourable friends opposite in seeking to centralize in the one Court the industrial ramifications of this great Continent. They will rest there. The Attorney-General ""talks about the devolution of functions, but, here again, human nature will assert itself. He knows as well as I do that while there is a final Court to be reached, both sides will insist upon going to it .",48
422,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The r i g ht honourable member's scheme provided for a final Court, and for appeals to it . Mr JOSE PH COOK - Yes ; but our scheme was devoid of all these technicalities in regard to registration of organizations and as to things being, and purporting to be, that are not actually in existence. We proposed to sweep away all these technicalities and to go back to the old method of allowing the parties to a dispute to meet round a table and talk it over. I have never known a disputeand I have had to do with as many as has any other honourable member, I think - that could not be settled satisfactorily in that way. The honourable member for South Sydney will say also that these disputes in the Newcastle 'district were settled more often by the parties themselves meeting round a table and talking them over than they are today. There was also much less contention there. As fast as these Acts have been multiplied, so have troubles risen and multiplied. They have multiplied, indeed, at a much faster rate than that at which the Court could deal with them. The Courts are too cumbrous as it is. There is too much of these technicalities and legalities. They are not Arbitration Courts, but Courts of litigation, and the Government are now going to cure all this trouble by giving the parties something more to discuss.",48
423,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,We have nothing else to offer.,49
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Then write the whole system down as a failure.,49
425,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,"So far, owing to the High Court decisions, it has been' a failure.",49
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Not one honourable member opposite who has had practical experience in the settlement of disputes believes in this legislation. Not one of them wil l say that this Bill is going to be effective. All that they say is that it is another attempt to secure industrial peace. The Attorney-General himself says that it is another patching up of the leaking, creaking, sinking, old ship in the hope that it may thus be towed into port.",49
427,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND,Why worry?,49
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I know of no subject which should make a man worry more than this. The course I am taking is not a popular one. It would be much easier for me to swim with honourable members opposite, and to say, "" I am in it with y o u . "" But I cannot. My judgment is against it . I was one of the first to give the principle of arbitration a trial, and I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that it has multiplied and not settled disputes. For every one settled in this way, ten are bred. I have been amazed to hear one honourable member after another in the party opposite say that they are sick and tired of Courts of the kind to which this Bill relates. Tho honourable member for South Sydney, who has had as much experience, perhaps, as any of us, described all these things last week as "" musty, fusty technicalities."" The Attorney-General spoke of them as unnamable technicalities. Not one member of the party opposite - has a good word to say for this legislation. All leave the way open. They know it is going to fail. The honourable member for South Sydney and the honourable member for Hunter, knowing that it is going to fail, speak accordingly.",49
429,Mr LALRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND,-We are paving the way to the referendum.,49
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"And when the Labour party get it , their trouble will only begin. They have a fairl y well-defined constitutional course at the present time. The border line has been charted by the Court, and it is able to tell us approximately where we are.",49
431,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND,I thought that Mr . Deakin said that the Constitution A ct was only a skeleton.,49
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I know nothing about skeletons, and the honourable .gentleman, with his jocular rotundity, is - not the one to discuss them. What are the facts about these Courts? All the legislation and clever brains that could be secured have been utilized in the construction of the Courts in New South Wales, and, after all, the Courts are admitted to be a failure. Mr Holman is in despair today, and asking that the whole thing should be taken off his hands.",49
433,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,He has said he is in favour of the Federal Parliament taking these matters over.,49
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Quite so.,49
435,Mr BBEITNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Somebody must do it .,49
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Does not the honourable member think it would be better to try something else after this failure all over Australia?,49
437,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Does the honourable member not know the causes of failure, if there has been a failure, in the Federal Court ?",49
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I am talking about the New South Wales Courts.,49
439,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,The same thing applies,49
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"In those Courts there is no question of jurisdiction, but complete power, and yet strikes are more numerous and more widespread than they are in the Federal arena. The mere granting of f u r the r jurisdiction is not necessarily going to settle the troubles which are multiplying in the States every day. In the Newcastle diatrict the Miners Association has been fined £2,000 after twenty-five years of industrial legislation. I challenge any gentleman representing the Newcastle district to contradict me when I say that the old voluntary Court, presided over in the old days by Mr Justice Barton, and fa ter by Mr Jacob Gerrard and Mr . Brunker, did much, better service there than any of the present Courts. same thing happened in the district with which I was connected. We never had a strike there, because we used to settle all our difficulties over the table; and when I left the men had better wages and conditions than they have today.  the same condition of affairs now?",49
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"That is precisely what I am trying to do;- and I believe that in Wages Boards we have the nearest approach to success. As matters are at present, the door to success is 30 covered with the ivy of technicalities that it is impossible to get through. disputes should be settled on the spot where they arise, and not thousands of miles away. What is the cause of all tiiis trouble and expenditure of money'? Witnesses have to be brought from allover Australia; and that in itself, in my judgment, almost amounts to a denial of justice. What is required is settlement on the spot, where the industries are in operation, and where the local conditions and surroundings can be thoroughly appreciated. In many cases the causes of the dispute are completely obliterated before cases can even be discussed in the Court; aud the honourable member for Newcastle knows to what I am referring. In mining, disputes very often occur during the night-time-. A man may h it up against a band in his seam, and require his price re-adjusted; and if he has to wait u n t i l he can get to one of the Courts, or until a Wages Board is set up by some Judge or other,, the whole matter is past and done with . If that be the case,, ho w on earth can we expect to do any better by a method of centralization? It seems to me that we are on the wrong track altogether. It is no comfort to me to say these things; and I know I shall only be adversely criticised, and, possibly, once more called all sorts of names. We have, however, to face the truth in these matter's; and the truth is that the present is the costliest and most unsatisfactory method of settling disputes that could be devised by the mind of man. The money that is contributed to the unions in Australia represents big figures. It amounts I suppose, to £75,000 in one way or another; and most of it is spent in the Courts in the settlement of disputes.",50
442,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND,That is a strong arguTho ment for the referendum!,50
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Well , honourable members opposite are going to have the referendum again; and I want to say here and now-and I hope that this may be reported in Hansard, and quoted if the referendum becomes an accomplished fact-that it will, so far from settling difficulties, create a fresh crop. Honourable members opposite are attempting the impossible in this respect.",50
444,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"We shall be prepared to meet our troubles.  ing! These Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Oh , I know; what does it matter to the poor wretches 1 outside who have been waiting all these years ? ",50
445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I know that they fling their hats up in the air.,50
446,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND,The argument of the honourable member is that if we simplify matters we make them worse.,50
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Honourable members opposite are certainly making matters infinitely more complex. Centralization is the greatest curse of this country in anything relating to the details of industries. Just as we cannot fromone centre govern the country from the large national point of view, so we cannot govern it industrially from one centre, and never will. I know the argument is-and no one can put it better than the Attorney-General-that there is to be no attempt to do this, but that the Judge will only have the overlordship of the others. The idea is that the central Judge shall set all the other Judges to settle matters locally: but the Attorney General knows that they never will be settled locally-that where there is a Central Court, human nature will take care that, that Court is applied to.",50
448,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,What the honourable member says applies to ordinary legislat i o n ; but we do not find all the people going to the High Court.,50
449,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND,O r to the Council.,51
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Wonderful ! Honourable members opposite have the facts staring them straight in the face, and they know that the clamour is to get to the Central Court. That is what is causing all the trouble, because people are led to believe that once they get to that Court they will have reached the industrial haven.",51
451,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,What we lead them to believe is that they will get justice there - that is all. They cannot - get it anywhere else.,51
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,What is justice?,51
453,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Do you reckon you got it at the last election?,51
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I should like to had lasted 193 days. tell the honourable member that he never heard any complaint from me about result of the election, and he never shall. cases. I am satisfied about the result of the election.",51
455,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND,"So are we!,",51
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I believe you.,51
457,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I should have been just as satisfied if it had been the other but it was the will of God.,51
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Honourable gistration members opposite are laughing at the Attorney-General for what he has said stituted. just now.,51
459,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"Oh , they will laugh at lers case. anything. The honourable member invoked the Deity, and so did we; and we points ? won.",51
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"That is the test the honourable member always brings to bear- "" We won!""",51
461,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,Will the honourable member confine himself to question 1,51
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"What are the facts today? The Attorney-General quoted the figures given by Mr Justice Higgins in reference to the Tramways case. Mr Justice Higgins' complaint is always that he is not arbitrating, legislating and fixing conditions whole of the continent; that he is called upon to deal with questions that have ""other fellows""? nothing to do with arbitration, and ought not to find their way intoCourt. His Honour told us that, in the Tramthat? ways case, eleven distinct tramway systems had to be inquired into and comnature. pared, that 291 exhibits were put in by the plaintiffs, and 396 by the responcan Privy dents, that there were 5,300 pages of transcript, and that the oases lasted altogether ninety-three days. That is what is called arbitration; and I guarantee that at the end of the ninety-three days the parties were anxious for nothing so much as to begin all over again. The trouble is that they cannot, because there are some technicalities barring the way. Now it is desired to have the referendum so that a fresh start may be made, and this, it seems to me, is the height of folly.",51
463,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,The ninety-three days were all right; it was the twenty-three days that mattered.,51
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"No doubt, it was all right for the honourable member, who would not have objected if the case",51
465,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,We lawyers are not the allowed by the Act to appear in such,51
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Then that must be the honourable member's trouble. In the Court, wages and conditions are not discussed for one day out of seven, but the time is occupied in considering way; whether the registration is right, whether the rules are right, whether the reis in accordance with the rules, or whether an association is properly conThat, I believe, was the fact in the Tramways case and the Sawmil",51
467,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND,Who raised all those,51
468,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The people to whom honourable members opposite, by their legislation, have given the right to raise them.",51
469,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,How does the honour the able member say those cases could have been settled ?,51
470,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I should say has that if a meeting had been called and matters discussed across a table they could have been settled in about a week.,51
471,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"That was suggested, but but the other fellows would not answer for the letters or meet the men.",51
472,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Who are the,51
473,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,The employers.,51
474,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,And why was,51
475,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Because it is their,51
476,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Then all I say is that their nature has changed since the honourable member has had to do with these matters. It was not their nature, nor was it difficult to get matters settled over a table, in the old days.",51
477,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,In your time matters used to be settled over a table by the employers making the employees swallow anything that was given them.,52
478,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Do not believe any such stuff and nonsense. I tell the honourable member that they did not. The conditions then were better than they are today, and the conditions of the Newcastle district were as good as they are today.",52
479,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I know nothing of the Newcastle district.,52
480,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member does not know, and that is why he is so glib with his interjections.",52
481,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"If you say the conditions were better twenty years ago than they are today, that is not true.",52
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I say it is true.,52
483,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,The waterside workers used to get only half what they get today.,52
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Goo d luck to them.' I do not want to take anything away from them.  were only getting 15s. per 100, and today they are getting 24s.",52

486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I should like the workers to get all they can; but let them get it with less of this ill-feeling, and with a better relationship between the parties. They will not get it if they tear concessions out of each other across the floor of the Court in this way.  of us twenty years ago.",52
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I am sure that the honourable member looks as if he had been torn about very badly! The facts are patent to anybody, and any person who gets the opinion into his head that if he can only concentrate everything in the Central Court, and if he can only get before Mr Justice Higgins, that will get him out of his difficulties, is ignoring altogether what is taking place in the States. Mr Justice Higgins, with even his limited jurisdiction, seems to be doing infinitely better, and is certainly giving more satisfaction to honourable members opposite, than the legal gentlemen in the State Courts, with their unlimited and allpowerful jurisdiction. Arguing on those lines, there does not seem to be much hope ahead for the settlement of industrial disputes, so far as the referendum goes.",52
488,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Do you suggest that Mr. Justice Higgins would not do better if there were fewer technicalities ?,52
489,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I think he would do infinitely better if there were fewer technicalities. - Mr HUGHES - What makes the technicalities ?,52
490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,What makes them in the State Courts?,52
491,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I know nothing about them.,52
492,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member must and does know something about them, and he must know that, even with the greater powers possessed by the State Courts, there are more technicalities than there are in the Federal Court. It is not a question of power at all, but of the framing of our legislative enactments. The Court in New South Wales has power enough, yet the men say they will have things differently. They even talk about another Labour party in the district of the honourable member for Barrier.",52
493,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,That makes the honourable member smile.,52
494,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"It makes me smile; but I would not like to see them get another Labour party which would displace my honourable friends opposite. I do not desire to see another Labour party arising, because I know that party would be even rougher on me than my honourable friends on the Government benches. However, no matter what the result may be to parties, we are all concerned with this great industrial question which is agitating the world, and is certainly agitating the whole of Australia at the present time, and I do not see where any hope will lie, either in the referendum or anywhere else, if honourable members will continue these Courts of Arbitration, which are really not Courts of Arbitration but Courts of litigation, because they are doing nothing else for three-fourths of their time but discussing rules, regulations, and registrations, and the relation of one industry to another. I se© no liop« for this problem, but to divide up and localize the work. All these troubles arise out of local consequences. They do not arise out of the general causes of discontent that sweep the continent.. The industrial troubles arise in a particular State in the ligh t of local circumstances, and you cannot settle them by any system of broad generalization. That is the cause of all the troubles in the Newcastle district today. There are general rules operating throughout a district that is as varied as possible in the conditions and phenomena it presents, and, because there is not a Wages Board to settle these troubles when they arise, and because they must be taken to a general Court to be settled, they are not settled sufficiently swiftly to give satisfaction.",52
495,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member knows the Newcastle district pretty well. Cannot be think of one man who causes more trouble than all the other men and all the circumstances in that district?,53
496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Will not the same man be there to cause these troubles when the referendum is agreed to?,53
497,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , but he will not cause them.",53
498,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Le t not the honourable member run away with any such silly notion. There are men as clever as my honourable friend.,53
499,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,It is not a question of cleverness.,53
500,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,What then? It isa question of framing legislation to deal with ordinary human nature.,53
501,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,If that man were in Heaven there would be trouble therenot that he will go there.,53
502,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not know what man the honourable memberrefers to. Is it Mr Brown ? I have met him, but the trouble even there, I think, is that that gentleman has a seam of coal which is not nearly so difficult to work as are many other seamsi",53
503,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,It is just the same as the others; there are no difficulties at all.,53
504,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member refers to the Maitland district. I suppose that would be so, but I am thinking of the older mines on the coast with which I was familiar. The honourable member for West Sydney is onlyemphasizing all I have been saying. He says that there is one man in that district with so much deuced human natureabout him that he makes more trouble than f if t y others. How is the honourable member going: to stop that man making trouble 1",53
505,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I do not know.,53
506,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member never spoke a truer word. He does not Know where he is going, but he is going to get there. He is like the man who was asked what he was striking for, and replied, "" I do not know, but I will not give in t ill I get it . "" I commend the honourable member for all his unwearied labours. I hope he realizes that I speak without a spark of bitterness towards himself or his party in this matter. Nothing would please me better than to see means brought about that would bring a l it t l e peace to this community; but I confess candidly that I do not see the slightest hope in any of the enactments, that he is piling up. They will all multiply and increase the difficulties; they will not settle tliem. That cannot be-. While men are given the right to test these matters, and to bring all their ability, influence, and money to. bear uponthem, the disputes will be multiplied, and not settled. The"" only way to settle them is to divide and localize them, not to generalize them. What the honourable member is seeking through the referendum is to more tharh settle the disputes: he is going to settle the disputes by "" s e t t l in g "" the continent. He is. going to do no less than socialize this country.",53
507,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,"I ask the honourable, member not to discuss the referendum.",53
508,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I am referring to it only in a very general way. Here are the facts -. In 1912 there were in Australia 14,500manufacturing industries; there were 312,000 handsemployed, and £32,000,000 was paid in wages. I find that since the Federal Court was established i u 1904 therle have been only twenty-eight awards.",53
509,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,And we have had nearly twenty-eight Ants in the same time.,53
510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Because the Court has made twenty-eight awards in ten years, honourable members have arrived at the conclusion that they can control all industrial operations in the country, and fix them upon a basis of permanent peace.",53
511,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND,"We have .settled the putes peacefully, and kept the men - work.",54
512,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Are there more than half the number of unionists workconciliation. ing today with no grievance ? They may be working peacefully, but the great bulk of them are wanting another "" go .at the Court for something.",54
513,Mr SIPENCE,CONCILIATION AND,"No , they are not. They are working peacefully without strikes.",54
514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course; are waiting hopefully for the referendum, so that they can get something more. They are waiting, bu t their hope is i the honourable member. Probably there Special Board appointed. would be strikes tomorrow if the men were not waiting for the referendum. And when m y honourable friends opposite position. get the referenda carried, they will have more strikes than they have the past, because then they will have all the power they are seeking, and., i States, where the Courts have complete power and jurisdiction, the disputes are - multiplying, and are not settled. is the position of affairs. This is a mere patching process that is going on by of frequent legislation. The honourable member himself says that the Bill is f if t h attempt, and yet he what is to become of the industrial ship. She is making heavy weather, and if can only get her into port he w i ll be very glad. But the Bill is a patch to prevent her sinking out of sight. This confession is a pitiable for the honourable member to make, even after fifteen years' operation of the in the Federal sphere. I shall not weary honourable members with any further marks. Indeed, I think it would be less to do so. To honourable opposite my remarks go in at the one and out at the other. My chief object is to call attention to the criticisms that honourable members opposite have bestowed upon the proposals in the Bill . All those honourable members on the M i nisterial side v/ho have made speeches have do that ? said that they would rather do without the Arbitration Court as it is now carried on, and they have confessed that things are as unsatisfactory as they can possibly be for the working man. Not honourable members but is getting ready to run away from the Arbitration Court and arbitration legislation, because honourable members know that it is destined to have failure. I believe that in the end, and disa sequel, they will find that the muchat despised Wages Boards, upon which we have heard so much contumely .poured, contain the germ of industrial peace and",54
515,Mr CHAHLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I suppose the honourable member knows that a Wages Board "" has caused the present trouble in the Newcastle district.",54
516,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I do not know it . I venture to say that the cause of the they trouble is that there are not enough Wages Boards in the district.,54
517,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Tlier e was no dissatisn faction on that score, because there was a The trouble was that the award was so ridiculous and unsatisfactory that it led to the present",54

520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable That member says that in this case it is the fault - of the chairman, and then in anway other district we hear of another man causing trouble. The honourable member the must recognise that we have to contend does not know with human nature.",54
521,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Nevertheless, the he fault lies with the Wages Board system. Mr. JOSEPH! COOK - Certainl y not. only A foolish man may be appointed to a Wages Board just as a foolish man in an one Arbitration Court may bring about in finite trouble. Human nature cannot be law avoided. While human nature is what it is, we must do our best with it . Do not relet us blame all our machinery because use now and again some man who does not do members what he ought to do makes a mess of ear things. Would the referendum stop that sort of thing and make all bad men good, all incompetent men competent, or all unfair men fair?",54
522,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Would Wages Boards,54
523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"No . The honourable member for Hunter claims that the trouble in the Newcastle district is due to an unfair award. He considers it u n fair ; one of these that is, one side does.",54
524,Mr CHABLITON,CONCILIATION AND,"No ; both sides do. It is a silly award, if I may so describe it .",54
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Fro m what I heard of it I do not think it was a as wise award. But the awards of our A r bitration Court are not always wise. The Wages Board system as applied at Newcastle is the last thought upon this subject from the honourable member's own party in New South Wales; it is the best they can do; and yet it has not settled their industrial troubles.,54
526,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,And you still argue in favour of the Wages Board system.,55
527,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I do. Nothing that the honourable member has said in reference to the Newcastle trouble has proved anything against the Wages Board machinery. As the honourable member has said, the Judge gave a wrong award.",55
528,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,The High Court also gives wrong awards. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not believe that the Bill will do a scrap of good. I believe that my friends opposite know this.,55
529,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I do not think that the honourable member should say that.,55
530,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I do say it , and I take the honourable member's own language for it , and the language, of other honourable members who have had a very wide practical experience in industrial matters. Not one of them believes that this Bill is going to do any good. The honourable member himself calls it a patch, and says that the "" s h i p "" is water-logged. He says that it cannot get along without the patch. ently, the "" ship "" was water-logged when it was supposed to have full and complete jurisdiction, and now it is water-logged when it is discovered that it has not that power.",55
531,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,It was logged where it had the power; it was being driven in the wrong direction.,55
532,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"If the honorby two to one to return to work. able member knows the direction in this ship should be driven, he is the for the job. But he knows very that, even in Government Departments, peace cannot be maintained. Ministers cannot keep peace in tlieir own works, say nothing of all the ramifications outcould side. Thore is now a strike at Cockatoo Island.",55
533,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,The strike is off.,55
534,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes ; settled, suppose, in a summary way. I wonder what would have happened had Senator Millen stopped it in the same way ? Honview orable members would have been "" on to him like a ton of bricks."" It is marorable vellous what they can do with their own men.",55
535,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,Senato r Millen would have shut the dock if he could have had his way.,55
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"That is another of the rash, u n truth f u l statements the honourable member is always making. He seems to think that it is his mission in life to make rash statements which he should know are not correct. No man sought to encourage that dock more than Senator Millen did.",55
537,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,He went about it in a funny way.,55
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,He did not do whab Senator Pearce is now doing by summarily suppressing this strike.,55
539,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the question before the Chair.,55
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I am talking about industrial peace. I do not agree with some of the things the Attorney General said last night, but time will not permit me to deal with them. However, one thing more than anything else I know of at the present time is likely to give us industrial peace, and that is the holding of a secret ballot before any trouble occurs. It is of no use blinking our eyes to the fact that many strikes are Appar- manufactured. On the East-West railway construction trouble was settled the moment there was a secret ballot taken. The wages and conditions were good, and the men had nothing to strike about, but one or two individuals kept them out on strike for the whole of the time, and not waterwould not allow a ballot to be taken. But the moment that the men had the opportunity to take a secret ballot, they voted In which my judgment, there are many similar man cases occurring today. If men could well only decide in their own deliberate and calm way about matters in dispute, I have an abundant and abiding faith into their calm sense. I know that, if they express their views in a secret manner before trouble actually came to the surface, there would be a great deal more industrial peace than we have today. I However, I cannot argue that question. I must leave the matter where it is. This Bil l will do no good from the point of of industrial peace. Instead, it will start another crop of litigants. My honfriends opposite are pulling up the 3 present pegs in the Arbitration Court, and they have to lay down others in place of them. Until they do that, litigation will continue. In doing away with one difficulty, they are creating a number of others. That is not the way in which to bring about industrial peace, but rather industrial litigation, and out of industrial litigation, I venture to say, the working man will get but small satisfaction.",55
541,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.26] - I intend to occupy the time of honourable members for only a very few minutes. Between the war and the dreadful avalanche of pessimism which the Leader of the Opposition has launched upon the House to-night, I feel f r i g h t depressed, and quite unequal to the task before me. I never saw a man so.pessimistic who looked so cheerful as did my honourable friend. His face was wreathed in smiles while he told us that there was no industrial way of salvation open to us. The only gleam of hope that I was able to gather from his remarks was that, given certain conditions, a settlement of disputes across the table was a brilliant project. This, unfortunately, is a proposal neither novel nor brilliant. "" Here is the table, and here are we."" I have seen disputes across this table, instead of proceeding towards a settlement, too often fanned to still fiercer flames, and only ultimately suppressed by the application of brute force, exhaustion of physical effort, or effluxion of time. I have had some experience in this House, and outside of it , of endeavouring to settle disputes across a table. All I can say in that connection is that you can settle a dispute across a table if it does not amount to much, but you cannot settle it if it does. Settlement in such cases is possible only by an appeal to some tribunal outside the parties. The Leader of the Opposition has said that this Court is not an Arbitration Court, but a Court of litigation. answer is that it is the best Court that we can create with our limited powers. He says the Court has done nothing. I Bay that it has done a great deal. I affirm deliberately that it has prevented industrial strife of a wide-spread character. To my own certain knowledge, in my own organization, industrial strife would have been as certain as anything on this earth can be but for the'existence of this Court - a Court of competent jurisdiction which afforded an opportunity for a just settlement being arrived at. It is perfectly true that, by reaBon of human nature being what it is, we cannot hope that any Court will give complete satisfaction to both parties. We must recollect that parties to industrial disputes have widely divergent interests, and that, therefore, to lament that better relations do not exist between employer and employ^ is. to misunderstand completely the factors of the problem. Tbere cannot be a better understanding between persons whose interests are widely divergent. Why does not the honourable member talk about a better understanding between France and Germany f The better full y understanding will come when one party is no longer able to resist the desires of the other, and not before. The only alternative is some tribunal to which both parties must resort, and by whose award they must abide. That is ' the A r b i tration Court; but the decisions of the Court will never be completely-satisfactory to both parties. One of the main reasons why it has not been as successful as it might have been-thoug h it has done excellent work-is that many employers in this country have never permitted any organization to enjoy an award given fairly by it after careful and meticulous investigation, if , by an appeal upon technical points, or upon some matter dealing with form rather than substance, they could upset the award. This Court performs a great work. . It maintains industrial peace; and, in comparison with the work performed by other Courts, it is of more value to the community than all the rest of them put together. The Leader of the Opposition, as a sort of setoff to his lamentations on the failure of the Court, affirmed his willingness to do anything in his power to make it better. But his efforts are confined to talk. He does not do anything to make it My better. He talks about Wages Boards, but he knows perfectly well that an appeal may be made from the determination of those Boards in this State. Hesays that that ought not to be. But he knows that it is the concomitant of - all Wages Board systems. It is perfectly true that if we had wider powers we could establish subordinate Courts in that way, we could deal with matters more expeditiously and economically. Bnt, until we get these wider powers, we can only hope to amend the law so that the Court may continue to exercise such functions as it possesses. I regret that I am unable to follow altogether the points raised by the honourable member for Darling Downs. In my opinion, clause 13 does not lessen the powers of the Court under section 60 in regard to an application for cancellation of registration. The Court will have the same powers that it always had. It may, under sub-section a, cancel the registration of an organization for any reason that it thinks fit.",56
542,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Can it question the registration at all,under section 60?",57
543,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"Certainly . The honourable member asks for a public notification of the intention to change the constitution and description of an industry in order that other organizations and parties may be afforded an opportunity of being heard. I shall not attempt to make that alteration in the Act, but I will suggest to the Registrar the propriety of providing in the regulations for it. As to section 3, I have dealt with that in another place. In my opinion, all that the Bill represents is an endeavour to make the Act work more satisfactorily; and I trust, therefore, that the House will agree to it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA (No. 2). Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. House adjourned at 10.37 p.m.",57
