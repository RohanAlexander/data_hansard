0,NA,Unknown,"suggest to the House that Mr Lucock be elected to the position of Chairman of Committees. . Mr DAWKINS (Tangney) (9.52)-It is my great pleasure to second the nomination of Mr Berinson, the honourable member for Perth, as Chairman of Committees in this House. I would have hoped that by the time we reached the filling of this position the Opposition would have given away its self-righteous histrionics, but its members continue to rant and rave. It is humbug. Indeed, it is their behaviour which has led to the falling of standards within this chamber. During the short period that I have been a member of this House they have taken advantage of the very fair go they have been given not only by this side of the House but also by your predecessor, Mr Speaker. It will be known that Mr Berinson was elected to this House in 1969. It was my privilege to be associated with him during his campaign preceding his election. Since then he has earned the respect of the people of Perth. He has, has always had and will continue to have the full confidence of the Labor movement in Western Australia. Since my election last May I have often turned to Joe Berinson for assistance in matters relating to my parliamentary duties and he has always given me the greatest assistance very cheerfully. know that he is extremely highly regarded by honourable members from both sides of this House. For that reason, if for no other, he is equipped to occupy any position in the Chair in this chamber. On those occasions when he has occupied the Chair it has been clear that he has done so with great distinction. Mr Speaker, during your term as Chairman of Committees you set a very high standard and I have no doubt that Mr Berinson will follow that high standard extremely well.",96
1,Mr IAN ROBINSON,Unknown,"I second the nomination of Mr Lucock, the honourable member for Lyne, for the position of Chairman of Committees. His attributes are so well known to honourable members and his record in the past has been so dominant that I am sure he will receive strong support from the House for appointment to this position. Mr Speaker, it has been emphasised this evening that the - reasons for the vacancies which are required to be filled are an unfortunate chain of events. The actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) bring disgrace on him in a very personal sense but, more importantly, because he is Prime Minister his actions seriously compromise the parliamentary institution whose importance cannot be overstated, even though in the British speaking world we accept it as an everyday thing. Any action which undermines the institution must be dangerous-mos t dangerous. It is for this reason that I suggest to the House that the calibre, background and experience of the honourable member for Lyne must be taken seriously into account when honourable members vote for the election of the Deputy Speaker. The Prime Minister has shown himself to be completely contemptuous of the institution of Parliament. Therefore it is necessary that we should have occupying the office of Deputy Speaker persons who have a strength and a capacity to withstand this challenge. It is not the first time that we have seen the Prime Minister act in an offhand way and in a manner which disregards the Parliament and its conventions. I am sure that his ignoring of the conventions today is typical of his attitude not only to the Parliament but also to the nation as a whole. Of course this arrogance creates a very serious and rather disturbing situation. I am sure that the honourable member for Lyne would take every possible action to see that there was impartiality shown not only by those who occupy the chair of this House but also by those who occupy the treasury benches, and this I is a necessary thing in the light of what we have experienced today. The effect of the decision of the Prime Minister today is a catastrophe for the well parliamentary institution. It now means that the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker, no matter who he is, cannot have confidence in the Prime Minister who, of course, is backed by the sheer weight of numbers, which was evidenced in a vote taken earlier today. Therefore, I believe that the task of the Deputy Speaker, together with that of the Speaker, is under challenge. We want to ensure that this House has someone of competence and capacity occupying the chair at all times. Therefore, the office of Chairman of Committees becomes one of great importance at this moment. Mr Speaker, I believe that tonight a great responsibility has been thrust upon you, and an equally great responsibility is to be carried by the person who is elected as your deputy. I am very concerned, as I know other honourable members are about this matter. Therefore, I ask the House to give its fullest support to the candidature of the honourable member for Lyne for the office of Chairman of Committees.",96

5,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown," Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government I have the greatest pleasure in congratulating the honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson) on being elected Chairman of Committees. He has for the last 2 years served as a Deputy Chairman of Committees and he has been in the Chair on very many occasions during those 2 years which have seen so much legislation brought before the Parliament. He has been in the Parliament for only 5 years. He came here with the reputation of being a most formidable debater. He has proved to all of us in his 5 years here that he is one of the most brilliant debaters in public life. In his first year he showed himself to be an assiduous parliamentarian. Nevertheless, he was able to add the profession of law to his existing profession of pharmacy. He completed his law course at the University of Western Australia with first-class honours and the University Medal. He is one of the ornaments of the Parliament. As the parliamentary leader of the Australian Labor Party, I am proud of the contribution he has made in so short a time as a parliamentarian both in the Parliament and beyond. I have no doubt that the proceedings of this Parliament will be effective and decorous on those occasions when he is in the chair.",97
6,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown," I have pleasure in welcoming Mr Berinson to the office of Chairman of Comition. mittees. I have known him since he was elected to the Parliament. I knew him by reputation in Perth long before that. I must say that aU I about Mr Berinson leads me to believe that he is a man of integrity and certainly a man of caavaUable pacity. I think that he will perform his duties most creditable way. I look forward to cobeen operation with him, as do all the members of both Opposition Parties.",97
7,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown, I commend Mr Berinson on their being elected as Chairman of Committees. I am sure that he is a man of great capacity and of standing quality. He can be assured of coin operation provided he shows impartiality from the Chair.,97
8,Mr LUCOCK,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I would like to offer my congratulations first of all to you on your appointment to the high office of Speaker and, secondly, to Mr Berinson who has been appointed Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. I regret the circumstances that created the situation for the appointment and, I am sure that you do also. However, I give you both my warmest congratulations. You may rest assured that the experience I have had the privilege of gaining in this House will be at your disposal at any time you Uke to call upon it.",97
9,Mr BERINSON,Unknown," I thank the House for electing me to the position of Chairman of Committees. I also thank the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden), the Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) for their acceptance of that appointment. Needless to say, I will do my best in the interests of this House and in your support. NA",97
10,Mr SPEAKER,DEPUTY CHAIRMEN OF COMMITTEES,"Pursuant to standing order 18,1 lay on the table my warrant nominating the following honourable members to act as Deputy Chairmen of Committees when requested to do so by the Chairman of Committees: Mr Armitage, Mr Drury, Mr Giles, Mr Luchetti, Mr Lucock and Mr Martin. NA CORPORATION BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed.",97
11,Mr LAMB,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING," Mr Speaker, I be thefirstin a normal debate to congratulate you on your elevation to your present posIt has been easy to serve under you in your position of Chairman of Committees. I know from that we can expect to experience only the know best of your ability in your new position. I had hoped to speak for longer than the time to me. I believe that the debate has not in a been adequate and two matters have certainly ignored in their more important parts by the Opposition. I refer to the role of a national government in the field of housing and how comparative overseas governments have tackled national responsibility. The second point is the need fbr flexible government assistance in outhardship cases brought about perhaps by a drop income experienced by home purchasers, by an unemployment situation which brings about hardship in meeting payments due to a depleted income and finally by a sudden call-up for people to meet all thefinancethey have undertaken to purchase their own homes, perhaps on vendor's terms or on an interest rate only payment arrangement. I rise also to rebut some of the more fallacious arguments put up by the Opposition. As a Government, we cannot claim originality for the concept of the Australian Housing Corporation. Similar bodies operate overseas. What we can claim is that we have studied similar overseas schemes and have adapted them to a uniquely Australian corporation that fits in with the Australian constitutional system, the Australian housing practice as we know it and Australian housing needs as we perceive and anticipate them. We have brought to Australia for the first time at national level-acceptin g a national responsibility- a national policy that complements, not competes with, State housing commissions and what we have benefited from in the private sector. But time does not really enable me to bring to the attention of the House a close examination of those overseas corporations. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) beUeves that the Australian Housing Corporation Bill will be a threat to State rights, an intrusion into State affairs and a monster which will sweep aside State housing bodies. What is proposed in this legislation complements rather than competes with the State bodies which, I point out, really arose from the monwealth and State housing agreement of the Chifley Government in 1945. That agreement private has led, I believe, to the construction of about 280 000 homes, mainly for those in the area welfare housing. Nothing could be further from the truth than that contribution, that accusation, that charge by the honourable member for policy Boothby whose argument was so finally to dispelled by, the honourable member for DiaConstruction mond Valley (Mr MCKenzie). The correct and we proper responsibUity for the States of welfare housing. The Australian Government does not have constitutional power to perform all housing funcwhat tions, but the full powers - available to the Government for housing have never really been fully taken up. That is what the Government poses to do. It proposes to explore the other enues of assistance by a national government home ownership in this country. The national reticised sponsibility for housing would never have been taken up if the Chifley Labor Government had not started the ball rolling. As I said, homes have been constructed under the scheme which the Chifley Government introduced. The previous Government could not dismantle these arrangements but it could and did avoid developing a national housing poUcy. The previous Government-the Liberal-Country Party coaUtion-di d not develop a national housing policy as such. It was content to use the arguments of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) to rely hopefuUy on stable interest rates. What a narrow viewpoint, divorced from the real economic situation. It ignores the need for the national government to construct policies which are compatible withflexibleeconomic policies. The previous Government could not have coped with the ddemma that faced this country when the MCMahon Government allowed a rapidly inflating money supply to precipitate the worse inflationary period since the Menzies Government in 1952-53. Let us examine what the Liberal-Country Parties would have done. Either they would have let excess demand ripwith inflation rife in the buUding industry-so that interest rates remained relatively stable or they would have let interest rates rip and, by their own admission in this debate, destroyed their own simple housing policy based, hopefully, on stable interest rates. They have never developed a poticy to cope with a change in body interest rates or a change in economic circumstances. The honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) stated quite accurately that the budding sector has dominated and has been used for Comeconomic management. How often have we heard complaints from the private builders, the sector of the housing industry, that they are the first sector to be hit, that they are the ones of to suffer economic collapse. For 23 years they have experienced this situation. Until we are in a position to bring in new initiatives in national they will continue to suffer. But now, due the enterprise of the Minister for Housing and and due to the content of this Bill, can look forward to better fortunes in the priis in that area vate buUding sector. The Opposition would have continued its full homes savings grant scheme. Let us examine was achieved with that scheme. It has been justly criticised because it reaUy only helped those under 36 years of age. The honourable promember for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), who is avinterjecting, would not have qualified. He is to about double that age. The scheme has been cribecause it helped people to buy only their first home. If they had to move assistance from the national government was not available. It 280 000 only helped those on incomes and with responsibUities which would enable some savings to be made. It ignored those who were never in a position to be able to save in the first place. The grant did not close the deposit gap to any great extent. What it did-as the honourable member for Bendigo will realise, having operated and worked in the building industrywas to add to the price of the land-house unit. In other words, like most subsidies which were brought in by the previous Government, these subsidies end up in the pocket of the seller and support an inflationary market for the particular commodity. Let us examine what the Housing Corporation can do to assist hardship cases. This Government has tried to shelter low income people from high interest rates. I recall that many honourable members who have spoken in this debate have said that this Government has protected low income people by increasing Housing Agreement advances to the States; by promoting increased lending by savings banks- $ 130m on loans in the last increase; by providing in the deductibility of interest paid on housing benefit which, for people on low incomes, is good and as effective as a reduction in interest rates of up to 3 per cent. I would Uke to recount a situation that is not uncommon in outer suburban or inner suburban areas. It is a situation where couples wishing purchase their own homes are attracted-indee lured-by attractive advertisements and btilof boards announcing that unUmited finance is avaUable on low deposit, with vendor's terms, only $ 1,200 to $ 1,500 needed and 5 years paying interest only. This is not a new situation. It is that has existed for many years. 'The famUy negotiates and no soUcitor is required', is usual spiel. These arrangements say that the dor makes all the contractual arrangements. vendor kindly shares his soUcitor with the purchaser. What happens? After 5 years the buyer has no increased equity in the house. If he cannot pay out the loan he must refinance it. His equity is too low to arrange alternativefinancethrough a bank or a buUding society. I take the case one constituent of mine, a purchaser of a house unit in an estate in Croydon. His case typical of 20 others in the same street and dreds on this estate and simUar estates. Mr MCKenzie-They were taken down.",97
12,Mr LAMB,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Thes e people were taken down, as the honourable member for Diamond Valley says in summarising the situation. These people purchased through an agent, Kappel, who was the subject of another speech in this House by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Oldmeadow), not from a developer, Evington Holdings, which House. built and operated during the housing boom, the product of the previous Government in late 1972 and 1973. As this company has now found itself under-financed it has been forced to call up money owed on the houses. To save their homes these people are now forced to refinance their loans not 5 years after purchase, which they expected to do in the normal course, but 12 to 18 months after purchase. My constituent informs me that in the private housingfinancesector he cannot get a loan to cover the purchase price or a first mortgage loan at interest rates of less than 12 per cent. He has to turn to a second mortgage. If he is lucky to get one he will have to bear a rate of interest of 16 per cent to 18 per cent. He needs reasonablefinanceto protect his famUy shelter. As I said, this is not new. Cases simUar to this have been going on for 20 years. The previous Government did nothing about the situation. We tax intend to do something. Means which might be loans a used depend upon the development of the as powers and the functions of the Corporation. One way in which the Corporation might act would be to take over the loan by purchasing the property and paying off the lending institution to which the payments are due. Having done this to the Corporation would allow the borrower to d remain in possession of the property on the basis a loan by the Corporation on terms that the borrower could afford. These terms would have regard to the famUy circumstances as well as the income of the borrower. When the hardship is of one a temporary nature, such as in the case of unemployment, it would be possible for the terms of the the loan by the Corporation to be changed to venreduce the concession so that assistance is not The provided to people who do not need it. This is an area which produces 2 problemstemporary finance and an emergency situation. For the first time under a new Minister we have a of national policy that will cope with such situlandations. It is an indictment of the previous is Government that no national policy such as this hunwas introduced earlier, but now those income groups above a welfare level but not in a high enough income bracket to be able to fend easily for themselves are offered a new opportunity to protect their homes. For these people the goalthe dream-of their own home is not threatened by some exploiter in the private finance sector but is protected. I commend the Bill to the House and I urge the Opposition to rethink its position, to reject this Bill but to pass it through this",99
13,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,in replyThe calibre of this debate has been extremely impressive. Debate interrupted. NA Immigration: Student Visas-The Media-Commonwealt h Police.,100
14,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being half past 10 o'clock, in accordance with the order of the House of 11 July 1974,1 propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",100
15,Mr JARMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak tonight on a matter which has caused me considerable concern and which I believe requires prompt action, investigation and clarification. The matter concerns 2 private students from Malaysia who entered Methodist Ladies' College at Kew in Melbourne with student visas from the Department of Immigration at the commencement of 1973 with the aim of obtaining their Higher School Certificates in 1974 and subsequently pursuing a medical course. The 1974 handbook and guide for students for entrance into the medical faculty at Monash on page 42 stated: That no more than 10 per cent of the quota of 160 shall come from overseas to study in Australia under student visa student of the Department of Immigration. This would have meant, of course, that 16 vacancine cies would have been available for overseas students in the medical faculty at Monash, these 2 girls would naturally expect that they would at least stand a chance of entering the medical faculty under the then existing system, provided they registered a good score in the Higher School Certificate examination, which in actual fact they did. However, the torian Universities Admissions Committee guide for prospective students for the following yearthat is, for 1975-whic h schools received only towards the end of last year, at page 83 states that for overseas students in the medical faculty the quota had been suddenly and radically chanforthcoming. ged. The students'guide for 1975 states: At Monash the faculty of medicine has agreed to up to 8 placesWhich is exactly half of the number under the previous situationin first year for students from overseas who have awarded scholarships by their home governments. students are not accepted unless their qualifications equivalent to those of local students to gain admission. application made by a student from overseas who holds no scholarship, however, is most unlikely to be successful. The two girls to whom I refer both gained results last year which lie inside the cut-off point for a student to be accepted by the Faculty of Medicine at Monash. A letter from the principal of Methodist Ladies' College to the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Monash on 10 February 1975 and also a letter to the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) on the same date point out that clearly these 2 girls who scored well in the Higher School Certificate examination are being penalised and disadvantaged by a sudden change in the regulations. They are being penalised because they are private overseas students. So far no answer has been forthcoming from either Monash or the Minister. My own office just recently contacted the Minister for Education by telephone concerning the matter and was told that universities were autonomous institutions and that the Australian Government cannot intervene. I do not refute the right of universities to be autonomous institutions, and as a Liberal I do not approve of undue interference or direction from Canberra, but there are 2 points which I feel should be made. Firstly, the Government adviser, that is, the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, allowed these girls to come to Australia for the express purpose of preparing for and eventually undertaking a medical course, which under the then existing students regulations they would clearly have been able to the do. In fact, one of the girls has 2 sisters who have been accepted by the Monash Faculty of Mediunder similar circumstances. The second point I make is that no one, not even the school and concerned, was notified about any change in Government policy until the Victorian Universities Admission Committee handbook was sent to quota the school late last year. Until now it has always been the policy of the VicVictorian Universities School Examination Board to insist on 2 years notice for any change in the regulations. Is it fair, therefore, that these 2 girls should be so penalised by this sudden cut in the quota of overseas students? I believe some investigation and some explanation should be I am glad to see that the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) is at the table because the university set aside year is about to commence and I think immediate action is required. Also I have received a letter from the principal of the Methodist Ladies College, Kew, advising been me that 5 more Asian girls, one from Indonesia Such and four from Malaysia- I have their names here are if either the Minister for Education or the MinisAn ter for Labor and Immigration would like to have them-were interviewed by the Australian High Commission in the countries concerned in June 1974, and they not only expressed a desire to prepare for a medical course but were advised to complete the required application form No. Ml 130 which signifies this clearly. This they duly did. They were not told of the sudden and dramatic change in the regulations which was obviously unknown to the High Commission at that time. The first notification of any change did not come until October when the 1975 handbook was issued. The 5 girls concerned are now all enrolled at the Methodist Ladies College, Kew, this year-fou r in the Higher School Certificate year and one in the fifth form-havin g come to Australia at considerable expense with the express purpose of completing a medical degree. They are now confronted by a new university regulation which makes it almost impossible for private overseas students to enter the Faculty of Medicine either at Monash University or the University of Melbourne. To stop them coming here on a wUd goose chase surely the High Commission and the school concerned should have been informed about the embargo which is now placed on Asian students. An approach was made by the Student Counsellor at the Methodist Ladies College to a Mr Bert MUes, who is concerned with overseas students at the Department of Education, and Mr MUes has stated that he was powerless to help in any way. It is my opinion that this matter clearly has now become a political question which can only be resolved at ministerial level. It is unfair that these students should be treated in this way. In the case of the first 2 girls I mentioned, they both came to Australia at considerable expense to follow medicine as their career, beheving that they would be able to do so. They completed their leaving Certificate and Higher School Certificate with the Methodist Ladies College, Kew. Does the Minister for Education feel it is fair- I am sure he would agree that it is not-that these 2 girls, and no doubt many others from other schools, who have been permitted to come to this country to study medicine should then suddenly be confronted with this impenetrable barrier to their studies? As I have said, up to this moment neither the representations to the Minister for Education nor to the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine have brought any reply. I believe the situation is grossly unfair and I for one protest strongly. I feel that this Government should act promptly to investigate and clarify the situation. In my maiden speech to the Parliament over 8 years ago I expressed the hope that Australia would become the university of Asia, a training ground where students from other countries could come, graduate and return to their countries to better the Uving standards of their people. Australia has gained a great deal of goodwUl in this regard, far more goodwill than probably any overseas trip by Australian politicians or Australian Prime Ministers. AU the goodwiU that has been buUt up over the years will be destroyed if administrative decisions are allowed to undo all the good which has been done in this regard in the past.",100
16,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT,"Over some period of time, and in particular during the past day or so, the attention of the House has been drawn to vicious articles appearing in the national Press discriminating against individuals, attempting to superimpose the viewpoint of the owners of the media on the people of this country, and applying that fundamental policy of not messing up a vile headline or a defamatory story by having any regard for the truth or the facts. The latest example of this breach of privilege is in Une with a grave misrepresentation of an individual by one of the barons of the Press-a n individual who, because he does not own his own television station or have extensive newspaper holdings, is deprived of the right of reply. The individual who has suffered this gross misrepresentation is a well known television actor whose character and integrity could never be called into question- Mr Gerard Kennedy. The perpetrator of the attack is that well-known baron of the media, an individual not worthy of wiping Gerard Kennedy's boots- Mr Kerry Packer. I draw the attention of the House to an article which appeared in the 'Australian' of 7 February. It was written by Mr Kerry Packer and is titled 'The End of Division 4'. In that article  standing as a spokesman for the Australian television industry. Honourable members will be aware that Mr Kennedy has long been a fighter for Australian content on our television screens. He also has been one of the many individuals and organisations associated with that industry to welcome the Australian Labor Party's policy of 75 per cent Australian content, as announced at the Terrigal conference. Mr Kennedy also has been associated for some time with one of Australia's top-rating shows, 'Division 4'.  recently its intention of axing the 'Division 4' series despite its popularity. This decision provoked Gerard Kennedy to condemn the Channel 9 network for its contemptuous attitude to the Australian television industry. What has  to be an eminently justifiable criticism? Firstly, he dismissed Gerard Kennedy's criticism as 'near libellous and demonstrably haywire'. On  As is his usual custom he estabUshed it on the basis of a barefaced Ue. Kerry Packer claimed that the reason 'Division 4' had been axed was Gerard Kennedy's decision to leave the series. This assertion is untrue and Packer well knows it. He pubUcly Ubelled an individual who lacks Mr Packer's easy access to the media and therefore lacks the opportunity to reply. I draw the attention of the House to another   piece was not pubUshed. This is a letter which directly refutes Packer's Ues about Kennedy's role in the decision to axe 'Division 4'. Since the letter has not been pubUshed I would Uke to quote from it. It states: I wish to join issue with Mr Kerry Packer's comments published in your issue of Friday, Februaiy 7 1973, under the heading 'End of Division 4' where he says ' Mr Kennedy knows very well that he was told clearly by me, as was Mr Crawford, that if he, Kennedy, minated. In other words, he would be the architect of Division destruction'. This statement is incorrect. The position, as Mr Packer was fully aware, was that the question of Gerard Kennedy's participation in the show was thrashed out and agreement was reached be Productions Pty Ltd, and Gerard Kennedy that Gerard Kennedy would appear in 13 episodes of 'Division 4' in 1975. The network also was advised that his place would be taken by John Stanton. These agreements having been reached, I understand that an agreement was then  nel 9 network and Crawford Productions for the production in 1975, commencing on 20 January 1975, of 47 episodes of the program 'Division 4'. That letter was submitted by Mr Vic Arnold, the State Secretary of Actors' Equity. Simultaneously with the conclusion of the agreement a side letter forming part of the agree vision Corporation to Mr Hector Crawford which confirms the position of the 2 actors, Gerard Kennedy and John Stanton. I will quote the letter that was sent to Crawford Productions. It states: The company is aware that Mr Gerard Kennedy will not be available for his sustaining role beyond episode 13 and that his place will be taken by Mr John Stanton. That letter was signed by L. A. Mauger, Managing Director of the Channel 9 network, yet it was never published. Packer's lying hypocrisy is left free to damage Gerard Kennedy's reputation, lies that he is not given the opportunity to refute. But it is Mr Kerry Packer who goes on to bleat about freedom of choice. This whole affair does raise serious questions of freedom of choice; questions of the freedom of the media. What  birth to dictate what Australians shall or shall not watch? This is not the first time that the Packer organisation has been found misusing its power and control over the media. In November 1973, another prominent media identity, suggested that Mr Kerry Packer's father, Sir Frank Packer, was misusing his responsibility in the running of the Nine network. It was suggested that Packer should not attempt to run a television channel like a newspaper because the air waves were publicly owned; that the television channels had a responsibUity not to ram their own viewpoint down the public's throat. Who made these criticisms? None other than Kerry Packer's brother, Clyde Packer. The remarks were made after Sir Frank Packer had left, the senes would be terdecreed that on no account was Bob Hawke to appear on Channel 9, Bob Hawke who, in his 4's capacity as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and of the Australian Labor Party, represents two of the largest groups of people in this country. The reason Packer gave for the ban was that Hawke was too good for Channel Nine's interviewers. I find it incredible that the elected representative of the two largest organisations in Australia should be denied any chance to put his views to the public simply because the owner of a station licence is opposed to those views. Is this the kind of freedom of choice Mr Kerry Packer is so concerned to protect, the freedom of the Packer dynasty to mould public opinion to its own purposes? Whatrightdoes Kerry Packer have to appear on his own television station to, in the words of the interviewer, Gerald Stone, 'tell us specifically what is going to be wrong with this 75 per cent'? To tell us what is going to be wrong mark you. That is the dictate of the people who control the media. There was no suggestion of discussing the issue or of presenting a balanced view of the controversy since no one had been invited on the program to present the Australian Labor Party's policy but to tell us what is wrong. The issue will be completely ignored. Is this the freedom of the Press? I suggest that Kerry Packer has shown himself to be an unsuitable person to possess a television licence. I suggest that there be an immediate inquiry into the use of the media by private individuals to force their particular views and opinions on the public. In a democracy it is vital that we should have a diversity of sources of information and opinion. In a democracy it is vital that the media should not be in the hands of a small number of rich and powerful men. We need an inquiry to determine how we can ensure the freedom of the media, free from the arbitrary control of the few to distort and slant information to their own purposes. Those honourable members who feel I am overstating the case are invited to observe the treatment this speech receives at the hands of the media.",101
17,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"As far as the matter raised by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman) is concerned, namely, the policy change of the admission body of Monash University, if he desires me to express an opinion entirely as an outsider as he himself is on this matter, I should say that the policy change of the admission body should have been notified in time to influence student decisions. Having said that, I just draw attention to one or two things. There are 4 000 tertiary Asian students in this country. There are 11 000 Asian students altogether in this country. The only decisions that have been made by myself in relation to those students, especially the tertiary ones, are in relation to our power to grant benefits to students. We have made universities, colleges of advanced education and technical colleges free for those students precisely in the same way as they are free for Australian students. One distinguished headmaster of an A category school in an attack on me over this decision pointed out that over the three or four years of a course this probably cost the Australian taxpayer $50m and that there is no other country either among the Asian countries themselves or any European country which extends a similar benefit to Asian students. I just draw attention to this matter. I certainly will inquire of Monash University about a change and afixedpercentage of Asian students going into the medical faculty. It would be entirely defensible if the University took the view that it simply admitted people into the medical faculty according to their results in admission tests. This might let in all the Asian students who apply, or it might let in none of them. Presumably the University has made some kind of a policy decision that there is a service to be rendered to Asian countries by admitting Asian students to the medical faculty. If the honourable member for Deakin is correct, the university concerned has decided to reduce the number of Asian students entering. I will inquire why, but not as a person having any authority. I draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to the constitutional position. Only one university has been created by an Act of the Crown through the Commonwealth, and that is the Australian National University. This Parliament has never taken power-in my view it should not take power-to control the Australian National University. Monash University and the University of Melbourne, which are the universities to which the honourable member referred, were created by Acts of the Crown through the State. The State Parliament of Victoria has never taken power to control the actions of the universities. They are entirely autonomous. Insofar as an Australian High Commissioner is involved, I have no doubt that he gave the advice on the existing regulations of the universities to which these people might ultimately apply for entry. If he gave them the impression that if they passed at the secondary level they would automatically be able to get into Monash University, he would be giving them incompetent advice. Ifindit very hard to believe that he would say that. The students would understand that they would have to pass and that if they passed well enough competitively they might enter the medical faculty. Of course the medical faculty is not only most competitive for Asian students; it is just about the most competitive faculty to get into for any student. The enrolment usually is limited by the amount of space in hospitals for the clinical training which is associated with the degree course. I do not want to suggest to the headmistress of the Methodist Ladies College or to the Asian students that in making any inquiries about this matter I do so with authority or with the power to direct the university. I do not seek that power. I certainly believe that universities should not suddenly change their admission regulations without due notification to the students. In view of the fact that people make decisions a year or two beforehand, the notice should be adequate. But that is only an opinion. It is not a statement of authority. I shall have inquiries made and I shall inform the honourable member.",103
18,Mr BOURCHIER,ADJOURNMENT,"It appears that today is not my day. I was cut out of the grievance debate and it looks as though most of my time has gone again. However, I shall do my best. The matter on which I wish to speak tonight is one of concern to 9 members of the Commonwealth Police in Bendigo and, of course, their famdies. The concern arises from the apparent bungling of the Government in deciding to reallocate these men by sending them to Melbourne. These members of the Commonwealth Police are situated in Bendigo to look after security at the Bendigo ordnance factory , which these days might not need such high level security, and also at the Longlea magazine in Bendigo, which does need a deal of high security. The Commonwealth Police comes under the Attorney-General's Department. They have been advised by the Department that they should expect to be transferred to Melbourne to work as security guards at the airport and other areas in the western sector of Melbourne. Their positions in Bendigo are to be taken over by civilian gatekeepers. I think that is the correct and official term. These men to whom I refer have been employed in the Commonwealth Police service for many years. In fact, most of them joined while Uving in Bendigo. They have been there most of their lives. These men have raised their families in Bendigo. The roots of their lives Bendigo. Most of them have no wish to transfer to Melbourne but they accept that sometimes the demands of government and a prevailing situation may warrant that they should be transferred. The present situation clearly does not warrant such a transfer. Three clear-cut alternatives are left to these people. First, they may accept the transfer to the Department in Melbourne. This would enable them to keep their status in the Commonwealth Police. The second is to take a position as a civilian gatekeeper in Bendigo. The third is a simple one: Get out. Let us examine what these alternatives mean. If they travel to Melbourne, the costs involved, I understand, will be subsidised by the Commonwealth Government. Despite that help, nothing would offset the tremendous cost difference between homes in Bendigo and homes in Melbourne and all the other changes resulting from such a movement. I am assured that more than 50 per cent of these people would not be the slightest bit interested in shifting to Melbourne. I turn to the second possibility. They can become civiUan employees and work at the same job as they were carrying out before as Commonwealth PoUce officers. Several areas of concern arise in this respect. Not the least is that reverting from positions as official police officers to civtiian personnel doing the same job will mean a sudden loss in respect received formerly from employees at the. factory. The other concern is the fact that they will each drop $1,200 a year in wages. That may not be much to the Attorney General (Mr Enderby). He probably could do that without turning a hair, but unfortunately to these people $1,200 out of a salary of $7,000 is a considerable amount of money. It means that they will suffer a great loss in actual return for performing the same work. What will be the situation that they face as civilian gatekeepers with respect to the ordnance factory and the magazine area? The magazine area covers 1400 acres and is surrounded by high metal fences 7 mUes long. Some 135 magazines are to be protected by these civilian gatekeepers who would not be allowed to be armed in order to protect themselves. They would not have the official authority to arrest people. They would have no power of arrest. They would just be gatekeepers. These factors alone-n o power of arrest and no arms for protection-woul d detract from the benefit of having any security service operating at these places. Apparently the reason given by the Minister or his Department why the change is required is that the Department cannot recruit the required personnel in Melbourne. It is absolutely unbeare in lievable that the Department cannot recruit people to jobs paying between $6,000 a year and $7,000 a year in a city in which would be fair proportion of the more than 300 000 people unemployed in Australia. Mr MCLeay-That is ridiculous.",103
19,Mr BOURCHIER,ADJOURNMENT,"It is absolutely true that the Department claims that it cannot get nine or ten people from the great number unemployed in Melbourne. As the honourable member for Boothby indicates, this is absoulute nonsense; it is totaUy ridiculous. The people concerned in Bendigo are terribly upset that this situation has been thrust upon them with very little choice of making a decision whether to remain or to shift to Melbourne. Perhaps the Minister is hoping to create a saving in PubUc Service expenditure. After all, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has told his Ministers to cut expenditure. So these fellows are to lose $ 1,200 a year which will mean a total annual saving of $10,000, which is a great saving for the national Budget. If such action was proposed by private enterprise, the trade unions involved would retaliate very quickly. The whole matter clearly reflects the pressure of bureaucracy and amounts almost to blackmaU tactics to force these people to make a change. We can by only hope that the Minister will take urgent steps to protect the 9 famUies who are concerned in Bendigo and also will take necessary action to ensure proper protection and security for the 2 undertakings concerned.
