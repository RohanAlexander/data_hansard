SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008 First Reading Bill, explanatory memorandum and-by leave-Inter-Governmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
2,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce a bill to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent national body whose role will be to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. The government has set itself the task of creating a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary state duplications, overlaps and differences. Occupational health and safety is a prime candidate for this sort of reform. More than 300 Australians are killed each year at work. Many more die as a result of work related disease. Each year over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. The cost to our economy has been estimated at $34 billion per year. The cost to those injured and to their families, workmates and friends is inestimable. Our health, safety and compensation systems are in a sorry state-unnecessarily complex and costly. Inconsistencies between jurisdictions mean that some workers are at risk of poorer safety standards than their counterparts in other states. At the same time, these inconsistencies increase the complexity, paperwork and costs for the 39,000 Australian businesses that operate across state boundaries. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential part of the government's strategy to improve safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. Since coming to office we have: - Undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme - Set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national occupational health and safety review, and - Developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with our state and territory counterparts to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation nationally. This bill, together with the intergovernmental agreement, ushers in a new era of cooperation and collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in this important area: a collaboration which will improve the health and safety of workers across Australia and reduce the complexity of regulation for businesses. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, established by the Howard government as an advisory council whose functions were confined to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts on health and safety and workers compensation. This bill establishes Safe Work Australia as an independent reform-focused body, with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council, WRMC. As we promised in the lead-up to the election, Safe Work Australia will be an inclusive, tripartite body. It will be comprised of 15 members, including an independent chair, nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of workers, two representing the interests of employers and the chief executive officer. The members will be supported by the chief executive officer and staff who together, will form a statutory agency under the Public Service Act. The body will be subject to Commonwealth governance regimes and will be a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. Safe Work Australia will: - develop national policy relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation - prepare, monitor and revise model occupational health and safety legislation model codes of practice - develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdicvise tions - develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements - collect, analyse and publish occupational health and safety and workers compensation data and undertake and publish search - drive national communications strategies to raise awareness of health and safety work - further develop the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy 2002-2012, and - advise WRMC on occupational health and safety and workers compensation matters. The bill establishes the operational arrangements to support Safe Work Australia, including provisions relating to the nomination, appointment and terms and conditions of members, conflict of interest issues, procedures relating to the conduct of meetings and decision-making processes, and the development of plans and reporting requirements to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. It enables the chair to constitute committees to draw upon a wide range of expertise for the performance of its functions. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in realising the government's commitment and the commitment of all state and territory governments to work together to achieve harmonisation of occupational health and safety laws. It will have the important task of developing the model Occupational Health and Safety Act, model regulations and and model codes of practice for approval by workplace relations ministers. I have established an independent occupational health and safety review panel to adthe Workplace Relations Ministerial Council on the optimal structure and content of a model Occupational Health and Safety Act. The work of the panel is now well underway. The panel is currently examining public submissions and will present its first report to the Workplace Relations Ministers re- Council on 31 October, with the second report due at the end of January 2009. For the first time in the history of our at Federation, governments from each state and territory and the Commonwealth have formally committed to the harmonisation of occupational health and safety legislation through an intergovernmental agreement. The Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety commits the Commonwealth and all states and territories to the adoption of the approved model legislation and, in a demonstration of the new spirit of cooperation, the agreement also provides that Safe Work Australia will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states and territories. Safe Work Australia will also take forward the initiatives of the Commonwealth and the states and territories to streamline and harmonise workers compensation arrangements. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation are too important to be neglected any longer. Workers' lives and health are at stake, and so too is the efficiency of our economy. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform will increase profitability and productivity and better protect the lives and health of Australians. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in this reform. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Markus) adjourned.

3,Ms GILLARD,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.10 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I also introduce this morning into the parliament the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill. The will repeal the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Act 2005. This will abolish the current framework provided by that act for the declaration of occupational health and safety national standards and codes of practice by the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC). However, the bill will preserve existing national standards and codes of practice. The bill will also enable Safe Work Australia to declare national standards and codes of practice relating to occupational health and safety on an interim basis until 1 January 2011, unless regulations prescribe an earlier or later date. It is anticipated that, over time, national standards and codes of practice will be replaced by model regulations and model codes of practice that will be approved by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. The bill will also provide for a number of other consequential amendments arising from the repeal of the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Act and from the enactment of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Markus) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
4,Ms GILLARD,AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.12 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill amends the Australian Rebill search Council Act to increase the funding limits in the special appropriation and insert a new funding cap for the last year of the forward budget estimates. This bill provides approximately an extra $950 million over the forward estimates for the Australian Research Council to implement the Future Fellowships funding scheme and for indexation and continued funding of the Australian Research Council's existing research funding schemes. The government values the important contribution made by our researchers to Australia's shortand long-term prosperity and is committed to fostering our research talent at all levels. The new Future Fellowships will encourage, support and nurture future generations of potentially exceptional Australian and international researchers and make available to them real opportunities to build a career here. At present, the career path for researchers can be uncertain with many highly qualified mid-career researchers required to work overseas to further their careers due to lack of opportunities in Australia. This new scheme addresses the problem by making funding available for 1,000 fouryear fellowships over the next five years. This new funding scheme for the Australian Research Council will act as an additional incentive to attract high-calibre, earlycareer researchers in all disciplines across the spectrum of pure basic, strategic basic and applied research to undertake their work in Australia. This initiative is an important investment in our research talent to enable us to grow Australia's research capacity and capabilities. I commend the bill to the House and the work done on it by my ministerial colleague Senator Carr. Debate (on motion by Mrs Markus) adjourned. SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL NA LAWS-GENERAL LAW REFORM) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCClelland. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
5,Mr MCCLELLAND,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-General Law Reform) Bill 2008. This bill introduces the second part of the Rudd government's historic reform to amend a range of Commonwealth laws that discriminate against same-sex couples and their children. I introduced the first bill, the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Bill 2008, in the House on 28 May 2008. Today we undertake major reforms which will effectively remove same-sex discrimination from many areas of Commonwealth activity. This bill will amend 68 Commonwealth laws. Nineteen government departments were involved in the drafting of the bill. It will not only remove discrimination against same-sex couples but also remove discrimination against their families and, most specifically, their children. Shameful delay in removing discrimination I am sure many in this House would agree that these reforms are long overdue. The delay in removing this discrimination is a matter of shame for both sides of the House. It is almost 20 years since ‘sexual preference' was added as an additional ground of discrimination under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Regulations. In 1997 the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee identified discrimination in Commonwealth laws and programs that deal with tax and superannuation benefits. In 2004, the United Nations Human Rights Committee found that Australia was in breach of the prohibition on discrimination in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because the Veterans' Entitlements Act denied a person a pension on the basis of their sexual orientation. And, of course, in May last year the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission released its report Same-sex: same entitlements-the outcome of a significant national inquiry and consultation on that issue. It personalised many examples of discrimination and the impact of discriminatory laws on Australians. The commission found that: - At least 20, 000 same-sex couples experience systemic discrimination on a daily basis. - Same-sex couples and their families are denied basic financial and work related entitlements which opposite-sex couples and their families take for granted. - Same-sex couples are not guaranteed the right to take carer's leave to look after a sick partner. - Same-sex couples have to spend more money on medical expenses than opposite-sex couples to enjoy the Medicare and PBS safety nets. - Same-sex couples are denied a wide range of tax concessions available to opposite-sex couples. - The same-sex partner of a Defence Force veteran is denied a range of pensions and concessions available to an opposite-sex partner. On coming to office, I instructed my department to carry out a whole-of-government audit of Commonwealth legislation building on the commission's excellent work. The audit confirmed the commission's findings. It further identified that discrimination also occurs in a range of non-financial areas, such as administrative and evidence laws. What the Bill will do This bill removes discrimination against same-sex couples and their children in many of the laws that were identified by the commission and the audit. The bill will ensure in each law it amends that same-sex couples and their families are recognised. The amendments in the bill recognise a same-sex partner and adopt a similar approach to that taken in the first bill to recognise a child in a same-sex family. The general approach taken by the bill is that ‘a child' will include a child that is the product of a relationship, where one partner is linked biologically to the child or where one partner is the birth mother of the child. By applying this definition, opposite-sex and same-sex families are treated equally. I am aware of some criticism of the bill. However, without it there is a risk that we will not recognise all children in same-sex families. Whatever people's views are, I am sure they will agree that children should be treated equally wherever they may be in Australia and irrespective of the relationship of their parents. The approach also avoids relying on inconsistent state and territory parenting presumptions that are contained in a variety of laws around Australia. We must take a national approach to addressing these issues to ensure that all children, wherever they may be in Australia, are treated equally. Many in this House would agree that it would be inappropriate for Commonwealth benefits to recognise children on the basis of which state or territory they happen to have been born in. Definition of a ‘de facto partner' The bill includes a new definition of de facto partnerships which will be included in the Acts Interpretation Act. This definition will become the standard definition for most Commonwealth laws, and the laws that will be amended will, in most cases, pick up that definition. It will provide a more consistent and uniform approach to defining who is a de facto partner across a range of Commonwealth laws. It will apply to de facto partnerships whether the parties to the relationship are of the same sex or different sexes. This definition will recognise two different types of relationships. The couple will be taken to be in a de facto relationship if they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis having regard to a number of circumstances included within the definition. Registered relationships The definition will also specifically and clearly recognise relationships that have been registered under prescribed state relationship registration schemes. What this will mean is that couples who have registered their relationships under a state or territory law will not have to demonstrate the circumstances to satisfy the definition of de facto partner under most Commonwealth laws. They will be taken to be a de facto partner on the basis that they have satisfied the requirements for registration under the relevant state or territory law. This will provide a significant incentive for couples to register their relationships under state or territory schemes. They can be confident in those circumstances that their registration under a state or territory scheme will, for most purposes, be recognised automatically by the Commonwealth. Currently, such schemes exist in Tasmania, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. It is also, of course, an incentive for other states and territories that do not have such schemes to develop and implement their own. The federal government's position is that, should they do so, they should be consistent with the general principles that exist in the schemes in Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT. Acts that take a different approach The definition in the Acts Interpretation Act will not be used in all the acts being amended by the bill. Some acts, such as the Social Security Act and the Migration Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act, currently have their own approach to defining who is a member of a couple or de facto partner or a child of a person. Given the specific issues that are dealt with by these acts, a slightly different approach to the definition of de facto partner or and territory child is adopted. The factors are generally similar but they do not refer to the new definition of de facto partner to be inserted in the Acts Interpretation Act that I outlined a little earlier. Nonetheless, in relation to those acts, the bill amends the relevant provisions to ensure that same-sex couples and their families are recognised. Interdependency The bill does not recognise interdependent relationships. I recognise that this is an issue of some controversy. Recognising interdependent relationships, however, raises many complex issues, and interdependent relationships would not necessarily benefit from such recognition. For a start, the relationships can be cult to define. There is no consistency in how they are defined or applied across Commonwealth laws or programs. And there is also a lack of reliable data on the likely numbers of relationships-which makes it difficult to calculate the financial implications of any recognition. Interdependency can include, for instance, a wide range of relationships, from flatmates to adult children living at home to siblings who care for one another and who are emotionally and financially dependent on each other. Recognising interdependent relationships, as I have indicated, may not be appropriate or fair in all situations. For example, in the social security or pension context it could mean that two sisters who live together would be treated as a couple and receive a lower amount in pension because of their interdependent relationship. On our calculations, such a couple would potentially receive a significant amount lower than they would otherwise receive if they were treated as single people for the purpose of their entitlements. While the position of some interdependent relationships (such as carers) may need to be closely considered by the government, this bill (which seeks to remove discrimination against same-sex couples and their families) is not the vehicle to address those concerns. In particular, as I have indicated, those members opposite who have advocated recognition of interdependent relationships should really look into this issue and ascertain for themselves the number of people in interdependent relationships who would actually be significantly worse of if they were to succeed in covering interdependent relationships in the context of these reforms. diffi- Marriage and marital status discrimination This bill also removes some laws that treat people in the same circumstances differently depending on whether they are married or not. For example, the opposite-sex de facto partner is not considered the associate of a person for the purposes of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, and there are obviously a number of other similar circumstances. It seems incredible that for almost 24 years it has been unlawful to discriminate against a person on the basis that they are or are not married. And yet Commonwealth laws still exist that only provide a benefit to a person on the basis that they are married to another person, while a person who is in exactly the same situation but not married would be denied that benefit. That applies, I might say, whether that relationship be de facto or same sex. The bill addresses these areas by recognising both opposite-sex couples and same-sex de facto couples. Stepchildren, step-parents, widowers Another area of marital status discrimination is in relation to stepchildren, stepparents, widowers and widows. Currently, the ordinary meaning of these terms requires that a person be married. This problem must be addressed if we are to remove discrimination, as children in same-sex relationships would never qualify as stepchildren because same-sex couples cannot marry their partners. The problem not only affects same-sex de facto couples but also affects opposite-sex couples who are not married. Again, I think that all people would recognise the undesirability of discriminating in particular in those instances against stepchildren. The bill expands the definitions of ‘stepchild' and ‘step-parent' to include a child of an opposite-sex or same-sex de facto partner by a former relationship and to include a same-sex or opposite-sex de facto partner of a parent of a child by a former relationship. That obviously is intended to address the injustice. Another example of marital status discrimination is where entitlements are payable only to a ‘widow' or ‘widower'. Again, the ordinary meaning of these terms requires a person to have been married to another person. Without amendment a de facto partner (whether of the same or different sex) would not be entitled to the benefit as they were never married to that person. The bill's general approach to these issues is to replace the terms by referring to a surviving spouse or de facto partner. Tracing rule The bill also introduces a tracing rule to identify family relationships. Where family relationships such as ‘brother', ‘aunt', and ‘grandparents' are provided for in an act, the tracing rule will allow relationships referred to in the act to include relationships that are traced through the child-parent relationship. This will ensure that family relationships will be recognised in same-sex couple families in the same way as they are recognised in opposite-sex couple families. Transitional issues For some of the acts amended by the bill, transitional saving and application provisions have been drafted to ensure the smooth implementation of the amendments. A provision has also been added to the bill allowing the Governor General to make regulations prescribing matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) relating to amendments and repeals made by the bill. Most of the amendments will commence on the day after the bill receives the royal assent. Other amendments have a delayed commencement date. This will provide time for agencies to train their staff or to amend forms or procedures, or introduce new software and other technologies. Delayed commencement will also allow time for individuals who may be affected by the changes to adjust. All of the amendments are expected to come into effect by the middle of 2009. Diminishing Marriage It is unfortunate that this debate sometimes gets sidetracked into a debate about allegations of undermining the institution of marriage. Removing discrimination against same-sex couples does not undermine marriage. The Rudd government's policy on marriage is very clear. Indeed, the policy of both sides of parliament on marriage is very clear. It reflects the widely held view in the community that marriage is between a man and a woman. And it is defined as such in Commonwealth legislation. This in turn reflects the traditional view of marriage that has been built up over many centuries. This legislation in no way, shape or form diminishes, alters or undermines the institution of marriage. Conclusion Removing discrimination is about making sure that same-sex couples and their families are recognised for all practical purposes and have the same entitlements as opposite-sex de facto couples. The bill provides equality of treatment for children who are brought up in same-sex families in a range of Commonwealth programs and laws. It provides functional recognition of these families in a way which will make a real practical difference to their lives as well as removing discrimination. It is time to stop treating people differently under Commonwealth laws or programs as a result of who they are in a relationship with or indeed who they love. It is also time to stop treating children differently under Commonwealth laws or programs because of the sexual orientation of their parents. This bill is long overdue and will remove discrimination to ensure that same-sex couples and their children will be able to receive the same treatment as opposite-sex de facto couples and their children in the same circumstances. In conclusion, I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous work that was undertaken by my department, the Attorney General's Department, on this legislation. As I indicated, some 19 government departments have been involved in assisting in this measure. There has been enormous cooperation across the Commonwealth Public Service. I think it is recognised that it is high time that these amendments were made to remove the last vestiges of discrimination from Australian laws in respect of people living in de facto relationships or same-sex relationships. It represents a major step to ensuring full equality before the law for all Australians, regardless of their sexuality or the status of their relationship. I commend the bill to the House.

6,Mr SWAN,FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Rising house prices and higher interest rates over the last three years have increased financial pressures on households and made it harder to save for a first home. Home ownership is important to the well-being of Australians. In recognition of this, in the 2007 federal election campaign, Labor announced that, if elected, we would introduce first home saver accounts. First home saver accounts are the first of their kind in Australia and will provide a tax effective way for Australians to save for a first home in which to live through a combination of government contributions and low taxes. For example, a couple each earning average incomes and both putting aside 10 per cent of their income into individual first home saver accounts would be able to save more than $88,000 after five years. Today, the government is introducing bills to implement some final parts of the scheme already passed in this place in June 2008. The two bills are the First Home Saver Accounts (Further Provisions) Amendment Bill 2008 and the First Home Saver Account Providers Supervisory Levy Imposition Bill 2008. The First Home Saver Accounts (Further Provisions) Amendment Bill 2008 includes various provisions to make the scheme operational. These include: - a system for dealing with unclaimed money; - amendments to secrecy and information sharing provisions between the ATO, APRA and ASIC; and, - dealing comprehensively with family law situations. Other amendments are also being made to ensure the accounts work as intended. The changes also introduce a framework for imposing a levy on first home providers to provide funding for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to carry out its supervision of financial institutions which offer these accounts. The levy is consistent with the existing financial sector levy framework that funds APRA's supervisory activities on a user-pays basis, and is modelled on the retirement savings accounts supervisory levy. Consistent with the existing financial sector levy framework, these bills do not prescribe the amount of levies that will be imposed, as this is assessed each year and made by a ministerial determination. The government is investing around $1.2 billion over four years in the first home saver account policy, including administrative costs. This is part of a package of measures costing $2.2 billion over four years to boost housing supply and assist those most in need-namely, first home buyers and renters on low and moderate incomes. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned.

The First Home Saver Account Providers Supervisory Levy Imposition Bill 2008 is the second bill in the package to finalise the government's First Home Saver Accounts scheme. As described in the second reading speech to the main bill, this bill imposes the levy to provide funding for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to carry out its supervision of financial institutions which offer FHSAs.

NA (NOTIFICATION REVIEW) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Laurie Ferguson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
8,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (9.40 am)I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008 amends the Migration Act 1958 by introducing a series of changes that will operate to clarify the way the Department of Immigration, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal communicate with their clients. These amendments are the initial steps in a broader series of measures that are being contemplated by the government. The Migration Act 1958 (the act) and the Migration Regulations 1994 (the regulations) contain complex provisions dealing with the requirements for notifying clients about important matters such as decisions on visa applications and visa cancellations. These provisions cover the content of the notice, identify who must be notified and where the notice must be sent, when the notice is taken to have been received and by what method the notice may be dispatched. These requirements can be difficult for staff to apply and provide fertile ground for the courts to find notification defects. Court challenges based on technical errors in the notification process are regularly pursued by the clients seeking to find a way to delay the resolution of their cases. There have been a series of cases over the past several years where the courts have identified technical defects in notification that have created large legacy case loads which have proved difficult, if not impossible to address through litigation or administrative reforms. For example, the case of VEAN of 2002 v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 311 found that the envelope containing a notification letter had to be addressed to the applicant's ‘Authorised Recipient', not to the applicant ‘C/O the Authorised Recipient'. This decision in late 2003 potentially affected thousands of cases going back to 2001. These adverse notification decisions can create a situation where subsequent action taken in good faith by officers in respect of a client may actually be unlawful because the client was not properly notified of a departmental or tribunal decision and therefore their bridging visa (or a cancelled substantive visa) may remain in effect. The Commonwealth Ombudsman, in his report Notification of Decisions and Review Rights for Unsuccessful Visa Applicants of December 2007 drew attention to the difficulties with the notification provisions and their potential to result in the unlawful detention of clients. The bill has three overarching sets of amendments: 1. Provide, in cases where other notification provisions would not apply to a minor, that where the minister (or MRT/RRT) forms a reasonable belief that an individual has care and responsibility for a minor, then the minister (for primary decisions) or the tribunal (for MRT/RRT decisions) may communicate with that person (instead of the minor) to notify that individual of a decision of the minister or tribunal about the minor. 2. Provide that substantial compliance with the required contents of a notification document is sufficient unless the visa applicant is able to show the error or omission in the document causes them substantial prejudice; and 3. Provide that the deemed time of notification provisions will operate despite non-compliance with a procedural requirement for giving a document to an individual, where the individual has actually received the document, unless the individual is able to show they received the document at a later date, in which case they will be taken to have received the document at that date. These three sets of amendments will ensure that notification will be legally effective and provide certainty regarding future action based on notification, while still maintaining fair and reasonable dealings with the department's and the tribunals' clients. The first set of amendments relate to communication with minors through a person or an organisation that has care and responsibility for the minor. Unless certain specific provisions apply, which deal with a client appointing an authorised recipient, or notification of clients that make combined applications, the act currently requires correspondence or notices be sent to the individual client for the notification to be effective, even where the client would be too young to understand what the notification is about. This amendment will enable notification to be effected on a minor, defined as someone under 18, where the minister or his delegate or the relevant merits review tribunal has a reasonable belief that the recipient of the notification has the day-today care and responsibility for the minor. The recipient in this instance could be an individual, 18 years of age or over, who has the day-today care and responsibility for the minor. The recipient could also be an individual who works for or in an organisation and has day-today care for the minor. The proposed amendment produces the outcome that is most likely to result in the person who receives the notice about the minor also acting on it. This is preferable to sending a notice to, say, a parent who is estranged from the minor or who is not present in Australia and who may not be willing or able to act in the interests of the minor. In the event that noone with care and responsibility for the minor can be clearly identified, it will still be possible to send the notification directly to the minor. The second set of amendments relates to substantial compliance with the required contents of a notification document. Strict compliance with arguably insignificant details regarding the content of notification required by the courts has caused the department to concede or lose a number of court cases on minor technicalities. The VEAN case, as previously mentioned, is an example and there are other similar cases. In SZKGF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 84 a question arose from the inclusion of an incorrect postcode on two letters sent to a visa applicant by the Refugee Review Tribunal which were received and acted on by the visa applicant. The tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision to refuse the protection visa, considering that there had been no practical injustice and the applicant had lost no opportunity to advance his case. There were also cogent reasons for concluding that a postcode is not part of an address and therefore the use of the incorrect postcode did not result in non-compliance with the relevant section in the act. This is a case where the court was satisfied that the oversight could have had no effect upon the tribunal's decision: no hearing was missed, no invitation to comment left unanswered, no delay caused, no prejudice suffered. The court noted that to set aside the tribunal's decision and require reconsideration of the applicant's claims would be to allow the triumph of mere technicality over substance. While in this instance the case law is of assistance in determining that a minor error, such as an incorrect postcode, may not render notification ineffective, the bill seeks to clarify this issue and put beyond doubt the possibility of further, related, appeals on similar factual scenarios. This amendment will ensure that substantial compliance with the required content of a notice will be sufficient to effect notification. Minor technical errors in the content of the notice will not render the notification ineffective unless the applicant can show that the error or omission substantially prejudices him or her. The third set of amendments deal with deemed and actual notification and relate to the methods that the department and the relevant tribunals use when communicating with clients. Currently, the courts require strict compliance with the statutory notification procedures in order to rely on the deemed notification provisions. Where there is an error in the notification procedures, clients may argue that the deemed receipt provisions do not apply, even when there is evidence that they have actually received the correspondence or notice. This amendment will provide that where there has been an error in notification such that the deeming provision will not apply, but there is evidence that the client actually received the document-for example, they responded to the notice-then notification will be taken to have occurred in accordance with the deeming provisions or at a later date if the client can show the notice was actually received at that later date. This will overcome difficulties created through the requirement for strict compliance with technical notification procedures but also ensure clients are treated fairly and reasonably. In conclusion can I reiterate that these amendments will achieve a notification regime that is simpler, provides greater clarity and consistency, and is sufficiently flexible to respond to individual circumstances. This streamlining of notification requirements will reduce complexity, and deliver more consistent, fair and reasonable outcomes to clients. I commend the bill to the House.

9,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (9.50 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of the Australian Pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo 2010, China. On 29 June 2006 the then Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard MP, announced that Australia would participate in the Shanghai World Expo 2010. This will be the first major world exposition since Aichi, Japan in 2005 and will take place between 1 May and 31 October 2010. In addition to the $61 million being provided through the budget, the government will seek an estimated $22 million in funding through corporate sponsorships and partnerships with the states and territories. The partment of Foreign Affairs and Trade has portfolio responsibility for this project and will manage Australia's presence at the expo. In terms of potential to assist Australian business and raise Australia's profile in a strategic market, this expo represents a unique opportunity, eclipsing in scale any previous expo, including Aichi. It is therefore essential that Australia's presence at expo be commensurate with our economic and strategic interests in China. The proposal is to construct a new temporary pavilion with appropriate public exhibition areas and capacity to host VIP, business and cultural programs that make up the Australian participation at the expo. The design process created a concept for a well-designed purpose built pavilion that will showcase Australia to the Chinese public, compares favourably to our market countries and provides a platform for helping Australian business succeed in the China market. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, a single contract will be awarded for the construction, exhibition, production and technical operation of the pavilion. A contract will need to be signed by mid-September 2008 to maximise prospects for commencing Chinese design approval processes and construction this calendar year. The construction program requires the base building to be complete and dustproof in the technical areas by midSeptember 2009. Practical completion and occupation is scheduled for 1 March 2007, with commencement of the expo on 1 May 2001. The estimated cost of the proposed works, inclusive of GST, is $49.38 million and includes construction and other related elements such as architecture, consultant fees, project management, supervision, exhibition, De- furniture, artworks, whitegoods and site office expenses. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",29
10,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-Monarothe Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (9.53 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fit-out of new leased premises for the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations at Block 9, Section 31, Canberra City. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations proposes to undertake a fit-out, at a cost of $66.6 million plus GST, of new leased premises at block 9, section 31, Canberra City in the Australian Capital Territory. The national office of the department is located in the Canberra CBD and at the Canberra airport in leases across 21 separate buildings, with a total lettable area of approximately 97,000 square metres. With the exception of the airport properties, most of the accommodation is in buildings which are over 15 years old and require major refurbishment to meet Commonwealth standards. The new building will be constructed on the 4,801 square metre site of the former QEII nursing mothers' hospital and is part of the rapidly changing City West area. The development will provide approximately 40,000 square metres of high-quality office space, 500 square metres of storage space, 418 secure basement car parks and ground level bicycle parking for 175 bikes. Subject to parliamentary approval and the satisfactory pricing of the tender trade packages, the integration of the fit-out is the department's preferred option. Under this arrangement, the fit-out will be undertaken concurrently with the base building construction, which commenced in February 2008 and is scheduled for practical completion in June 2010. Occupancy is expected to occur in mid-2010. Current leases have been structured to expire no earlier than mid-2010, to avoid the risk of penalties associated with short-term holding leases. In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",30
11,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (9.56 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Bridging of Kings Avenue over Parkes Way at the Russell roundabout, Canberra. The National Capital Authority, NCA, has been appropriated funding of $26.6 million over four years to undertake the bridging of Kings Avenue over Parkes Way at the Russell roundabout, Canberra, ACT. Parkes Way will be lowered and a new bridge will carry Kings Avenue traffic over Parkes Way to the Russell Defence precinct. This work will also reinforce Kings Avenue as one side of Walter Burley Griffin's national triangle. This project will remove one of the worse traffic bottlenecks in Canberra. The new intersection where Kings Avenue passes over Parkes Way will allow traffic movements in all directions and provide safe pedestrian access from the Russell Defence precinct to Kings Park and the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. The bridging of Kings Avenue over Parkes Way will provide improved, more reliable and more readily-secured transport links between Canberra City, Parliament House and the airport. The estimated cost of the proposal is $26.6 million plus GST. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence late this year, with completion in 2010. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",31
12,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (9.58 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of new warehousing facilities at Wadsworth Barracks, East Bandiana. The Department of Defence proposes to undertake the construction of new warehousing facilities, at an estimated out-turned cost of $36.369 million plus GST, at Wadsworth Barracks, East Bandiana, Victoria. The project will provide modern, purpose built facilities to enhance operational capability and will provide efficient logistical and warehousing support to Defence. The project consists of the construction of a new purpose built support warehouse, a dedicated area for freight distribution and the demolition of redundant buildings. The project will also include upgrade works to address occupational health and safety issues and operational inefficiencies associated with the existing facilities. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Defence accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works will commence early next year and be completed in 2010. On behalf of the government, I thank committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Reference",31
13,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (10.00 am)-I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Australian War Memorial Eastern Precinct Development and National Service Memorial, Canberra. The Australian War Memorial is a unique national institution. In the last decade the memorial precinct has been extensively transformed, including the development of the western precinct sculpture garden, ANZAC Hall, the parade ground and the CEW Bean building. The current proposal to develop the eastern precinct represents the next stage in a program of planned site development and will deliver a new formal memorial courtyard, much improved and safer coach and car parking, improved outdoor areas and toilet facilities, and replacement of the existing cafe with an accessible facility more suited to the requirements and significance of the site. The development is necessary to improve visitor safety, access and amenity in the eastern precinct and to bring the substandard eastern precinct up to the high standard of the remainder of the site. The new memorial courtyard also provides a site for the national service memorial. The estimated cost of the eastern precinct development, inclusive of escalation costs, contingencies, GST and all professional fees and disbursements, is $19.54 million. The cost of the national service memorial will be funded by the National Servicemen's Association of Australia. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence after ANZAC Day in 2009, with scheduled completion prior to ANZAC Day 2010. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Privileges and Members' Interests Committee Report",32
14,Mr RAGUSE,COMMITTEES,"I present the report from the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests concerning an application from Professor David Flint for the publication of a response to a reference made in the House of Representatives, and I ask leave of the House to move that the report be agreed to. Leave granted.",32
15,Mr RAGUSE,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the report be agreed to. The report I have presented relates to a request from Professor David Flint for a right of reply in relation to references to him made by the now Minister for Finance and Deregulation in the House on 13 February 2006. The committee has considered Professor Flint's submission and has recommended that a response in the terms included in the report I have just presented be incorporated in Hansard. In recommending the response be incorporated in Hansard, the committee emphasises that, as required by the right of reply resolution, it has not considered or judged the truth of any statements made by the member in the House or by the person seeking a response. Question agreed to. The document read as followsOn 13 February 2006, Mr Lindsay Tanner MP, the Member for Melbourne, alleged that Australian's for Constitutional Monarchy (ACM) had “engaged in a brazen tax scam” and that the tion between ACM and the Constitution Education Fund Australia (CEF-A) was a “fraud on Australian taxpayers”. He offered no evidence had he contacted either ACM or CEF-A beforehand. However he urged ACM “to make use of their right of reply in parliament” to provide an explanation of the circumstances. In referring to me as the national convenor of ACM, there was an implication that the allegations Mr Tanner made applied to me in a way that adversely affected my reputation. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) conducted a comprehensive and lengthy audit of CEF-A, and substantial costs were involved in satisfying requests of the ATO. The audit resulted in no finding of any breach of the tax laws. Although requested, Mr Tanner has not withdrawn his gation. Treaties Committee",32
16,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 93: Treaties tabled on 12 March and 14 May 2008. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.,33
17,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"by leaveReport No. 93 contains the committee's findings on four treaty actions tabled on 12 March 2008 and 14 May 2008. The committee found all four treaties reviewed to be in Australia's national interest. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as CITES, provides for international cooperation to protect and conserve species of fauna and flora from overexploitation due to international trade. The committee considered amendments to appendices 1 and 2 of CITES which will alter the level of control imposed upon trade in a number of species that are either endangered or at risk of becoming endangered. The committee was particularly associainterested in the implications of these amendments for Australian sawfish species, which are now afforded protection under this nor convention for the first time. The committee has raised a number of concerns in its report about the process adopted in relation to the listing of this species. In particular, the committee has recommended that the Australian government review its policies relating to the assessment of applications to trade in CITES listed species to provide for a more formalised process of independent scientific assessment and a the greater degree of public consultation. It has also recommended that policies relating to the composition of Australian delegations to alle- CITES negotiations be reconsidered to minimise conflicts of interest. It has done so because the committee is concerned about Report the inclusion of parties with an obvious commercial interest in the outcome of negotiations in an Australian delegation. In the case of Cairns Marine, it has given rise to perceptions of a conflict of interest, and the committee would like the government to have a look at this issue. The committee is particularly concerned that trade in a critically endangered species internationally is permitted at all and has recommended ongoing monitoring and assessment of the impact of trade in freshwater sawfish by the Australian government. The International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006 succeeds similar agreements dating back to 1983. Its objective is to promote the expansion and diversification of international trade in tropical timber from sustainably managed and legally harvested forests. Sixty countries are members of the International Tropical Timber Organisation established by the agreement, representing around 80 per cent of the world's tropical timbers and 90 per cent of the global timber trade. The agreement is consistent with Australia's sustainable forest management and overseas aid objectives, including reducing illegal logging, mitigating and adapting to climate change and assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. While the committee recognises the importance of international cooperation to promote sustainable management and address illegal logging, it does question the extent to which this agreement will actually contribute to reducing the devastating deforestation occurring in some countries. The world's tropical rainforests are under great pressure. Clearing and logging, substantial parts of it illegal or unsupervised, causing substantial losses to our rainforests at the very time when the emerging science about global warming tells us we need them most. We need to protect our rainforests, which are the lungs of the planet. They are essential carbon sinks, they attract rain and keep our planet cool and moist and they provide an essential habitat for countless species of birds, plants, animals and other wildlife. Given their environmental significance the committee has recommended that the consultation process undertaken for any future agreement on sustainable trade in tropical timber specifically includes consultation with environmental groups. The Protocol Amending the Agreement between Australia and South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes on income will alter Australia's existing agreement with South Africa to meet Australia's most favoured nation obligations with South Africa, promote closer economic cooperation between the two countries and upgrade the framework through which the tax administrations of Australia and South Africa can prevent international fiscal evasion. The amendments are expected to reduce barriers to bilateral trade and investment. Reduced withholding tax rates on dividends, interest and royalties will also provide benefits to Australian businesses obtaining business loans and intellectual property from South Africa. The committee also considered a category 3 treaty-Amendment to the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk. Category 3 treaties are identifiably minor treaty actions which do not impact significantly upon the national interest. The committee resolved not to hold a formal inquiry in relation to this treaty. The committee supports all four agree is ments and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. Publications Committee Report",33
18,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES,I present the report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being placed on the table. Report-by leave-agreed to. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2008 Debate resumed from 1 September. Second Reading,34
19,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (10.10 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 is an omnibus bill that will make amendments across the Migration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007 and the Customs Act 1901. This will clarify and improve the effectiveness of the Migration and Citizenship legislation by addressing and rectifying a range of problems that have been identified in the legislation over the years. It will also ensure that the citizenship legislation is consistent with Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness 1961 and the United Nations convention relating to stateless people 1954. The amendments in this bill are important and necessary and, in the case of the Migration Act, are long overdue. The amendments to the Citizenship Act, which has now been in operation for over 12 months, rectify a number of issues that have been identified over that period. Rather than allow these issues to accumulate this government will deal with them now. Since the introduction of the bill, some urgency has now arisen in relation to the amendments in schedule 4 that I will address as I am going through the bill. As the bill will make over 100 amendments, spanning four acts, I will confine this speech to the more notable amendments in each schedule. Schedule 1 of the bill will, amongst other things, amend the Migration Act to streamline the procedures for notifying parties of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal, MRT, and the Refugee Review Tribunal, RRT, by removing the requirement for the tribunals to ‘hand down' their decisions. The handing down and current notification procedures have doubtful practical value and have been the source of considerable litigation over the years, often with far-reaching effects including, on occasion, the potentially unlawful detention of noncitizens. The amendments in schedule 1 will make the notification and merits review process simpler and reduce the risk of administrative error by removing the handing down requirement and providing that the tribunals' review decisions, other than oral decisions, are taken to be made on the date of the tribunals' written statement of the decision. The amendments also provide that where two or more persons apply for review of a decision together, documents given by the tribunals to any of the applicants are deemed to have been given to all of them. This will avoid uncertainty regarding notification of review applicants who have made or sought to make a combined application, and is also consistent with subsection 52(3C) of the Migration Act, which applies to notification of visa decisions made by the minister or his delegate in the case of combined applicants. Schedule 1 also includes amendments that will create a new position of deputy principal member for the MRT. Currently the RRT includes the position of deputy principal member but the MRT does not. As the tribunals operate administratively as a single agency, and the principal member and other members are cross-appointed to both the RRT and the MRT, it is anomalous for the position of deputy principal member to exist in one tribunal but not the other. Schedule 2 of the bill contains measures to strengthen the provisions in the Migration Act and the Customs Act relating to border protection to ensure that the Commonwealth can take appropriate and unified action across departments when Australia's border protection laws are contravened. An important new measure in schedule 2 of the bill relates to the requirement for erators of aircraft and ships to report on sengers and crew prior to entering Australia. The amendments make it clear that an operator must report on each passenger and crew member individually. This is to ensure that operators take greater care in ensuring that every person on board the aircraft or ship is properly accounted for. The amendments also align reporting time frames in the migration legislation with those prescribed in the Customs legislation. To ensure the government has in place practical methods for enforcing compliance with these reporting requirements, schedule 2 also establishes an infringement notice regime. This new regime is an alternative sanction to prosecution for failure to meet advance passenger and crew reporting requirements. This regime is expected to be less costly to administer and easier to implement, with the flow-on effect of increased compliance with reporting obligations. Schedule 3 of the bill will make a number of minor amendments to the act to clarify and improve certain provisions relating to visas, including amendments to give greater certainty to the immigration status of noncitizen children born in Australia; amendments to ensure that a security may be imposed for compliance with visa conditions before grant; and a range of other amendments to clarify the operation of certain visions relating to bridging visas. Schedule 3 also includes amendments to clarify certain offence provisions in divisions 12 and 14A of part 2 of the act and clarify the operation of certain provisions after they were amended as part of the Criminal Code harmonisation changes with the Criminal Code. As I flagged earlier, amendments in schedule 4 have now taken on some urgency. The amendments were initially included to op- address obiter comments in the May 2007 pasfull Federal Court decision in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 626. The obiter comments cast doubt on whether the minister's powers under section 501 of the Migration Act to cancel a visa on character grounds would apply to transitional visas. Where a visa applicant or visa holder does not pass the character test, the minister has been given the discretion to refuse or cancel a visa. In exercising this power, the minister has a responsibility to the parliament and to the Australian community to protect the community from criminal or other reprehensible conduct and to refuse to grant visas, or cancel visas held by noncitizens whose actions are so abhorrent to the community that they should not be allowed to enter or remain within Australia. As part of what was a highly technical judgement, the full Federal Court in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 132 on 17 July 2008 found that a transitional (permanent) visa cannot be cancelled on character grounds because it is a visa that is ‘held' rather than ‘granted'. These transitional visas are held by operation of law post reforms to the Migration Act in 1994. As a result of the court's decision in Sales, 23 people, including Mr Sales, were released pro- from immigration detention. The department decided, on legal advice, not to appeal the judgement in the Sales case. The amendments in schedule 4 to the bill address the Moore decision (and now the Sales decision) to ensure that the character cancellation provisions in the Migration Act apply to all temporary and permanent transitional visas, and provide validation of all past character cancellation decisions in relaviously tion to such visas. This maintains the minister's ability to protect the Australian nity. Another measure in schedule 4 to the bill aims to increase protection for clients of department who engage offshore migration agents. There is currently a comprehensive scheme in the Migration Act administered by the Migration Agents Registration Authority, MARA, for the registration and disciplining of migration agents operating in Australia, but it is impracticable and contrary to interAustralian national law principles to extend this regulaConsequentials) tory framework offshore and provide coercive powers to the authority to investigate actions taken overseas. The amendments in schedule 4 therefore use the authorised recipient provisions to regulate the activities of offshore migration agents, by providing that, where an authorised recipient is giving immigration assistance and is not a registered migration agent, the minister or his delegate will not be pelled to communicate with them. This new power will provide the department with the power to refuse to communicate with offshore migration agents, most of whom are unregistered, when there are concerns about their professionalism, competence, conduct or character. The measures will also provide a disincentive for clients to use such agents when there are these concerns. This new statutory power which provides a form of sanction for unacceptable behaviour is also designed to reinforce trative accreditation scheme that will be established to recognise offshore operators who deal professionally with clients of the department. Schedule 4 also clarifies section 193 of the Migration Act to ensure that an illegal foreign fisher or environmental offender can be removed from Australia if they have prebeen granted a criminal justice visa or bridging visa while in remand or serving a commucustodial sentence. This minor amendment ensures this provision is consistent with its original policy intention, that an illegal for the eign fisher and more recently an environmental offender should be removed from Australia as soon as possible after they become an unlawful noncitizen. The amendments in schedule 5 seek to clarify the meaning of certain provisions in the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 and the Citizenship (Transitionals and Act 2007 and remove inconsistencies across the acts. The amendments also aim to ensure that Australian citizenship law is consistent with our international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness 1961 and the United Nations convention relating to stateless people 1954. I commend the bill to the chamber.  com- speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. The coalition supports this legislation. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 is a noncontroversial omnibus bill that makes a range of amendments to the Migration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007 and the Customs Act 1901. These miscellaneous minor amendments provide consistency with other legislation, streamlining procedures, providan adminising clarifications and so on. I note that the bill was intended to include provisions to reinstate effective time limits for applying for judicial review of migration decisions. The current time limits in the Migration Act have been rendered redundant as a result of the April 2007 decision in the High Court in Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the July 2007 full Federal Court decision in the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC. The government has removed these provisions from the bill on advice that the bill as drafted would not have worked appropriately. We understand that further consideration will be given to determine how best to reinstate these time limits. The opposition looks forward to the opportunity to review and consider what the government puts forward. Senator Ellison, the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, has outlined the opposition's position in relation to this bill very clearly in the Senate, so I will now only speak briefly in relation to each of the specific schedules. Schedule 1 of the bill will streamline procedures for notifying parties of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. The current notification procedures have been the source of considerable litigation over the years. Schedule 1 was also originally the section that would have dealt with time limits for applying for judicial review. As I earlier, these are now being redrafted. Schedule 2 of the bill makes some clarifications in relation to the requirements of the Advance Passenger Processing System and establishes an infringement notice regime. The Advance Passenger Processing System was made compulsory after the September 11 terrorist attacks and requires each of the airlines and cruise lines on their way to Australia to provide information on their passengers to DIMA. Upon check-in at the country of origin, the passenger's details are submitted to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. If there is a problem that would prevent their entry to Australia, they are not allowed to board. The government's amendments will insert a new subsection at the end of sections 64ACD of the Customs Act 1901 and 245N of the act to make it clear that an operator of an aircraft or ship is liable to separate prosecution under these offence provisions in relation to each individual passenger and crew rather than in relation to each journey. As an aside, I should tell the House that recently I was in Washington, Boston and Denver in the United States and, as the shadow minister for justice and border protection and assisting in immigration, I did have cause to go to Washington Dulles International Airport and meet with the customs and immigration officials there. I can say with some pride that the Australian system was regarded as the state of the art in the world, and they wished that, in many respects, they could emulate-and they are trying to move towards emulating-what Australia has already introduced. So, while America has made leaps and bounds since September 11 in the way it manages the movement of people both in and around the country, Australia is certainly at the forefront of that regime-or was under the previous government certainly. I assume, and so far it said seems, that the current government is continuing the same response and the same attitude towards the migration of people and the entrance of people through passenger movements on cruise ships and airlines. Schedule 3 of the bill makes minor amendments to the act to clarify immigration clearance of non-citizen children born in Australia, in compliance with visa conditions and the operation of certain provisions relating to bridging visas. Schedule 4 aims to increase protection for clients of offshore migration agents. DIAC will be able to refuse to communicate with offshore migration agents in cases where there are concerns about their professionalism, competence, conduct or character. The opposition appreciates that this schedule must be passed in a timely fashion due to the full Federal Court's decision of 17 July in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. This decision gave effect to the obiter comments in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in 2007. Schedule 4 anticipated difficulties such as those arising from these recent decisions, and will ensure that the character cancellation provisions apply to all temporary and permanent transitional visas and provide validation of all past character cancellation decisions in relation to such visas. As a of the full Federal Court's decision in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, 23 people, including Mr Sales, were released from immigration detention. The coalition, while cautious in supporting such legislation, agrees with the government that this legislation must be passed quickly to address this situation caused by the full Federal Court's decision. Schedule 5 seeks to clarify certain provisions in the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 and the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007. The amendments also aim to ensure that Australian citizenship law is consistent with our international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness 1961. I am pleased to again confirm the opposition's support for this bill, and I commend it to the House.  rise to speak in support of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 and the amendments put forward by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and I acknowledge the support from the opposition as outlined by the member for Sturt. This bill makes a range of amendments to various migration and citizenship acts to clarify and improve the effectiveness of the legislation. I represent an electorate where one in three residents was born overseas-nothing like your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, where I grew up. Instead, it is a completely different mix. The electorate of Moreton is an open, vibrant, multicultural community and, for the most part, we are tolerant and understanding of one another. However, not a day goes by in my electorate office that I am not contacted by somebody seeking help and support with an immigration matter for themselves or a family member. Immigration and the reality of having result family members scattered throughout the world is something I am constantly reminded of in my job. Setting aside the Indigenous population of Australia, obviously the other 97 per cent of Australians would have roots overseas. I myself am of Irish, Italian and French background, married to someone of Englishalthough her family stress that it is Cornish-Germanic and Indian background. So, like most Australians, our roots are overseas. The decisions that members make relating to the legislation and policies that govern immigration should not be taken lightly, as these decisions, more than any other area of law, have the power to drastically impact on individuals and their families, especially the people in my electorate, because so many are from overseas. The electorate of Moreton has a significant number of people who are Sudanese and from other places in Africa, including a lot of people from South Africa and Zimbabwe. It also has a large Indian population. There are many New Zealanders and people from the UK and Korea. But the most significant group in my electorate represents the Chinese diaspora-people who have come not only from China but also, significantly, from Taiwan, and also there are Papua New Guinean Chinese, Hong Kong Chinese and Malaysian Chinese. I want to turn to that particular group, the Chinese diaspora, to tease out how important this idea of immigration and race is. Let us look at the history of Australia since Federation and the Australian view of China. When the Federation started, both sides of the House, or all three sides of the House, as it would have then been-there were three major parties-would have seen China as the land of the yellow peril. That was very much one of the motivating factors for Federation. That view evolved over the next 50 years into China becoming the land of the red menace. I guess now, 50 years on, we would see China as being the land of the golden opportunity. It has gone from yellow to red to gold-so much has changed in our understanding of China's role in the world. This then reflects on Australians' view of ourselves and what defines an Australian, and what immigration is about. Back when immigration decisions were first being madesome of the major decisions were made in 1908-basically what defined an Australian was that you were a British citizen; or, if you were not a British citizen, immigration law determined that you were not an Australian. It is interesting that, 100 years on, in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship we are still making decisions about what constitutes an Australian, what defines an Australian and who decides what an Australian is. Race has been a significant factor in many elections in Australia-questions about who decides who stays here and what sort of person stays here. While doing some research related to the legislation before the House, I looked up John Christian Watson, the first Labor Prime Minister of Australia, and I was interested to read this in Wikipedia: Watson maintained that his father was a British seaman called George Watson. Being a British citizen was a prerequisite for being a parliamentarian. It goes on: Records dispute this, however; they indicate Watson's father was a Chilean citizen of German descent, Johan Christian Tanck, and that Watson was born in Valparaiso, Chile. Records also show that his mother was a New Zealander … who had married Tanck in New Zealand. So that was the very first Labor Prime Minister, and it is suggested in Wikipedia that he is the only Australian Prime Minister who was not either born in Britain or of Anglo-Celtic descent. I am not sure about the descent of Mr Rudd. I would suggest it is Anglo-Celtic but I have not discussed that with the Prime Minister. But Watson is the only Prime Minister in the 107-year history of our Federation who was not British or Anglo-Celtic. Interestingly, it is suggested that one of the other early MPs, King O'Malley, lied about his descent, but that is a story for another day. I think he has Tasmanian connections, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, so I will leave that to someone with more knowledge of the history of Tasmania. Race has obviously been a very powerful factor in Australian history and Australian politics. It was a factor in the 1996 election, when the Howard-Costello government was elected, unfortunately. It became a big factor in the Queensland state election soon after, when 11 One Nation MPs were elected. Race is certainly something that is significant in Australian history, and it was very significant in my election, because every now and then there are still troubles between races or religions or various groups. Thankfully we have an immigration minister who has a huge heart and a great mind and we have a Prime Minister who has always had that visionary view of Australia that we are a country that needs to keep fighting above its weight in leading the world as to how cultures, religions and races can live together harmoniously. Unfortunately we can look at the policies of the previous government relating to the that mandatory detention of illegal asylum seekers-and I acknowledge that there are Labor roots in those policies-to see how immigration laws can horribly disrupt people's lives. That is why I welcome the reforms to Australia's immigration detention system announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans. Under the Rudd Labor government, detention in immigration detention centres will only be used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time. The department will have to justify why a person should be detained. Once in detention, a detainee will have their case reviewed every three months to ensure that the further detention of the individual is justified. Most importantly, children will not be detained in an immigration detention centre. Surely that is a great outcome for common sense. Irrespective of what laws a parent might have bent, it is ridiculous to think that young children should be put in detention centres. We should never have those situations again where we have young children thinking that the only way out is to sew up their lips. I say that particularly because my partner has worked in child protection for nearly 20 years, and when I hear of the abuse of children it is certainly something that tivates me a lot, especially with Child Protection Week coming up next week. The bill before the House initially sought to reinstate effective time limits for applying to the courts for judicial review of migration decisions. However, subsequent amendments moved by the minister removed these changes as it is important that we nut out a comprehensive solution to ensure that time limits apply to all decisions reviewable by the courts, including decisions made offshore to refuse to grant a visa to an applicant who has applied for a visa outside the migration zone. This is the case for many of the African residents in my electorate. The overarching notion that will guide the minister will be that justice delayed is justice denied. The minister has indicated that these time limits will be introduced in the parliament later. I think that most people will be pretty relaxed about that because we all want to ensure that we get the provisions right. The measures in schedule 2 of the bill are about strengthening Australia's border controls. These amendments seek to provide for airline and shipping carriers to be liable for separate prosecution for each and every individual not reported prior to arriving in Australia. This is about bringing the shipping industry in line with the airline industry and ensuring that the government is aware of all people entering our country. It is obviously a very common sense approach. The further amendments introduced by the minister provide greater clarity on this matter and ensure that the reporting obligations on aircraft and shipping carriers under migration and customs legislation apply in relation to each individual passenger and crew member and not the voyage or flight generally. They will also provide for operators to be liable to separate prosecution for each passenger or mo- crew member not reported. We can have strong border controls without depriving people of their dignity and humanity. This bill also seeks to bring Australia into line with our international obligations under the 1961 United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. It amends the Australian Citizenship Act to ensure that the good character requirement applies to applicants for citizenship by descent who do not fall within the definition of a stateless person. Further amendments proposed by the minister ensure that applicants for citizenship who are not a stateless person, such as war criminals, are subject to the good character requirement. This will allow the minister to refuse an application for citizenship by descent if satisfied that the applicant is not of good character because of crimes against humanity or war crimes. The recent Federal Court decision in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship found that a transitional permanent visa cannot be cancelled on character grounds because it is a visa that is held rather than granted. As a result of that decision, some 23 people, including convicted murderer Mr Sales, were released from immigration detention. It is obviously important that we get the character grounds definitions right so that we know where and when to draw the line in terms of the sort of Australia we want to take forward into the future. The amendments in schedule 4 anticipated this difficulty and ensure that the character grounds cancellation provisions apply to all temporary and permanent transitional visas and provide validation of all past character ground cancellation decisions in relation to such visas. Obviously this is an important area of law. We are talking about the very heart of this country and what we are as a nation. The legislation before the House today goes some way to sorting out these concerns. I commend the bill to the House.",34
20,Mr SIMPKINS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Cowan) (10.42 am)When I looked at the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 I decided to concentrate on aspects of the Migration Review Tribunal and the visa provisions. The thrust of what I was going to say-and I will say it later-relates to a case I intend to raise and the judgement of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship about a visa application based on the 2008 rules as opposed to the conditions, rules, forms and applications that applied in 2007. It is very interesting that the member for Moreton should talk about mandatory detention from what I perceive is a very 2008 perspective. There was a time in our history when people in some parts of the world would decide to leave their home country and cross a border, hop on a plane and fly to Kuala Lumpur or maybe Jakarta. From there they would go to a place where they could pay, perhaps hundreds or thousands of dollars, to jump on a leaky boat. In so doing, they put their children in circumstances of such danger that their lives were at risk. I do not think anyone would say that that was a great situation. It is now 2008 and we do not have a stack of boats carrying such people arriving on our doorstep from other parts of the world. For whatever reason, we do not have people taking those sorts of risks with their lives and the lives of their children. It is important to realise why we no longer have that situation. It is a result of the strong and unequivocal message that former Prime Minister John Howard sent to the world. I will never back away from that past and those decisions. They were hard and unpopular, but sometimes these things just need to be done. I pay tribute to former Prime Minister John Howard for his leadership and for the efforts that he and the former coalition government made to stop people-trafficking, this boat trade, by sending clear messages. They may have saved the lives of people who eventually realised there was no point in taking those risks with their lives or the lives of their children. We are going through a historical revisionist period in which certain persons in this place are applying 2008 circumstances to more difficult times and are judging the former government on that basis. It is important to move on and I would like to speak about this bill as it relates to a migration application that I am aware of. There are often quite great periods between an appeal being lodged with the Migration Review Tribunal and the matter being heard. Given the significant workload of the MRT, I think it is desirable that cases not go there unless they truly need to. I am concerned that there are times when flexibility and a full consideration of the facts and circumstances of an immigration matter may come second to a rigid and narrow application of the migration regulations. I would never advocate that the law should ever be put aside or that the rules should be bent, but the facts and circumstances should be considered against the situation at the time of the application, not just against the situation at the time of the hearing. I will offer an example of this and the sort of problem that impacts on the areas dealt with by the MRT. I have recently become aware, through a constituent of mine, of a case where a South African family appear to have been unfairly treated by the department with their visa application. This is the case of Mr Steven Patrick, an electrical engineer in Durban. His wife, Lisa, has a Bachelor of Arts which actually includes three top subjects in English. They have three daughters: Hannah, 9; Robyn, 13; and Kerry, 17. I have read their skilled independent migrant visa subclass 175 application and I believe all the information is there. It is an outstanding application. The family have skills. They have qualifications. They definitely have the English language. The couple have childrenalways good for the future of this great country-and, ultimately, a very clear commitment to Australia, should they be allowed to come here. I have no doubt that this is a family who would add great value to this country. Unfortunately, their application was rejected. I have written to the State Director of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on this specific issue and I hope to have a reply soon. The Patrick family's visa application was rejected basically because the goalposts were moved after their application was submitted and because the departmental official did not take that into consideration. will get into the detail of the reason they were rejected. The date that they lodged their visa application was 9 October 2007, but at that time they had not submitted evidence of their English language ability. They had indicated on their visa application that they had a test booked for 1 December 2007, about two months after the application was lodged.  1 December, the result was forwarded. The result was an 8.5 on the overall band score, which I understand is pretty good and more than satisfies the requirement. Unfortunately, in a letter dated 8 July 2008 from an official at the General Skilled Migration Processing Centre, their application was rejected. A portion of the letter reads: ... you must submit evidence of your English ability at the time you apply. As the results of your IELTS test dated 1 December 2007 indicates that you do not have the IELTS test result before the day on which your application was lodged on 9 October 2007. So they are saying: ‘You did not prove that you can speak English to the required level at the time you applied on 9 October and your test dated 1 December is proof that you did not apply and that you did not have the ability tested at that point.' They go on to say: As you did not provide evidence of your English ability at time of application as specified in Migration Regulation 175.213 and 1.15C you consequently do not satisfy the requirements of clause 175.213 ... Some would say that such a decision was inflexible, yet if the rules are there, if these clauses say that, maybe there is no room for flexibility and common sense. Maybe we do not actually need electrical engineers, just for the sake of maintaining the strict parameters of these regulation clauses. I will make no further comment on the inflexibility of the department in this case. The I important point is that the application forms for these visas have actually changed in the last 11 months. When the Patrick family filled in the form in October 2007, the question regarding language requirements was question 30; now it is question 29. That is no big deal unless the words and layout of the question also changed with the number. This then becomes the point: the skilled migration centre knocked back the Patrick family based on the rules now, not on the rules that applied when they filled out the visa application. I call that unfair. The difference in the questions is very important. The original form required you to have booked a test and to provide evidence of that booking, and the results then had to be sent on later. That, of course, was all by the Patrick family; it was all complied with. I have seen the forms. They say that the family had booked the test; there is a printout with the date of the booking. It is all there. Unfortunately, the 2008 form, upon which the department has judged this application, has a note on it which says, ‘If you are applying for a subclass'-including 175-‘you must provide evidence of your English ability at the time you apply.' That is what I call goalpost shifting. A 2007 application was submitted and complied with to the letter of the law. In 2008, this family, and this opportunity for our future and theirs, has been judged on a new set of rules. To just reject the application is pretty inflexible. The point here is that the goalposts have shifted. The rules have changed and no flexibility was employed to delineate between the two different sets of rules. This seems a very bureaucratic decision, and I would hate to think that this country will miss out on the contribution of the Patrick family because of the ridiculous application of 2008 rules to a 2007 application. Today I have provided just one example of inflexible and counterproductive decision making. It is my hope that the state director of the department of immigration will remedy the situation, that he will see reason and that he will help out. However, what this situation shows us is that when the rules change there can be great disadvantage for real people. I wonder, then, how much of the MRT's time is taken up with cases where regulation changes may have been applied in such a way. It is in our national interest to seek to improve this country by allowing skilled migration. The rules are not there just to be blindly followed without due regard for such highly relevant information, as the Patrick case shows. Indeed, perhaps the MRT would have fewer cases to work through and done could move through them more quickly if the department's officials were more careful with such cases as the Patricks' visa application and, no doubt, other cases that directly involve the MRT. I welcome this bill to fix up the problems identified in the Migration Act, the two citizenship acts and the Customs Act. But I urge the department to be very careful in the manner in which it prosecutes the legislative and regulatory changes. Attention to detail is required, as is a consideration of the circumstances at the time of the application being lodged. They need to be fair and balancedthat should always be a consideration when dealing with the lives and futures of people. I look forward to the response from the WA state director of the department, the reconsideration of this matter and the right and appropriate response that will see the Patrick family granted their visas. I would like to finish by going back to an aspect raised by the previous speaker, the member for Moreton. I am sure that all members of parliament are familiar with going door to door preor post election. Sometimes you encounter people who want to tell you their views on immigration policy. It is one of those things that, let's face it, everyone has a view on in various ways. Sometimes people can make disparaging comments or can air their views with regard to the race or religion of people that they would particularly like to see not come to this country. Picking up from what the member for Moreton said, race should never be a part of politics. I do not really see the things that happened in the last six or seven years as being a matter of race. The good thing about this country is that, if someone wants to come here, make a positive contribution and work for a living, then they are welcome. But they must do those things and they must have respect for the traditions and the tions of this society. The good thing about Australia is that the colour of your skin or the religion that you do or do not practice does not matter. If you want to come here, work hard and respect the institutions and traditions of our society then you are welcome. That is a great thing about Australia. I do not think it is anything to do with race; I think it is something to do with attitude. I support this bill and I look forward to its plementation. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak today.",42
21,Mr DREYFUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 seeks to clarify and improve the effectiveness of the Migration Act, the Australian Citizenship Act, the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act and the Customs Act. There are a range of amendments proposed by the bill; I want to speak to only a few aspects of those amendments. Before I do, I would note the major changes that the government has made towards a fairer and more just immigration system. Amongst these are changes to the detention system recently announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans. The Rudd Labor government has made reforms to ensure that detention will be the last resort and will be for the shortest practicable time. Other changes have included the ending of the so called Pacific solution, the abolition of the temporary protection visa regime, increasing the minimum salary levels for 457 visa holders and increasing the humanitarian and refugee intakes. I was sorry to hear the member for Cowan this morning persisting in the defence of the brutal immigration regime of the former government. I was sorry also to hear the member for Cowan persisting in the demonisation of those seeking refuge in this country. instituThe Rudd Labor government has put the immigration regime of the former government behind us. We are no longer going to imprison children of those seeking refuge. We are no longer going to remove people seeking refuge to the middle of the Pacific at huge cost to this nation-even before one considers the emotional and physical cost to the people concerned. We are going to use a just and humane approach to immigration im- matters-one that Australians can be proud of rather than ashamed of, as so many Australians were of the approach of the former government to immigration questions. I want to specifically deal with one of the reforms introduced by this legislation, and it is the abolition of the handing down procedure that has been used by the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal until now. This is something that is dealt with in items 6 to 9 and items 19 to 22 of schedule 1 of the bill, by which those handing down procedures are going to be abolished. The abolition of these handing down procedures in both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal makes good practical sense. They reflect the current processes found within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal at the Commonwealth level, the Veterans Review Board, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, and, in my home state, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. I should refer to a letter that was written by Jillian Segal, who has done tremendous work in the service of the Commonwealth as President of the Administrative Review Council. What Jillian Segal wrote about the handing down process was that it was ‘administratively costly with no apparent benefit to the applicant'. With only 22 per cent of review applicants attending the handing down of their decisions, it was also a very artificial procedure. What these amendments will do is to allow the tribunal to simply give the applicant and the secretary of the department a copy of the decision within 14 days of the decision being made. This reflects the current processes found for those in immigration detention and also unifies the notification procedures. This simplification will reduce the of administrative error and prevent additional needless expense. It will also limit the source of a significant amount of litigation which the department has faced due to uncertainties in the notification and handing down procedures. The abolition will also expedite the notification processes by ensuring that decisions can be speedily delivered and, hence, any potential appeal or additional submission of materials can only occur after a certain date. I want to mention briefly the question of time limits because these were originally dealt with when this bill was introduced to the Senate in June. In the form in which this bill was introduced in the Senate, it contained amendments to reinstate appropriate and effective time limits for judicial review, and those provisions were found in schedule 1 in the form introduced. The existing sections 477 for the Federal Magistrates Court, 477A for the Federal Court and 468A for the High Court provide extra time limits on the time frames required for applications in immigration matters to be lodged with those courts. In the decision in Bodrudazza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the High Court held that such provisions were inconsistent with the powers provided by section 75(v) of the Constitution. In a joint judgement made by Chief Justice Gleeson sitting with Justices Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan, the court stated that section 468A could not be read down or severed to preserve its validity. The later decision of the High Court in Plaintiff S157 confirmed that any time limits must be truly regulatory in nature and not remove the constitutional right to recourse to the court. In that decision, Justice Callinan suggested that a 35-day time limit accompanied risk by a power to extend time would be acceptable. After the introduction of this bill to the parliament, a concern was raised that the amendments might not cover all decisions that are judicially reviewable and which should be subject to time limits. This included decisions made offshore to refuse to grant a visa to an applicant who has applied for a visa outside the migration zone and is not sponsored by an Australian permanent resident or citizen, and decisions to cancel a visa held by such a person while outside the migration zone. Due to the urgency in passing the amendments found elsewhere in the bill in schedule 4-and this relates to the decision of the full Federal Court in Sales, which I will come to in a moment-and as more detailed consideration is required to ensure that the amendments to reinstate effective time limits for judicial review will operate in the way intended, the government withdrew the amendments relating to time limits in government sponsored amendments in the House. I understand that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has indicated that he will seek to introduce amendments dealing with time limits in a separate bill later in the spring or autumn legislative program. As I have already mentioned, this bill has been given very considerable urgency by the decision on 17 July 2008 of the full Federal Court in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. That decision in effect built on comments that had been made by Justice Weinberg in an earlier decision, Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. What these decisions deal with, particularly what the decision in Sales deals with, is section 501(2) of the Migration Act, which reads: The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if: (a) the Minister reasonably suspect that the son does not pass the character test; and (b) the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test. Under the subsection, ministerial discretion exists for a visa that has been granted to be cancelled on character grounds. In the Sales decision, the Federal Court found that visas that are ‘held' by operation of law rather than ‘granted' cannot be cancelled under the character cancellation provisions of the Migration Act. As a result of that judgement on 17 July in which Mr Charles Sales's appeal against a decision of the former minister to cancel his transitional permanent visa on character grounds was upheld, Mr Sales was released from immigration detention. I should point out that Mr Sales was convicted of a particularly brutal murder in 1989 and had been serving a term of imprisonment until 2006. As a further result of the judgement some 22 other people were released from immigration detention: 14 were released from detention on 21 July 2008, six were released on 24 July 2008, one was released on 28 July and another was released on 30 July. Sixteen were released from Villawood, four from Perth and three from Maribyrnong in Melbourne. These people are all noncitizens who had served terms of imprisonment for their convictions for a variety of crimes. Those crimes cannot be detailed for privacy reasons, but the convictions include armed robbery, serious drug trafficking, sexual assault-including of minors-manslaughter and murder. It is of course the case that had they been Australian citizens each of these people would have been released into the community at the conclusion of their sentences. As noncitizens they had all been assessed as not passing the character test. The Migration Act provision to which I have already referred contains a ministerial per- discretion to refuse or cancel a visa where a visa applicant or visa holder does not pass the character test. In exercising this power, there is a responsibility to the parliament and to the Australian community to protect the community from criminal or other reprehensible conduct and to refuse to grant visas to or cancel visas held by noncitizens whose actions are so abhorrent to the community that they should not be allowed to enter or remain within Australia. Their visas having been cancelled under section 501, the group of people who were released had been detained upon their release from prison and were awaiting removal from our country. As a result of the court's decision in Sales, there were no grounds on which to continue to detain them and they were released from immigration detention. Turning to the specific amendments that are designed to deal with this problem that has arisen, it needs to be made clear that there can be no suggestion that it was ever intended that the holders of transitional permanent visas would be exempt from having their visas cancelled on character groundslike other noncitizens. What schedule 4 to this bill does is amend the Migration Act so that the character cancellation provisions apply to all temporary and permanent transitional visas and provide validation of all past character cancellation decisions in relation to such visas. There is no reason at all why this group of visas should have been exempted as a group. The amendment makes clear what could only have been parliament's original intention-that the holders of permanent and temporary transitional visas would be subject to the same character cancellation provisions as any other visa holder. The bill validates the cancellation power in relation to previous cancellations of transitional visas-that is, it is not a wholesale validation of the cancellation decisions in all respects; it deals with critical technical issue of whether the visa was granted. The amendments as drafted will effectively and automatically reinstate the cancellation decisions under which many of these people were detained. Following the commencement of these amendments, the majority of the people who have been released from immigration detention as a result of the Sales decision may then be liable for redetention, depending on their circumstances. For those not automatically covered by the legislation, the department will be considering their individual circumstances to decide what further action may be appropriate. This legislation will deal promptly and effectively with the consequences of the Federal Court's decision in the Sales case. I commend the bill to the House.",45
22,Mr SLIPPER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"It is always a pleasure to join the debate in the Parliament of Australia. In particular, it is a pleasure today to be able to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. This bill amends, as an omnibus bill, a number of pieces of legislation, including the Migration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007 and the Customs Act 1901. This bill seeks to ensure that Australia can do all that it can to meet its responsibilities and obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness 1961. These modifications could be regarded as housekeeping, but that would diminish the importance of the legislation impacted by this bill and would also diminish the importance placed on the vigilance required to ensure that our migration laws are protective of Australia while also meeting internationally accepted standards. Like many other pieces of legislation, it is the supported by both sides of the House. The bill is noncontroversial. The community is often not aware that most pieces of legislation introduced to the parliament-regardless of which side of the House is in government-are supported by both sides. The only things we read about parliament are about when the parties vigorously disagree. It is important that our migration laws are updated and reviewed from time to time, because it is an important sector of government responsibility. It was one of those areas passed to the new Australian government when Federation occurred in 1901. It is vital that, while making sure that we have internationally accepted standards, the government of the day continues to protect our borders and our way of life. It is important to recognise our own citizens and it is important, of course, always to recognise that there are people who want to cross Australian borders for many legitimate reasons. The bill streamlines the process by which those most impacted by decisions of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal are able to access those decisions. In the past, parties often had to wait until the decision had been formally handed down, but, with the passage of this bill, this requirement will be removed. This streamlining ensures that those whose lives may be placed in limbo as a result of the usual length of time taken to process immigration issues are potentially given somewhat of a reprieve. It does not represent a reduction or a softening of the security measures, but it does enable a reduction in the time taken in the normal processes of judicial review and analysis of immigration cases. Schedule 2 of the bill introduces measures relating to better monitoring of passengers on ships and aircraft, including the introduction of infringement notices that take the place of more lengthy prosecution for those operators who fail to meet their obligations of providing passenger and crew reports in advance of their arrival in Australia. Currently there are set time frames and specific deadlines for the provision of these passenger and crew information reports. The passage of this bill will see the introduction of provisions that allow the prescribing of time frames that are deemed suitable for individual cases. As you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, this enables improved flexibility in this aspect of border protection. Supplementary amendments clarify that the operators of these ships and aircraft are liable for prosecution for each individual passenger who is not properly reported on in line with the requirements rather than facing one charge per journey as is currently the case. It means operators must place greater emphasis on actually supplying the passenger and crew reports; otherwise they will face greatly increased penalties. Where in the past an operator would have faced a maximum amount no matter if there were one or 50 passengers not properly reported on, the passage of this bill will make it in their best interests to gently attempt to provide reports for every single passenger. This means that the penalty that will be imposed on them is commensurate with the level of their dereliction of duty. Schedule 3 of the bill deals with changes to legislation that deal with non-citizen children born in Australia and also introduces a condition that a security may be imposed to ensure compliance with visa conditions before the visa is granted. The amendment aims to give greater certainty to immigration status. It also clarifies the requirement that reports must include certain details of each individual passenger and crew member. The bill also affords the establishment of a new position of deputy principal member for the Migration Review Tribunal. This position currently exists only within the Refugee Review Tribunal so this bill will introduce a similar officeholder to the migration tribunal. As I said at the outset, this bill is supported by the Liberal and National Party opposition. I am very pleased therefore to be able to commend it to the chamber.",48
23,Mrs MARKUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Greenway) (11.18 am)I rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. The coalition is supporting this legislation. The bill is an omnibus bill that makes a range of amendments to several acts, including the Migration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007 and the Customs Act 1901. Schedule 1 of the bill will streamline and simplify the procedures of notifying parties with regard to a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. The current notification procedures have been the source of litigation and lengthy time before courts for families and individuals affected by this for many years, and, in many cases, decades. As has already been mentioned, this has been a diliconcern for both sides of the House for several years, particularly when families and individuals have had to put their lives on hold. Children of parents who are applicants have had to wait decades to actually plan for their future. One would hope that these amendments will actually improve that situation. The coalition notes that schedule 1 of the bill was also intended to reinstate effective time limits for applying to courts for judicial review of migration decisions. The current time limits in the act have been made largely ineffective, particularly following the April 2007 High Court decision of Bodruddaza v the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the July 2007 full Federal Court decision of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The government's new amendments will effectively remove a schedule 1 of the bill as it has come to light that the bill as drafted would not have worked appropriately with regard to decisions to which no merits review rights attach. The coalition understands that further consideration is required to determine how best to reinstate effective time limits for all judiaffects cially reviewable cases. Items 7 and 20 provide that tribunals will be required to notify an applicant of a decision other than an oral decision by giving the applicant and the secretary a copy of the decision within 14 days after the day on which the decision is taken to have been made. Items 6 and 19 provide that a decision other than an oral decision is taken to have been made on the date of the decision. This new formulation largely reflects the notification procedure that currently applies to persons in immigration detention. According to the second reading speech, the proposed new method for notifying parties of the tribunal's decision will be a lot simpler, thereby reducing the risk of error, particularly administrative errors. This suggests that handing down procedure that was introduced in 1999 to create certainty of dispatch has not, in retrospect, achieved its purpose. Schedule 2 of the bill clarifies the requirement for operators of aircraft and ships to report on passengers and crew prior to entering Australia-the Advance Passenger Processing system-and also establishes an infringement notice regime. The government's amendments make it clear that aircraft and ship operators are liable to separate prosecution under these offence provisions in relation to each individual passenger and crew rather than with regard to each journey not reported on prior to arrival in Australia. Schedule 3 of the bill makes a number of minor amendments to the act to again make it clearer with regard to immigration clearance of non-citizen children born in Australia, compliance with visa conditions and the operation of certain provisions relating to bridging visas. Immigration clearance is vitally important for a number of reasons. It a noncitizen's access to visas, especially bridging visas, under the Migration Regulations. It affects immigration detention. An unlawful noncitizen-that is, a noncitizen in the migration zone without a visamust be detained and a lawful noncitizen may be detained if they hold a visa that may be cancelled. An immigration cleared noncitizen may only be detained if they are likely to attempt to evade or otherwise not cooperate with Immigration officers. It also affects access to visas in relation to safe third-country rules. If a noncitizen is covered by an agreement between Australia and a safe third country, their access to visas will be essentially diminished. It also affects the cancellation of visas and the review rights. Generally, the MRT may not review a decision to refuse to grant or to cancel an offshore visa if that decision was made before the person was immigration cleared. The purpose of the measures in schedule 4 is to increase protections, particularly for clients who engage offshore migration agents. This gives DIAC the capacity to refuse to communicate with offshore migration agents, particularly when there are concerns about their professionalism, competence, conduct or character. Many of us on both sides of the chamber have seen many of our constituents come to us regarding this. As a result of poor advice or excess charging by migration agents-the list goes on-their future capacity to actually migrate or obtain a visa is limited. Often these individual applicants are unable to obtain a visa for decades because of the impact of this advice and the way that migration agents overseas have, in some cases, handled their case. Schedule 4 of the bill was not initially considered to be urgent, particularly when the bill was introduced. However, the legislation must be passed quite quickly due to the decision on 17 July of the full Federal Court in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. This decision gave effect to the ter comments in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The amendments contained in schedule 4 of the bill already anticipated such problems and difficulties, but these amendments will help to ensure that the character cancellation provisions apply to all temporary and permanent transitional visas and provide validation of all past character cancellation decisions in relation such visas. Throughout the history of immigration in this nation, Australians have felt strongly about Australia deciding who is to come to this country. One of the foundation principles has been the importance of character and how that impacts on the decision to grant someone's application for a visa. As a result of the Federal Court's decision in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, some 23 people, including Mr Sales, were released from immigration detention. The coalition, while careful and cautious in supporting such legislation, agrees with the government that this must be passed quickly to address the situation caused by the decision of the full Federal Court. Schedule 5 seeks to clarify the meaning of certain provisions of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 and the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that Australian citizenship law is consistent with our international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness of 1961. This bill aims to address and rectify challenges in the areas of judicial and merits review, border protection, visa integrity, Australian citizenship and other miscellaneous matters. I commend the bill to the House.",49
24,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (11.29 am)-in reply-As indicated earlier in the obi- debate, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 is an omnibus bill that makes amendments across the Migration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007 and the will Customs Act 1901. This will clarify and improve the effectiveness of the migration and citizenship legislation by addressing and recto tifying a range of problems that have been identified in the legislation over the years. It will also ensure that the citizenship legislation is consistent with two United Nations conventions: the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness 1961 and the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 1954. The amendments in this bill are important, necessary and, in the case of the Migration Act, long overdue. As was highlighted in my second reading speech, the bill has some urgency in relation to amendments in schedule 4. Some of the amendments in this schedule were included initially to address obiter comments in the May 2007 full Federal Court decision of Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 626 and the full Federal Court decision in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) FCAFC 132 on 17 July 2008. They affirmed the obiter reasoning in Moore and further found that a transitional permanent visa cannot be cancelled on character grounds, because that visa is held rather than granted. The amendments in schedule 4 of the bill address the Moore decision, and now the Sales decision, to ensure that the character cancellation provisions in the Migration Act apply to all temporary and permanent transitional visas and they provide validation of all past character cancellation decisions relation to such visas. This maintains the minister's ability to protect the Australian community. I now turn to matters raised in the debate and thank those who have contributed. I refer to comments by the member for Sturt. They were generally supportive of the legislation; however, it is very ironic that, on the morning after the night on which the opposition thanked the previous Prime Minister for his contribution to this country's politics, the member for Sturt has come in here and, in a way, slighted the contribution of the previous Prime Minister. Prime Minister Howard, historically, showed himself to be a major critic and opponent of multiculturalism, but the member for Sturt has come in here today and referred to the department as DIMA; that department's name was changed in January 2007. Changing the name of the department was a major accomplishment of the previous Prime Minister, but the member for Sturt has come in here today and, perhaps accidentally or perhaps deliberately, referred to a department by a name that has long gone. I take note of the comments that were made by the member for Cowan in relation to the Patrick family. We are certainly happy to look at that case and try to resolve the problems referred to. That member made some additional comments, unfortunately, regarding the history of migration detention in this country. Clearly, the Australian electorate recognised the need for overdue significant changes regarding the long-festering issue of temporary protection visas-the fact that people were in limbo land, unclear about where they were going. That has been rectified and, as I said earlier, welcomed by a broad constituency well beyond the conventional refugee advocacy movement. We have the situation where offshore detention sites have been ended and what has been termed in the ‘Pacific solution' has been terminated. It is perhaps unfortunate, given the crusade by a small number of members of the previous government against that government's legislation and activities on detention, that we have this member today still harking back-in a sense, in the way they do regarding Australian workplace agreements-to a now rejected history of detention of individuals for long periods. I conclude by commending the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",51

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (SCHOOLING REQUIREMENTS) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 September, on motion by Ms Gillard: That this bill be now read a second time.",52
26,Mr LINDSAY,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"I want to speak on the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 because, while I will vote for it, I do not think it is going to be effective and achieve the outcomes desired from it. I want the parliament and the people of Australia to know what my concerns are in relation to this particular piece of legislation. There is no doubt that everybody wants to see kids go to school, and do so regularly, and have a good education, because that is what will stand them in good stead for the rest of their lives. There is also no doubt that there is a fair bit of truancy out there and in certain communities kids do not go to school regularly. It is happening more and more in mainstream communities. In my electorate is Palm Island, which I think, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you have been to. It is a beautiful island with an Indigenous community, but both the government school and the Catholic school have difficulty in getting many of their students to attend school regularly. It is such a shame, and Indigenous leaders recognise this. Certainly, Reverend Shane Blackman at Shalom Christian College on the mainland in my electorate is ferocious in telling parents, ‘You must get your kids to go to school because it is how Indigenous Australia is going to get ahead.' There is no doubt that Indigenous Australians are just as capable as any other Australians of achieving. We have proved this at James Cook University in my electorate in Townsville, where each year we enrol Indigenous students in the medical school program; those students graduate as doctors. But, across the economy, you will find Indigenous people who are doing just as well as any other Australians. So I come back to Palm Island. I come back to the need to get the students to attend school. It is just such a shame that, for whatever reason, students will just decide, ‘Well, we won't go to school today; we'll just go horse riding.' In other communities you find that there are cultural reasons why young men decide not to continue at school, because once they reach manhood in Indigenous culture it is considered kind of beneath their dignity to go to school. That attitude has to change. The bill before the parliament today basically says there will be penalties for children on welfare payments who do not go to school. My concern is how you actually, in practice, make this work. The bill requires that schools to report nonattendance to Centrelink. Centrelink then looks at that and says, ‘Well, we'll dock welfare payments.' But do we really think that schools have the time to report students who do not attend to Centrelink? Do we really think that is going to happen? You know how school officers are so busy trying to keep up with the administration that is needed in a school of this modern era. Do we really think that schools will say, ‘Well, okay, we'll take on this extra load'? The answer is no. The problem for the Commonwealth is that schools are under state jurisdiction and we cannot order a public school to report to Centrelink. Indeed, some states have said, ‘We can't report anyway, because it is a privacy issue.' That is particularly so with Tasmania. So the legislation is doomed to failure, but the philosophy is right-and that is why I will support it. But it is a shame that legislation goes through the parliament that in practice will not work. Nobody will be reported to Centrelink. There is a bit of cynicism here, I guess, where the government takes the credit for doing something that everybody wants to see happen but in fact the wool is being pulled over their eyes because it is not going to happen. I find that very unfortunate indeed. We have to get kids to school. The Liberal Party for its part believes in mutual obligation. It believes that, if government support is provided to Australians, there should be an obligation to return something in response to that support. We think that it is reasonable to request that children attend school, but this is not going to happen. I think we all struggle to find ways that enable us to get our students to stay at school, that we can convince the mums and dads that they have to get their kids to attend and that we can convince the students that it is in the interests of their ture lives to attend school. I will conclude there by indicating my support for the bill and my disappointment that this bill is not in fact going to do what the people of Australia expect it to do.  Before I enter into the body of my speech on the second reading of the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008, I will correct for the benefit of the member for Herbert some of the information that he has provided. Having worked in schools for a long time, 11 years as a teacher and five years as a union organiser, in both state and private schools, I am very well aware that attendance records at schools, the rolls, are actually public documents. Anyone who has organised a school reunion would know that. They are public documents that must be kept as a record, as can be seen in the Queensland archives-you can go and track down the attendance record of anyone who has received public money. It is already a process that is in train in terms of people recording the attendance of students at school, as it rightly should be. It would only be a small task for a school officer-and I have a lot more faith in the school officers and the education sector than the member for Herbertto pass that information on administratively to Centrelink. It would be a click of a mouse, because the data is recorded every day anyway. I think this initiative, the legislation before the House, is a great piece of legislation because it will go some way to achieving that great Labor goal that the member for Herbert did touch on-that all children have the right to high-quality education. It is a basic tenet of the Labor Party that we support good education. Every parent, every community and every MP in the House, I am sure, would support the proposition that every student fuhas the right to a high-quality education. That is especially so for the Rudd government. Our Prime Minister has had success in life because he was given an opportunity through education. For so many of the people on this side of the House that has been the case. Bright minds-I am not talking about myself-have been given an opportunity to do well. Parents, teachers and school communities all play a crucial role in providing a goodquality education, but ultimately it is the role of governments to raise the standard, increase investment, guard against inequality, boost attendance and ensure that all children can achieve to their full potential. That is why the government that I serve is so serious about delivering an education revolution to this country. The Rudd government's education revolution includes a half-billion-dollar investment in early childhood pre-literacy and pre-numeracy, halving HECS for those studying maths and science at university and then halving HECS again if they choose to pursue a career teaching or working in maths and science. These are great initiatives that will produce real results-real, life-changing decisions-for people who are out there considering an education career. The Rudd government is committed to a new national curriculum in the core subjects of maths, science, English and history. Many Australians do not see the state borders anymore. They move regularly following work, following sunshine and following lots of things, so it makes sense now, in 2008, to have a national curriculum rather than the old horse-and-buggy approach of the states looking after it. We are also committed to a new national action plan on literacy and numeracy and a $2.4 billion education tax refund, which will help out so many parents and, more importantly, sends the key message that education is to be valued. We are also committed to a $1.2 billion digital education revolution to give every student in years 9 to 12 access to a computer. I have seen this in my electorate, where I was able to proudly hand over the certificate to the principal of one of my nongovernment schools and where they were able to put more computers into the school. Ironically, in the only school in my electorate that received computer funding in the first round, the principal was a paid-up member of the Liberal Party. That is just the irony it, I suppose, but it goes to show that the Rudd government is, without fear or favour, committed to ensuring that every student in years 9 to 12 has access to a computer. We are also investing $30 million to boost education for remote Indigenous children, including a trial linking family and welfare payments to school attendance. This is the plan the Australian people voted for. If we are to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children, school attendance rates in remote Indigenous communities must be improved. I come from a country town in Queensland with a significant Indigenous population. I know too well the difference between wandering away from school and staying at school and going on with a career. Too many of my friends dropped out early. This policy would have changed lives. Perhaps it would even have saved lives. There are about 2,000 Indigenous children of compulsory school age in the Northern Territory who are not enrolled in school2,000 people. That is the size of the town I grew up in. That is 2,000 people, 2,000 lives and 2,000 opportunities wasted. That means that one in five Aboriginal children in remote communities in the Northern Territory is not even enrolled in school. A further 2½ thousand are not attending regularly, and about 8,000 Indigenous children attend school only 60 per cent of the time on average. Without continuity, obviously the chances of getting a high-school certificate or a tertiary qualification are very, very limited. If we truly believe that all children have a right to a quality education, then a child growing up in the remote community of Katherine should have the same chance to get an education as a child in Brisbane. That is why I am proud to speak in support of the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amend of ment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008. Children not enrolled in and regularly attending school miss out on an education and are severely disadvantaged later in life when it comes to seeking employment and gaining financial independence. This bill introduces greater support for parents to help ensure that their children are enrolled and, more importantly, that they are regularly attending school. It also introduces conditions, tied to school attendance, on income support payments. These measures will be trialled in six Northern Territory communities, one site in Western Australia and another metropolitan site to be determined. Parents who fail to enrol their children or take reasonable measures to get their children to go to school may have their income support payments suspended until their children are enrolled or they begin attending school. Parents will be required to provide Centrelink with information about their child's school enrolment. Parents who fail to do so without a reasonable excuse-and that is most important-may have their income support payments suspended until they enrol their child. Centrelink will also work with those parents to help them meet this requirement. This bill also authorises schools to report poor attendance to Centrelink. Once again, Centrelink will then work with the parents to help them improve their child's school attendance. Education authorities, local schools and Centrelink will work together with parents to improve school attendance. They will work together to improve their children's lives. A decision to temporarily withhold a parent's income support will be a last resortonly a last resort. The first thought that came to my mind was: when would the trigger event happen? It is reassuring to know that it will be the last resort, where it can be shown the parent has failed, despite help from the school and Centrelink, to exercise parental responsibility and regularly get their child along to school. Full back pay will be provided when parents have met their responsibilities within a 13-week period or longer. Basically, they have a quarter of the year, 13 weeks-a season, I suppose-to get it right. Much has been said about the measures in this bill which give Centrelink authority to suspend welfare payments, but this bill is not about punishing disadvantaged families. It is not an attack on the poor and the vulnerable. Instead, it is about putting in place a system to support parents and help them give their kids the education they deserve. If I could just touch on my own experience, I came from a family with 10 children. My mother was not receiving Centrelink payments so there was no lever for the government to pull in terms of school attendance. My mother was a single mum and she worked as a registered nurse at the hospital. When she left in the morning, it was up to us to get ourselves to school, basically. There were six of us at high school and primary school at the one time. I know that one of my brothers-who I will not name-had a shocking attendance record; it was absolutely shocking. Unfortunately, we do not have a social lever to pull to get someone like my brother off to school, so this will only affect those people who are receiving Centrelink payments. Hopefully, there will be other mechanisms in place to try and ensure that people not receiving Centrelink payments do send all their children to school. I stress again that income support payments will be cancelled only in the most extreme cases, where parents refuse to cooperate with the school and Centrelink. I am hopeful that the trial areas will experience a surge in school enrolments and attendance as a result of this bill before the House. This in turn will dramatically boost the lifelong potential of many children in these trial communities, because there is so much evidence indicating that more education means more chance of having a job that pays more and that is not part-time, casual or based on seasonal factors. I am also pleased that an evaluation process will be undertaken and that the results of this trial will be monitored before the program is expanded to other areas. This approach, of linking welfare payments to social outcomes, is a proven and effective way to change community behaviours. And, as I said, when community behaviours are changed, lives are changed. A good comparison would be to look at immunisation. Obviously, immunisation is actually about life and death, not just the sort of job you might have, so one would think that even a parent with the poorest parenting skills would still take their child off to be immunised. But, since the childcare benefit and the immunisation payment were linked to children completing a vaccination program, we have seen immunisation rates rise from around 50 per cent in the 1990s to more than 90 per cent today-and that is with something as important as a life or death thing like vaccination. Obviously, immunisation funds are not inconsequential but they are not that significant. But, by making that simple connection and simply tweaking, we were able to change the vaccination rates very significantly. Obviously, money talks. The legislation before the House supports a program that is not being done in isolation. Instead, it is part of a range of Rudd government measures to improve education and health outcomes for Indigenous children. We have already committed 200 extra teachers for the Northern Territory. These additional teachers will help meet the increased enrolments that this bill will deliver. As a former teacher, I am especially proud of this commitment. It is a real calling to be a teacher. Not many people are in it to retire rich! Teachers' wages are adequate; they obviously could be much more. But it is good to see the cultural shift that is occurring under the Rudd government through this education revolution. Unfortunately, I am a little bit confused about the opposition's position on this bill. We heard from the member for Herbert. As he said, he doubts the efficacy of the legislapolitics out. tion but was able to support it. If we go back a bit further, in 2006, the then Treasurer, member for Higgins, announced a similar plan, and he told Tony Jones on Lateline: … new proposals to make welfare conditional on school attendance … is a real breakthrough. Of course, despite announcing this plan, the coalition never actually introduced it. So now, in 2008, the opposition leader, Dr Brendan Nelson, described the plan as: … some sort of media-driven stunt. I stress to the House that this is not a stunt. This is legislation that will change lives. And, going on my experience in a country town with a very significant Indigenous population, it will also save lives. Unfortunately, the opposition Indigenous affairs spokesman refused to support the plan. Old habits die hard for the member for Warringah who, on Radio National last week, blamed the states for not enforcing current truancy laws. I have not caught up with the member for Warringah, but he informed the House that he had spent a few weeks in the bush in a remote Indigenous community. I wonder what the parents of the Indigenous children not attending school told him. I wonder if their plea was the same as that of every parent-that they want their children to have a chance in life. Unfortunately, that blame game that we hear referred to still exists on the other side of the House. But, thankfully, one of the people who we often hear from in question time, the member for Canning, was much more open in his support of the plan before the House. What did he say? He said: This is taxpayers' money … and we want it to be used properly for the benefit of children. I should point out that, I think, the member for Canning was a teacher, so he does understand the importance of education and he is obviously, on occasion, able to leave the There is no confusion on this side of the the House about the merits of this bill. The bill before the House balances appropriate support with financial incentives to encourage parents in the trial areas to get their kids enrolled and along to school. Labor understands how important this is. As I said, the Prime Minister, who was given a chance in life through education, values it, as does the Deputy Prime Minister, and as do so many other people on this side of the House who got here through education. The Labor Party is committed to building a nation. That has been our history. We have made visionary programs and we have made visionary decisions that have been the bedrock for much of the nation. Unfortunately, those opposite, the Liberals, are happy merely to bill the nation that Labor built. I commend the bill to the House.",53
27,Mr TUCKEY,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (11.59 am)In making his comments, the member for Moreton said that there was some doubt amongst Liberals about their support for the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008. It is my clear understanding that we not only support the legislation; we support its principle. But, on the other hand, had the member for Moreton read the explanatory memorandum, as I have, and had he searched for evidence that there is some obligation on the state entities, private entities or religious entities running schools to make the reports to Centrelink, which are fundamental to the issuance of notices on parents, he would have found that it is not there. I am not sure if constitutionally it could be there. All I can find in the explanatory memorandum is the following: ... a person responsible for the operation of the school gives the Secretarythat is, Centrelinkwritten notice that the child is failing to comply with the school attendance requirements to the satisfaction of the person responsible for the operation of the school and the person is failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that the child attends school to the responsible person's satisfaction. That is all very easy for some hard working single mother to understand, I am sure. It goes on in that regard. But it is voluntary. Let me draw the member for Moreton's attention to the beginnings of this idea. Privately, without any legislative backing, without anything, a school principal in either Halls Creek or Fitzroy Crossing in the northern area of my state, in the electorate of Kalgoorlie, did a deal with the local Centrelink bloke that if the kids were not coming to school Centrelink would take some action. It worked, virtually overnight. Large numbers of kids who were not there before started attending school. The figures, in fact, were a matter of public record. But what was the result of that? There was a hell of a fuss from the state Labor education minister about the fact that this rotten principal had actually acted to get kids to school-to the extent, as I recollect, that the principal eventually resigned his position as a teacher. He is no longer available to teach kids, and he was one who had obviously volunteered to go into that area. That is what happened. This is what we get and why we are cynical. We accepted that, when we were the Liberal government, state Labor governments were not going to do anything to help Aboriginals for which we might get the credit. That is how stupid the political system is. But the reality is that the Liberal government, in proposing to implement these arrangements, got no cooperation from the state governments at all. The member for Moreton mentions the blame game. Let me tell him that his Prime Minister has been absolutely successful in playing the blame game. He no longer blames the states and they no longer blame him. The sorts of wars that used to exist between Labor premiers and the Liberal government-and, I might add, in the days of past premiers in WA such as Sir Charles Court, between Liberal state governments and Liberal federal governments-have ceased to exist. But in the cancellation of those wars, the community no longer has any idea what you are up to. I would have thought that this legislation would have had substance, that there would be something in it. I have read the second reading speech. I think there could have been some obligation for the minister to make a statement to this House, under the discipline of not misleading it, about the fact that the arrangements were already in place with COAG and that he had written commitments from state education ministers that they would conform with the requirements of this legislation. That would have given meaning to an otherwise excellent measure. But the reality is that, wherever we turn, and particularly in education, it is all ‘gonna'. The Deputy Prime Minister is up every day measuring her success, her excellence, by expenditure. She has spent the money or she has transferred it somewhereand, I understand, primarily to state govern- book on that. ment agencies. She ought to read Paul Keating's comments on that after we introduced the GST and made it a grant for unspecified use. He told us we were stupid. There are many examples of similar quotes about the fact that we are sending so many millions to state education agencies and expecting that the money will actually materialise at a school. The member for Moreton talked about a school having some association with the Liberal Party and getting some computers. A lot of schools in my electorate puters before the election because the Howard government introduced the Investing in Our Schools Program, or IOSP, as we got to know it. That gave every school in Australia-the smallest numbering 10 pupils in some cases in my electorate-the opportunity to spend, with appropriate approval, $150,000 on upgrading the infrastructure or the equipment of their school. To my recollection, a lot purchased computers. They used the money for that purpose. It is magnificent to go into some of those schools. I might add a comment about one school for disadvantaged kids-and I mean disadvantaged kids, one of whom had practically no motor skills. If you really want to get a lump in your throat, go and see those kids actually using a computer when they can virtually not move any part of their body. There are computers they can use, and they get the benefit. Those computers came out of IOSP, not from the claims of the Deputy Prime Minister. From what she said yesterday, one would think that there are kids today using sophisticated tools and equipment about in schools because she has allocated the money. I am happy to go with her-as I said at the doorstop this morning-to some of those schools when the computers are actually in operation. I would like to run the This is the same thing. The government would have credibility for a great initiative if they demonstrated to us that they had any arrangements in place to require that person, as the explanatory memorandum says, to send those notices whenever truancy came to their notice. Of course, it would not be a bad idea if other methods were used in terms of knowing where these people are. Yes, privacy is a right, but not when you are denying your kids an education or a future. That is an outrage, and there can be no privacy associgot their comated with that failing. It is a fact of life that 50 per cent of the cost of running every government school in Australia is funded from the budget of this parliament. That is constantly overlooked. We have these silly campaigns by the school teachers union identifying specific grants. I hope one day the revenge that is taken upon them in that regard is that this parliament shifts to parental vouchers, where there can be no question mark whatsoever. We have all this fooling with numbers, where one takes the specific grants but ignores, for instance, the GST revenue that flows to a state government. They run those silly specific grant comparisons when no GST revenue goes to non-government schools. ",58
28,Mr TUCKEY,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"For the member for Moreton's information, because he might not understand: 100 per cent of GST revenue is distributed to state governments. We went to the Australian people with the fact that if they re-elected us we would introduce this tax-and it cost us a lot of seats. For years thereafter, the opposition said that they were going to have a rollback. They opposed it even after it was established and in existence. Our leader, John Howard, said, ‘You the people of Australia have to absorb this tax for the purpose of ensuring state governments can look after their schools, their hospitals and their law and order responsibilities.' They got the money but they do not have any truancy officers. And here we are in the federal parliament legislating to get stuck into individuals for the purpose of replacing the inadequacy and, in fact, the obstructionism of state education agencies to this point in time. ",60
29,Mr TUCKEY,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"I remind the member for Moreton that it was a state minister that persecuted a school teacher who first did this, to the point where he resigned on mental anguish grounds-the man was so heartbroken. ",60
30,Mr TUCKEY,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"I will stand corrected if the member for Moreton wants to go and research those circumstances, but in my recollection-and my memory is pretty good on these things-I read in the media that the fellow eventually resigned. There is absolutely no doubt that he was personally attacked by, I think, Michelle Roberts, the then minister-but I will stand corrected on that. But I advise anyone in this House to be very careful about denying my memory without having the written documents. What I am saying is that this is a good scheme but we have doubts about why it is introduced at a time when GDP growth is falling to 0.3 per cent et cetera, et cetera, and there is nothing in the legislation that tells us how it is going to work. I well remember the minister responsible for Aboriginal affairs speaking in this place in opposition, and even on the assumption of government, to cast grave doubt over the concept of hypothecating people's Centrelink payments for food for their children. When eventually convinced-I think as much by public opinion as anything else-she decided to do something about it, and what have we got? We have got a trial. I think there are three localities-in Western Australia and possibly Australia-where we are trialling the patently obvious. But let me tell the member for Moreton one place where there is not a trial. It is a town called Narrogin, which for most of my career I represented. At the moment that town and district is in the electorate of Pearce. I received a frantic call from the district superintendent-a policeman whom I admire greatly-telling me that there is a family of seven in the area and they have one of those kids in court, as they are obliged to do, for his umpteenth break and enter. And what was his purpose? To get food and somewhere to sleep. He is one of seven children. The welfare payment to his parents exceeds $700 a week, and on a visit to the house it was found to be devoid of food. There are seven kids-and an eighth is on the way-and there was no food in the house and they receive $700 a week. I wrote to the minister about that situation and said, ‘For goodness sake; I have the pleadings of a district superintendent to extend your scheme. He does not want to be grabbing this kid and dragging him into court; it is heart breaking. The kid is a trained home invader-out of hunger.' But I got the usual form letter from the minister. I did five years as a minister and I read every letter someone else wrote for me-a standing joke in the department was, ‘Never send him fewer than 50 letters at a time or he will change the lot of them'-and the first reference I ever made was to the content of the letter we received. Ministers here might tell the member for Moreton that I put my constituents first-and I do. I have been enraged in the past to see people stand up on these opposition benches and use the hardship of an individual to attack the government. As their representative, I will plead with a Labor minister for help, as I think ministers would know-without any pack drill, media releases et cetera. There is an agricultural school run by the Catholic church in the northern sectors of my electorate. It has been there for 100 years and it takes, amongst others, a heap of Aboriginal kids who come down from as far away as Broome. The Catholic agencies want to close it-partly, I think, because they are not getting enough revenue out of the farm anymore because there has been a drought. That will be changed a lot this year, I am pleased to say. I rang the office and asked if I could speak to the minister and give a heads-up in the hope that she, bringing credit to the government, would make some announcement because some financial help was needed. ",60
31,Mr TUCKEY,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"Yes. I even got a call asking for my phone details. I thought, ‘That's good of her, she's going to ring.' I did not go to the media, as others did in due course, but what did I get? No call. That is silly. The first issue there was to say: ‘You'd better have a look at this. It needs some special assistance. It's got history, it's got heritage and it does a good job. I think its financial difficulties are more to do with a couple of failed crops than the fact that only 100 or so kids turn up there.' You can have all the legislation in the world, you can have all the talk at that desk about the money you are going to allocate, but if it does not turn up in results it is a tragedy, particularly when it comes to giving basic education to all children. I do not think Literacy and Numeracy Week is an occasion to blackguard someone over here. I am pretty good at that I do not mind-but I do not think you need that as an excuse. Julia Gillard thinks she is Mick Young. I was here when Mick Young was here. Mick Young was genuinely funny. I have walked up and down this side of the place pleading with my own side not to laugh. They were being caused to laugh at one of us. She is not of that status. She should stick to going around seeing that the state governments are not ripping her money off under IOSP. What happened? We dictated that it was the school principal and the school P&C-or whatever it might be called-who made the decisions. But the minute they went anywhere near repairs to the building or anything the Department of Housing and Works in Perth said, ‘We have to be involved.' What did the school do? It had to go through the department for all the work involved. They have their chosen contractors. One job went from $2½ thousand to $7½ thousand when the local contractor could not do the work. They escalated the values and then took 17½ per cent for their help. Nobody who went down the road of having to use their services-and there were some options to get out of it-got $150,000. The best they could get was $150,000 less 17 per cent, which is about $120,000. Why would a state government do that when this parliament decided-I am sure it had the support of the opposition at the time-to send them money? It all comes down to this same arrangement. The first and required step-call it the blame game, if you like-is for state education agencies to employ sufficient truancy inspectors for the purpose, but that then should be in agreement with Centrelink to use the effective proposed reduction in Centrelink payments. At the same time, and even more importantly, it is not a bad idea to see that some those Centrelink payments are paid so a kid gets breakfast before they go to school and that the reason for their truancy is not that they are running around trying to steal food. These are the fundamental issues and this is where this legislation fails. It gives no antee that it will be implemented. That is the position. (Time expired)",61
32,Dr STONE,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"I support, as do my coalition colleagues, any actions which are just, practical and effectively result in achieving greater school attendance for all Australian children throughout the country. What we are concerned about with this Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 is that the Rudd Labor government has a very poor record of following through good intentions with adequate resources and proper process. We tend to get the grand statement and the photo opportunity, but there is nothing beyond and nothing that will really make a difference. Often the cynicism that those who are to receive the service feel when expectations are built and then dashed leaves them even worse off than before. Let me give the House a few examplesnone of them is nearly as important as education for children. Fuelwatch was supposed to bring down the price of fuel. Petrol is one of the very serious inputs to business but is also necessary for community members to go about their daily family life. Fuelwatch was going to make a difference, we were told. It was going to bring down petrol prices. In fact, what we got was a website. The Fuelwatch process is a nonsense and has the opposite effect of dampening competition in selling fuel across the country. Then we had the business of ‘grocery watch', or GROCERYchoice as Labor initially called it. It is another serious issue. The cost of living for households has gone up so of much since this government was elected that families want relief. There are already families in my electorate on food parcels due to the drought. Even with salaries, the cost of fresh and manufactured food has gone through the roof. People expected something guar- to happen when this government said, ‘We will bring down grocery prices.' What did we get? We got ‘grocery watch', another website that is so stupid, so flawed, that it has become the target of every comedian in the country. It was so badly designed it could never bring down grocery prices, and it cost taxpayers $13 million. As I said at the beginning, the sound education of our children is of critical importance. No nation can expect to have a just and civil society with social inclusion, full employment or even decent workforce participation rates if children do not go to school and stay as long as it takes to have a sound, basic education that will maximise their opportunities in life. But we cannot expect to deal with non school attendance with a single instrument. We know that school attendance is very much a part of the states' work, and there are a lot of complexities around who keeps data-especially at the secondary level-about school attendance, in particular when a child is already over the legal age of compulsory education in a state. I want to applaud this government for at least-like the coalition-articulating the problem, but I am extremely concerned that, as I have mentioned already, this will be a one-day wonder with success measured in newspaper column centimetres for the day and maybe a few bits of TV. The Australian community deserves to have much more and much better. All Australians deserve more, but particularly our minority groups-like our Indigenous Australians and also our recently arrived refugees-and our country communities. They are suffering extremes of depopulation and internal migration, not only because of drought and climate change but also because of poor government policy-for example, taking their water and leaving them without the means of production. Members will note that I am not calling these students who do not attend school ‘truants'. That term implies that students knowingly and wilfully choose not to be enrolled or not to go to school, preferring to spend their day in the sun. That seems to be the implication when you talk about these children as truants. It is estimated that up to 20,000 children of school age are not enrolled in schools and, of course, many, many more are not going to school. Why aren't children being enrolled in school? We have to ask that question in order to understand what to do about it. The intention of this legislation is that parents will be made to enrol their children by understanding that, if they do not, they will have their income support payments cut off for a period of up to 13 weeks or perhaps permanently. This implies that there are parents-either two parents or even one parent in control of the child. The legislation says that if a child is not attending school then the parents will have up to 13 weeks-over three months-to have that child back in school and then their payments will be re-established. If they cannot pull that off, their payments will be permanently withdrawn. I have to say that I am concerned that we do not know enough about why children are not enrolled in school, but we can speculate. That speculation, backed by some good research and communication with the states, should have better informed this policy. Is a child not enrolled because the parent does not speak English? Because they have recently arrived in this country? Because they are not literate? Perhaps the parent never went to school. Perhaps the child does not even have a birth certificate. Perhaps the child was not born in the hospital system. Perhaps there is not a school at the outstation or near where a child lives, so the parent did not understand the expectation-even though a school was not available. And this is the situation in a lot of Northern Australia. Even though there is not a school, that child should be enrolled somehow or have their income support withdrawn. If a child is refusing to attend or does not attend school, is it because they are too hungry? Is it because they are embarrassed about the fact that they do not have a uniform, or that they have not been able to wash? Perhaps they have a chronic undiagnosed illness or disease. Perhaps their hearing is so poor that they cannot hear and so they fail in school. Or perhaps their eyesight is damaged or too poor and it has not been diagnosed or treated. Or perhaps they were born with foetal alcohol syndrome that has not been diagnosed and the child cannot cope at school. Perhaps they have been bullied, or perhaps, the night before, they watched their parent become a victim of domestic violence-or perhaps they have been a victim of violence themselves. Sadly, we know only too well the extent to which that happens in our most dysfunctional and impoverished Indigenous communities in the emergency response area. Perhaps the child does not have a parent nearby. Perhaps the grandmother is raising the child and she has too many to feed and keep safe to ensure that the children of school age not only go to school but stay there all day. Perhaps the child has not had a bed to lie down in and they do not have decent housing. As I have said, they may be so hungry that their object is to get some food, not to go into school and stay there all day. Perhaps a child has no-one in their family who is employed-nor has there been anyone employed for generations. So when someone says, ‘If you don't go to school you won't get a job,' that is not a meaningful statement for them. If they have no understanding, knowledge of or expectation that they will be employed in this country, the lure of staying at school to get a qualification and a job is not in their family's life experience and it makes no sense to them. These are just some of the reasons why we have school attendance problems and issues. These issues, it would seem to me, require a much more comprehensive Commonwealth partnership. This policy highlights the total failure of child protection systems in the states and territories. Every now and then the media reports some horrific story of a child reported to DoCS, for example, who has not been removed from a desperately dangerous situation and the child dies. We know that, sadly, there is abuse in families. We know that a lot of children are not safe. Often a symptom of failure of protection is that a child does not go to school. Perhaps the child is shifted around too often by a parent trying to get out of a very violent situation and it is impossible for that child to go to school. I want to read from today's Australian a report which highlights this problem. I quote: In its submission to the federal Government's intervention review team, chaired by indigenous leader Peter Yu, the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care, said the Territory's child-protection system remained seriously flawed with “a chronic lack of capacity” to deal with the issue. Failure to go to school is often an indication of a child protection need. The chairwoman of the SNAICC, Muriel Bamblett: ... yesterday told The Australian she believed there was a culture within under-resourced child care agencies in the Territory that “if a child is living on the land, they won't go in and remove that child”. She is referring to a situation where a child's safety is not being given absolute priority consideration. In its submission, SNAICC, which represents Aboriginal child care agencies nationwide, said there had been no significant increase in notifications of abuse or removal of children despite an extensive focus on child abuse and neglect over the past year. “This is cause for grave concern and suggests that systems firstly for ensuring children's well-being and secondly for protecting them from harm are still seriously flawed and lacking capacity stateacross the Northern Territory,” the agency says. Child protection is very important work and this report stresses that the very first areas to experience the full brunt of this legislation, six of the eight sites, are going to be in the emergency response area-in the Northern Territory, where there is a total failure of the Northern Territory government to do the right thing, to resource better and to have better systems of child protection. So by itself, just going in there and having the schools report that children A, B and C have not gone to school again, and taking the parents' welfare, does nothing to address the complex and long standing problems of these children needing protection-and children who need protection often do not have good school attendance or may not even be enrolled in school. I am concerned that this legislation is just another bit of window-dressing which does not go to the heart of or deal with the complex set of problems. It does not demonstrate that the states or territories are going to do anything different other than provide data from the school principal which says, ‘Yes, we had 13 not at school again today.' A lot more work, a lot more understanding and a lot more community and parental supportor grandparental support-has to go into ensuring that all of our children reach their full potential, all of our children are safe and all of our children live a life of choice and deep meaning in our country. That cannot happen with a strategy which simply says: ‘Your child was not at school. Parent, get your act together. Why wasn't your child at school? You don't know? We will give you three months to get your child back in school.' That strategy is just not good enough. The Northern Territory is going to be the location for six of the initial sites where the so-called truancy will be dealt with. There are eight sites in all. One is possibly going be in Cannington in Western Australia, and we do not know the site of the final trial. In the Northern Territory in particular, the tion understood only too well the interconnectedness within the cycle of poverty, despair, and dysfunction that affected the lives of children and adults in remote communities. We understood that unemployment was at the core of the sense of alienation and boredom which can lead to pornography, drug and alcohol abuse and finally the terrible child abuse that was reported so profoundly and distressingly in the Little children are sacred report. We looked at what has caused that chronic unemployment over generations, when there is employment-in fact, jobs going begging-in the Northern Territory. Of course we immediately focused upon CDEP, the Community Development Employment Program. What we found was that the Northern Territory government had been cost shifting the payment of teachers' assistants in schools for years by simply reimbursing these women-it was and remains mostly women-through CDEP, rather than having them employed by the Northern Territory education department and properly trained and supported so they became literate, numerate English-language speakers, who could then help to give a more meaningful school experience to their students. If the school is a poorly resourced place, if it does not teach adequate English, if it does not teach literacy and numeracy, if it looks like any other run-down shack in that community, if it is hot, dusty and dry, if teachers are overworked and if they depend on the welfare-paid teachers' aides to do most of the heavy lifting, why would a child be excited by the prospect of learning in that place? So we said to the Northern Territory government: ‘Get your act together. Here's at least $30 million to go to those schools with those Indigenous teachers' aides so you can put to them on a proper salary. Give them a proper job. Give them the professional development that they need. Give them a sense of pride in coalia career-it could be permanent part-time; that is up to the individuals-and in that way we can help build the experience of school as a good place for boys and girls in the Northern Territory.' I am saddened and sickened to say that the Northern Territory government has not used those millions of dollars to transfer the Indigenous teachers' aides onto Northern Territory payrolls. I think that is a disgrace. So here we go: we are now going to ask those hard-working, overtaxed school principals to dob in the kids not going to school, track down the parents, if they can, take them off their income support for up to three months and tell them they have got three months to get the kids into school-and then presume the job is done. Well, it may not be. The coalition would never have put this on the plate as a stand-alone, simplistic, silver bullet lution to a complex, long standing, difficult situation. We also would not further enforce the notion that this is a problem just for Indigenous families. We would have had a number of sites trialled across Australia, not just in Indigenous communities, because failure to attend school occurs across Australia, in particular in areas under great financial distress and with low socio-economic status. While of course I support anything that is going to help give children a decent education in this country, that starts from families being sufficiently resourced, sufficiently secure and functional, so they understand the importance of the child attending school and they can supply that child with the physical and emotional support they need to go to school. That includes a good night's sleep, a decent meal, hearing them read-and if the parents are not literate, that is also a problem needing attention. I want parents to be very much a part of this movement to help kids stay in school. Under this legislation, parents are simply going to be the ones with their incomes removed. I do not think this is good stand-alone icy. I think it should be part of a total package or strategy. Certainly, in Halls Creek in Western Australia, where a similar process was trialled, it worked. But, with the process that occurred in Halls Creek, there was a whole range of other measures in place and in parallel. I ask this Rudd Labor government not to go again for the quick headline or the quick TV show appearance. Let us be serious about this. This is a chronic and serious problem for a developed nation. It is a problem which, if not properly addressed, condemns a child to another generation of unemployment, alienation, poor health and lower life expectancy. So, while I support the principle of improving school attendance, I so- say, ‘You have got to do much better.'",62
33,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"The concept of mutual obligation is one that the Liberal and National parties are proud to take credit for. We pioneered mutual obligation in the area of employment services-the Job Network-over the opposition of the Labor Party in every case. The introduction of activity requirements and the dole diaries-all of these were measures which were opposed by the Labor Party. Last year, we, the former Howard government, introduced legislation to quarantine the welfare payments of parents who did not ensure their children regularly attended school. So the concept of welfare quarantining is not one we are opposed to; it is one that we introduced-it is one that we support. There is a remarkable lack of consistency in the approach which is taken by the Labor Party on this issue. When we were in government, the Labor Party was quick to criticise our Welfare to Work reforms, which were implemented by the former Howard government. It must be stressed that the measures we put in place were not designed to punish people. Rather, polwe believed very strongly that people should accept personal responsibility. We believe that, if you are supported by the welfare system, you can and should contribute back whatever your level of capacity. When we look at the approach that the Labor Party have taken on this and look at the approach they take to the suspension of welfare payments, there is a double standard. As soon as the government were in, one of the very first actions they took was that the Minister for Employment Participation rushed to write to all employment service providers-all the providers of Job Network and the other employment services-and urged them to go easy on job seekers who did not meet their mutual obligation requirements. So they were urged not to breach people who did not turn up for job interviews, who did not turn up for meetings with their employment service providers or who did not turn up for their work for the dole activities. Before the new government had even completed their review of employment services, before they had even shaped the new employment services that they wanted to operate from 2009 onwards, the Minister for Employment Participation had already signalled that he did not want to see anyone breached, he did not want to see anyone reported and he did not want to see anyone penalised for not meeting their activity requirements. This letter was followed up by a letter from Malisa Golightly from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. It reiterated taking a more lenient approach on those who failed to attend appointments with their employment service provider, failed to attend interviews with potential employers or failed to attend Work for the Dole activities. What this lack of consistency demonstrates is a much wider truth. It is becoming increasingly apparent that Kevin Rudd is very fond of the small picture. Paul Keating was someone who liked to paint on a big canvas. He was the Tom Roberts of the Australian Labor Party. He liked to paint on a canvas. He had the big vision. Kevin Rudd reminds me much more of the guy who gets in the Guinness Book of Records writing the Lord's Prayer 25 times on the back of a postage stamp. This is one of the problems that you have when you just pick up some thought bubbles and try to merge them together. We have the extraordinary thing after nine months where what we see with the Rudd government is that the sum of the parts is less than the whole. We have the left hand of the government not knowing what the right hand is doing. After nine months it is very clear that the government has run out of ideas and has run out of steam. In the area of employment, the suspension of welfare payments for those who fail to meet any of their work obligations has in essence been abolished. But now Labor are saying that they want to adopt this system for parents if their children wag school. The logic of this escapes me. On one hand an adult job seeker who fails to attend an appointment, an interview or a mutual obligation activity on more than three occasions without a reasonable excuse will no longer be penalised; yet, if a child skips school, the parents may incur a non-payment period. We believe that parents are role models for their children. But we also believe that Labor should have a consistent approach to the quarantining or suspending of welfare payments. For whatever reason, the Labor Party are sending different messages to different constituencies. It is a very mixed message. In concluding this speech, I want to make a couple of points about something that very few members of the government have mentioned: we do have, in every state and territory, truancy laws. These laws are not effective but, more importantly, they have not been enforced by the state and territory departments of education. We have information from the Bureau of Statistics that suggests big that nationally there are 20,000 children of school age who are not in school. While we support the principle of this legislation, we have to question how effective, how practical, it will be. We are looking at just one set of payments going to the parent rather than looking at things like the truancy laws and the enforcement of them that is done at a state and territory level. I would say not to expect too much from this legislation. The Minister for Education in her second reading speech, said: It is anticipated that a very small number of ents will have their income support payments suspended and even less, if any, will have their payments cancelled. So we are asked to believe that we will see big changes of behaviour without much of a stick being offered in terms of the welfare payments. The expectation is that we may actually see no-one having their welfare payments cancelled from this. If the legislation does operate in this way, it will be very similar to the state and territory truancy laws that are there. The laws are there and you can see them. They are good laws; they just do not work. They are not effective and they are not enforced. Finally I would just like to say how clear it is that this is one of the problems of running a government by thought bubbles and just waking up one morning and deciding, with the hollow men, what you will come up with for the next media cycle. It does not offer much of a theme for the Rudd government. There is a remarkable lack of consistency in the way they deal with welfare payments and the quarantining and suspension of them.",66
34,Mr IRONS,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"I rise to talk about the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 and its effect on the people of my electorate of Swan. I rise not to oppose the bill but to speak about some of the areas that I have grave doubts about with this legislation. Today the member for Moreton spoke about his union time involved with schools and recognised the member for Canning for his time as a teacher. He seemed to intimate that their involvement with schools gave him and the member for Canning some exclusive rights to talk on this bill. I would let the member for Moreton know that, as a humble parent, I think I also have a right to speak on this bill. The member for Moreton spoke about his parbrother's truancy record. I advise the House that I too have a truancy record. It is not something I am proud of but it gives me a life experience and an ability to comment on this bill. Yesterday in the House the member for Parramatta made a speech about this bill, and I happen to agree with her-I do not favour punitive approaches except as a last resort. But the real issue, as also referred to by the member for Parramatta, is that this is a state issue and the states have sat on their hands and done nothing about this problem for years. In her speech the member for Parramatta said there is already a last resort at state level which is called prosecution. The member went on to state that historically this has not been used. Wouldn't it be simple enough for the COAG to get their collective ‘no blame game' hats on and solve the truancy problem at a state level, as it should be? My colleague the member for Cook remarked in his speech yesterday that this bill is a further measure in the Rudd government's bid to cover the incompetence of the state governments. As honourable members will know, the immediate effect of the bill is the implementation of the school attendance and enrolment pilot. The pilot, commencing from January 2009, will operate in six Northern Territory communities and two metropolitan locations, one of which will be Cannington in Western Australia, part of my electorate of Swan. Under the pilot, all parents who are also income support recipients will be required to notify Centrelink of their child's enrolment at school. State education authorities will be able to notify Centrelink of a child's nonattendance at school. Centrelink will then be able to advise the parent that taking steps to ensure school attendance is a condition of receiving income support. Having not been consulted by the government on this important issue concerning my electorate, my electorate office contacted the Cannington branch of Centrelink for more details on the proposed measure. These hard working Centrelink people, who as a result of Rudd's razor gangs faced significant job cuts this year, helpfully informed my staff that the Cannington scheme will involve Centrelink customers of the Cannington, Victoria Park, Gosnells and Midland branches. Among the schools that could be expected to administer this scheme is Bentley Primary School. Bentley Primary School opened on its current site in 1953. It was once a school of 900 students, with demountable classrooms dominating the landscape. In 1973 the current open area classrooms were built and the administration block established. It was the first school to participate in the school renewal program, and it was decided in 1991 to amalgamate the junior primary and senior primary schools. As a result, the resource centre was built to provide a state-of-the-art computerised library with accompanying art and music rooms. This resource centre, the Shelagh Shannon Resource Centre, acknowledges the outstanding services of Mrs Shannon, who was registrar from 1969 to her retirement in 1991. The original Bentley Junior School buildings were leased to the Islamic community in January 1994. I provide the House with this information not to digress but to demonstrate the importance and the fragility of the services local schools provide. I had the pleasure recently of being invited to Carlisle Primary School to take part in their ‘Kick Around Australia' celebrations. A diverse group of children took part in an extravaganza of kicking, handballing and banner-making fun. In my role as the Director of Junior Development for Perth Demons Football Club in the Western Australian Football League, I appreciate the efforts of the Carlisle Primary School and commend Sports Director Clint MCNerny for his efforts in organising a great day. When I read through Ms Gillard's legislation, I asked myself one simple question: how will this affect the invaluable services that schools provide to the people in my electorate? In the case of Carlisle Primary School, how would the government's legislation specifically affect their capacity to organise such events as I just spoke about? This is a question I shall come back to. Before examining the bill before the House in detail it is important to consider the Western Australian state government's response to truancy. The Carpenter government's response to this issue extends to funds being provided to each district education office to develop a retention and participation plan. The plans must include processes for identifying and profiling the district's alienated student population, prevention strategies for each phase of schooling, intervention strategies for those students identified as alienated, strategies to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes for these students, and interagency collaboration. SMS technology has been introduced to enable schools to alert parents about their children's absence from school. However, there are reports that the technology is not working and that only a few schools are using it. I refer honourable members to an article by Y Phillips and J Strut ‘Schools wag SMS' in the West Australian of 14 June 2008. There have not been any prosecutions for nonenrolment or nonattendance since the School Education Act 1999 came into effect in 2000. This hands-off approach by the state Labor government is inexcusable. As always, when a state government fails-which is a frequent occurrence in Western Australia-it is up to the federal government to make up for the shortfall. In this context, it is appropriate to make my first point on the bill. I restate the fact that the states have always had responsibility for school attendance. The principle of compulsory education and the requirement that schoolchildren be enrolled in and attend school, registered for home schooling or eligible for exception is ensconced in state and territory education legisvacy lation. What have the states been doing? I have recently made speeches in this House about the homelessness crisis in my electorate and about the growing violence around public transport nodes. These are both state issues looked after by HomesWest and the police department. Will the Rudd government step in and take over these state issues as well? When will the federal government in the new environment of supposed COAG cooperation ensure that the states are accountable for education and its integrity? How long must the people of Western Australia and Swan continue to suffer while we wait for some responsibility to be taken? I draw the attention of the House to the fact that this policy seems to ignore the recommendations of widely accepted research. According to US analysis of the research into effective truancy prevention and intervention, those approaches that have ‘solid research evidence for their effectiveness' are intensive ongoing interventions involving well-defined attendance policies, parental engagement, family counselling, individualised plans, a team approach, trained school staff and ongoing evaluation. There is no mention here of extreme policies that take money away from vulnerable families. Indeed, the same analysis actually singles out financial sanctions against families and tying benefits to children's school attendance programs as ‘not having an impact on truancy'. Evaluations of US school attendance programs found that case management, not sanctions, was the most important attribute of successful programs. Given the convincing nature of this research, I find it remarkable that this Rudd Labor government has chosen a big-stick option. Additionally, I am not convinced that in putting this legislation before the House the government has thought through the implications of the PriAct. To place such a burden on schools such as Carlisle Primary School would inevitably lead to resources being diverted away from events like Kick Around Australia Day and towards Rudd red tape. I note the member for Warringah's important contribution to this debate yesterday. The vital question he posed on privacy, which was summarily dismissed with carefree abandon by the member for Bennelong, has yet to be properly addressed. I repeat his question: will Centrelink have to provide all schools with details of those living on welfare? I also ask: will the principal of each school want to provide information on his students and their parents to Centrelink not only as a privacy issue but also as a social issue? Families have to be able to trust their teachers and principals and this legislation will drive a wedge into that trust. The feedback I get from teachers and principals in my electorate is that they do not want to be responsible for running a government stunt. The government knows the legislation proposed is unworkable. The Tasmanian government has already indicated that. This boils down to another example of government grandstanding to catch media headlines. Given the points I have made, I object to the district of Cannington in my electorate being used as a trial site. Why does the minister not run this pilot program in her own electorate? That way she could keep a close eye on it. Given all these problems and unanswered questions, it was not surprising to read a report in the Age on 26 August that federal Labor backbenchers were angry about the welfare policy announcement. Apparently most of the 18 members who spoke either opposed or expressed concern about the bill. The Deputy Prime Minister noted recently in her second reading speech on the bill that up to 20,000 Australian children of compulsory school age may not be enrolled in school. Something should be done to address this issue, but the flawed nature of the bill as it currently stands means that it needs the closer scrutiny of a Senate committee. I agree that all children have a right to an education and it is the prime responsibility of their parents to avail themselves of the opportunities provided by the states and their education systems, no matter how run down they are. This is an on-ground issue which cannot be controlled from Canberra but which needs the lazy Labor states to ensure there is a cooperative attitude amongst parents of children and the education system in each state. In my role as the Director of Junior Development at the Perth Football Club I see what it takes for children in my district to improve their levels of competency in sport. There is no tricky scientific solution. The children who develop the quickest are the ones who have parents who are involved in their lives and who take seriously the responsibility of bringing up their children. It certainly is not punitive, last-resort stunts. I will support this bill because its intent honourable and correct, but I believe the process is wrong. When the lazy state governments pick the ball up and encourage people to take their children to school under any circumstances with programs that make it easy for the parents who struggle with the concept of educating their children, then we will see some real results. In my electorate a group of self-motivated volunteers have started a breakfast program at a primary school and, as a result, attendance at the school has increased. I applaud this simple and pragmatic program. Where was the state government when the program started? It was nowhere to be seen. It was done by the community and the champions of our society-volunteers. It was achieved by the efforts of people who really want to see the children of our communities at school where they should be with a non-punitive program. In closing, I urge the government to look closely at the effects and results of this pilot scheme and ensure it has the will and flexibility to implement necessary changes that will surely arise.",68
35,Mr BILSON,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"I rise this afternoon to say that the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 before the parliament seems like a good idea because it is a good idea that has been discussed in this parliament before. For that reason, I am not opposing the bill. I am querying, though, the bona fides of the government in bringing this bill to the parliament. It does represent a leopard changing its spots and I think the Australian public have a right to be, at best, curious but, at worse, deeply suspicious about this legislation. This initiative-if I can call it an initiative-seems to have had many announcements but not a whole lot of action or focus on implementation of the ideas it seeks to embrace, so I just wonder whether it is more of the politics of is the stunt and the set piece event rather than the policies of sound government. It is very much in the government's court to prove that it is fair dinkum about this and to back up the legislation that we are debating today with a concrete plan of action and some bona fides on the measures that it plans to put in place and to provide some justification to this parliament and to the Australian public about why this enormous change of heart when measures of this kind have been stridently opposed by the Australian Labor Party time and time again. That is the context in which I make my remarks. The bill itself aims to introduce conditions on the receipt of income support payments whereby parents are obliged to ensure their children of compulsory school age are enrolled in school and that those parents are taking responsible action to ensure regular school attendance. The bill provides the mechanism to suspend or cancel welfare payments of parents who are considered negligent in this role, and previous speakers have discussed some of the practical implementation issues of how those judgements will be made, who in fact will make those judgements and, when a conclusion has been arrived at that someone has been negligent in this role, what happens when they take adequate steps to no longer be negligent in those responsibilities. I certainly recognise an added burden that will be placed on school councils, on parents and particularly on cipals that might find themselves involved in this regime that seems to be very broadly outlined with a crayon in this legislation. The Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 goes further than a bill that was introduced and passed by the parliament in the term of the Howard government. The previous government's legislation permitted welfare payments to be quarantined in the event of bad behaviour by welfare recipients, such as not sending their to school or so neglecting their children that they were brought to the attention of the child protection authority. It is not easy to determine how many children of compulsory school age are not actually attending school. Some place a conservative estimate at around 20,000 Australian children of compulsory school age who are not enrolled to attend school, but the data that is available-collected and published in New South Wales and Victoria-is that, on any given day, 10 per cent of the student population may not be there. If those figures are accurate and give a reasonable picture of the overall situation, we could be looking at 200,000 school age children not attending school on any one day. This is a staggering figure and it does not really capture the issue of irregular attendance-that is a more complex thing to draw out-but, in referring to those statistics collected and published by New South Wales and Victoria, it does raise the point that other speakers have raised: isn't this what state governments are supposed to be doing? Aren't enforcing truancy laws and the responsibility of jurisdictions to see that children of compulsory school age are attending school things that the states and territories do? Most people would nod their head and say: ‘Yes, it is,' yet from what you hear in many of the contributions in this place, particularly from the government prin- members advocating this measure, you would not think there was such a thing as a state and territory government or that there are responsibilities that those jurisdictions are charged with discharging. This is an interesting context: what are the responsibilities on those state and territory jurisdictions to carry out their roles and responsibilities? If the Rudd government were consistent-heaven forbid-would you see a reduction in payments to the states and territories if they do not carry out their roles? kids That would be analogous to what is being done here in relation to parents, but of course you do not hear that, because that is not what this bill is about. This is not about ensuring that those with responsibilities carry out their role; this is about something else. You have heard people talk about the need for the Rudd government to look like it is serious about these things. We have the announcement but not the action plan, not the implementation agenda and not the evaluation framework to see whether this is actually working or not. We look at some of the work that has been done in this area. In his paper to the Learning Choice Expo, Graeme Withers, a senior research fellow at the Australian Council for Education Research, suggested that there are many key reasons for unauthorised nonattendance at school, and these reasons ring true with, I think, the experience of anyone who has had an involvement with school age children. Issues include family relationships; family values and the emphasis placed on school attendance and the value of education as a platform for future opportunities; ethnic values; excessive home responsibilities; peer pressure amongst friends and, dare I say, amongst enemies where children are frightened or bullied into seeing nonattendance at school as an option in dealing with challenges that they are facing in the school enviways ronment itself; strong attachment to friends or siblings that might have lost their way; poor reading skills and therefore an inability to engage in the curriculum and to benefit from the learning that is available; anxiety about course deadlines-a no-show because there is work due; fear of bullying, which I have touched on; maybe dislike of particular lessons or units that they are studying or even of some of the teachers; and maybe a feeling of being disengaged because of perceived irrelevance of the curriculum. I am quite familiar with that challenge, having been a former secondary school council president. Our mission was to offer an engaging learning environment for our secondary school age kids in the school community for which I was responsible for a period of time. We would offer a rich range of course opportunities that the young people would see as valuable, as engaging, as worthwhile and as connected to future opportunities, and we would make that effort to piece that story together-that participation and commitment to education at secondary school meant a whole lot of opportunities in future life. We made that our goal and saw very encouraging improvements in attendance and also in passion and enthusiasm. Engaging learning is an enabler that says to people, ‘I want to get involved; I can see the benefits of applying myself.' We also recognised that we needed to tell that story to the parents, where households might not have had a parent who finished even their secondary education and the young person might have been getting a message that the value of their education was not as highly prized as we thought it should be. That was part of our work. Withers believed there was no such thing as the typical early school leaver or truant and that there were a whole range of reasons for that kind of behaviour. States have alhad that responsibility for school attendance, with legislative requirements in place that school-age children must be enrolled in and attend school. That should be implemented and governed by state governments. Where is the collaboration that is needed to make this work? Where is the effort that was made by the Howard government in putting together a collaborative and cooperative approach to tackling truancy, notwithstanding the at times less than full commitment and assistance of state and territory governments, mainly of the Labor persuasion? The policies and programs that need to be talked about to support this crayon drawing of a headline of a piece of legislation are what is going on in those schools and what is happening with school-age people during working hours. It is interesting that we are focusing on those receiving welfare payments. My experience is that some of those families whose primary source of income is welfare payments are the most committed, the most available and the most engaged in the school community. They are the parents involved in looking after the canteen and helping with reading recovery programs. They are always there and can be relied upon for a school excursion or a sports day. Because this measure targets those on income support, the inference is-and I imagine that this is the government's argument-that there is somehow a correlation between households relying on income support and school nonattendance. I do not think that is convincing. I do not think it reflects reality, and it certainly overlooks some of the experience that I have been exposed to in an outer metropolitan community where parents may have considerably long commutes to work-the latchkey kid phenomenon-and might not actually know about the school attendance of their children. That puts a different light on things and leads you to ask: what else is going on to address this range of problems-none of which are common or consistent and for none of which a single reason can be pointed to-that Graeme Withers talked about? Where are those broad initiatives to make sure school is engaging and that support is there for young people to attend? Where is the counselling and mediation, if that is required? Where is there some recognition of a need for exemptions around distance eduction and other options? So this is an interesting bill. I suppose a headline bill because that seems to be what it aims to achieve-getting headlines. Why else would you announce it three times? You would get on with it, you would put together a comprehensive package and you would talk about what you are doing to implement and support the idea behind it. The idea is not one that this parliament is unfamiliar with. The coalition's truancy initiatives, borne out of the July 2006 COAG agenda, agreed that jurisdictions would work together to address school attendance in Indigenous communities. Mr Bowen interjecting",71
36,Mr BILSON,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"The member opposite says that it was all talk. Well, it was full of Labor state and territory Premiers. I wonder whether they are now feeling more inclined to do things of little substance and dubious consequence but high potential for harm when there was a more comprehensive program in place and we saw state and territory Labor ministers there for largely ornamental value. That seems to be something that is being developed very quickly by this government. In April 2007 the meeting of the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs also agreed on the attendanceMs Macklin interjecting",74
37,Mr BILSON,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"It is interesting, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I have two hecklers across the table and you are doing a stealthlike job influencing the behaviour of your colleagues",74
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,The member should be allowed to continue his speech without interruption,74
39,Mr BILSON,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"and I thank you for your help! Had they been listening or been in the it is chamber hearing the thoughtful contributions of many of my colleagues, they would know clearly what our position is. That April 2007 meeting of the ministerial council agreed to get attendance data reported to the National Student Attendance Unit. Ministers also agreed to establish a process to enable the sharing of enrolment information among states and territories, particularly South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, to address absenteeism in Aboriginal homelands resulting from the movement of families between communities in the area. Those were the plans put in place by the Howard government, which was committed to achieving those goals. That is why the opposition is not opposing this bill, but, as I said, one is entitled to be extremely dubious about the motive behind it, given its announcement has taken up more energy than putting in place an implementation program. In closing, it is interestingMs Macklin interjecting",74
40,Mr BILSON,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"I am grateful that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is here heckling me during this debate. She might actually want to do something about an issue relating to children at risk and children at risk funding. I have been contacted by the directors of the Kids Paradise Child Care Centre and by families in the community that I represent who are very concerned about a family with three children that is under great stress. Two of the children attending that childcare centre found themselves needing to be removed from their mother and placed in foster care. Had these children been assigned to a selfless family to receive that foster care, they would have continued to receive children at risk funding and the financial support of the Commonwealth. Instead, those children are being cared for by their grandparents. Those grandparents, who are not at all wealthy, who are in need of the support that would have otherwise been available had they been foster carers, are denied that support. These children have been provided with a loving and caring household in a reasonably familiar family environment. Under the current regime that the minister at the table is overseeing, that family, those grandparents, are denied the very support that would help them in their role of caring for those children at risk. I am hopeful that she will turn her mind and focus in on that issue rather than playing the blame game. I have written to her about itMs Macklin-And in 12 years you did what?",75
41,Mr BILSON,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"and I would be grateful if she would-obviously not now but in a more thoughtful, reflective moment-put her mind and energy to the substance of that concern, and then she would be in a position to do something to support children at risk. That would be a pretty worthwhile use of your time, I believe, Minister.",75
42,Mr ROBERT,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"Fadden) (1.14 pm)Whilst not rising to oppose the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 I do seek to raise a range of significant concerns I have with the bill. Primarily, the bill seems to lack any degree of substance or indeed concern. One could even go as far as to say that the bill is somewhat of a charade, that it was announced in the media to take the focus off a declining economy, perhaps. Not even Labor revisionists-and indeed the Labor storytellers-could spin some of this. Growth figures for the previous quarter announced yesterday of 0.3 per cent compared to 0.7 per cent the quarter before is something that a bill like this cannot cover up. New South Wales growth was in negative territory at minus 0.1 per cent. The Labor caucus did not even know this bill was coming up. The majority of Labor members of parliament found out about this bill-and I assume this includes you, Mr Deputy Speaker Bevis-through the media when the spinmeisters put it through. When caucus met, 38 speakers lined up to speak on the bill-35 against and three for. The Labor members did not even know the bill was coming. They heard about it in the media and the majority disagree with it. This is the genesis of this bill that this government seek to bring forward-a bill that is disingenuous, a bill that is designed to hide an economy that is going downhill because of a lack of confidence of Australian people in the Treasurer and, indeed, the Rudd Labor government. Furthermore, the bill is steeped in duplicity. It seeks to force parents to make children go to school and then to punitively punish them if the kids do not go. Yet the Minister for Employment Participation has previously written to the Job Network providers and to Centrelink saying: ‘Go soft and have compassion on those looking for work. Go soft and have compassion on those who are seeking work for the dole and those responsible for mutual obligation.' The government released the new employment services discussion paper on 16 May 2008 which said that negligent job seekers on the dole would not face automatic suspension after three strikes; rather they would be referred to comprehensive assessment. Furthermore, on 16 May the Age reported that the minister said, ‘We are not going to allow children to be affected adversely because of a breach by a parent.' In the workplace participation area, we have a minister saying: ‘Don't go hard on the parents if they do not want to go to work. It's right; they do not have to go to work. Show compassion. We are not going to allow children to be adversely affected because of a breach by a parent.' But on the other hand, in a hypocritical and duplicitous manner, the government say about the same parent: ‘It's all right if you don't go to work. We don't want to adversely affect your kids. But, if the kids don't want to go to school, we're going to punish the entire family by taking away welfare payments.' The duplicity is outstanding even for this ‘hollow man' government. In the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Act 2007, the Howard government said it permitted welfare payments to be quarantined in the event of bad behaviour by welfare recipients-that is, not sending their children to school or neglecting them. This struck the right balance. There was no need for any further act of parliament. This again reinforces that the only reason a government would bring this to the parliament without telling any of their Labor members, and letting them find out about it in the news, is that it is a charade. It is an act to cover an economy that is slowly going downhill because of an incompetent front-bench. This bill goes to quarantine, suspend and potentially cancel welfare payments to those parents who apparently do not properly do their job. It is not a problem if the parent does not want to get a job-no drama at all-but if they do not do their job at home the family will be punished. I think the average Australian can work out their hypocrisy in that. The cancelling of welfare payments includes, of all things, social security pensions, social security benefits, service pensions and income support payments but does not adversely affect family tax payments. So this government is happy to say to veterans, ‘You can do everything you can to help your kids all go to school, but if they don't go we're going to hit your service pension.' The hide of this government to look men and women in the face who have faced bullets and war and danger and suffering, and say, ‘We're going to take the pension away because your child doesn't want to go to school'-without offering a range of incentives, support and help, they are going to say that to veterans. But I guess this is in line with what this Labor government put through in the budget-it took away $110 million of veterans entitlement. I guess they are consistent in their seeming dislike for veterans. I agree with the government that bad behaviour should have consequencesMr Bowen interjecting",75
43,Mr ROBERT,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"as the Assistant Treasurer nods his head. Bad behaviour should have consequences. However, the Labor ‘nanny state' should not be telling families how to raise children. It should be following the previous Howard line to permit welfare payments to be quarantined in the event of poor behaviour by welfare recipients. This bill is rushed, and anything rushed that has not been thought through will have unintended consequences. The unintended consequence of this bill is that it will be completely, utterly and totally ineffective. Punitive actions are not always the best responses. That is difficult, I know, for a party controlled by unions to understand. Punitive actions do not always work. Some argue that you catch more bees with honey than, indeed, with vinegar. This bill lacks a range of support measures needed to attract kids to school. Some schools are doing things like providing free breakfasts for kids from families where they are not getting fed, providing a range of extra support and tuition, and offering a range of activities that connect more with the culture of the day. These things are appropriate and relevant. The bill singles out needy families for punishment. If you are a wealthy family and your kids are going to school, ‘We're not going to do anything,' says the Rudd government. But, if you are hurting, if you are needy, if you require support, ‘We're going to kick you so hard in the guts, it will give you a nosebleed'-that is what this legislation says. For a party that stands up here and purports to represent working families, this an appalling piece of legislation that has not been thought through. Firstly, this is a state responsibility. The two ministers at the table should understand by now that this is a state responsibility. There comes a time when the federal government has got to stop bailing the Labor states out-difficult, I know, for a government that is putting aside $40 billion in slush funds to help their Labor mates out. But this is a state responsibility. The Courier Mail reported on 7 April that in my home state of Queensland hundreds of Queensland students are skipping classes undetected and are not even enrolled in school. Yet only one parent was prosecuted in 2007 for failing to ensure their child attended school. The parent pleaded guilty but no conviction was recorded and they were placed on a six-month good behaviour bond. Minister Welford, the education minister for Queensland schools, said that a system was in place which involved phoning parents and holding meetings with them to ensure their children returned to school. Yet a report the Labor state government of Queensland refused to release actually showed that 800 students at Logan High School alone were absent for a third of the school year. Education minister Welford also admitted there was a problem. The government believes that taking all of the parent's money is one of the answers. Labor is looking to remove, at its worse, the funding from 800 families in Logan, one of the most socially disadvantaged areas between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. I believe it is held by the member for Rankin-has anybody told the member for Rankin that the parliament is looking at passing legislation that will take away the very support that 800 families in one of the most socially disadvantaged areas of Logan need? Has the member is for Rankin been told that 800 families will be suddenly thrust onto the poverty line if this continues, based on current statistics? Minister Welford, whilst admitting there was a problem, said that prosecuting parents was not the answer to combating the truancy problem. Has anybody told Minister Welford that, apparently, the Rudd government is actually going to take away their very means for survival? Based on this, and based on the comments that Minister Welford has made, I doubt very much whether the states are likely to agree to the collection of data. Minister Welford would not even release this report on truancy. The Courier Mail had to uncover it through the ways and means that the press gallery is used to. He would not even be upfront with the people of Queensland to say that these are the problems with truancy and kids not going to school. He was not even willing to engage the people of Queensland in a discussion on the issue. It is farcicalalmost comical-to think he is happy to engage with this Labor government to publish these figures and to remove welfare payments. On the data right now, 800 families in Logan, one of the most socially disadvantaged areas in South-East Queensland, would have their payments removed. Considering that, I doubt whether schools are likely to report. Why would schoolteachers and school principals start reporting to Centrelink when they do not think they ought to report that data to their own head offices-and which their head offices have shown they are not willing to report to the people of the state? Why would they report this data when the consequences of that reporting would mean the family about which they are reporting would be totally without income? Many of these schools are running programs like providing breakfasts, extra tuition assistance, and phoning parents and other siblings to find out where schoolkids are. They are running these programs because teachers genuinely care about the children. Why would a teacher, who has gone out of their way to run a range of programs, who genuinely cares about children, make that phone call that would see that child's family thrust into impoverishment? What will the schools in Logan do? What will they do about 800 families with children who have missed a third of the year? If the two ministers opposite think those schools will call Centrelink and say, ‘You know what? Eight hundred children from the most disadvantaged homes in the state are not coming to school. The best thing we can do is knock out all their money-that will get the kids to school,' then I think they are on a planet different to mine. The final point to consider is: as this government moves to punish a family for the failure of one child, what will the impact be on the other siblings? Let us take a hypothetical situation of mum, dad and three kids, with two children working their guts out and mum choosing to stay at home to take care of the kids. There is little support from the government-this government believes in supporting mums who go out to work with a 50 per cent childcare rebate; but if you want to stay at home and take care of the kids, there is nothing in that respect. Dad is out working, mum stays at home, there are three kids, data and they are doing it tough with the mortgage. One of the children does not want to go to school, not matter what assistance, love, care or support is provided-and it is reported to Centrelink. There are two children busting their guts at school-studying hard with a vision for what they want their lives to be, a plan for how they see their futures-but one of their brothers just does not connect with the schooling system. It goes to Centrelink, and Centrelink speaks to the family resulting in 28 days and a range of things in place. The kid still does not want to play. Suddenly this legislation will take away the entire family's income. It will punitively push the two siblings that are busting their guts onto the poverty line because of one other sibling. And you have the hide to look me in the eye and say that you know what it is to be a working family, and to stand up for working families. This bill is a charade-it is a disgrace. It is an absolute cover-up for an economy that is hurting. This bill will be so ineffective and will not achieve anything because the reporting will not be in place, the states will not play, Centrelink will not play and the schools will not play. We will not oppose the bill cause Labor needs to understand the consequences of their own poor legislation. It is not the coalition's responsibility to save a rudderless Rudd government from itself. Minister, it is not my responsibility to save you from your own decision-making and from your own poorly, rushed-through judgements. It is up to you to save you from yourself; it is up to you to face the consequences of moribund legislation. This bill needs to be referred to a Senate committee. It needs an enormous amount of scrutiny because that scrutiny has not occurred. The Labor caucus was not informed. No-one on the Labor Party back benches knew about it. It was announced in typical Prime Minister Rudd style to catch a media headline without thinking it through. I only hope a Senate committee will go through it, point out the range of egregious errors of judgement that the bill is predicated on and seek to bring back to the House a bill that makes a lot more sense and is in the nation's greater interest.",76
44,Ms MACKLIN,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (1.29 pm)-I thank the House for the opportunity to sum up the second reading debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 following its introduction by the Minister for Education. For the benefit of the member for Fadden, who has just spoken, I reassure him that most of what he said is wrong and I will go through all the details that in my summing up remarks so that he can correct the record when he is speaking to his constituents. The same applies to the member for Dunkley. I thought it was unfortunate that he finished his remarks on a very personal case which related to some people in his electorate who very much deserve our support. I can respond here-and, of course, beI will respond in writing as well-by saying that he would be aware, because the rules for grandparents have been in place all the time that he has been in the parliament, that people who are on an income support pension can receive the grandparent childcare benefit which pays the gap in childcare costs. Grandparents also receive all the family tax benefits for the child if they are assuming the care of the child. These are very difficult issues faced by grandparents who have the task of taking on the care of their children. I think it is appropriate that these matters be dealt with in a much more sensitive manner than the member for Dunkley chose to do. The bill represents a very significant step in the government's broader agenda to reform the welfare system to make sure that we provide the support that families need and to protect vulnerable children. This bill is all about giving effect to measures that were actually announced in the 2008-09 budget under a $17.6 million package of welfare reform initiatives, with this bill enabling implementation of the improving school enrolment and attendance through welfare reform measure. Under the initiative, parents in the trial sites who receive income support will need to give Centrelink evidence that their children are enrolled in school. This will be a condition of receiving the welfare payment. If a school reports that a student is not regularly attending school, that student's parents may have their income support payments temporarily suspended if they do not take reasonable steps to engage of with the school and the school continues to be dissatisfied with the child's attendance. The bill gives legislative authority for the trials of these measures. In both June and July I announced the locations of the trial sites in the Northern Territory and in the suburbs around Cannington. Another trial site in another metropolitan area is also under consideration. We expect that these trial sites across Australia will cover around 3,300 children. Without this legislation, these trials would not be able to proceed. If the trials are successful in getting children to school and keeping them in the classroom, the legislation will allow, after a proper evaluation, for the rollout of the policy to other areas. It has been estimated that around 20,000 Australian children of compulsory school age may not be enrolled or regularly attending school. Many more are not attending school regularly enough to meet any reasonable benchmark. The government's view is that we have to explore every single avenue available to us to fix this problem. I think it is important that we remember that each and every one of these 20,000 children will have their life opportunities constrained or diminished as a result of not going to school. Part of the way to fix that is to find ways of encouraging greater parental responsibility so that parents are making clear their expectation that their children will go to school. This is a very important part of our childcentred approach to family policy. We are taking a number of other initiatives in our efforts to make sure that we support disadvantaged families, including the development for the first time of a national child protection framework, our early childhood development agenda, a national plan to reduce violence against women and children, and our homelessness strategy. We have a number of very significant initiatives aimed at making sure that disadvantaged children in particular grow up in happier and healthier families. These strategies are all about making sure we improve support for families. Consistent with this, we as a government have a responsibility to make sure that the money that is made available from the Commonwealth to families-in this case, welfare payments-is put to the use for which it was intended: that is, to help families provide a safe and supportive environment to raise children. That is why in the 2008-09 budget we had a package of welfare payment reforms designed to assess a range of different approaches to improve the quality of care provided by disadvantaged families to children. I just touch on a few of them. Firstly, there is the approach to income management in prescribed communities in the Northern Territory. That will cost more than $63 million in this year alone. Secondly, we have an agreement with the Western Australian government to implement the income management for child protection measure, under which the Western Australian government department for child protection can refer parents who neglect their children to Centrelink for income management of a portion of their payments. That will cost $16.9 million this financial year. Thirdly, we are supporting the introduction of the Cape York welfare reform trials, where welfare payments can be linked to meeting parental and community responsibilities. That will cost $12.6 million this financial year. The legislation before the House asks that parents meet a basic responsibility that each and every one of us as parents has-to take reasonable steps to make sure that their children are enrolled in and attending school on a regular basis. It does not of course require that children never miss a day of school. Of course we understand that children get sick. We also understand that some children have unsatisfactory school attendance despite the best efforts of their parents. But we do think it is reasonable to require that parents work with the school and education authorities for the benefit of their children. There is another correction I need to make to comments made by those opposite: the bill does not change the balance of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. Like the child protection measures that we have put in place in trials in Western Australia and in Cape York in Queensland, this bill involves the Commonwealth working in partnership with our state colleagues, each of us using the tools and powers that we have as governments to try and achieve positive outcomes for our children. This government will be introducing this initiative-I gather with the support of the opposition, even though they made a lot of noise along the way. We will be evaluating the initiative along with other welfare reform initiatives, and we will use this evidence to shape our further policy development and implementation. This is a trial. We know that there are at least 20,000 children either not enrolled at or not attending school, and it is important that we try new approaches and use all of the tools available to us to get those kids to school. We know that issues such as poor school attendance and child neglect do not generally occur in isolation either. There are very strong links between disengagement from school, childhood neglect and other social exclusion factors that come from homelessness, drug and alcohol issues and joblessness. All of these issues together can be helped by this measure. Some critics have argued that the welfare payment reform approach is paternalistic or punitive. I actually see it quite differently. Given the adverse and lifelong consequences of non-attendance at school, I think that we, all of us in this parliament, have a responsibility to use and evaluate the full range of tools that we have at our disposal to improve the life chances of Australian children. There are a number of misapprehensions about this initiative that have appeared in the debate in the parliament and also in the media. I just want to go through some of them to clarify these issues. First of all, parents will not lose payments where they cannot, after all their best efforts, control their child's behaviour. This legislation is quite clear that parents should take reasonable steps to ensure their child is enrolled at and attending school. If, despite these steps, a child persists in truanting, this will not affect a parent's payment. We certainly recognise that, especially as children get older, no matter how hard some parents try, they just cannot get all of their children to school. So if parents are trying their best and if they are doing everything they possibly can that is reasonable to get their kids to school, this measure will not apply to them. The measure does allow schools who are having difficulty engaging with parents to ask Centrelink to remind parents that they have an obligation to make sure that their children go to school. If parents continue to ignore both the school and Centrelink then normal Centrelink procedures, including payment suspension, will apply. I think this is the other thing that many commentators, including members opposite, do not seem to recognise. It is normal, current Centrelink practice-which existed all through the time of the Howard government as well-that if an income support customer repeatedly fails to engage with Centrelink then their payments can be temporarily suspended for up to 13 weeks. They are the rules now and they were the rules under the previous government; they are rules that are necessary to make sure that people engage in a proper way with Centrelink. It occurs, for example, when there is no response to requests from Centrelink for information about a person's income or their current address details. Suspension is not the first step; it is the last step. If a family is in this situation, they will be offered case management for support from schools and from Centrelink social workers before any consideration is given to suspension. Another important correction to make is that suspensions are not designed to last for 13 weeks. In most cases, we actually expect that the suspension will only last for a few days until the parents re-engage with Centrelink and their school. This is the way in which the suspension mechanism currently works with Centrelink in the areas that I have already mentioned. Once the reengagement with Centrelink and the school occurs, then full back pay for the days that the parent had refused to engage will be provided. In these cases, parents are plainly not going to lose their benefits. The approach is fundamentally different-and this is also an important correction that needs to be made to comments made by those opposite-to the eight-week non-payment period penalty faced by job seekers not meeting their obligations. I think it is critical that those site get that right. The privacy of parents on income support will also be respected. Schools will not be given a list of families on income support. The details of how the data exchange will operate are being negotiated with the states, but there certainly will not be a wholesale release of data by Centrelink. There were some specific questions asked by the member for Warringah. I want to respond to those. He asked whether or not we are going to be able to implement these measures in the trial sites as we have announced. I can inform the House that preparation for these measures is well underway with both the Northern Territory government and the Western Australian government, and the measures are expected to apply from the beginning of the next school year. Once again to respond to the member for Warringah: there are no savings to the budget. No savings have been factored in because, as I have just indicated, where re-engagement by the parent occurs, full back pay is going to be provided. We do expect that parents will respond and make sure that their children go to school. The member for Warringah wonders whether we have agreement with the respective governments. To respond to his third concern: we have got agreement from the Northern Territory and Western Australian governments. We are in the process of developing protocols in the areas where the trials will take place and developing the protocols for the necessary exchange of information. Any suggestion that that has not taken place is just wrong. It is also critical to make plain that this is not a measure that is targeted at Indigenous children. We recognise that Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in many parts of Australia are not attending school. The trial sites that we have identified in the Cannington district in Perth is in an ordinary suburb in Perth. Even in the communities and towns oppoin the Northern Territory, there is a mixture-Hermannsburg, Wallace Rockhole, Tiwi Islands, the town of Kathryn, Kathryn Town Camps and Wadeye. And, as I mentioned earlier, the final site will also be in a metropolitan area. Some critics have also argued that we should be working on improving schools and providing more support for children who are struggling rather than focusing on increased parental responsibility-as though the approaches in some way are mutually inconsistent. As far as we are concerned we cannot see any reason why we should not be doing both things at once, and we are. Just last week we say saw the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister setting out our next chapter for the education revolution, improving quality teaching in school, measuring school performance, helping our disadvantaged school communities. All of these areas are critical to improve the quality of education across the country. All those things are necessary, but children are not going to get a world-class education if they do not turn up to school. The measures in this bill will ensure that the education revolution actually works for those children who at the moment are either not enrolled to go to school or not attending on a regular basis. Each and every one of them needs to go to school to make sure they get the advantage of the improvement to education that we are putting in place. Welfare conditionality linked to school attendance does work best when combined with other support services-that is absolutely true. That is especially the case with direct case management. The school enrolment and attendance trial will in fact be delivered in this way, with Centrelink and schools working very closely with communities. The trials will operate to trigger specific case management where children are not being supported to attend school. Results in the selected locations will be carefully monitored and evaluated to provide an evidence base for us to go ahead in this area. I do think that the trials will also help us to improve child protection systems. We are all very well aware, each and every one of us, of the very distressing cases of neglect or abuse where children involved were not enrolled to go to school. So linking welfare to enrolling children will actually help make sure that those children do not fall through the cracks. If children are at school they are much more likely to come into contact on a daily basis with their teachers and principals, and with Centrelink. And if those children are being subject to abuse they will have a much greater chance for early intervention or rapid response if the teachers know about it. The government very firmly believes that meeting basic parental responsibilities is a reasonable expectation to place on families receiving welfare payments. We obviously are aware that measures of this kind are controversial but we think they are necessary for a very simple reason: the consequences of not exploring every possible avenue are far too serious to ignore. Financial levers actually work. We have seen that most significantly with the measure the previous government put in place, which I support, where we saw a huge increase in immunisation rates following the introduction of the maternity immunisation allowance and the requirement that parents have their children immunised in order to receive the childcare benefit. So this is what it is all aboutlinking personal responsibility to financial reward. It can change behaviour. That is what these measures are designed to do. Suspension is a last resort but a necessary element of these reforms. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. AUSLINK (NATIONAL LAND TRANSPORT) AMENDMENT BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 August, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",83
46,Mr TRUSS,ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION,"The AusLink (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill 2008 proposes technical amendments to the AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005. The bill's first purpose is to extend the Roads to Recovery program from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2014. Insofar as imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the opposition welcomes the new government's decision to continue yet another effective coalition policy. As a regional member, I know of few government programs more universally popular than Roads to Recovery; it has made such a difference to country roads and urban streets. Roads to Recovery began in November 2000, with a decision by the then coalition government to provide a new support program for local roads of $1.2 billion over five years. Funding was allocated to all councils in receipt of financial assistance grants according to the traditional formula used to distribute Commonwealth road funding to councils. In January 2004, after a review in 2003, the coalition government announced that a further $1.2 billion would be provided over the four years from July 2005 to June 2009; from that date, it became a component of AusLink. This was supplemented in the 2005-06 budget with a bonus $307.5 million payment to provide an extra boost to councils for their roads program in that year. Roads to Recovery has simple administrative arrangements and goes directly to local government. It recognises the virtues of local decision making, allowing councils to implement their own priorities according to their own requirements. I welcome the fact that the government has resisted the ongoing demands of the states to have this funding passed through them or to be administered, no doubt at great cost, by the states. The direct and largely unconditional payment of Roads to Recovery to councils is one of the great strengths of program. The coalition government recognised that much local road infrastructure in Australia was reaching the end of its useful life and its replacement was beyond the capacity of councils. After all, local governments are responsible for 650,000 kilometres of roads, slightly over 80 per cent of Australia's total road length. Roads to Recovery is needed because the states have failed to provide adequate funds to local councils to meet their infrastructure requirements, and their own revenue raising capabilities are constrained. It took a coalition government to provide a practical solution, and it is deplorable that some of the Labor states actually used the Roads to Recovery funding as an excuse to further cut their assistance to local government. So some of the benefits which could have been achieved from this program were whittled away by state governments that were not prepared to honour their responsibilities to also fund some of these key road networks. Under Roads to Recovery, councils have delivered over 25,000 local projects. This amazing figure is testimony to what local communities can do when given the resources to act. The former coalition government remained committed to this program's success, providing $150 million in the first year of its operations in 2000-01 and then lifting that to approximately $300 million by 2006-07. In the recent election year the coalition government raised the amount further, pledging that the program would continue at $350 million per year from 2009-10. I note that the Australian Local Government Association in its last newsletter of Friday 29 August welcomed the minister's decision to continue Roads to Recovery. We too support the government's decision to continue this popular and effective coalition government initiative. the It would be helpful if the Rudd Labor government could encourage its state Labor mates to provide enough funds to support their local governments the way they should. This has been an extraordinarily successful program, and it is great to see that it has now developed a degree of bipartisan support and that the new government is continuing it in the same form as it has served the community over the last five years or more. The second purpose of this bill is to allow certain funds allocated under Roads to Recovery to be preserved in particular states or territories while arrangements can be made to determine the most appropriate entity to receive funds. There are parts of Australia that are not subject to local government jurisdiction. They are unincorporated areas in north-west New South Wales, outback South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. In terms of the provision of roads, these areas are subject to the jurisdiction of the relevant state or territory departments. I also understand that in Western Australia seven per cent of Roads to Recovery funds are provided for special projects, being divided up between bridgeworks and access roads to Indigenous communities. With regard to these cases, it has been necessary to preserve these funds while a suitable authority is found to receive and manage their expenditure. The amendments to this bill provide legislative clarity to this long standing practice. The third purpose of the bill is to amend the definition of ‘road' contained in the act to put beyond doubt that future funding under AusLink may be applied to roadside projects such as rest stops, parking bays and decoupling facilities. The opposition has no problem with this change to the act, as again it gives legislative clarity to what is already occurring. I am puzzled, however, by the comments of the minister in his second reading speech on this issue. The minister said: The bill amends the definition of a road so that it includes heavy vehicle facilities such as rest stops, parking bays, decoupling facilities and electronic monitoring systems. The amendment to ‘road' in the bill, subsection 4(1) after subparagraph (a) (v), reads: ... a facility off the road used by heavy vehicles in connection with travel on the road (for example, a rest area or weigh station); Plainly this amendment has nothing to do with funding electronic monitoring systems. In fact, the act already allows funds under AusLink to be expended for such purposes. Section 30 of the act, entitled ‘What projects are eligible for approval', states: A project is eligible for approval as an AusLink Transport Development and Innovation Project if the project is for either or both of the following: (a) planning, research, investigations, studies or analysis of matters related to the present or future development or usage of the National Land Transport Network; (b) research or development related to technology or practices that will, or may, be used in connection with transport operations on the National Land Transport Network. So I conclude from my reading of the act that the legislation already permits expenditure of funds for the purposes cited by the minister. I am left with the conclusion either that the minister has simply been careless and sloppy in his second reading speech or that the bill before the House is in fact silent on the electronic monitoring systems. I would also welcome the minister's clarification of the heavy vehicle safety and productivity package. The minister's media release said that the $70 million package was to fund ‘trials of technologies that electronically monitor a truck driver's work hours and vehicle speed-one using an on board ‘black box' or electronic log and one which makes use of the global positioning system'. The second reading speech makes no mention that this initiative is to be a trial. Likewise, from the section of the act that I read out, it seems clear that such projects are authorised only on the basis of planning, research, investigation and studies. So I would be grateful if the minister in his response to these remarks, whenever that might happen, in a week or two's time, could reassure me that the funding package is, as he stated in February, for a trial only. There are other elements of the minister's second reading speech which require clarification. It was poorly worded, but it outlines government policy on the heavy vehicle safety and productivity package. This policy is apparently one of blackmail.",83

49,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence. Could the minister please update the House on the status of the nine Australian soldiers wounded in Afghanistan and the overall status of operations on behalf of Australia?,86
50,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition not only for the question but for the concern he has expressed over our soldiers and the bipartisan support we constantly receive from the opposition on matters operational, particularly in Afghanistan. Yesterday the Prime Minister confirmed that on Tuesday night, our time, nine Australian special forces soldiers were wounded while on operations in Afghanistan. The question from the Leader of the Opposition gives me an opportunity to provide the House with an update on their condition and their progress. I am pleased to be able to say that our most critically wounded soldier made it through the night and has been sufficiently stabilised for transport to Germany, where he will receive the sort of expert care suitable for his needs. However, he is not out of danger, and I ask all members and indeed all Australians to keep him in their thoughts and in their prayers. I can also report that overnight the number of soldiers on the serious list fell from five to three, so that is more slightly good news. Those three soldiers remain in a serious condition, however. They have been stabilised and remain under care in coalition medical facilities in Afghanistan. The remaining five soldiers are in the hands of those who provide excellent care on base in Tarin Kowt. The incident which led to these casualties is a reminder of the dangers faced by the men and women of the ADF on a daily basis. They put their lives on the line for others, for all of us. Their work is critical to global security and indeed to Australia's own security, and of course they fight for a better deal for the Afghan people at the request of the democratically elected government of Afghanistan. The work of our troops there is diverse. They are taking the fight to those who want to take Afghanistan back to the dark days of the Taliban regime and those who want to continue to use the country as a breeding ground for terrorists who seek to perpetrate their acts of terror right around the globe, including in our own backyard. Our Reconstruction Task Force continues to build social and economic infrastructure-hospitals, schools, roads and bridges. The events of Tuesday night remind us that Afghanistan remains a dangerous place and that the challenges to the global community there remain enormous. But we must continue to meet those challenges, and we will. I know that is what the six soldiers we have lost in Afghanistan would want us to do, and I am confident that all those who have served in Afghanistan, including those many who have been wounded there, would want us to do that. They know how important our work there is. I conclude by thanking all of them for their service and their sacrifices and by suring them and their families that the Australian people are a very grateful people for the work they do. I also thank in particular the families, including those loved ones who are nervously awaiting the next update on the condition of those injured on Tuesday night. Their sacrifices are also enormous, and too often the emotional pain they feel can be excruciating. Again, I ask all members and indeed the broader Australian community to keep those who are currently under care both in their thoughts and, of course, in their prayers. Economy",86
51,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House why responsible economic management is needed for Australia's future?,87
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Overnight it was confirmed that the economy of the 15 euro zone nations shrank by 0.2 per cent in the June quarter of 2008. It was the first quarterlies on-quarter decline since the data series for the euro zone commenced being collated back in 1995. As the House would know, this comes off the back of negative or zero quarter growth among five of the world's largest economies: Japan, a 0.6 decline; Germany, 0.5; France, 0.3; Italy, 0.3; and the UK, zero. world. By contrast, what we had from the national accounts figures yesterday for Australia was solid growth of 0.3 per cent during the June quarter, 2.7 per cent year on year. As Chris Richardson, of Access Economics, said today, I think, or perhaps it was yesterday: I think it will be a better balance for the economy; business spending up a storm is good news, … That shows business is confident about the future and putting their money where their mouth reasis, and that is better for future growth. I note what CommSec equities economist Savanth Sebastian has said: Australia has delivered another fantastic economic report card given the economic conditions on the global front. What I would say, rather than use those terms, is that Australia is not out of the woods yet. We have a lot of work to do. It is important to be upfront with the Australian people about how difficult the challenges are, particularly off the back of continuing global economic difficulties and off the back of the domestic economic circumstances which the government inherited at the end of last year. Those circumstances, of course, were difficult. As the House has heard many times this week, if the economy has been buffeted by 10 interest rate rises in a row, it does have a cumulative effect on economic confidence and activity. That is just a fact. And if you translate that through, the impact of those 10 interest rate rises in a row for working famiwas a $400-a-month interest rate hike. That is what it represented-real money in the pocket. That is the cumulative impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row under the Liberals, delivering us, by the time the government changed at the end of last year, the second-highest interest rates in the developed The question asked why responsible economic management was necessary, given the challenges which lie ahead. The global factors are those which we have addressed in the parliament during this week, and we are not out of the woods yet in terms of the rollon impact of the global financial crisis. The local factors are those just described, but impact which that continues to have on confidence in the economy, the confidence of business and the confidence of consumers is real. The key challenge, however, is to deliver a responsible program of action. And what we have done on that score is that we have embarked upon a strategy which, first and foremost, delivers responsible economic management of a $22 billion budget surplus, which is now under assault, by those opposite, in the Senate-$22 billion on which they are seeking to conduct a $6 billion to $7 billion raid in the Senate. That is the first plank of responsible economic management. The second is to have a clear-cut national program of economic reform, and that is what the government has embarked upon in terms of the challenges of education, skills and training, to address the skills crisis and skills shortage delivered to this economy by those opposite, having ignored 20 consecutive Reserve Bank warnings. As a consequence of that, the government has embarked upon an education revolution. The Minister for Education, the Deputy Prime Minister, and I have been speaking to that and, most recently, announced the quality education reform agenda, which will be part and parcel of that, to boost the quality of our school education, to boost the quality of our teachers, and to produce an increase in the quality of our education, skills and training outcomes. The third element of our response, of course, is a program of nation building-a $76 billion plan for nation building, which those opposite, again, seem to wish to undermine. And finally, part of our program of responsible economic management-to ensure that those opposite are fully mindful of it-is to ensure that, through the budget, through tax cuts and through what we have done by way of additional payments to pensioners and carers, we are assisting working the families, pensioners and carers on the way through. What I would say to those opposite as we come to the end of the sitting fortnight is to reflect carefully on the impact of their actions in the Senate on this overall economic strategy, because this $6 billion raid on the surplus in the Senate being waged by those opposite is the very definition of economic irresponsibility. We had volume 1½ last night and this morning-depending on who was counting the votes in the Senate last night and who showed up for the vote, and who might have showed up this morning. It is interesting that the Liberals were too busy at their fun-fest over here in the Great Hall of the people to actually make sure that people were going to roll up and vote in the Senate, so committed were they to their course of action. But, on the luxury car tax, I think it is remarkable that, in the first defining vote of the new Senate on a major tax measure before the parliament and the nation, the Liberal Party stands up and says: ‘We the Liberal Party-this party with its eye fixed firmly on the past-are going to say that our first legislative action is to ensure that you can get a cheaper luxury car.' That is what they have done: they have voted for a cheaper luxury car for Australia-saying everything, I believe, about the priorities of those opposite, and how they bleat. Mr Hockey interjecting",87
53,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, Joe: $555 million, which you have chosen to provide to the Porsche drivers of Australia, as opposed to $555 million for the public transport needs of Australia; $555 million for Porsches and $555 million less for public transport; $555 million for Rolls-Royces and $555 million less for urban rail-those are the priorities which those opposite have embraced. Whether it is the luxury car tax or the Medicare levy surcharge-and let us go to this other element of the in-touch Liberal Party of the 21st century. Here we are in this week, where, for the first time in seven years, we have had an interest rate cut for working families, for those who have suffered those 10 interest rate rises in a row, those working families, depending on the size of their mortgage, being benefited to the tune of $600 a year, on the basis of that 25 basis point cut. In the same week that working families get a $600 interest rate cut, the Liberal Party of Australia says that they are going to vote for a $1,200-a-year hike in terms of their taxes, through the measures that they are taking on the Medicare levy surcharge. So the Reserve Bank brings down, for the first time in seven years, an interest rate cut to save working families $600 a year, and the Liberal Party says, ‘We are going to reward you by giving them a $1,200 tax hike this year.'

We know where they now stand on the question of luxury car tax-that is, half a billion dollars for the Porsche drivers but not for those using public transport. We know where they now stand on RTDs-backing the big distillery companies. We know where they now stand on Fuelwatch-backing the big oil companies. We know where they now stand on GROCERYchoice-backing the big supermarket chains-and on the Medicare levy surcharge-backing the big private health insurance companies. It is about time that the Liberal Party stood up for working families instead. We have a clear plan of action, a responsible course of action for the future. I would say to those opposite: why don't you allow working families to get a decent outcome from the votes in the Senate-most particularly on what is happening with the Medicare levy surcharge-and a decent outcome for those who are crying out for action by the national government on urban transport?

79,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, because we do need a very strong surplus in these times of international economic turmoil. International uncertainty demands that we have a strong surplus as a buffer against that global turmoil and also to ensure that the Reserve Bank has room to move when it comes to interest rates and also to put in place critical investments for the future. Of course, the plans that those opposite have to blow a hole in the surplus of $6.2 billion are now well advanced with their actions in the Senate today. We saw how confused they are on the economy yesterday when they could not even organise a raid on the surplus. They could not do that competently yesterday, but today they have rejected the increase in the luxury car tax. In so doing, they have indicated, as the Prime Minister said before, where their priorities lie. Their priorities lie in lower taxes for people who buy luxury cars. That is where their priorities lie. That is where the member for Wentworth's priorities lie. Their priorities do not lie in lower interis est rates for working families. They lie with big oil and they lie with people buying luxury cars. They do not lie with those people who are suffering under the Medicare surcharge levy. They certainly do not lie with working families. They are doing their best to ensure that the rate cut that working families receive this week may not necessarily be put in place again. The Liberal Party's determination to blow a hole in the surplus simply means that interest rates will be higher for longer. That is the consequence of their action in the Senate.

Let me explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition what has happened with the workplace relations system. People saw an avalanche or a tidal wave of extreme industrial relations legislation coming under the former government. Knowing that that extreme legislation was going to be put in place, people rushed to lock in their collective agreements before it took effect. As a result, many collective agreements were locked in at the same time and those collective agreements are now coming up for rebargaining. That bulge of numbers is the logical consequence of people seeking to beat the industrial relations extremism of the former government. Mr Danby-What is the point of order?",92
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the member for Melbourne Ports will allow, I will give the call to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and she will have the opportunity to tell you the point of order.

91,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much. Let me further explain this matter to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The figures clearly show that there are more collective agreements coming up for renegotiation as a result of this lock-in before Work Choices. Listen to the figures. The number of expiring collective agreements in the first half of 2007 was 1,676. The number of expiring collective agreements in the first half of this year is 4,948. Obviously that is a huge lift in the number of collective agreements expiring in this six months and coming up for rebargaining.",92

98,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To further explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition something she clearly does not understand, when collective agreements expire there is a period of bargaining. Even under the extremism of Work Choices, during a period of bargainingMr Dutton- Mr Speaker, on the point of order of relevance, this has nothing to do with the question that was asked. The question was: how much will this cost the economy?",92
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.,93
100,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When agreements expire, even under Work Choices people can engage in protected industrial action as part of the bargaining system. Therefore, the more collective agreements expiring in a time period, the more likely it is that there are people taking protected industrial action. Mr Dutton-On a point of order, this was a very specific question about what the cost of this strike action will be to the Australian economy. She does not have any idea.",93

104,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I again make this simple point because, obviously with the level of disruption from the member for Dickson, I do not believe it was heard: the more collective agreements that are coming up for rebargaining in a period, the more protected industrial action that may be occurring in that period, because the only time in which protected industrial action can be taken is when people are rebargaining for a new agreement. Obviously, you are seeing the evidence of that in the number of collective agreements coming up for rebargaining in the figures. I say to the opposition that under Work Choices you could have protected industrial action.",93

107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, under Work Choices you could take protected industrial action during a bargaining period. I do not know what is being suggested by the opposition here, but I take it that they have in contemplation a workplace relations system even more extreme than Work Choices. Presumably, under that system anybody who took protected action during a bargaining period would somehow be, what, shot? Is that what you want?

108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of to the Opposition will resume her seat.,93
109,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Presumably, we can conclude that, yet again, the opposition stands for something more extreme than Work Choices. These figures show a clustering effect of the number of collective agreements coming up for rebargaining. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spent five minutes analysing the issue, she would understand that. Of course, she is incapable of it. Infrastructure",93

If you actually listened to those opposite and their attitudes towards infrastructure and wards the budget surplus and if you analysed what they did in the Senate, you would think that they had no regard at all for infrastructure. We have heard allegations that these funds are not real, that they are not important and that it does not matter whether we make that long-term infrastructure investment. But, whilst they say that through their spokespeople in the parliament and whilst they act on that in the Senate by undermining the budget surplus, what they do as local members is very different. I have a folder here with 103 submissions from many of the members of the opposition front-bench. Thirty-five coalition MPs have made submissions to me about infrastructure spending-more than half of their front-bench. That indeed is what you would expect local members to do about infrastructure.

The fact is that for 12 long years-and indeed since the election, so for almost 13 years-we have heard those opposite say, ‘Public transport is solely a state responsibility; it has nothing to do with us.' There was no engagement with urban policy and no engagement with cities. We heard it for 12 years-no engagement with public transport. And yet the member for Cowan has written asking for funding for a mass transit solution for Perth's northern suburbs. He asks for funding for buses, for light rail and for rail. Not just thatremember how day after day they said the BAF did not matter and Infrastructure Australia did not matter? Well, they are not just asking; they are pleading. I will read from the member for Cowan's letter. It states, ‘As federal transport minister I implore you to support this proposal through funding from the Infrastructure Australia Fund.' Imploring!

That is what they are asking for. But in the other chamber they are ripping out $6.2 billion. What they need to do is to put the principles that they espouse in this correspondence and the principles that they talk about in their electorates about the importance of infrastructure funding into practice and vote for our measures, vote for the surplus, and support the government's long-term infrastructure agenda.  point of order.

130,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a very serious question that I ask on behalf of working families and I address it to the Prime Minister of this country. Prime Minister, during a recent trip from Cootamundra to the New South Wales coast, I counted more than 70 vehicles for private sale parked on the side of the road. Prime Minister, why are people doing it tough since the election of the Rudd Labor government?",95
131,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. The truth is that working families, pensioners and carers are experiencing great challenges when it comes to cost-of-living pressures. That is the absolute truth. What in practical terms do you do about it? I say this to the member for Hume: what you do not do about it is bring about a set of economic conditions which make it easier for the Reserve Bank to continue to put up interest rates. If you look at the cumulative impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row, what you have is the Liberal's $400 a month interest rate hike that was imposed on working families. That is what those 10 interest rate rises in a row led to. Our response is responsible economic management, which makes it easier for the Reserve Bank to act to bring interest rates down. That is what we have done in the nine months that we have been in office, as demonstrated through the budget that we put through this parliament in May and that was announced by the Treasurer, and which is now, in substantial measure, being threatened in the Senate by the party of those opposite. That is a clear-cut course of action. The second thing that you can do to assist working families under financial pressure is to honour your pre-election commitments on tax cuts, which is what we have done with a $44 billion package to reduce taxes for lowand middle-income earners. The third thing you can do, in practical terms, is to assist families dealing with the cost of child care, which is why we took a commitment to the Australian people to increase the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per centand that was honoured as of 1 July this year. These are practical measures which assist working families balance the budget, given that they are under enormous cost-of-living pressures. I tell you what does not help the challenges faced by working families: the action of the Senate-which I presume the member for Hume is supporting through his party in the Senate-to vote against the government's measures on the Medicare levy surcharge. If you look at the maths of that and how it flows through to families, for a family on a combined family income of, say, $120,000 a year, the measure we are putting forward would save that family $1,200 year-and that means something in the order of $20plus a week. I would suggest to the honourable member for Hume that that is a practical measure, again, where he could help working families under financial pressure. These are the practical actions which a government committed to dealing with these challenges have advocated. I would strongly say to the honourable member: get with the government's program in the Senate-get in particular with the matter which is yet to be voted on, the Medicare levy surcharge, because that is a real potential hit on working families who continue to do it tough in Australia. Education",96
132,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and Social Inclusion. Will the minister please inform the House of the government's progress in delivering its education revolution and how it compares to the legacy of previous governments? Is the minister aware of any risks to Australia's education system?",96
133,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course the government are committed to an education revolution and we are doing that because we want every child in this country to have a worldclass education. I know the members of the opposition are in a sour mood today, because last night they had their big shindiglistening to Memories, The Carnival is Over and Yesterday while having glasses of red wine-and this morning they have woken up a little sore in the head and with a sour taste in their mouths, but if they could just try and concentrate for one moment. While they are living in the past, we are committed to making sure that the children of this country get first-class education in the future. We are committed to overcoming the neglect of more than a decade of the former government-six years of it under the personal administration of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. For a reason best known to themselves, they are all pretending to be characters from Fawlty Towers today. They picked the wrong show; it should have been Seinfeld-a show about nothing! They all would have fitted into that because they did nothing in government. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker: the Howard government released 24 reports on teaching and 76 on school education and it did nothing of substance to make a difference to the quality of education in Australian schools. The Rudd Labor government are getting on with the job of investing in Australian education-our $1.2 billion digital education revolution, our $2.5 billion investment in trades training centres in schools, our $577 million investment in literacy and numeracy, our $534 million investment in early childhood education and our $500 million we have already delivered to Australian universities to help them renew their ageing capital stock because they were bearing the burden of a decade of neglect, six years of it under the personal watch of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. But we want to do more and, in doing more, we have created the Education Investment Fund, an $11 billion fund to renew the capital stock of our universities and our vocational education and training sector. I am asked about the risks to this new fund. The risk to this new fund is the smash-andgrab raid that the Liberal Party has engaged in on the surplus. In pursuit of luxury cars, they are putting at risk our ability to invest in our educational institutions, particularly voa cational and higher education institutions. Mr Tuckey interjecting",97

It would be able to benefit the Curtin University of Technology campus in Geraldton. Presumably, he does not want to see these campuses benefit and that is why he is supporting the smash-and-grab raid on the surplus. Mr Anthony Smith-I thought it was all going to public transport.",97

We want to invest in universities and vocational education and training around this country. The risk to that is the Liberal Party's smash-and-grab raid on the surplus. I say to the Liberal Party: if they are going to continue on this smash-and-grab raid, they should have the decency to ring every vice chancellor and every TAFE director to explain to them why they do not believe their campuses are worth investing in. That is what they are putting at risk by their conduct. Taxation",98
142,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his last answer, where he emphasised the importance of honouring pre-election tax commitments. Given that this budget increased taxes by $20 billion with no electoral mandate, will the Prime Minister guarantee there will be no new taxes in next year's budget?",98
143,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again the Leader of the Opposition puts a question to the parliament based on an entirely false premise-that taxes have increased under this government as a proportion of gross domestic product. The only effective measure of the tax impact on the economy is tax as a proportion of GDP, and tax as a proportion of GDP has gone down this year relative to last year, relative to the year before that, relative to the year before that and relative to the year before that as well. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition study his statistics and work it out. Taxation",98

145,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. Today we have seen the first instalment of the Liberal Party's smash-and-grab raid on the government's surplus in the Senate after bungling it yesterday. That first instalment is highly symbolic, because the Liberal Party are seeking to relieve the tax burden on the purchases of Porsches, Lamborghinis, Ferraris and other such vital modes of transport for ordinary working people. At the same time as they are seeking to relieve the tax burden for purchases of such vehicles, they are also seeking to keep the tax burden for middleincome working families arising from the Medicare levy surcharge-something in the vicinity of $1,000 plus, which the government is seeking to remove and they are seeking to retain. In effect, their message to these working families in that middleto upper middle-income bracket is: ‘Don't worry; it's okay. We will allow you to get a tax break on your next Ferrari or your next Lamborghini.' While they will still have to suffer the Medicare levy surcharge, if they are out buying a Lamborghini, a Ferrari or a Rolls-Royce they will be okay. It is interesting that the member for Hume today had the gall to ask a question about battlers selling cars on the side of the road. It appears to me to be rather odd that the policy response from the Liberal Party on the costof-living challenges facing working people-the first big policy position they put forward in this parliament-is to cut the taxes on luxury cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis. Mr Schultz- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I take exception to making comments in this House on behalf of working people and being denigrated for it by a member on the opposite side of the House.",98
146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,99
147,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good to see, finally, that the opposition have a policy with respect to the cost of living. It is: ‘Let them drive Ferraris!' Given the shambolic performance of the Liberal Party yesterday and the fact that their positions on what they are going to do in the Senate, and indeed on their leadership, have moved around over the past few months, we can be forgiven for not being entirely sure about how this is all going to unfold. I would urge the opposition again to rethink their position. We could actually get a change of heart. But we know that one thing will not change with the Liberal Party, and that is that their core priority is to stand up for the interests of high-income, wealthy Australians. We do not know who their leader is going to be. We have seen over the past few months the member for Higgins appear on the horizon as a would be saviour for the Liberal Party. You can see them huddled in corridors around parliament discussing this-the Messiah is potentially on the horizon for the Liberal Party. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. How could this possibly be relevant to the question asked?",99

169,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his previous answers today and to table 2 in Budget Paper No. 1. I ask the Prime Minister: isn't it a fact that the only reason that tax as a percentage of GDP has declined somewhat is that the government has implemented most, but not all, of the coalition's tax cuts which were set out in the pre-election financial outlook and It does that, if the government had implemented those tax cuts in full and not imposed $19 billion of new taxes in the budget, tax as a percentage of GDP would be lower still?",100
170,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might begin my answer with a continuation of what I thought was a first-class presentation from the finance minister. I will tell you what we were not prepared to commit to in any element of tax reform and that was providing a tax break for those highest income earners in Australia. The minister for finance was absolutely right: how those opposite could have gone to the election last year promising, from memory, $3 billion to $4 billion in tax cuts for those Australians earning north of $180,000 a year strikes me as passing strange. The honourable member asked this other question about what other tax measures we have introduced to provide tax relief to working families. I tell you what else we are introducing: it is called the education tax refund. For the first time in this country's history, we are providingMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. It is a very straightforward question, and the Prime Minister should direct himself to it.",100
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,101
172,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was about tax and what the government has done on tax. We have been absolutely clear cut about honouring our commitments for tax cutssome $44 billion of them-for lowand middle-income earners. Secondly, we have been absolutely clear cut that, when it comes to the use of additional public revenues, we do not believeas those opposite believe-that Porsche drivers need further income tax relief. Those opposite are about to give them a tax break in terms of the luxury car tax. But do those north of 180 grand need an extra $3 billion to $4 billion? I would have thought not. Therefore, what we did with that money-and I say this to the member for Wentworth-is we said to working families, ‘If you are spending money on your kids' education in primary school and high school, you should keep those receipts and then, at the end of the financial year, we will provide you with a tax refund at different levels for both primary school and secondary school students.' It is $750 a year for primary school students and $1,500 a year for secondary school students. That is a measure which, from memory, cost something in the vicinity of $3 billion to $4 billion. We believe that is a very significant measure. For example, if those at home wish to add to the digital revolution occurring in the classrooms of Australia, as a consequence of the policies of the government, by assisting with their kids buying a home computer and getting internet connections at home, that becomes a tax deductible expense for the future. As a consequence of that, we are making it easier for working families to provide for their kids' education. On the question of child care, there is the increase in the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. I do not recall those opposite actually saying anything about boosting the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent prior to the last election. So on the education tax refund, Member for Wentworth, you are wrong. On the question of the childcare tax rebate, you are wrong. On the question of your predisposition to provide $4 billion worth of funding for those north of 180 grandMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. While the Prime Minister is going through his list, he could at least include a relevant answer to a relevant and important question.",101
173,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! That is not a point of order. Mr Turnbull-He treats this House with contempt.,101
174,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wentworth will resume his seat.,101
175,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On those three measures that I have just referred to, the position of the government on tax is absolutely clear. But I go back to the fundamental premise of the question being advanced by both the member for Wentworth, the plan C for the leadership of the Liberal Party, and the current Leader of the Liberal Party. Mr Turnbull-Answer the question.",101
176,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Wentworth has asked his question.,101
177,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the member for Wentworth seriously suggesting that he is not out there counting numbers at the moment? Mr Turnbull-You are a joke. I'm seriously suggesting you're a joke!,101
178,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Are you seriously suggesting that you are not out there counting numbers at the moment? Mr Truss- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The latest comments by the Prime Minister have nothing whatsoever to do with the question, and I ask you to bring him",102
179,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Nationals will resume his seat. I will listen fully to the Prime Minister.,102
180,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My comments have everything to do with the answer to the question because they go to the future of the government's tax bills in the Senate. If there is a change in the leadership of the Liberal Party, we will wait with interest to see what new posture will be adopted to the passage of those billswhether it is plan A, plan B, plan Z or plan whatever in terms of the alternative leadership of the Liberal Party. I would say to the member for Wentworth that, given that he is so experienced in counting the numbers, they should probably think about appointing him as Senate whip, because they seem to have a problem with counting numbers in the Senate at the moment, too. If you are harnessing votes generally, Malcolm, I would suggest that your Senate whip needs a bit of help on that score, because it did not go so well last night. Mr Hockey-You couldn't even get a quorum this morning.",102
181,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the member for North Sydney volume barometer again: when in big trouble, bellow most loudly.",102
182,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will ignore the interjections.,102
183,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the honourable members who have asked this question about tax: the previous Liberal Party government was the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Why do we say that? We say that because tax as a proportion of GDP reached 24.9 per cent in both 2004-05 and 2005-06. When we took over office it was running at 24.7 per cent. For the benefit of those opposite, get these numbers straight: 24.7 per cent in 2007-08, 24.6 per cent in 2006-06, 24.9 per cent from 2004 through to 2006, 24.5 per cent from 2003 to 2004, 24.6 from 2002 to 2003. The first budget brought caredown by this Australian Labor government reduces tax as a percentage of GDP to 23.8 per cent. That is the mathematics. You might find it very disconcerting, but that is the mathematics. And if you look to the forward estimates, it remains lower right out to 201011. I would conclude my answer by suggesting that those opposite reflect on this: if we were to sustain in this budget-the one that the Treasurer brought down in March-the same tax to GDP ratio as we inherited from you with the last budget, do you know how much more we would be collecting by way of tax in the period ahead? We would be collecting $30 billion in more tax. If we sustained the Liberal's tax as a percentage of GDP at 24.7 per cent, as opposed to the 23.8 per cent we had hit, that would be a further $30 billion tax hike on Australian working families. I would say to those opposite, given their deep addiction to taxation, to do one thing for working families: tell your senators in the Senate to get behind the government's program on the Medicare levy surcharge, as $1,200 extra a year means something to working families at the moment. If the Reserve Bank can give us an interest rate cut which produces for working families a reduction of $600 in their interest rate bill each year, the Liberal Party should at least not add to that by providing an additional $1,200 tax hike a year, which their current action in the Senate is contemplating. NA",102
184,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Jennifer Rankine, South Australian Minister for Families and Communities, Housing and Disability Services. On behalf of the House I extend to her a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA",103
185,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister explain the benefits of the government's decision to raise the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds?,103
186,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman for his question. He takes a particular interest in our government's health policies, having recently secured $7 million for 12 new dialysis chairs in his electorate. But he asks particularly about the Medicare levy surcharge. Members might recall yesterday that I enlightened the House as to the reasons behind the setting of the surcharge, introduced by then health minister Michael Wooldridge, who told us that this threshold was devised over a bottle of Jameson's whiskey late one night. I thought it might be a good idea to let the House know about a few other comments that Dr Wooldridge has made about this surcharge. When the surcharge was first introduced, he said: High income earners will be asked to pay a care levy surcharge if they do not have private health insurance. These are people who can to purchase health insurance. Now we have the current-day Liberal Party with the firm opinion that someone who earns over $51,000 is a high-income earner. Never mind that somebody earning that rate is now earning less than the average wage; in the Liberal Party's eyes, if you earn more than $51,000 a year, you are a high-income earner. You are rich if you are over Michael Wooldridge's Jameson's whiskey threshold-hardly something to be proud of. But I am informed that this morning in the House, a Liberal senator for Queensland-in fact, I think the sameMr Anthony Smith-In the House? It must have been in the Senate!",103
187,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you. It is good to Budget know that the education spokesperson can help us out on occasion. I thank the member for that. In the Senate this morning, a Liberal senator from Queensland-and I believe it was the same senator who feels so passionately about the luxury car tax that she forgot to turn up-suggested that the Liberal Party's position on the Medicare levy surcharge was all about choice. There is nothing wrong with choice; the Labor Party think choice is a good idea. However, the choice that the Liberal Party are offering working families is this choice: they can choose to pay for private health insurance or they can choose to pay a tax. That is the choice that they are offering. I do understand that working families start to get nervous when the Liberal Party talk about choice. We know that the last time they talked about choice it was Work Choices. We know where that led; it was absolutely nothing to do with choices. Under the Labor Party's policy, we are offering a real choice to these people. We know that family budgMedi- ets are under pressure, and our measure would actually allow families to choose afford whether they want to spend their money on their home loan, whether they want to spend their money on groceries, whether they want to spend it on private health insurance or whether they want to spend it on child care. We believe in giving them a real choice by giving them the money in their pockets so that they can choose how to spend it. It is about time, if the Liberal Party were really about choice, that they supported our measure in the Senate. Fuel Prices",103
188,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the comments in today's Launceston Examiner by the Tasmanian premier that he will be lobbying hard for a cut in fuel excise. Will the Prime Minister listen to his Labor mate and adopt our plan to take pressure off motorists and inflation by reducing fuel excise by 5c a litre?,104
189,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would ask those opposite,104
190,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,104
191,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,to reflect long and hard about their first action in the on the luxury car tax.,104
192,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition! The Leader of the Opposition!,104
193,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first priority legislatively for those opposite is to send a message to working families, pensioners and carers that they, the Liberal Party, stand for cheaper Porsches. That is their message: cheaper Porsches, cheaper Ferraris and cheaper RollsRoyces. Mr Truss- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question is about a cut in fuel excise. It has nothing to do with the issues the Prime Minister is talking about.",104
194,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Nationals will resume his seat. I call the Prime Minister.,104
195,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In terms of the cost-of-living pressures on working families, you have groceries, you have petrol and you have interest rates-and the impact which that has on home mortgages and rents-as well as the other challenges which working families face in balancing their budgets. The measure that was put forward by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply, which I notice was opposed by the member for Wentworth, and I think the member for Higgins and the member for Flinders-have you sorted that one out yet, by the way, as to whether it is official opposition policy?",104
196,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister's answer will go to the question. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the Prime Minister cannot answer the question, he should save Australia and not give us any more gas.",104
197,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! That is not a point of order. Mr Hockey-Give us an answer.,104
198,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! That is not a point of order, and I warn the member for Senate, which is North Sydney.",104
199,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, it is a relevant question in terms of the future leadership of the Liberal Party. If they change to the member for Wentworth, will this policy they currently have be sustained? It is an entirely legitimate question.",104
200,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition! I warn the Leader of the Opposition!,104
201,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is an entirely legitimate question because the member for Wentworth had been backgrounding at the time how much he opposed the policy-I think the member for Higgins as well, supported by the member for Flinders. I think, on the calculations put forward by those opposite at the time, they said that this would assist working families by about $2 a week. I think that was the figure used by the Leader of the Opposition. I would say this to those opposite: the measure you are about to vote against in the Senate on the Medicare levy surcharge equals about $20 a week. That is about $1,200 a year based on the income profile I referred to earlier in the question.",104
202,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition!,105
203,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite stand here and say on this measure that they are concerned about the price impacts on working families. We are offering, in effect, a tax cut for a very large number of those working families; you stand for a tax hike. The inconsistency in these positions is extraordinary. Murray-Darling River System",105
204,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's response to the crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin and outline any other responses? Ms Julie Bishop interjecting,105
205,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects, ‘A holding pattern'. What were the last 12 years? The last 12 years were, I would say, not just standing still but actually taking the entire debate backwards. They had 12 years to act on a climate change crisis which is impacting on the Murray-Darling Basin, and what did they do? How many gigalitres of water entitlements did they buy back after 12 years in office? Zero. Absolutely zero. Mr Hunt interjecting",105
206,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Flinders!,105
207,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a direct proportional relationship between the loudness of their interjections and the absence of action during their period in office. The situation in the Murray-Darling Basin is serious. There has been some modest reprieve with some recent rains but, with the arrival of warmer weather, evaporation will start again to take its toll, and water levels are again expected to start falling. If we look at the facts which we are presented with, we have just had the fifth driest winter on record, and that is out of 117 years of records. Normally storages would be starting to fill now but, while there have been some inflows, these are now below the historical average. Active storage in the Murray system is around 20 per cent capacity, and for the basin as a whole it is around 23 per cent capacity. These are the facts that we are presented with. This is a deep challenge to the entire Murray-Darling Basin system; in fact, the system is in real crisis. I look also to comments made yesterday by the CEO of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, Wendy Craik. She said that the current water shortage ‘has the fingerprints of climate change all over it' and she said: There are features of the current phenomenon that we find ourselves in-water shortage, drought, whatever you want to call it-that are linked to climate change. We also have statements by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology in their technical report on climate change in 2007-when those opposite were in office-which say: Recent Australian droughts have been accompanied by higher surface temperatures due to anthropogenichuman inducedwarming. If you look at the 2008 report of CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, An assessment of the impact of climate change on the nature and frequency of exceptional climatic events, it states in its conclusion: About 50 per cent of the rainfall decrease in southwestern Australia since the late 1960s is likely to be due to increases in greenhouse gases. The autumn rainfall decline in south-eastern Australia since the late 1950s may be partly due to increases in greenhouse gases. That is what the scientists have to say. The Chairman of the NFF, David Crombie, said, ‘The NFF believes that climate change may be the greatest threat confronting Australian farmers and their productive capacity now and into the future.' This is the challenge we face with the Murray-Darling Basin system now. We have clear statements from the scientific community, from those representing farm organisations and from those representing the basin authority itself about the direct linkages tween climate change and what is occurring in the Murray-Darling Basin. The government's course of action is clear-cut. Dr Nelson interjecting",105
208,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition says that the government has done nothing. The Leader of the Opposition therefore says that the fact that we have, for the first time in the history of the Murray-Darling Basin, spent $50 million on purchasing back 38 gigalitres of water entitlements-when those opposite had 12 years to buy back one gigalitre-is doing nothing. We have done that in nine months. In 12 years they bought back zero. Secondly, we have allocated, at the Adelaide cabinet meeting, a further halfbillion dollars to accelerate the purchase back of water entitlements; thirdly, we have allocated $5.8 billion to improving irrigation infrastructure; fourthly, a new and independent Murray-Darling Basin authority has been established as a consequence of the intergovernmental agreement which this government brought into being-not our predecessorswhich will implement a new basin plan from 2011. On top of that, we have for the first time an independently audited account of the total storage within the entire system. These are practical courses of action against a real crisis facing the Murray-Darling Basin system. I am also asked about alternative responses to the challenges we face. The core problem we face is that those opposite still do not accept that there is any linkage at all between climate change and the impact on the Murray-Darling Basin system. How can we get to first base in reaching a conclusion on what should be done about the Murray-Darling Basin when the alternative government of Australia and, as the Leader of the Opposition often describes himself, the albeternative Prime Minister of Australia say that there is no relationship at all between climate change and the current state of the Murray-Darling Basin? That is what he has said. You cannot dispute it. He was asked the other night, ‘Do you accept what's happening to the Lower Lakes and right up the Murray is also related to climate change? And he answered, ‘No, I don't.' It is quite clear-cut. They were at dinner last night with the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard. Those opposite and those on this side of the chamber may remember the answer that was given at the beginning of last year on climate change when I asked, I think, the Prime Minister at the time whether he accepted the reality of climate change and its relationship to human-induced emissions. He said that the jury was still out. Eighteen months on, that is still the state of the Liberal Party. They are climate change deniers-not in their heart of hearts but in the words put forth this week by the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. Can I just say to those opposite: in terms of the leaderless rabble that the Liberal Party have become, the time has come for the conspirators to come out of the shadows and bring this to a conclusion. It has gone on for too long-whether it is plan A or plan B. It is about time this was brought to a conclusion. We have here a clear statement from the climate change denier who is currently the Leader of the Opposition and the alternative Prime Minister. Our Murray-Darling Basin system is in crisis. It requires, therefore, tional political action-not opportunistic, short-term political pointscoring. It is time that the climate change deniers in the Liberal Party got with the government's program and backed a national solution to a river system in crisis. Taxation",106
209,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why would any responsible economic manager put new taxes on vehicles that are used extensively by farmers and tourism operators already struggling in a declining economy?",107
210,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are not doing that; that is the point. What we are doing is increasing taxation on Porsches-very expensive luxury cars. That is what we are doing, and you have no",107
211,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,107
212,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition has asked a question. It would be helpful if the House were silent so that we could listen to the response.,107
213,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition want lower taxes for people who purchase luxury vehicles; it is that simple-lower taxes for people who purchase luxury vehicles. All of this today is about covering up their embarrassment, because what they are now doing is trying to blow a $6 billion hole in the surplus, which means that what they are saying to the Australian people is they do not stand for working families who want lower interest rates. It is very clear who they are siding with in this debate. They are siding with big oil, they are siding with people who are purchasing luxury vehicles and they are siding against people on average incomes who are slugged with a very high levy when it comes to the Medicare surcharge. That is what they are doing. They are acutely embarrassed about it, and all of their tactics in question natime today have been about camouflaging that fact. Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Talks",107
214,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Trade. Will the minister update the House on the free trade talks of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, and New Zealand?",107
215,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can indicate to the House that in Singapore last week Australia and New Zealand concluded a free trade agreement with ASEAN. This agreement is the most comprehensive free trade agreement that ASEAN has ever entered into. It is Australia's largest free trade agreement; ASEAN as a whole is our largest trading partner, with some $71 billion in two-way trade between us and them. This is a larger trading partner than China, a larger trading partner than the US, a larger trading partner than Japan. As for the agreement itself, it will liberalise commerce on up to 97 per cent of Australia's current trade with key ASEAN partner markets by 2015, a significant advance on the Bogor 2020 time line. It covers all three major sectors-agriculture, manufacturing and services. In the case of agriculture it will cap tariffs and phase them out over time. In respect of manufacturing it will cover over 30 per cent of our manufacturing exports and eventually eliminate tariffs on manufactured goods such as machinery and parts, electrical equipment and instruments and gaming machines. Australian pharmaceutical products as well will be tariff free in a few years. As far as the services sector is concerned, there will be greater security and certainty for the banks and insurance companies. The agreement will improve entry for teaching staff, allow education providers to supply more courses and give telecommunications providers access to essential network services. This is a very significant free trade agreement. It will provide not only new export opportunities but, significantly, capacity to create new jobs in this country. As well, whilst I was in Singapore, where Austrade has headquarters, I also had discussions with the Austrade regional manager for the ASEAN region and I have instructed Austrade to work with industry to develop a strategic plan for all the sectors of industry not only to have a better knowledge of what this agreement holds but to develop a strategic plan to properly take account of it. This is a significant advance. Australia was left a woeful record in trade by the previous government. We inherited a trade performance of 72 consecutive months of trade deficits. Never before in the history of this country has a government presided over such a performance. And in the 11 years that the previous government was in office it was only able to have net exports contribute to economic growth in two of those years. Not only did it leave us high inflation which drove up interest rates; it left us a woeful trade performance. Labor has a plan and has started to implement it to turn around that woeful trade performance. This ASEAN free trade agreement is part of that plan. Taxation",107
216,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Tourism. Minister, how will the Rudd government's $1 billion of new tourism taxes affect the job security of 483,000 Australians who work in our tourism industry?",108
217,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question on the tourism industry. I say that because the tourism industry is exceptionally important to the Australian community, especially in the context of jobs in regional and rural Australia. One of the issues the tourism industry is ing is their serious concern about the impact of inflation on their local businesses and the need for the Australian government to get the economic fundamentals right. In that context they are vitally concerned and they seriously welcomed the reduction in interest rates this week, which has made it a little bit easier for them to conduct their businesses in a very tough global environment. I say that because the tourism industry in Australia is finding it a little bit tough at the moment because of the serious economic concerns throughout the global economic community. On top of those serious economic concerns, they have also had to handle the impact of a very strong dollar, which has undermined our historical inflow of tourists from such significant markets as Japan. This industry has also had to handle the impact of a serious oil crisis, which has made it more difficult for tourists to come to Australia and to travel in Australia. So I simply say that the Australian governmentMs Julie Bishop-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was about the $1 billion in taxes imposed on the tourism industry, and he has not mentioned the $1 billion.",108
218,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will resume her seat. There is no point of order.,108
219,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure the House that we will continue to work closely with the tourism industry. We will also continue to work to overcome the neglect that this industry has had to put up with-the failure of the previous government-on such fundamental issues as a shortage of labour and a failure to train Australians to perform very valuable work in the tourism industry, which is so important to Australia's economic performance. I might also say that they have raised with me their raisserious concerns about the failures of the previous government with respect to key infrastructure issues, such as improvements in railways and the performance of airports-in association with the requirements of the Australian community-to actually save to invest in improving those key economic activities for the future in terms of investing in skills and infrastructure development. I am pleased to say that I have a good working relationship with the tourism industry. They continue to bring their concerns to me, because they are also about making sure that, unlike the previous government's international tourism advertising campaign called ‘Where the bloody hell are you?'Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I am loath to interrupt, but the ister has now been speaking for about 2½ minutes and he has not yet mentioned the billion dollars, and before",108
220,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will leave the chamber for one hour. The member for Curtin then left the chamber. Mr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, under the general standing orders, I wish to protest against that action.",109
221,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! It will assist your cause if you get my right title-but that's okay. Mr Abbott-I am sorry, it has been a long and tiring afternoon, and we have been rather bored by the proceedings. Mr Speaker, you have quite properly over the last couple of weeks talked about the circumstances of the House and how rulings are influenced by the circumstances of the House. Given the circumstances of the House today, I put it to you that to exclude the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is a harsh measure. I would respectfully ask you to reconsider.",109
222,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Warringah will resume his seat. It is true that I have emphasised the circumstances of the chamber. I warned the Deputy Leader of the Opposition earlier in the piece. On the basis of the circumstances of proceedings that have followed that, I have ignored a number of times things that have happened. On the basis that I had asked her to resume her seat and on the basis of previous matters that I had taken into consideration, I thought that it was a fair cop. To get back to the point of order that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was making before I sent her on her minway, in her points of order the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has only been emphasising one point of the question. The minister has been relevant to the question, as set by the precedents of this place.",109
223,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will also work with industry to get Tourism Australia's performance right. I recently read with concern a report by the Australian National Audit Office about the lack of attention paid by the previous government to corporate governance issues concerning the operation of Tourism Australia. I understand the need to actually make sure that I get the tourism industry right. The Leader of the Opposition is concerned about tourism because the member for Wentworth is just about to send him on a long, long holiday. Homelessness",109
224,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing and the Minister for the Status of Women. Is the minister aware of figures released today on homelessness from the 2006 census? What action is the government taking in this area?,109
225,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question today. The member for Kingston held a very successful forum on homelessness in her electorate with a lot of local organisations represented. Her report to me was a very insightful and compassionate report. So I thank her for her question today. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a report Counting the homeless. It counted the people who were homeless on census night in 2006. One of the frustrations of working in the area of homelessness is that figures are really only taken twice every decade and then we wait two years to see what those figures are. Nevertheless, the Counting the homeless report, which looks at census night 2006, shows us some very important and disturbing information. The number of people who were sleeping rough each night increased 16 per cent between 2001 and 2006, from 14,000 people to 16,000 people. On census night 2006, there were 2,192 more children homeless compared with census night 2001. That reflects, unfortunately, a 22 per cent increase in the number of homeless children under the age of 12 in that five-year period. It also reflects a much broader shift in the type of people who are becoming homeless. We are seeing a lot more families and couples becoming homeless-a lot more families with children. I am pleased to report that there is some good news in the data as well. There has been a fall in the number of homeless young people between the ages of 12 and 24. That group of homeless people fell from around 23,000 in 2001 to just under 18,000 in 2006. That shows that targeted interventions in a particular population group can be successful in reducing homelessness. This data also confirms that homelessness services have been doing an amazingly great job with the resources that they have. Over 20,000 people were staying in shelters and refuges on census night 2006. That is 5,600 more people than were in the same type of accommodation in 2001. That was done without, at the time, any real increase in funding from the Commonwealth. Of course, the Rudd Labor government has already taken action in the area of homelessness. In the May budget we contributed $2.8 million to RecLink, the organisation behind the Choir of Hard Knocks, and 30 other similar programs. We put $150 million of new money into building homes for homeless Australians. These funds have been allocated to states and territories, and states and territories are building, buying and planning those homes right now. A Place to Call Home will meet its target of delivering 600 new homes for homeless Australians, an important though modest contribution. Last month I launched the National Homelessness Information Clearinghouse. With government funding of $500,000 over three years, it is a crucial tool for informing and connecting the homelessness sector. Our homelessness white paper will be out in a few weeks time. Over 1,200 Australians attended consultations and over 600 written submissions were received. Today I also released a short summary of those submissions. Homelessness is being tackled by the COAG Housing Working Group because obviously Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments need to work together. Of course, the problem of homelessness goes beyond government intervention. It requires all the support and help of the notfor-profit, non-government, benevolent and charity sector, which has been so successful for so many years. But it goes beyond that also. Our response needs to engage the business community and the whole of the Australian community. We know that with targeted action we can turn around the figures that we have seen today. Economy",109
226,Mr IRONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House of the forecast increase in the price of gas and electricity in Western Australia as a result of the government's new tax on gas?,111
227,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say to the honourable member, who I think comes from the state of Western Australia, that the first responsibility we have as a government is to make sure that we are prosecuting a policy of responsible economic management. Secondly, I would say to the honourable member that if he looks at the national accounts figures released yesterday he will see a solid growth performance for the Australian economy but a particularly solid growth performance in the Western Australian state economy. The honourable member, I presume, refers to the impact of another tax measure which is being considered by those in the Senate. I presume that is the reference of his question; what in particular he was talking about is somewhat unclear. Can I say to all those opposite: if you are going to prosecute a policy of responsible economic management, it means ensuring that you deliver a responsible surplus outcome. Currently, we have a $6 billion assault on it. I would say to those posite: you ought to pursue these policies in order to make it possible for the people of Western Australia to enjoy, like other Australians, a decision by the Reserve Bank to bring down interest rates, rather than to see them continue to go up. That, I would say to all those in Western Australia, is a good way ahead. The other thing I would say on the question of fuel prices for those in Western Australia is this: those in Western Australia have benefited from a Liberal government decision since 2001 under Premier Richard CourtMr Irons- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I did not ask the Prime Minister about fuel prices; I asked him about gas and electricity prices.",111
228,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,111
229,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the matter that the honourable member just raised, I also draw his attention to what his own leader had to say on 20 August. He said, ‘I'm advised in part that the change in excise referred to is not likely to have any impact on domestic gas prices.'",111
230,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, that is not what I said.",111
231,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So says the Australian Financial Review. Is anyone up there in the press gallery saying they got it wrong? Let us find out.,111
232,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,111
233,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, the Leader of the Liberal Party should be careful about what he says. Obviously, he has come under attack from his Western Australian Liberal colleagues for that statement and he is trying to wriggle out from under it. It is there in black and white. I have not heard",111
234,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The people of Western op- Australia want to know: are their gas prices going up?",111

236,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As we know, the tax measure being considered in the Senate at the moment is a tax on condensate. Again, I draw the attention of those opposite, including the honourable member, to their leader's own statement on 20 August. He said: I am advised in part itthe change in exciseis not likely to have any impact on domestic gas prices. I know it is a politically uncomfortable message for the honourable member, particularly on this day, that his own leader does not adhere to the political script that he desires. know that is politically uncomfortable",111
237,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question to the Prime Minister is for the Prime Minister to guarantee this will not increase the price of gas.",112

239,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The more the Leader of the Liberal Party protests this day, the more we know the Leader of the Liberal Party is in terminal trouble. We had the Nelson doctrine on interest rates earlier this week: what he says on interest rates as Leader of the Opposition is not what he will do on interest rates as Prime Minister. We have had the Nelson doctrine on climate change, which is that he does not accept there is any connection between climate change and inflow of water.",112

242,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Again we have the Nelson doctrine when it comes to the impact on gas prices in WA. One thing is said in this place",112
243,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will get to the end of his answer.,112
244,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and another thing elsewhere. I would suggest that those opposite develop a clear political and policy script for the nation's future.,112

247,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the progress of implementation of the government's world's best practice national reform package for organ and tissue donation for transplantation?,112
248,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I believe this is a matter on which all members of the House have a common view-that is, how do we deal with the problem of the inadequate supply of donated organs for those who need them and for those who now are adding to the waiting lists for transplants around Australia? Currently we have 1,800 people around Australia on waiting lists and that number is made up of those who make the waiting list. There is a further number of patientsMr Baldwin-Can you get a brain donation?",112
249,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Paterson will withdraw that remark. Mr Baldwin-I withdraw.,112
250,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Paterson is warned.,112

260,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Where I began on this was to say that I believe all members of the House are united in their interest in ensuring that we have a decent organ donation and transplant system for the future. I assume that is the case on part of all members in this place. Mr Baldwin-What are you doing about it?",113
261,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Paterson interjects, ‘What are you doing about it?' Can I say this: as a consequence of the 2020 Summit, when the question of organ donation came up and was prosecuted with legitimate vigour by those who are associated with the system as it works at present, the government decided in July to embrace a $136.4 million national plan to boost organ donation and to save lives. Mr Baldwin-That's not enough.",113
262,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Paterson interjects, ‘That's not enough.'",113
263,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Paterson.,113
264,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I would suggest that those opposite try to enter into the spirit of what we are doing here, which is to try to make a real improvement for a whole lot of people who need organ donations. This $136.4 million plan includes the following elements: firstly, $67 million to fund dedicated organ donation specialist doctors and other staff in public and private hospitals who currently do not exist; secondly, $46 million to establish for the first time a new independent national authority to coordinate national organ donation initiatives across the country, which anyone associated with this would know are currently poorly coordinated; thirdly, $17 million in new funding for hospitals to meet additional staffing, bed and infrastructure costs associated with organ donation; fourthly, $13.4 million to continue a national public awareness campaign; and, fifthly, $1.9 million for counselling for potential donor families. These are very practical measures. We have engaged in a lot of discussion within the government about how to do this and the how to do it better. The reason we have done that is the figures that I began my answer in question time on today. I think all of us have people in our own electorates, people that we know, who are directly personally affected by something we as a nation need to do better. That is what we are trying to do. It is not just the 1,800 who are now on transplant waiting lists; it is those who cannot even get on to those lists for a series of other reasons. We had some good news today at a personal level when we had a visit from little Cordelia Whatman. She is, I think, 15 or 16 months old, a little bub. This case is prior to this scheme coming in. There is no direct connection here, but I simply use this little one as an example of what good things we can do as a country if we talk up, both sides of politics, the importance of getting donations right. This little one successfully, thank God, got a liver transplant at Westmead children's hospital two months ago. I saw her today and she is looking in really good nick. But that is just one case, and there are 1,800 others out there who need help and need it now. Therefore, I would say to all members of the House: in our own way, in our own communities, let us get behind what I think is a really good national program. It is not going to solve everything. But one of the things that is really important is for us all talk up the need to not just commit ourselves to organ donation but, when that terrible tragedy occurs in a family, for people to go through with it to the end, because that is where the downfall is occurring. The stats on people signing off for organ donation are huge for Australia. Australians want to do this. Some 90-plus per cent, I think, of Australians sign up saying that they are willing to donate. But last year we had a total of 198 people who donated organs. There is a real problem at the actual interface-that is, where it happens in the hospital. That is what we have to crack. That is why the advice to us from the medical experts is that they need specialist medical and nursing staff within hospitals to try and make this work-people who are not associated with the normal functions of the hospital; people who have this as their dedicated mission. As of Saturday, I understand, the positions of the chief executive officer and medical director of the new organ donation authority will be advertised. We are at this stage on track to have the new authority up and operating by 1 January 2009. It will be good if we can get those numbers down. That is the ambition I think of all of us here, and I think we can all play a modest part in our own communities in trying to make this work as well. Mr Speaker, on that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",113
265,Dr NELSON,ORGAN DONATION," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, this is one of the initiatives of the government which the opposition strongly supports and commends, and has been very supportive of publicly. I join with the Prime Minister in challenging every Australian to discuss with his or her family what they would like done in relation to organ donation to in the event of their sudden death. Everyone of us every day should do everything we can to encourage a broader discussion in the community because, tragically, it does often fall down, as the Prime Minister says, at the hospital level and in the discussion between medical and nursing staff and immediate family members. NA Question Time",114
266,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, given that this is quite likely the lengthiest question time in the history of the Commonwealth parliament, could I ask what your preferred timetable is for the Procedure Committee to consider the Deputy Prime Minister's demand that ministerial answers be limited to four minutes.",114
267,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,That is not a question that is in my hands. Question Time,114
268,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, a few days ago you noted that you had written to the Procedure Committee asking them to continue with their review of question time, particularly I would imagine with reference to the previous demands by the now Deputy Prime Minister to limit answers to four minutes. Have you received a response and can you inform the House of that response if you have received it?",114
269,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member for North Sydney might liaise with members of the opposition that are on the committee. Quorums,114
270,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I refer you to standing order 54, which says, inter alia: The Speaker shall take the Chair and, if a quorum of 30 Members is present, read prayers. If a quorum is not present standing order 57 (count out) shall apply. This morning, not enough government members to provide a quorum in this chamber bothered to turn up prior to prayers. Why did you allow the sitting to begin rather than counting out the House as required understanding order 54?",114
271,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have two options: I can use the indication that I have given to the chamber that matters of procedure are not open to discussion at this point in time-and I am tempted to do that because of the implied inference in the latter part of the question-or I can respond to the question. It is true, as the Chief Opposition Whip has indicated, that standing order 54 is the relevant standing order. On this occasion, on taking the chair, and in the absence of advice as to a quorum not being present and, therefore, in the belief that a quorum was present, I proceeded to prayers. I will say that, as a result of the raising of this question, a lesson may have been learnt by a number of people in this chamber, and I just take the opportunity to perhaps iterate that it is the duty of all members to ensure that a quorum is present, particularly at the commencement of proceedings when the prayers are offered. Question Time",115
272,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, as a passionate devotee of organ transplants, I would like to ask you whether it was appropriate this afternoon, at the last question on the last hour on the last sitting day of the fortnight, to raise a question which the Prime Minister said was so important and not give it the status it deserved of a ministerial statethat ment.",115
273,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,That is not actually a question to me. Quorums,115
274,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, given that the Prime Minister sought in question time and numerous other places today to highlight the fact that there was a senator missing from a vote in the Senate, and given that we noted that there were nine Labor members who did not attend to form a quorum for this House to meet today",115
275,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat.,115
276,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I have not asked the question.,115
277,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I am perhaps suggesting that I am not going to make any more comments about the events of this morning other than the response that I have given to the Chief Opposition Whip.,115
278,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,But I am asking a question!,115
279,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"All right, the member for North Sydney may ask a question on the administration of parliamentary departments.",115
280,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"That is right. Yes, I am, and I am asking you to make available the tape of proceedings of this morning that proves there was not a quorum present when the House met at the first opportunity this morning.",115
281,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The tape of proceedings is available to all members. I say to the member for North Sydney, if we want to go down this track of rewriting everything that happened this morning so that some people can feel better about it than others, by all means do that. I think that, if you look carefully at what I have said, you will see I have admitted that I did not get advice from people that there was not a quorum. Remember I come in here trailing the mace. I then stand, and it would be a bit hard for me to actually count all the faces that are smiling back at me. In fact, today, if you want to know what my other problem was, one member had his phone in his pocket and it beeped for a message, which distracted me if I wanted to claim I was distracted. But, if you want to listen to what has been said, I said that a lesson was learnt by the events of today. On the basis of the lesson learnt, I for one will ensure that any error will not be repeated. If you leave it at that, that should be sufficient. At the end of the day I could deflect it to other people. I accept that it was in my control because there is no opportunity for another member to indicate to me that there is not a quorum. Of course, there are other procedures and other ways that the Speaker can be advised of it, and I do not wish to put the blame on other people that work in the chamber.",115
282,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I respect and accept that, but it does raise issues in relation to section 39 of the Constitution about whether the chamber had a valid quorum in order to give effect to the day's proceedings.",116
283,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"That is why I carefully said that I obviously believed that there was a quorum, and that is why I proceeded to prayers. Question Time",116
284,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, given the number of opportunities afforded to the opposition to raise questions with you, is it the case that there were 31 points of order and one protest made during question time today? Is it also the case that, during the last term of the previous government, the government gave 288 answers that were longer than four minutes? Thirdly, given the question raised by the Manager of Opposition Business about constitutionality, I wonder whether you could ascertain from the opposition whether they intend to proceed with their legal action about the constitutionality of this parliament when it does not have quorums or divisions between 6.30 and eight o'clock and whether the extension that they have asked for of that provision, which has been forwarded to the Procedure Committee, raises any legal questions whatsoever as well. Mr Hockey-Okay, so you want to raise that subject too. Right, bring it on!",116
285,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,You were going to take legal action. Do it! Mr Hockey interjecting,116
286,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"As I said, I am reluctant to make, and try to avoid making, any comments about questions to do with procedures. I am not in a position to give any type of legal advice from the chair. Thirdly, the fact that the matterMr Hockey interjecting Mr Albanese interjecting",116

288,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Given the fact that the matters raised by the Leader of the House have been referred to the Procedure Committee, I think the Procedure Committee can look at the matters that have been raised. NA Economy",116
289,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-There have been a lot of economic numbers in the last week or so and a lot of debate and commentary about our economic circumstances. So I do think it is appropriate now to give the House and the Australian people the government's detailed assessment of the Australian economy: where we have come from, where we are and where we are going. I do so in the knowledge that this is a challenging time for the Australian economy and the global economy. There is rightly a good deal of concern about the security of our prosperity, about global financial turbulence and about economic dislocation elsewhere. These are indeed challenging times. Our economic circumstances require careful consideration of policy, careful weighing of the evidence, discriminating judgement and a continuous openness to new information. But I want to offer this message to the House and to Australian families: the Australian government's assessment of the unfolding information about our economy suggests we do have reason for optimism, and if we engage and work on the challenges we face we will come through this difficult time better placed to enjoy and secure the long-term prosperity this government is committed to delivering. Through to the beginning of this year the global economy experienced the five best years of global prosperity in recent history. This year, growth in the global economy is much slower and the global environment is much more uncertain. The global financial turbulence which began in the US subprime mortgage market over a year ago has spread throughout global financial markets. Borrowing costs have been pushed higher around the world. Global share markets have fallen by an average of about 20 per cent since the global turmoil began. Business and consumer confidence has fallen across developed economies, with the OECD's measure of consumer confidence for member economies at its lowest point in almost 30 years. the face of these global difficulties, the world's largest developed economies are experiencing sharp slowdowns in output growth. The UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy all recorded negative or zero growth in the three months to June this year. So what began as a crisis in the US subprime mortgage market is now producing a significant slowing across developed economies. Even if, as we hope, the worse of the financial turbulence is behind us, we are now dealing with the impact of higher interest rate spreads for borrowers, losses of financial capital and diminished confidence on growth and employment in major developed economies. At the same time, higher food and oil prices have driven up inflation worldwide, limiting the response of central banks to the downturn in output growth. These are the global challenges confronting the Australian economy, and they are considerable. From the beginning, we have been upfront about them. We also face formidable domestic challenges. In November last year we took responsibility for an economy in which the Reserve Bank of Australia had already been obliged to impose 10 successive interest rate increases to combat the threat of rising inflation; an economy in which underlying inflation was already well over the top of the central bank's target band and still increasing; an economy in which the inflation threat was sufficiently serious that the central bank was compelled to tighten rates twice more within four months of this government coming to office-in addition of course to the increases in the general level of interest rates that arose from the global financial crisis; an economy constrained not only by high interest rates but also by capacity constraints which had become tighter and tighter as a result of the negligence of our predecessors; an economy in which export volume growth had slowed to a crawl despite In the highest export prices in half a century; an economy in which productivity growth had fallen to half the average rate of the previous three decades; an economy which in the fourth quarter of last year, the last quarter in which those opposite held office, had already slowed to well under the average quarterly growth of the past 16 years. These were economic circumstances to which this government had to make an immediate and decisive response. Instead of celebrating an electoral victory, we immediately sought the best advice from the Treasury and from the Reserve Bank on what we saw to be critical threats to the continuing prosperity of the Australian people. We were determined to be upfront and honest with the Australian community about the challenges we faced, both domestically and from abroad, and the impacts they were having on our economy. First, we identified the magnitude of the inflation challenge and dedicated ourselves to addressing it. At that time the opposition said it was a fairytale and a charade. But now inflation is over four per cent and everyone understands it is a problem. We also recognised that, while Australia was not affected as acutely by the global financial crisis as many other economies, we needed to be in continuous and close contact with our regulators, with the central bank and also with the commercial banks. We recognised that as a government we needed to put our weight behind the stabilisation of financial turbulence in Australia, while exerting ourselves to support actions to address the crisis internationally. No issue took more of my time in the early months of office than assessing and monitoring the financial crisis and reassuring all the relevant parties that the Australian government understood the gravity of the issues and stood ready to assist where necessary. That is why, some months ago, in a ministerial statement to the House, I announced plans to increase government securities on issue as part of a prudent plan to maintain liquidity in critical government bonds and to underpin the proper functioning of the bond market. Recognition of the inflation problem we inherited and recognition of the gravity of the global financial crisis was our priority in the early weeks of office. This was the difficult backdrop that we confronted when we sat down to prepare our first budget. In designing our budget strategy we recognised that inflation would likely continue at an unacceptably high rate for some time to come. And we recognised that the global financial crisis and tighter credit conditions would continue to affect the growth of developed economies as well as our own. But we also recognised there were big differences between Australia's circumstances and those of other developed economies. We recognised that Australia's financial sector is strong and did not face the same problems being experienced in the US housing and subprime mortgage markets. We recognised that the prices for many of our export commodities had risen to levels not seen in a generation and, in some cases, were still rising. This meant nominal export income would be rising rapidly and this would mitigate some of the contractionary impact of higher interest rates and tighter lending standards. We knew that in these circumstances we had to get the balance right between bearing down on inflation, providing a buffer against global uncertainty and providing the means to finance vital investments in nation building for the future. All these considerations suggested to us that it was imperative that we abruptly change Australia's fiscal direction, move away from the reckless spending of our predecessors in their last desperate years of office and change to a consistent and disciplined stance that would help rather than hinder the efforts of the Reserve Bank to bear down on inflation. At the same time we judged that the household sector was under considerable strain, which is why we were determined not to compromise in any way on our election commitment to deliver tax cuts. Finally, we recognised that, with the Australian economy running close to full capacity after years of neglect of the physical infrastructure of our economy, education and training and health, we needed to begin planning a nation-building program that would put Australian prosperity on a more secure basis. We needed to plan that modernisation and we needed to begin to set aside the resources that would allow us to execute those plans. That was the budget strategy we put in place five months ago and those were the circumstances it was designed to address. It was a budget that struck the right balance between relief for families and long-term investment, a budget right for the times and geared for the challenges of the future. We anticipated in our budget what is now occurring, we were prepared for the challenges now unfolding and we got it right. The opposition told us we should have cut harder, despite having said before the budget that there was no need to make spending cuts. Others also told us we should have cut harder in the budget. But the Prime Minister and I had been taking careful soundings on the international climate and thought it wiser to strike a more careful balance. I think, day, people are very glad that we did. People told us the tax cuts would ruin the economy and we should cancel, cut or divert them. We insisted we could deliver them responsibly by making cuts elsewhere and we did. And I think, today, people are glad that we chose that path. Whether you look at the inflation problem or the turbulence in global financial markets, this has been a government working hard to stay ahead of the game and make the right decisions, popular or not, in the national terest. This brings me to the core of my assessment today. How is the economy evolving, particularly in the light of our budget strategy and forecasts and in the light of the seven years. June national accounts received yesterday? In the last week or so we have seen new numbers on business investment, exports, imports and the current account and now we have the national accounts for the June quarter. We have also seen the Reserve Bank cut the official interest rate by one quarter of a percentage point which, I am glad to say, was promptly passed on to variable rate home loans by the major commercial banks. We are in a position to outline a detailed assessment of the circumstances of the Australian economy. The first point I would make is that domestic demand growth has certainly slowed, much as expected in the budget forecasts. In the June quarter, domestic demand increased by 0.9 per cent. This is quite vigorous but slower than in the previous two quarters. As we expected at budget time, the biggest contribution to the slowdown in domestic demand growth came from household consumption. The cumulative impact of rising interest rates, which had increased by 200 basis points since March 2005, combined with unofficial rate rises by the commercial banks, has clearly taken its toll on household tobudgets. On top of this, the global oil price shock saw average petrol prices rise by 25c a litre in the space of three months. These factors were the main contributors to the 0.1 per cent fall in household consumption in the June quarter. That fall confirms the wisdom of proceeding with the tax cuts, which of course kicked in during the current quarter rather than the June quarter and will provide support to household budgets, as will this week's much welcomed interest rate cut. We on this side of in the House were certainly heartened to see that the Reserve Bank was sufficiently confident of the direction of inflation to be able to lower interest rates-for the first time in Turning to other elements of demand, we begin to see how different the performance of this economy is from other developed economies. Business investment for example was up 4.0 per cent in the June quarter alone and contributed 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth in that quarter. This strength is most welcome. It is enlarging our capacity, helping to sustain employment and contributing to future productivity and growth. Creating room for the continuing expansion of business investment was one of the major objectives of our May budget. Last week's data on business investment intentions suggest that the strength we saw in the last quarter of last financial year will likely extend well into the current financial year. demonstrates that, despite global turmoil, businesses have the confidence to invest in the economy and the confidence to plan for yet more investment into the future. The June quarter accounts are pleasing in another respect as well, which is the expansion of export volumes. In the June quarter alone export volumes increased 2.7 per cent-the biggest quarterly increase in almost five years. We saw in the current account data earlier in the week that in the June quarter Australia achieved the first quarterly trade surplus in over six years-another very welcome development. So while we are not immune from global difficulties we do have grounds for optimism. We acknowledged in the budget that, given the global difficulties and the impacts of successive rate rises flowing through our economy, economic growth would slow and that this would lead to a modest rise in unemployment. But, as recent events have demonstrated, Australia is well placed in comparison to other developed economies and the Rudd government is determined to secure this advantage. Because many of the global challenges we face are beyond Australia's control, the government is focused on those things that we can control-that we can influence. We delivered a strong surplus to bear down on inflation, to buffer against international turbulence and to give us the flexibility to respond to today's challenges. We made room in the budget to deliver tax cuts for working families-$7 billion in tax cuts this year; half a billion each month. And we have begun the process of modernising our economy and expanding our productive capacity for the long term. We have laid the foundation of $40 billion of responsible investment in our nation-building funds and, It all up, $76 billion in total infrastructure investment. Genuine nation building means lifting the productive capacity of the economy road by road, port by port, cable by cable, university by university and trade school by trade school. It means boosting productivity, lifting our international competitiveness and investing in human capital. These are the fundamentals of a modern competitive economy, where all our efforts are directed. Building a new platform of growth with low inflation is going to take time and disciplined effort. The business community are confidently investing in our economy's future. The Rudd government will stand with them in this effort, helping provide the critical infrastructure and the skills they need. We are determined not to make the same mistake those opposite made. The mistake that was made by those opposite was to celebrate prosperity but do so little to sustain it. The House would have heard me say before that Australia is not immune from global difficulties which are slowing the world economy, but we are better placed than most countries to withstand the fallout. Given your pick of developed country to be, in these circumstances, you would choose Australia, for all of the reasons I have outlined above. But of course we are far from complacent. We are focused on delivering responsible economic management so we can have strong growth with low inflation well into the future. Our strategy, which combines a strong surplus, relief for families, and long term investment in nation building and growth, is the best way to respond to the global challenges Australia faces. I thank the House. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Wentworth to speak for 17 minutes. Leave granted.",116
290,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent Mr Turnbull speaking for a period not exceeding 17 minutes. Question agreed to.,121
291,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I thank the Treasurer for what is not so much an economic statement as a confession of incompetence. It is welcome nonetheless, although the Treasurer should recall what Mark Twain said, ‘A confession is good for the soul and bad for the reputation.' We have seen today a new approach from the Treasurer-a first. He has spoken well of the Australian economy. He has been right to speak well of our economy. As I have been saying all year-whereas he has not-our economy is stronger than those of comparable developed economies, our financial system is more secure, our mortgage lending practices are more prudent and our rates of default are relatively low. The Treasurer should have been shouting that from the rooftops all year, but he was not. He says that he identified the magnitude of the inflation challenge shortly after the election and he implies that the remarks that he made about inflation were made with the advice of the Reserve Bank and the Treasury. I cannot accept that either the Reserve Bank or the Treasury advised him to say ‘the inflation genie is out of the bottle'. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been an economic tag teamrecklessness leaning on the shoulder of irresponsibility, the Treasurer talking about an inflation genie out of the bottle and the Prime Minister talking about an inflation monster stalking the land, wreaking havoc on working families. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",121
292,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"At the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Ecoornomics hearing in April, the member for Aston put the Treasurer's remarks-those disgraceful remarks about the inflation genie being out of the bottle-to the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Glenn Stevens. Remember that it was on the day before the Reserve Bank met in February that the Treasurer chose to say that the inflation genie was out of the bottle. It was the day before the Reserve Bank met to consider how it should respond to inflationary pressures in Australia that the Treasurer said inflation was out of control. Mr Stevens gave his commentary on the Treasurer in April. He replied to the member for Aston with every syllable dripping with distaste for the Treasurer's recklessness. The governor said: I do not want to comment on colourful things that are said in public debate, but what we have said is inflation has risen and that is a problem. It has to be dealt with and we are dealing with it. We will contain it and it will come down. Is it out of control? No, I have never said that. I have tried, if you like, to make balanced comments that one cannot say that there is not a problem. There is a problem, but I do not think it is out of control. I think it will be controlled, and that is why we are doing what we are doing. So, there is a problem, a response is needed, it is being made and it will work. That was the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Consider the measured language from the Governor of the Reserve Bank compared to what we had from the Treasurer. We have had a Treasurer all year who in pursuit of a simple political objective-to blacken the economic reputation of the Howard government-has talked up inflation and talked down our economy. And we have paid a very heavy price for it. The Treasurer has talked today about a number of other developed countries in which economic activity is slower and which either have zero growth or are going backwards. He has pointed out that our economy is stronger than those other developed countries, and he is right to do so. He should have been doing so all year. But that begs the question: if our economy is stronger than those of other developed countries, why is it that confidence is so low? Since the election of the Rudd government, Australia has experienced the largest drop in consumer confidence in the OECD, according to the OECD's standardised consumer confidence indicator. That indicator for Australia has dropped 13.7 per cent since November, whereas the overall indicator for the OECD has dropped by only 4.6 per cent. The drop in Australia was by far the largest in the tire OECD. As I pointed out in a question that the Prime Minister chose not to answer-he does not answer any questions in this House anymore-Australia currently has the second lowest level of consumer confidence in the OECD after Spain. So what has made the difference? Why can an economy that is so relatively strong have a business community and consumers that are so relatively lacking in confidence?

The Rudd government has misrepresented every significant economic issue that we have dealt withMr Turnour interjecting Mr Irons interjecting Mr Robert interjecting Mr Turnour interjecting,122
294,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I interrupt the shadow Treasurer. The exchange is ridiculous and unparliamentary. Stop it. Member for Wentworth, please continue.",122
295,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We have been told that the government is proud that it is levying a lower percentage of GDP in tax revenues this current year than in the last year of the Howard government. That is true, but it is true for one reason only: the Rudd government has implemented almost all of the tax cuts proposed by the Howard government which were set out in the pre-election financial outlook. When you look at the Treasurer's own Budget Paper No. 1, you see over the forward estimates that there is $19.7 billion of additional taxes. In other words, were it not for the policy changes of the Rudd government, tax as a percentage of GDP would be lower over the forward estimates than is set en- out in the Rudd government's first budget papers. So that claim to some sort of fiscal rectitude is completely bogus. It is no wonder that when that was raised with the Prime Minister today he was unable or unwilling to answer the question. We have been told that if the $6 billion worth of unmandated, unwarranted and unnecessary tax increases are blocked by the Senate-if the Senate does not pass themthat will cause interest rates to rise. We have been told that this $6 billion will punch a hole in the $22 billion surplus. The $22 billion surplus is for one year only and the $6 billion is over four years, so that statement too is completely false. The $1.5 billion, approximately, of Commonwealth revenues that would be reduced by reason of those tax bills not being passed by the Senate could not have any conceivable impact on inflation whatsoever other than to put a slight upward pressure on prices, because all of those taxes would increase prices-be it for cars, alcohol or gas. But $1.5 billion a year in a $1.1-plus trillion economy obviously can have no material effect on aggregate demand and, hence, no material effect on inflation-again, another economic proposition that is nonsense. And then we have the extraordinary falsehood told to us about Fuelwatch. We are told that Fuelwatch is there to protect independent retailers, to protect competition and to bring down fuel prices. Yet we know that every expert department in this city told the government that it would put prices up. And we know from Michael Luscombe, the Chief Executive of Woolworths-a big oil retailer-that, based on his experience with Fuelwatch in Western Australia, it delivers his giant corporation its best margins. So much for the question of who is on the side of big oil. Fuelwatch is on the side of big Then we come to another great economic issue that the government made so much of, and where it has again shown its complete incompetence, its complete impotence, and that is grocery prices. For all of last year Prime Minister was going around supermarkets feeling sorry for shoppers-sharing their pain, so he said-and then he comes up with a website called GROCERYchoice. It provides averages of the cost of shopping baskets a month ago, averaged over a very large number of stores, in some cases over gigantic geographic areas, and sets them out as ‘Coles', ‘Woolworths', ‘Aldi'-if Aldi is present-and then ‘independents'. Because ‘independents' includes everything from 24hour grocery stores, which quite reasonably charge higher prices for greater convenience, and larger stores that are competing on price with Woolworths and Coles, it makes the independents appear more expensive than they are. It defames and misrepresents the independent grocery sector. It is nothing more than an advertisement for Coles and Woolies. It is as though the government wants to look after Michael Luscombe-not just big oil, but big retailers as well. So $14 million for GROCERYchoice and no useful information other than an advertisement for Coles and Woolies. We were told in the Treasurer's address that capacity constraints in Australia are tighter because of the neglect by the previous government. Really? Almost all productive capacity in Australia is in the hands of the private sector. When growth is strong, capacity utilisation is high. When capacity limits are beginning to be stretched, business invests in new capacity-new premises are required, new equipment is ordered, more staff is hired. High levels of capacity utilisation are signs of a strong economy. High levels of spare capacity and low levels of capacity utilisation are signs of a weak economy. oil. Empty factories and equipment that is not running are signs of a weak economy. When everything is working at full tilt, that is the sign of a strong economy. But high levels of capacity utilisation are not enough in themthe selves to promote investment. That is the ideal. As capacity is getting close to full utilisation, owners of businesses invest in more capacity. That is what we want to see, and we were seeing that under the previous government. But that requires confidence as well. So it is not just high utilisation of your capacity; you have got to have confidence and faith that better times are ahead, that the nation's economic destiny is being steered by people who know what they are doing. That is why this collapse in confidence in Australia has been so dangerous. Without that confidence, there will be no improvement in capacity, because there will be no confidence to invest. Confidence is at the core of everything in our economy. We talk about a global credit squeeze, a global credit crisis. It is a crisis in confidence. And the melancholy fact is that the international financial markets appear to have no more confidence in our economy than they do in those that are travelling much worse than ours. Why is that? It is because for all of this the Treasurer and his colleague the Prime Minister-irresponsibility and recklessness together-have been talking down the economy and talking up inflation. They have done that for a political purpose and we have all paid a price. There was a clear difference between the Treasurer and me at the beginning of this year. He was egging on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates, saying that inflation was out of control-not the moderate language he uses today, where he says that it is a lem, with which we can all agree; not the moderate language of Glenn Stevens. When he was using that dramatic language, talking up inflation, I urged the Reserve Bank to stay its hand. I expressed the view that the global credit squeeze would be very tough on Australia, that we would get more than enough monetary tightening from the international financial markets, that the global credit squeeze would achieve all of the interest rate pressure that the Reserve Bank could want without it having to raise rates. These are all questions of judgement, and it is hard to say who was right and who was wrong. But I staked my position on the side of prudence, of caution, of looking after the Australian economy, of speaking of its strengths and seeking to protect it against a global credit crisis. The Treasurer exposed us to the credit crisis. He did nothing to speak of the strength of Australia. He did everything to make us appear worse. He said that there have been abrupt changes in the government's economic policy since the election. Well, there have been abrupt changes. We have had a government who have talked the economy down. We had a Treasurer who, in the lead-up to the budget, said that it would be a harsh one-cutting spending, inflicting pain. An anxious nation awaited the axe, and what did we get? We year got a budget whose impact was at best neutral; in truth, slightly inflationary. They had the audacity to stand up in the House and quote from an economic report from Goldman Sachs JBWere, my old firm, but they did not even have the time to read through it, because what it said-in the faintest of faint praise-was that the best thing that could be said about the budget was that it did not make inflation any worse. We do have a strong economy. We do have a resilient economy. We do have a pruprobdent and well-managed financial sector. But what we do not have is leadership with vision, with courage and with the preparedness to stand up for this nation. (Time expired) NA",122
296,Dr KELLY,ADJOURNMENT,Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (4.45 pm)-I move: That the House do now adjourn. Fadden Electorate: Helensvale Bravehearts,124
297,Mr ROBERT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to support the plan to build an AFL stadium at Helensvale in my electorate as the home ground for the 17th AFL franchise team, which will come to the Gold Coast. I also rise to call on the Labor state government in Queensland to work with the Gold Coast City Council with respect to including Helensvale as a station for the light-rail hub. Helensvale is the fastest-growing electorate in the nation; it grew by 31.6 per cent between 2001 and 2006. The fact that Helensvale is actually being viewed as a potential home for the new AFL stadium is testimony to the strength of the economy in the local area and the growth in Fadden. The local community in Fadden, particularly in Helensvale, has exploded, with the construction of Helensvale train station, new developments, a shopping centre, and now possibly an AFL stadium. The state government is progressing with light rail, having announced that that will be the preferred way of moving to a mass-transit system. But the closest station to Helensvale that is currently being considered is at Harbour Town, which is 5.5 kilometres away. The new stadium, as proved conclusively at Robina stadium, will bring with it new business precincts, increased numbers of tourists and, of course, the tens of thousands of people who come along on game night. It is incongruous to consider that a new light-rail system would go into provide mass transit across the Gold Coast but would not take it to Helensvale, where the new AFL stadium is proposed to be. There is a railway station at Helensvale for the electric train system, which moves mass numbers of passengers north to Brisbane and south towards the New South Wales border. But there is nothing that moves east-west, which is why having a light-rail station at Helensvale makes an enormous amount of sense. If we assume that the GC17 bid is successful, as I certainly hope it is, and that the stadium is built at Helensvale, it makes sense to have the light rail there. I join in supporting His Worship the Mayor Ron Clarke in making sure that a light-rail station is at Helensvale. hope the Bligh Labor government will seriously review the current light-rail plan and include funding for Helensvale station. I also wish GC17 and their 20,000 supporters-of which I am one-the best of luck in procuring the 17th national team licence to enable AFL to be played on the Gold Coast in 2011. In conclusion, I would also encourage the work of Bravehearts and its founder and CEO, Hetty Johnson. It was great to see so many members of both parties wearing a Bravehearts badge to recognise and support White Balloon Day next Tuesday, 9 September, and National Child Protection Week next week. Our society and, indeed I-and I hope I speak for all members of parliament-will not accept child sexual assault or abuse in our communities. It is interesting that Bravehearts reported that, as a result of the first White Balloon Day and other initiatives, the number of disclosures of child sexual assault increased by over 500 per cent. I encourage the community to support the great work of Bravehearts and other child advocate organisations. I especially encourage them to make a stand and a statement next week, particularly on Tuesday, 9 September for White Balloon Day. Kingston Electorate: Public Transport",124
298,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to raise an issue that is very important in my electorate, and that is the issue of public transport in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. There are many new homes being built in my electorate and there is an imperative to ensure that these new suburbs, as well as the existing suburbs in my electorate, are serviced by good public transport. It is estimated that over the next 15 years the population in the outer metropolitan areas of Adelaide is set to double. We need to make sure that the infrastructure is there to accommodate this growing populaI tion, including by providing a good public transport system. With the price of petrol going up and with growing concerns about global warming, using public transport is becoming a more affordable option for many people. This is particularly the case in the southern suburbs, where many people in my electorate commute to the CBD of Adelaide. If you take a car, this takes around 50 minutes. However, the public transport option is attractive not only for enabling commuters to get around more easily but also for governments who are looking to make a significant impact in reducing carbon emissions and urban congestion on our roads. In my electorate, there is a train line that goes from Adelaide to the suburb of Noarlunga. I would like to take this opportunity to applaud the South Australian state government's recent announcement to electrify this rail line. This will be a key measure to allow for a faster, quieter, more reliable and cleaner public transport service. When this train line was first constructed in Noarlunga, it was the obvious place for the line to end. However, over the years, the suburbs of Seaford and Aldinga have grown significantly. It is therefore inevitable that the Noarlunga rail line will need to be extended to the suburbs of Seaford and Aldinga. This project has been widely endorsed by local residents, including the Seaford Residents Association. The South Australian state government has moved one step closer to extending the rail line by committing $34 million in its most recent budget to acquiring land to develop a transport corridor from Seaford to Aldinga. I certainly support this move, as it is one step closer to extending the line. The previous member for Kingston talked a lot about extending the rail line. However, he was never able to deliver one cent to this project. Why? It was because the previous federal government were intent on blaming the states rather than looking at how they could contribute to building the nation's public transport system. I am pleased that this government, the Rudd government, takes a different view. That is why I welcome wholeheartedly the announcement in this year's federal budget of $3 million to fund a transport sustainability study for Adelaide. This is a first for a federal government. I was pleased to announce recently at the Flinders Medical Centre the specific projects that the study will focus on. One of the projects that we need to tackle is the complex engineering issue of extending the Noarlunga rail line across the Onkaparinga River. The study does exactly that. It is a complex task to extend the bridge over the Onkaparinga River, as the width and the winding nature of the river make crossing difficult. However, the study will focus on solutions. The commitment of $3 million shows that the Rudd government is serious about being involved in the development of public transport and building a modern nation for the future. This has been backed up by the $20 billion Building Australia Fund. I am pleased to be part of a government that does make building our nation its priority. Emissions Trading Scheme",125
299,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to discuss the Rudd government's climate change legislation and, in particular, its plan for an emissions trading scheme in Australia and the effect it will have on my constituents in the Swan electorate. With reference to two of the many constituents who have approached me on this issue, I would argue that this scheme has the potential to severely disrupt business in Western Australia and I urge the government to consider a more effective way of dealing with this issue. I was recently contacted by two constituents who raised some extremely important points that I would like to take up with the House. The managing director of a locally based resource company contacted me, having read about the Labor government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The company in question has just completed a prefeasibility study for a major resource subsidiary project to take place in the goldfields region of WA. This constituent's assessment of the impact of the proposed legislation on his business is horrendous. It would not only stop his company from spending $1 billion in WA that would benefit all the people who live there with downstream benefits but also decimate the whole sector of his industry. It would make them less competitive by 16 per cent against their international competitors. This would see the shutdown of the industry in Australia and the massive export dollars that it earns. As there is so much uncertainty in the legislation, business investors worldwide are looking at Australia and thinking that we are taking a huge risk without global participation. This company has been trying to raise capital but overseas investors are prepared to take the risk, because of the uncertainty, and this will probably kill the $1 billion capital investment in Western Australia. If the current Rudd climate proposals become law, my constituent's company will not qualify for assistance as an emissionsintensive trade-exposed industry. Without this assistance, the industry would risk being out-competed globally by nations that are not burdened by a carbon tax-in this case, the Philippines, Russia and Indonesia. The uncertainty surrounding the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will make it difficult to attract investors. Ultimately the project may not go ahead, and that would cost WA jobs and it would be disastrous for the Australian economy. I have also been contacted by the director of a public company based in WA-again in my electorate and again regarding the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The company is looking at investing $2 billion into a resource extraction plant in a high unemployment region of Australia. Under the Rudd government's climate change proposals, this project would be liable for an estimated $40 million in tax per year. Again it seems likely that this company would not qualify for assistance as an emissionsintensive trade-exposed industry. If there is no temporary protection against this tax it is likely that the project will be discontinued and relocated to a more favourable business climate, probably in Asia. Australia would lose an opportunity for $300 million to $500 million in foreign currency. These pleas for help from local businesses demonstrate several points. First, the uncertainty surrounding the CPRS caused by the Rudd government's confusion is crippling Australian industry. The Rudd government is very happy to announce these grand policies-the Prime Minister's ‘grand designs' not for the country-but they seem never to be properly costed and thought through. Is it any wonder business confidence is at such an unprecedented low? Second, the Rudd government is rushing through these proposals without any appreciation of the damage they are doing to the competitiveness of businesses in Australia. Third, the Rudd government clearly underestimates or just does not care about the number of jobs that will potentially be lost by such a scheme. I do not believe that the examples I have just raised are isolated and I do not believe I am overstating the threat to Australian businesses. I would like to read to the House an extract from the Australian newspaper of Friday, 22 August 2008 titled ‘Carbon plan a company killer'. It says: A “real world” analysis of the impact of the Government's plans based on 14 companies that opened their books for the Business Council of Australia revealed that even with the Government's proposed compensation, three firms would face a carbon cost so high they would close. The future of another two of the 14 companies drawn from hard-hit sectors such as aluminium refining, cement manufacture, petroleum refining, steel making, sugar milling and zinc and nickel refining would be extremely bleak. The companies, with annual revenues ranging from $90 million to more than $3 billion, revealed their confidential financial data to BCA consultants Port Jackson Partners on the basis that their identity would remain secret. But the research shows that on average, the companies' pre-tax earnings would be cut by 22 per cent. The worse affected would suffer a 136 per cent reduction in earnings. I am not a climate sceptic; I am a climate realist. I understand the need for action to cut the world's carbon pollution, but I feel dutybound to ensure that this happens in a responsible manner. That is why the coalition supports, in principle, an ETS as part of a three pillars approach to climate change. (Time expired)",126
300,Mr TURNOUR,ADJOURNMENT,"Leichhardt) (4.58 pm)On 5 June this year, the Qantas group made an announcement that would reverberate through tropical North Queensland communities. A significant reduction in international flights between Cairns and Japan-our strongest provider of international touristshas been planned. The decision by Qantas to cut these flights means the loss of an estimated 62 per cent of total flight seat capacity to Japan, which equates to approximately 3,500 seats per week. This is a significant impact for the tropical north, and some economic analysis shows the potential financial loss to Cairns equates to about $100 million. Earlier this week, the Minister for Tourism, Martin Ferguson, announced the release of the regional tourism profiles that provide regional communities with thorough and meaningful data about tourism in their area. The profile for tropical North Queensland states that, last year alone, visitors spent $2.8 billion in the region. Four-point-two million visitors were drawn to the region, helping to support more than 7,100 tourism related businesses. Given my limited amount of time, I want to make the point that tourism is doing it tough in tropical North Queensland. It has been great working with the minister. I am looking forward to his visit to my electorate on Sunday and Monday and to visiting a number of tourism operators up there to experience what they provide. It is going to be a great opportunity for us to work with the industry and outline some of the measures that will be put in place in terms of a $4 million package that the federal government has committed to support tourism in Queensland.",128
