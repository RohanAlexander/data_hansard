1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA (PETROLEUM ACCESS REGIME) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Latham.",13
2,Mr LATHAM,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (12.31 p.m.)The Trade Practices Amendment (Petroleum Access Regime) Bill 1997 seeks to provide a legal right for each of Australia's 9,000 service stations to shop around for competitively priced wholesale petrol. It establishes, for the first time in Australia, an active wholesale petrol market. It breaks up, for the first time in this country, the vertically integrated control of the industry exercised by the major petrol companies. This bill, through the establishment of an open market for wholesale petrol, gives Australian motorists, primary producers and businesses their best chance for lower petrol prices. Both the petrol distributors association-APADA-and the Service Stations Association have estimated that the passage of these provisions through the parliament would lower retail prices by up to 6c per litre. The greatest price benefits would be enjoyed in regional Australia-such as Tasmania where the 'Four Sisters' presently take three to four times the wholesale profit per volume of petrol sold in that state compared to Melbourne. This is a bill the government should embrace and pass as soon as possible. Only through downstream terminal access-legally mandated and guaranteed--can the coalition parties fulfil their major election commitment to lower petrol prices around Australia and narrow the city-country differential. The government knows that this industry lacks active wholesale competition. The government knows that the petrol multinationals use their vertically integrated control of the industry-from refinery stage to bowserto exploit motorists and enjoy oligopoly rents. But this is a government unwilling to act. Its only plan is to move down the path of deregulation, giving the oil majors more power and more vertical control, especially at the retail level. The government knows the problem but will not embrace the only common sense solution-downstream access to petrol terminals under part IlIA of the Trade Practices Act. On 7 January, the National Party's self styled spokesperson on petrol, Mr MCGauran, 'criticised petrol price rises during the holiday break saying that in some cases it was blatant exploitation'. He told the Australian Financial Review that the government embarked on deregulation 'on the assumption that this was a competitive market, but inexplicable price rises raise questions about exactly how competitive it is' . It is not too late for the government to abandon its deregulation plans. This bill shows it how. The National Party, in particular, needs to stand to up the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and his hand-in-glove relationship with the petrol multinationals. Part IlIA of the Trade Practices Act is designed to provide downstream retail access in vertically integrated, monopoly and oligopoly markets. It was introduced by the former Labor government to secure consumer benefits in electricity, gas and like markets. It can legitimately be applied to the private sector as much as public utilities. The structure of the petrol industry in Australia is the same as electricity-that is, a largely undifferentiated product with a concentrated market structure, integrated between the production, distribution and retail stages. A handful of companies in Australia own each of the nation's petrol refineries and terminals. They have substantial ownership interests and control at the distribution stage. Through company owned, branded and tightly franchised service stations they effectively control the retail market. The major companies have developed a market area pricing-MAP-system to manipulate retail prices and effectively sidestep the ACCC's industry monitoring. In recent weeks, employees from the major companies have contacted me to explain their role in the MAP system. Their job is to drive around the local area each moming and report back to head office on what the other major brands are charging. This indicative price minus a small retail margin then forms the basis of the buying price made available to individual retailers. Through this system and the manipulation of transport subsidies and service station rebates, the major companies are able to maximise their profits. For consumers, it frequently means higher prices during the holiday season and on weekends, plus local price variations and a city-country price differential which cannot be explained in terms of transport costs. The MAP system is proof positive that the anti-competitive features of the petrol industry in Australia sit in the boardrooms of Shell, BP, Mobil and Ampol-not among the country's 9,000 service station small businesses. The petrol retail sector in Australia is already competitive. This bill aims to apply competition policy to the wholesale sector, that is, for existing service stations and new buyer cooperatives---especially in the bush-a downstream legal right to obtain product at commercially negotiated prices, terms and conditions that may be subject to ACCC analysis and determination. When the government talks about terminal access it means only physical access-the right to purchase wholesale petrol, but on terms and conditions dictated to by the oil majors. This bill seeks to entrench competitive price access into the laws of the Commonwealth. It applies the same market principles which the oil majors apply to themselves through their horizontal sharing of terminal facilities. This is the great irony of the current market structure. I commend the bill to the House and seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Leave granted. (Time expired) Bill read a first time.",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES' NA NA 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Allan Morris.",14
4,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMPENSA TION AMENDMENT BILL,"I refer to these amendments as the Adamthwaite amendments. They arose from a case of a constituent that I dealt with over the last couple of years and which concluded in a hearing at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 30 August. It related to an injury suffered by a young woman working at the Commonwealth Bank just over 10 years ago who eventually was deemed by Comcare to not have a work-related injury. The medical evidence in the case was overwhelming. There was never a question of the injury not existing, and there was never a question of her not having been injured at work. The young woman lacked the resources to engage legal advice. She was unable to obtain medical witnesses on her behalf and, eventually, in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the case was simply presented by her and me. Subsequently, I sought information from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) by questions on notice as to why a case of this nature was dealt with. The response from the minister to question No. 884 is in fact incorrect in so far as it suggests that the decision not to mediate or to undergo mediation was not made by Comcare when in fact it was. My advice has been that the question of mediation was raised with the tribunal member, who indicated that it was up to the Government Solicitor acting for Comcare to agree to that, which was not forthcoming. By way of the same question I sought to establish the cost of this process. The information available to date indicates a cost of somewhere in the vicinity of $9,000 to $10,000. This does not include Comcare's barrister costs and, of course, it did not include the costs of the applicant, which were awarded. As a parliamentarian, I make no charge. I represented this young woman simply as a constituent. The all-up cost most likely would have been more than $20,000. I started to ask around as to what was happening, why Comcare took this course of action and why we needed to have cases dealt with at that high legalistic level at massive expense, somewhere in the vicinity of $40,000 of actual costs incurred by both parties, when the evidence was so overwhelming. Mr Speaker, I should point out that we won the case. The fact is that I and my constituent presented our case before a senior member of the tribunal against the Government Solicitor, a barrister, a doctor brought up from Sydney for the day and an ex-Commonwealth Bank bank manager. Against all of that, the decision was to support my constituent. That is why I have proposed this amendment. The amendment proposes to change legislation which would in fact allow a first level appeal on Comcare to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, a process whereby people can sit, talk and look at the evidence. That is a process which does not involve lawyers and which does not involve incredible expense; it involves a tribunal assessment of whether or not there are medical grounds, how the injury has occurred and whether it is work related. The precedent exists already for the SSAT, which was used by Austudy . We extended the use of that tribunal to Austudy, particularly in the case of homelessness. So there is already a precedent for that particular body to be used by other departments. In this situation the fact is that, on the basis of a single medical advice, a person can be deemed by Comcare not to have a work-related injury; and from that point their only point of appeal is ly to a court, which can impose enormous costs and enormous pressure on them and is an enormous waste of funds. So the amendment is a simple one. It basically allows a right of appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which is more sensible, much more humane and much less expensive. That still allows the right of either party to appeal to the AAT. I commend this bill to the House and seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum associated with this legislation. Leave granted. (Time expired) Bill read a first time.",14
5,Mr SPEAKER,COMPENSA TION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA People's Constitutional Convention",15
6,Mr TED GRACE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) condemns the proposal by the Prime Minister to establish a People's Constitutional Convention and to promote at a referendum any consensus that emerges on the question of a Republic; (2) notes the likelihood that a People's Convention would comprise appointed representatives only and that such a Convention would be biased in its recommendations; (3) calls on the Government to hold an indicative plebiscite to enable Australians to decide whether they want a Republic or not; and (4) calls on the Government to legislate to exclude persons who are not Australian citizens from voting in referenda or plebiscites. It gives me great pleasure today to refer my motion to the House in what I consider to be the opening batting in what is going to be a long debate in Australia regarding the republic. I realise also that anybody who gets up in any forum, not just this House, with an accent like mine will obviously be treated with a certain amount of scepticism or bias. Before I get on to my motion, I would like to disvirtualpense with, in general, some of those scepticisms. I have not been inundated, but I have had some nasty letters since my motion appeared in the Notice Paper in the middle of last year. Some of the references in those letters upset me enormously. Unfortunately, some of the references are also being used by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and members of the government as red herrings to detract people away from the actual point we are trying to make about a republic. The first is that we are anti-British and that we hate the Queen. That particularly upsets me because I happen to come from a family who lost 14 members in the Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War, including my paternal grandfather in the First World War and my own mother and father in the Second World War. I have stated that in this House on previous occasions. It particularly upsets me that anybody should say to me, 'You and your ilk are anti-British.' As far as Her Majesty is concerned, I will not say I hate to admit but I will claim that I am the only member of this House who stood outside Buckingham Palace with my wife and other family members waving my little Union Jack on the day of the coronation. I am not quite sure I would do it again for the other members of her family. Nevertheless, that dispenses with that. If I have time, I will come back to some of the other red herrings. The Prime Minister does a lot of chest thumping about keeping the promises he made during the election-and at least he is keeping one promise, having broken enough already. I refer the House to an article in the Telegraph last week by Piers Ackerman. He is not a journalist whom I would normally agree with, and I am quite sure some people on the other side of the House would not agree with him either. But I think he hit the nail on the head in some of the points he made in the argument he put up. I quote one of the main points he makes: The Coalition-in Opposition-set its sights on a People's Convention but that surely is an unnecesI sary duplication of effort. The Federal Parliament is already a standing People's Convention. The point I make about the Prime Minister is that he does not really trust the Australian people to make up their minds. It is a very simple question to be put to the Australian people. I suggest in part (3) of my motion that it be put through a plebiscite to the Australian people whether or not they want this country to become a republic. It is a very simple question, demanding a very simple answer. The procrastinations of the present Prime Minister and the government suggest that they do not trust the Australian people to do that. They trusted them last March when they elected them-that was okay-but for a simple question we now have to have a people's convention, which will be loaded by pro-monarchists, by a pro-monarchist Prime Minister and a pro-monarchist government. The propositions that will be put to the Australian people, I fear, will not be fair and above board because, of the people who are elected by the people to this convention, there are bound to be 50 per cent who are promonarchist. As I said, I am neither pro-monarchist nor anti-British; I am all about independence. I am all about an independent head of this country. My opinions go back to 1975 when the duly elected government of this country was dismissed by a representative of the Queen. I point out that it is questionable-and I have not been able to find out even from the Parliamentary Library-whether the Queen has that privilege in her own country. And yet her representative in Australia can dismiss a government. As far as I can understand the Queen's powers in England, she would take the advice of the Prime Minister. I cannot imagine a Prime Minister in Australia demanding that the Queen or her representative dismiss a government. So that is my first and major point. I reserve any criticism to part (4) of my motion, about which I feel very strongly. Some of my colleagues on both sides of the House probably do not agree with me on this. disagree wholeheartedly with non-Australian citizens voting in any constitutional reform in this country. I think it is obscene. Estimations differ, but we have in this country about one million people-nearly 300,000 of them residing in New South Wales-who have not taken the trouble to take up the Bible and give their allegiance to this country. I have spoken to some of them and their answer is, 'We built this country. We made it what it is.' My answer to them is that, sure, they helped to build this great country-and they were very well rewarded for it. They were allowed to live here and bring up their families here, but their bigotry and bias prevent them from taking that last move to become an Australian citizen. Most of the people I have spoken to like that have no intention of doing so. I think it is obscene that it is such a large proportion of people. Take my own state of New South Wales. Even if it is not 600,000 people, if it is 300,000, that would no doubt disqualify New South Wales from taking part or being counted in a plebiscite or a referendum to change our constitution, because a majority of states have to agree. The most heavily populated state in Australia could be a no vote and it would be a no vote purely because it would be dominated by people who are not citizens of this country. It is as simple as that: they are not citizens of Australia. I do It reads: not care where they come from; they have not taken that final step. That worries me. If the Prime Minister-as it seems he will-holds a convention, I would respectfully suggest that that would be one of the areas that should be corrected before it is put to the people. The debate will obviously go on in other forums for a very long time. I refer again to Ackerman's article. I think that the amount of money being put forward-and this government is obviously very cost conscious-for a talkfest in Old Parliament House is ridiculous. The Australian people should be trusted. They are quite capable of answering a simple question on whether they want a republic for this country. If the answer is no-and I have been described as 'you and your ilk' - I have news for those people: 'I and my ilk' will accept the Australian people's answer. If they do not want a republic, fair enough. If they do want a republic, the matter should come back to the duly elected people of this country whom the population has trusted and put hereimmaterial what party we represent-and we are the people who should then come up with suggestions on the republic and other changes in the constitution, particularly the one relating to part (4) of my motion. Then it should be put to a referendum as to what the Australian people want. I specify again that it should be put to a referendum but not one that is voted on by non-CItIzenS of this country. I commend the motion to the House.",15
7,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded? Mrs Crosio-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,17
8,Mr ANDREWS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Menzies) (12.53 p.m.)In politics, as elsewhere in life, prematurity can cause problems. The motion being debated today, having been proposed by the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) on 16 September last year, was at best-as events of the past week have illustratedpremature. At worse, it portrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the political and legal basis on which the Australian constitution is constructed. The honourable member did not go to his motion, but let us go to it in detail. (l) condemns the proposal by the Prime Minister to establish a People's Constitutional Convention and to promote at a referendum any consensus that emerges on the question of a Republic; (2) notes the likelihood that a People's Convention would comprise appointed representatives only and that such a Convention would be biased in its recommendations; (3) calls on the Government to hold an indicative plebiscite to enable Australians to decide whether they want a Republic or not; and (4) calls on the Government to legislate to exclude persons who are not Australian citizens from voting in referenda or plebiscites. Apart from the last part, which involves some questions of mechanics, the motion involves at least three propositions: firstly, a rejection of a representative forum to discuss the issues of constitutional change; secondly, a negation of the principle of a deliberative assembly; and, thirdly, by implication, a denial of the federal nature of the Australian constitution. This is not some ordinary motion that we debate in this place from week to week. What it does is represent an attitude. It presents a mind set-an orientation towards the governance of this nation-which is either misguided or unreflective. I say that with no personal ill-will for the honourable member for Fowler who, in other respects, is an honourable member and upholds his position quite well. But what he does in condemning a people's convention and seeking a direct plebiscite is reject a representative forum, yet our constitution was founded by a representative forum. Our government--Dur parliament-comprises a representative forum and there is good reason for this. As James Madison, one of the founding fathers of that great republic, the United States, pointed out: [It is the function of representative government] to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice temporary or partial considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves ... What Madison was voicing in the United States in 1787 was what Edmund Burke said, in other words to the same effect, in Bristol 13 years before: Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion. Burke, of course, was able to justify his stance partially because of the distance between Bristol and London and the time involved in travel. But his position, I believe, is the only basis of intelligent government. What the honourable member's motion proposes is, firstly, that we ignore the wisdom of a representative assembly in favour of an unreflected opinion. Secondly, the motion negates the notion of a deliberative assembly. As Madison pointed out again: As the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free governments, ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers, so there are particular moments in public affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the blow mediated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind. In other words, an outcome most beneficial to society is likely after reflection and deliberation, where competing propositions can be put, tested and examined, rather than in a direct appeal to some popular sentiment of the moment. If this were not the case-and I heard the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who is at the table, interjecting before-then we ought to rescind the entire Commonwealth parliament forthwith, because that is what we have here-a reflective deliberative assembly. Surely there is no issue more worthy of it to careful deliberation, in which various propositions are voiced and tested, than the system of government itself, and that is what the honourable member's motion is all about. Not only does the convention involve a deliberative assembly; the government's proposal meets the fundamental tenets of representative government. Let us recall also that, following a convention, any consensus proposition will then be put to the people. Accordingly, the proposal involves two levels of decision making, so far as the nation is concerned. As John Stuart Mill pointed out on one occasion: The essence of constitutional government is that every authority should be forced to consider ""whether its acts will be concurred in by another constituted authority"", and should not be ""exposed to the corrupting influence of undivided power, even for the space of a single year"". It is this proposal that the government seeks to emulate. It is this principle that the honourable member's motion rejects. It is also why unicameral parliaments, such as in one state of this country and in the territories, can be dangerous creatures. There is a current fad, it seems, for direct democracy, leaving aside all the advances so far as representative government is concerned, and this motion panders to it. But it is a notion of direct democracy which the proponents, in the most part, of republicanism reject themselves when it is suggested that the people of Australia directly elect the head of state of a new republic. You simply cannot have it both ways. Perhaps the honourable member is not trying to have it both ways, but certainly some of the leading lights of the repUblican movement are, by saying, 'Let us have direct democracy,' on the one hand, leaving aside the whole principle of representative government-constitution by convention-under which this country has been governed. But when it comes to the question of how you actually appoint or choose the head of state, they want to set that aside when the people say, 'Let's vote for ourselves.' Thirdly, the honourable member's motion, by implication, denies the federal character of the Australian constitution. This Commonwealth of Australia was established after a series of meetings, stretching over almost a decade, at end of last century at which representatives of the then colonies deliberated. The essence of their efforts was the constitution of a federation in which the Commonwealth and the states would cooperate, but in which there remained a check on the powers of each. Given the fact that a change in the head of state nationally will have considerable ramifications for each state of Australia, not appropriate that there be some voice for the states in any deliberations about such changes? Fourthly, the motion betrays some imprecision which is evident in many discussions about a repUblic. What sort of republic is the honourable member talking about? How should the head of state be chosen? What powers should he or she be able to exercise? How does the head of state relate to the executive government of the day? They are four questions which are not dealt with with any degree of precision in the honourable member's motion. Are these not questions which the Australian people would want deliberated upon in some assembly where competing propositions can be put, where arguments can be raised and where people can say, for whatever reason, that they disagree with the proposition being put forward, and in that way come to a reflected opinion about the way we should go forward? That is what the Australian people are being denied in the honourable member's motion. Finally, there is a consideration which, though important in itself, is minor compared to those that I have articulated-that is, that this government, these parties occupying the Treasury benches, this coalition, promised a constitutional convention in the terms announced last week. I have with me the press release of 17 November 1994 where it was promised that the convention will comprise 50 per cent of delegates to be elected by the community and 50 per cent of delegates to be appointed. There will be a convention. It will be a deliberative assembly and it will recognise our federal character. Australia is one of only eight nations that have been continuously democratic in the 20th century. Given this stability, nothing short of careful deliberation is required.",17
9,Mrs CROSIO,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I had much pleasure in seconding the motion moved today by the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace). One of the things that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) forgot to say is that if this motion had is it not been on the Notice Paper six months before the announcement was finally made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) late last week then maybe the debate would not even have come up. To refer to the point made by the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), it probably is one of those core promises that have been delivered. When you look at the motion now before the House and hear the debate on it, you find that the Prime Minister's announcement last week of his people's constitutional convention really pleases very few people at all. The republicans naturally do not want it. They would much rather go straight to a referendum on whether the people want an Australian as their head of state, and if so, then a vote on the republic after that. The monarchists do not want it. I notice from looking at those speaking in this debate on this motion from the government benches that probably the one pro-republican from that side is speaking on this motion today. Most of them are now monarchists anyway. We are going to have a balanced debate from the government benches. If they had read the papers last week they would know that the monarchists certainly do not want what the Prime Minister has announced. They think the convention will give more credence to a republican movement which they believe is virtually non-existent. They, too, would prefer an immediate vote for an Australian head of state because they feel it would expose a widespread lack of support for the republican cause. The majority of Australians do not want it. They consider the convention will be nothing more than an all expenses paid gabfest for the intellectual elite. They know right now whether they want a republic or not and they are ready to vote accordingly. The only people who want a people's constitutional convention are the Prime Minister and a few of his supporters on the government benches. Now, why would that be? I believe it is for two reasons. Firstly, because it means that he gets to put a big tick in his ledger in the promises kept columnand we all know that he needs all the help he can get to fill the blank spaces. Secondly, because as one of the arch-foes of the republican cause, the Prime Minister knows the convention may assist him in wounding the republican push-perhaps mortally so. I hope not. Australians have been talking about the issue of a republic for well in excess of 20 years-and with even greater fervour during the last five or six. Whether they like the idea or not the majority of people know where they stand on this issue. Even for those among us who have not thought it through in any great detail, does the Prime Minister really think that the amount of discussion and publicity generated by having an indicative plebiscite on an Australian head of state, possibly followed by a similar vote on the republic, would not crystallise the matter for them? One thing is for certain. For these people, a constitutional convention is only going to muddy the waters. We will not see any consensus arise from its deliberations-quite the opposite. I predict the convention will be deadlocked from day one. We will see both sides of the debate talking at each other rather than with each other. In the end, the entire meeting will degenerate into a spat over national symbols, such as the flag, while the rest of Australia, to varying degrees, will either tear their hair out in frustration or just let out a loud, disinterested yawn. Neither will the convention, as the Prime Minister is hoping, effectively and for the long term demote the republican issue to fourth or fifth ranked status behind some of the more pressing matters on our plate such as unemployment, industrial relations and national savings. Rather, taking piecemeal steps, which is what the convention adds up to, certainly would not satisfy anybody. It will merely try the patience of ordinary Australians who would like to clear the issue up once and for all. A great many Australians may not rank the republic as the number one issue facing this country, but they certainly feel it is the most important issue related to our identity and our place in the world, especially as we near a watershed in this nation's life-the centenary of Federation. They will say, 'We've already elected our representatives in Canberra to think about these issues. Why do we now have to spend another $50 million of taxpayers' money electing more people to think about it, especially when I've already made up my mind?' While urging the Prime Minister to go back to the drawing board on this issue, I would also urge him to consider the rights of non-Australian citizens to vote in any referendum on an Australian head of state or a republic, as the honourable member for Fowler has indicated in his motion before the House. Especially important when approaching a vote on the republic, it is wise to remember that currently we do have approximately 300,000 people of British citizenship in this country, all of whom are eligible to vote but none of whom have decided to take out Australian citizenship. That is 300,000 people who may have a strong link to Australia, certainly, but it is not strong enough to join with us 100 per cent, to forgo their loyalty and allegiance to the UK. That is 300,000 people who are able to determine the national outcome in any referendum or plebiscite in this country. (Time expired)",19
10,Mr ABBOTT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (1.08 p.m.)-This motion is 12 months out of date, because it embodies the kind of thinking that was represented by the former Prime Minister, thinking which was decisively repudiated by the electorate last March and thinking which contributed very much to Labor's defeat, as has been made clear by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), by the former member for Petrie and indeed by the former Secretary of the ALP, Mr Bob Hogg. Also, this motion is a week behind the times, because we are in fact having an election for 50 per cent of the delegates, unlike what the statements in the motion indicate. The difference between the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is that the current Prime Minister is prepared to do what the people want, whereas the former Prime Minister wanted the people to do what he wanted to do. That is the difference. It is a very important difference and it is one that we should stick to. We need a convention because, unfortunately, a plebiscite is simply not going to clarify the issues. If we put to the Australian people the question: 'Do you or don't you want an Australian head of state?', everyone will be entitled to vote 'yes', because the fact is that we have an Australian head of state. The Governor General currently does all the things that a head of state would do. If it looks like a head of state, acts like a head of state and lives like a head of state, it is a head of state. In any event, under some of the republics which have been mooted, the 1975 problemwhich so upset the member for Fowler (Mr Grace)-is simply not going to be resolved. 'Do you or don't you want a repUblic?' is another possible plebiscite question, but what sort of a republic-the Irish republic, the French republic, the American republic, the Indian republic? These are issues that need to be resolved before we make that choice; otherwise, what the republicans are asking for is a blank cheque. I call upon the republicans in this House-those on the other side and, if there are any on this side, those on this sideto resolve exactly what sort of a republic they want, because it is not as easy as members opposite typically think. Members opposite typically want to give the vast powers, on paper, of the current Governor General to a president chosen and dismissed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament. They are vast powersat least on paper. They are powers to command the armed forces, to sign bills into law, to summon and prorogue parliament and to choose ministers to serve at his or her pleasure. At the moment those powers are exercised on prime ministerial advice because of the conventions governing the Crown. Those conventions will not necessarily apply to any president unless we make a very elaborate mechanism clear, and I call upon the republicans to do so. The fact is that all those powers will be given to a president who is virtually unsackable, because as long as that president has one-third support of both houses of parliament, he or she will be able to exercise those powers at his or her whim. That is a very serious prospect for the Australian people-not one to be entered into lightly. So I call upon the member for Fowler and other members supporting his motion to immediately clarify exactly what sort of republic they want. Until they have done that, what they are advocating is blank cheque republicanismand that is simply not good enough. Until they have done that, the real debate cannot really begin. We must know exactly what sort of republic is on offer before we are able to make an informed and intelligent choice about whether it is better than what we have. The second speaker on the other side, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), made a very grave admission. She said that a convention will be deadlocked from day one. What does that imply? Half of that convention will be elected by the people, the rest will at least in part comprise ex-officio representatives. Then there will be representatives of Aborigines, of women and of non-English speaking persons. So it will be a very representative convention. If that is going to be deadlocked from day one, the clear message is that the Australian people do not want-at least at this stage in their history-a republic. I tum to a final point in the member for Fowler's motion; that is, his request that people who are on the electoral rolls but are not citizens be excluded from any plebiscite or vote on a republic. I very much regret the fact that some British migrants in this country have failed to take out Australian citizenship. I have, the member for Fowler has, and I wish others would follow our example. But the idea of knocking off 600,000 or 300,000-whatever the number is-people from the electoral roll simply for this reason is an insidious and unfortunate form of ethnic cleansing. It is most unacceptable. It should not happen. I do not think the member for Fowler really means it. If it were to happen, this republic would be born in division; it would not be a republic for all Australians but a republic for some Australians. (Time expired)",20
11,Dr LAWRENCE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"FremantIe) (1.13 p.m.)I rise to support this motion. From what the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who has just finished speaking, has been saying, it is very clear that there are forces within government-including the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-who would have this debate stalled. They actually do not want the people to decide what form our government should take into the future. They do not want any kind of discussion that is likely to result in outcome. The idea that we can have a plebiscite on a simple question which, in some way, prevents a later referendum, is also extremely silly. It is possible to put a simple question about the general direction in which people want to go, then sit down and work out the detail of that question to go for a referendum. I do not see any conflict at all between those two positions. I want to raise a slightly different point today. Given that the government seems hellbent on having their so-called people's convention, which is only partially electedthereby belying the title, I must say-it is vital that they consider one very important group that I have not heard the Prime Minister, for one, mention in the course of this discussion. I take this opportunity to call upon the government to ensure that, in the event that this benighted convention goes ahead, at least half of the delegates are women. I have noted that the government have been prepared to talk about reserving places for young people and for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander members of our community, but I think they should go further and recognise that, in the 1990s, we do not want a repeat of what happened in the 1890s when women-making up then, as they do now, approximately half of the populationwere explicitly excluded from full participation. Mr Martin-He would.",22
12,Dr LAWRENCE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Probably. At this critical moment in our history it is absolutely essential, even if this convention is not being taken seriously by the government, that we take seriously the notion of comprehensive citizenship. Women were excluded from the conventions of the 1890s which led to our federation mostly because members were appointed-as half the members of this convention will be. But even where there was a vote taken there was only one woman who was in a position in South Australia who put her hand up to be considered. So women were excluded from the constitutional convention of 1891 and again in 1897-98. Interestingly, they were also excluded from voting on the referendum-so they had an neither the opportunity to shape the arguments of the debate nor the opportunity to vote on the referendum. If, as the government is insisting, this is to be a people's convention, it is essential that half the representatives be women. There are some people on the other side who might not have noticed, but women are people too. The days of accepting that men can represent women or that a few women will do are absolutely past. We have watched the new wave of women on the conservative benches remain silent while various matters affecting the status of women in this community have been debated; they have remained silent when changes have been made which are inimical to the interests of women. So it is that much more critical that both the elected and the nominated representatives of this convention, should it go through, be women. In the 1890s it was argued that men could represent women; that you did not actually need women to be there. They said that women's interests could be adequately represented 'by their male friends and relatives'. That was patronising and exclusive then and it would be even worse now. So everyone will be looking very closely at the composition of those who are nominated and those who are elected. If we are to have any concept of democracy it must clearly entail a link between those people who are elected and the electors. They must represent the people in that genuine and extensive sense. It is also a question of justice. What, in a system such as ours, would men think if they were outnumbered overwhelmingly by women in any decision-making body? I am sure they would not stand for it. If we were to ensure that, whatever the nature of this convention, half the representatives were women that would make some change to the normal imbalance in representative politics. It might give a spark to some of the women, including some in the New South Wales Liberal Party at the moment who might be aspiring to politics, to think that their views would be taken seriously on such an important issue. It is important to recognise too that as with men so with women: there is no homogeneity of point of view so it does not do to have just a few women; you need a wide variety representing a wide variety of points of view. I know that some members opposite might argue that because there are perhaps slightly older women in our society there might be a slightly more conservative bent amongst some women in voting on the republican question but from my point of view it is absolutely critical that the full range of views of women-young, old, in or out of the work force, retired or with young children-should be properly represented. I know everyone in this community will be looking very closely to see what sorts of people state and local governments throw up to speak for the community at large. I think it is time for government to layout its plan for the proper representation of women. (Time expired)",22
13,Mr HOCKEY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It gives me great pleasure to be able to speak on this motion before the House, given that there are a very large number of people within the federal parliamentary Liberal Party who do support the concept of Australia becoming a republic. It is quite ironic that the supposed great advocate of the republic, the previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was the catalyst for a popular policy espoused by the Liberal Party at the last election that there be a constitutional convention in relation to the matter of Australia becoming a republic, for until the last election it was always going to be Keating's republic. As a member of the Liberal Party who supports Australia becoming a republic, I must say that Paul Keating was the greatest impediment to our nation every becoming a republic. It is perhaps fitting that he is no longer here and that he should have very little say in the nation and at the constitutional convention. There is a very genuine attempt by this government to provide a forum through which all the views of the Australian people can be represented. There is a diverse range of views within all political parties. Yes, there are even constitutional monarchists within the Labor Party, although they have not yet had the courage to stand up and be counted. Mr Martin-Name them; its not our policy.",23
14,Mr HOCKEY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"If you are not careful, I will name them but I could be here for a while. There is a diverse range of views within the political parties and across the spectrum within Australia. There is also a varied view on the priority of this issue for the Australian people. But if it was good enough in the 1890s to have constitutional conventions that were going to decide whether we should become a federation, I think it is even more important that in the 1990s we provide a similar forum for the debate about how Australia should become a repUblic. People have often forgotten to reflect on the history of the development of our nation when they have debated this issue. The first national Australian convention was held on 2 March 1891 and it had appointed representatives, not elected representatives, from each state. So it is clearly arguable that the constitutional convention that we are proposing be a more democratically elected and appointed constitutional convention than even that which was the basis upon which we fonned our federation. Even after that convention on 2 March 1891, there was a great debate not necessarily about whether we should become a federation but about side issues. The most pressing debate in the lead-up to the convention was the debate about free trade versus protectionguided ism-quite an appropriate debate. History seems to be repeating itself in the 1990s, as it often does. It is even more ironic that 1890s, after the first national convention completed, the delegates to the convention were distracted by the fact that the nation going through an awful depression, so there was no further convention until 1897-98. The father of Australian federation, Sir Henry Parkes, quite tragically had died by then. second round of conventions in 1897 in Ian federation. Adelaide was the basis upon which we formed our nation. If there are constitutional monarchists in the federal parliamentary Liberal Party, they will be given an opportunity, as will everyone else, to have their say at the constitutional convention. It is very important that we adopt a united front about having a stable and infonned debate when it comes to discussing the future of our nation. For me, there is matter more important for this nation than have a stable democracy, and the debate about the make-up of our democracy is vitally important, even if it is not a priority issue the Australian people. I agree with the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) that there should be a very good hard look at whether non-Australian residents should be allowed to participate in the tion. He makes a fair point: if they are zens of another nation, why should they given the opportunity to vote on whether should or should not become a republic? That is a fair point. However, for all the points, there is no doubt that it is vitally important that all Australians have a say. promise made and kept by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is one that will bring a very stable transfonnation of the nation to a repubthis lic in the years ahead.",23
15,Mr HATTON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"You know there is a problem with the proposition that has been put up when the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) quotes not only Mill and Burke but also Madison. I note that he left out Bentham, Jefferson, Franklin and a number of others that he could have alluded to. The underlying approach that he took in relation to this question was that you needed democracy before you could get to a plebiscite of the Australian people, that you should not leave it to the irregular passion of in the the populace to decide on whether or not was Australia should become a republic; rather, you should have reflection and deliberation in was a constitutional convention such as that proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I imagine that that reflection and deliberation would have a time frame something similar to The what happened before we became an AustralThe essential nature of the convention is that it is a political fix. It is to fix a problem that the coalition had prior to the last election, related to the fact that they do have a small group of republicans-such as the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey)-within the coalition and the fact that they do have a great move within the community at large to have a simple, straightforward, clear plebiscite no of the Australian people putting the question to of whether or not they would like an Australian as their head of state. Just prior to the new millennium and the centenary of Federfor ation, we are in a situation where that question could be put simply, clearly and directly. If the answer was no, in a vote of all the Australian people who are eligible to vote, that they did not want at this stage in their elechistory to contemplate any further move cititowards a republic, there the matter would be rest. If the answer was yes, it would then we come to this parliament to detennine what specific questions to put, and what manner of other republic we would then look at. The Labor Party has been quite consistent The in regard to this question. The former Prime Minister and former member for Blaxland was open, direct and forceful in his leadership on question. He thought it was possible to be careful and deliberate and to work through the advice given by the body that he sought advice from. He thought that there was a position where that simple question could be put to the Australian people. The contrast is quite stark with the present Prime Minister. He is someone who does not want to move towards an Australian republic and, with the drive to put that question and the drive for people to consider it, he is like a small Queen's scout who is sent out to go on a journey through the forest. He is given a compass and a group of people to take through that closed thicket. The only place that is open is the place behind him. So, when he has a problem-there is a closed thicket and he has to find a way through that-he consults the compass and looks for the direction north. The compass does not seem to work. The indications he gets do not meet his expectations. So he rattles the compass: he still does not get any indication of the right direction. He gives it another go: it is still not there. Because the only direction he really wants to go is back. The only direction he wants is obfuscation, delay and for a simple question not to be put. So, when they came up with the idea of the people's conventions, it was a perfect delaying mechanism. It was also a perfect mechanism for obfuscating and not clarifying the situation. If you bring up every possible contingency related to our constitution and how that might be changed if we were to go to a republic rather than putting a simple, open question as to whether we want an Australian as our head of state, then we can spend the next century-into 3001considering all those elements and never putting the direct question to the Australian people as to what is their desire in regard to that. So, the debate, I expect, will be non-focused, extremely wide ranging and vague. It will run off into all sorts of tunnels and byways and that will serve the Prime Minister's intent. Because his intent is not to clarify this issue. He is extraordinarily reluctant, as are, I think, the vast majority of people in the coalition. The few within that party-like the member for North Sydneywho are republicans, I think, at heart want a simple, clear point put and would join us. They are supporting the convention, whereas we are not. The motion before the House today, moved by Mr Ted Grace, indicates that we should put that question. (Time expired)",24
16,Mr TRUSS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The proposed people's convention not only fulfils an election promise made by the incoming government during the election campaign but is also a very effective way of dealing with issues surrounding the constitutional future of our country. It is not intended that the constitutional convention should deal with only one issue-namely, whether or not this country should be a republic-but that it should deal with what the shape of our country should be in the century ahead. Our constitution does not reach any magic use-by date in 2000 or 2001. It has served this country very well for generations and can continue to serve our country very well for another century, if that is our wish. The Americans, after all, have had the same constitution for more than twice as long as Australia, and in that time they have made proportionally fewer changes to their constitution than we have to ours. H would be completely inappropriate to address issues like a republic by conducting some kind of popularity poll on some inane and nonsensical question like, 'Do you want an Australian as your head of state?' Of course, many people would argue that we effectively have an Australian as our head of state. The man living at Yarralumla is about as Australian as anybody I know, and so were his predecessors, if we go back many, many decades. So that is a stupid question. Nor does it resolve the issue. If it is meant to be some kind of code question for, 'Do you want a republic or don't you want a republic?' again, that is not a fair question to put to the Australian people without their knowing the details. The Australian people should not be asked to vote for a republic without knowing the precise detail of the nature of the republic being proposed. They need to know how the head of state will be chosen---elected or appointed by some group. They need to know in advance what will happen to the reserve powers and what other matters will be changed in our constitution to accommodate the new arrangement. It is simply unfair to ask the Australian people to make a judgment on these issues unless they have seen the detail first. It is ridiculous to ask the real estate agent to put down the details of which property you are buying after you have signed the contract. It is an illogical suggestion which is being put by the proposers of this particular matter. It is essential that those issues be reviewed thoroughly in advance so when the question is asked of the Australian people they know what they are buying, they know whether they want this form of a republic or whether they want to stick to the arrangements that we have. If they are not happy with any of those alternatives, let us talk about it more and come to an arrangement that everyone agt:ees with. I believe it would be utterly wrong for this country to get a republic by trickery, by asking people inane questions that do not resolve the issue. When it is time to become a republic, there will be overwhelming universal support for it. If there is only 51 per cent support, frankly, that is not enough. It will be divisive for our country if the decision is made in that sort of context. I think we will all know when the time is right, and at that stage there will be overwhelming support by the people of Australia to make those sorts of changes. But, even then, they need to know the detail and the detail will be provided to them through the deliberations of the constitutional convention. The convention needs to deal with other matters as well. It is appropriate to review the operations of our constitution. It was, after developed at a time when there were no satellites, not even any air travel, when many of the issues that are of importance today were not even on the agenda. We need to look at the transitional clauses in the constitution that are redundant these days. The Inter-State Commission is referred to in the constitution, but has rarely been activated. We need to also look at other matters such as the term of the parliament, whether local government should be recognised, things like citizen initiated referenda, which needs to be resolved once and for all, and the foreign affairs powers, which have been used by the Commonwealth to extend its influence in such a range of areas. Perhaps most importantly of all in the current climate is the role of the High Court. That particular section of the constitution was written at a time when there were appeals to the Privy Council. Now when our High Court makes strange and illogical decisions-and there have been far too many of them in recent times-there is little opportunity for review. These issues can be dealt with by the proposed convention. (Time expired)",25
17,Ms ELLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The people's constitutional convention to me is a very interesting conundrum. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims that this is not an issue of first-rate importance to him or of first-rate importance to the Australian people. In a world of core and non-core promises, is it not interesting that this promise lands in the 'core' basket of promises when it is second rate, according to him? But, there again, as the Prime Minister himself has said many times, he is a monarchist. He does not see why the community wants to go down this path but, to give him some credit, he is now at least saying that, if it is what the community wants, he will not stand in their way. Thank you very much, Mr Prime Minister! It will be a difficult, costly and lengthy process. One of the best comments that I have seen on the rate of difficulty and the rate of complication proposed by the people's constitutional convention was illustrated very well in a recent Pryor cartoon in the Canberra Times. all, I need to share this with the House. In this cartoon, there was your obviously supportive republican posting his ballot in the convention process. The obvious advice coming to him from the Prime Minister depicted in the cartoon was this, 'Okay, next you have to cross Sydney Harbour Bridge on rollerblades wearing only a G-string and with this egg balanced on the tip of your nose.' I think that really puts into very plain language the sort of complicated process that the convention is about. The real point is very simple. It matters not in the scheme of things at all whether I or you, Mr Deputy Speaker, other members of this place or members of the convention are supporters of the republic. What matters is what the people of this country happen to want. Simply hold the people's plebiscite with the simple question: do you want an Australian republic? Do you want an Australian as a head of state for your country? It is quite simple: if the answer to that is yes, you go ahead through the appropriate mechanisms and develop that outcome. The sort of debate that we are hearing in the House today from fellow members is, I am alarmed to think, the sort of debate that we will hear through the country in the leadup to and during the convention. There will be every diversion you can possibly think of. The people out there in the community who really do believe that it is about time Australpublic is became a republic, who really do believe that we should have an Australian entrenched in our constitution as our head of state, will then have thrown at them things like citizen initiated referenda, compulsory or non-compulsory voting, whether or not a group of people appoint the head of state, as was mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), yet we are allowed to have a group of people decide whether we go down this particular path. I am pretty alarmed to think that, after all the history of the republican movement in this country, this is not a new thing. It has been debated in our community in Australia for many years-for over 100 years. Previous speakers have said, 'We will know when the time is here.' Let me assure you, I believe the Australian public knows the time is here. I believe the polls that are taken-not by the Labor Party, not by the republican movement but by independent people-indicate that the community want to get on with it. Having an Australian as a head of state in this country entrenched in the constitution is what they want. It is what they believe in. The diversionary tactics of a people's constitutional convention will only serve to confuse the debate. Every diversionary political tactic known to mankind and womankind will come into the debate. I should imagine we will end up with a very heated process. Those who believe in the simple question are going to have a lot thrown at them. I say to them, 'Stick to your guns. If you really do believe that the time has come for Australia, that the republican movement is ready to come through, then hold your belief and go with it.' The Prime Minister is saying a very honest thing when he says that he is not in favour of it. He will not stand in the way but, I will tell you what, he will make it very difficult.",26
18,Mr REID,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Bendigo) (l.38 p.m.)Regrettably for him, the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) has been overcome in this debate by the passage of time and his motion has slipped behind the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That announcement honours his election commitment to the of Australia that a people's constitutional convention on the republic will be held in either November or December at Old Parliament House in Canberra and that it would be preceded by a possible national voluntary postal ballot for half of the delegates, with the other half to be appointed by the government. Special positions would be allocated for 18to 24-year-olds and Aborigines, and the head of state will be the main issue. But, as the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) quite rightly pointed out, it will be only one of a number of important considerations under deliberation by the people's constitutional convention. The balanced public information campaign will be conducted before the ballot for delegates takes place, and will include arguments for and against the present constitutional arrangements as well as the republican alternatives. Regrettably, opposition members want to rush straight to a plebiscite. They want the public to vote on a republic without being informed of what a republic is and what form it would take. I cannot understand the logic of opposition members putting this forward as the answer to everyone's prayers. Here we have a proposal for a republic. Many people in Australia simply would not have the information about it before them. One way of getting the information to them is to have a people's constitutional convention. If you look back to how the original constitution was framed in Australia, you that a series of public conventions were held throughout Australia in the lead-up to the federation of Australian states. Sir John Quick, from Bendigo, the area that I reprehave sent, was one of the leading proponents this. It came from the ground up, and this what the Prime Minister is doing. As to the movement for the constitutional convention, 50 per cent of the delegates will be elected a postal ballot and the other half will appointed by the government, which was dead'. similar to the arrangement in the lead-up to 1901. I want to particularly refer to the comments of the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) that the Prime Minister has ignored women. The Prime Minister refers to the elected people, the elected delegates and the young people. There is simply no intention in any shape or form to exclude women. The ments of the member for Fremantle, who comes from a party that still has a 35 per cent quota on women becoming members of parliament, are quite outrageous. They have not rescinded that motion. I indicate that the coalition has more women in the parliament than any other party. The Liberal Party, of which I am a member, gives equal rights in every office and in every preselection for parliamentary representation. I felt that those comments by the member for Fremantle were quite outrageous. The Prime Minister has kept his promise to the Australian community. He will inform the community through the people's constitutional convention what the proposals are and will provide an adequate base for discussion of a number of important issues relating to the constitution. It is all set out very clearly. Regrettably for him, the member for Fowler has lost the momentum on this motion. I suppose at the time it sounded like a good idea, but with the events that have occurred, the passage of time and the commitment from the Prime Minister to move to the people's constitutional convention the motion has been overcome. I believe that we have totally honoured the commitment we made in the . lead-up to the last election for a constitutional will find convention. (Time expired) Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter) (1.43 p.m.)-It seems that those on the other side-some of them republicans, most of them monarchistsmissed the main point of the motion of of the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace). The is point was not missed by the Sydney Morning Herald in its editorial last Wednesday headed 'Cart before the horse'. The point was not by missed by Michael Gordon's article in the be Weekend Australian headed 'Howard runs Those on the other side really are missing the point. This is a very simple question. It is a matter of principle. The question is: do Australians generally support the concept of an Australian and independent head of state'? I would have thought it was a very simple proposition. It comes as no surprise to those of us on this side that the Prime Minister (Mr comHoward)-a devout monarchist-should attempt to politicise the question by moving towards this constitutional convention before giving the Australian people a chance to still answer that very simple question. Attempts by those on the other side to compare the need to hold constitutional conventions at the end of the 1890s with the current situation are simply ridiculous. The question should be put to the Australian people: do they support in principle the shift towards an independent and Australian head of state'? Once that is resolved-and they know on that side that will be resolved-it can move to a constitutional convention.",27

20,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On 6 December 1995, Reading Australia announced plans for a 25-screen, $35 million megacinema complex in Burwood and got an enthusiastic response from Premier Kennett, who described the project as 'very exciting and groundbreaking'. But, as the Age revealed last Friday, from December through until April last year, Reading's competitor Village and related companies donated $788,000 to the Victorian and federal Liberal parties, including $200,000 in April-after the election was over. On 23 April, Victorian planning minister Rob MACLellan called in the Reading plan, despite the fact that it had been approved by the Whitehorse Council and, on 27 August, announced that the government would not allow the scheme to go ahead. Village are proposing a new cinema complex in my electorate, in Munro Street, Coburg. Some local residents oppose this proposal because of the traffic it will generate and the damage it will do to views from Hudson Street. I have advised them to write to Liberal planning minister MACLellan-as they say in the movies, the best planning minister that money can buy-asking him to call this proposal in too. Unlike Village, they have not donated $788,000 to the Liberal Party! Let's see if the minister does call the project is it really true that the supposedly pro-competition Liberal Party says Village should not have to compete with Reading, and the supposedly anti-regulation Liberal Party is regulating cinemas?

They go about their tasks, day after day, week after week, without expecting anything in return except the satisfaction of helping others. The recipients of the Swan Community Contribution Awards were as follows: Harold Mundy for his work with the Manning Memorial Bowling Club; Noma Wright for her devotion to the South Perth Girl Guides; Jan and Charlie Seager for their development of the Karawara Kats Basketball Club; Pat Strachan for her work with people with disabilities at the Belmont Oasis; Frances O'Connor for her devotion to the Belmont RSL Ladies Auxiliary; Diamond Walters for her volunteer work with the Ngala childrens institution; Rick Watson and Brian MCIntyre for helping to develop junior cricket in South Perth; Peggy Edwards for group teaching at the Rivervale Church of Christ; David Watson, Bill Carlton and Ray Stewart for their devotion to the Como RSL; William Wilson for helping transport dialysis patients to hospital as well as other community activities in the Belmont area; Del Stickland for his work with the Welshpool Rotary Club and his care of local seniors; Bert Dean for his volunteer work with the Belmont RSL; and Maisie Killgallon who is an active member of the Belmont RSL Ladies Auxiliary.

22,Mr ANDREN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"My statement relates to Austudy. In my electorate many deserving families are being denied assistance by the operation of the means test. The daughter of one farmer constituent faces the prospect of losing Austudy because of a family partnership. In this case, a partnership between her father and uncle is necessary to run the property but most income is derived off farm and ploughed back into the farm for weed and feral animal control and general maintenance. The farm at the moment-for reasons that do not need spelling out to anyone aware of the rural decline-is not returning a living. The daughter needs to live away from home but the family cannot sustain what amounts to two households and so seeks Austudy assistance. But the assistance being sought is required to be listed as expenditure for this year. Surely the government did not intend to catch people in this situation. Today I also received details from the student council at Charles Sturt University detailing the impact the actual means test is having on farm family students. The actual means tests fails to take into account the cyclical nature of farm income and the fact that rural students-farm or otherwiseinvariably have to leave home to study. I call on the government to urgently amend the actual means test so that this year's of rural students will not be denied the tunity of pursuing their studies and be forced to go on the dole for three years before they can receive the independent rate of Austudy. We must root out the rorters of Austudy, but the actual means test has gone too far and trapped many rural battlers, while encouraging the three-year dole option. (Time expired) Papua New Guinea Trip Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay)-I rise to comment on my trip to Papua New Guinea and along the Kokoda Trail. It was a remarkable trek in terms of reviewing the history of the contribution of our soldiers and the incredible fight that was put up in unforgiving terrain. It was incredibly difficult country which to wage a battle against an enemy which totally outnumbered our soldiers and which was well supplied and well equipped. Some of our militia put up an incredible defence and made a very organised withdrawal down the track. Unfortunately, many of the very historic artefacts along that track-helmets, unexploded ordnance, mortar base plates-are left lying about in the terrain and are not being preserved in any fashion. In those environmental conditions they will be in a very sad state of repair within the next 10 years and a large part of Australia's history will be unpreserved. Recognition of our soldiers and the sacrifice of Australians on what was, at that time, Australian territory is very important. When we were invaded for the first time, it was Australians and Australians alone who defended Australia. We were not helped by the US, New Zealand or any other nation. Australians fought long and hard on Australian territory. Some recognition of those efforts and some lasting memorials should be made along the Kokoda Track for those who died in defence of Australia and also for the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels who contributed so much when they had so little training and opportunity.

After Earlwood post office, Bob went to work at Campsie where he stayed for 28 years, before moving on to the Lakemba delivery centre as a night sorter, where he has been for the last 18 months. Last year, after 40 years service with Australia Post, Bob was presented with a gold watch and a certificate of recognition by in Australia Post. However, Bob has not worn the watch yet, as he is waiting for his friend and workmate Kerry Innes to return to work at Lakemba so that he can celebrate with him. It is interesting to note that Kerry Innes has worked with Bob, and Kerry's father Roy worked with him at Campsie post office. Forty years service for Bob is no mean achievement. He has overcome great adversity in his life, growing up as a state ward and spending time in boys homes. On top of that, he has had to put up with very poor health. His colleagues say he is a good worker. Having no family of his own, his colleagues have become his family. His knowledge of the mail run is extraordinary. You can just mention a name and he will tell you where the person lives. He has also been a bit of a legend on talkback radio. When Garry O'Callahan was on 2UE, he often used to send a good morning hello to Bobby Gorton at Campsie Post office in the mornings. Bob Gorton has been a member of the Labor Party for 20 years and has worked very hard both for the people of Campsie and for the party. Bob Gorton is an all-round good bloke-and a bloke who completes 40 years service in Australia Post shows the sort of person Bob Gorton is and that is the sort of person that keeps this country together. Car Tariffs",30
24,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to raise the matter of car tariffs, especially with the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) at the table. In the city of Geelong, this matter is very much under consideration and very strong emotional debate is taking place. I want to put before the parliament the effects that the lowering of the tariff rate has had on the Ford Motor Co. The Ford Motor Co. in Geelong have improved profitability, they have improved the quality of their product and they have improved the productivity of their employees, and their head office in America has maintained their investment in Geelong. I draw to the attention of the House the fact that the member for Corio was part of a government that reduced the tariff regime from 60 per cent to the current 22 per cent, and foreshadowed a rate of 15 per cent in the year 2000. Mr O'Connor-Not down to zero, and you know it.",31
25,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Since 1989 the Ford Motor Co. have improved under a reducing tariff regime which the Labor Party put in place and which I agree with. What is the member for Corio going to say to the people of Geelong as to what his position is on the tariff debate? He knows that he supported the minister, Senator Button, in reducing regime in the previous government. Members of this House should wait until the Productivity Commission report comes down and have a look at the facts of the matter in the tariff debate, have a look at what has taken place and look at the good things that have emerged in the motorcar industry, both in Geelong and at Broadmeadows. The honourable member for Corio should read them very carefully. (Time expired) Car Tariffs",31
26,Mr SA WFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the Adelaide Advertiser on 4 February Chris Milne reported that there has been a surge of growth in activity at the outer harbour wharves and the container terminal at Port Adelaide. The annual throughput at the container terminal has risen from 31,000 containers in 1991 to 83,000 last year, with in excess of 30 ships calling there each month. It is a highly efficient port, enabling quick turnaround times. Productivity gains have been negotiated with the workers without the new anti-worker industrial relations laws of the coalition government. One of the port's major clients in the future will be the South Australian car industry, as the tariff reform of previous federal Labor governments bears fruit in the form of increased motor vehicle exports. That reform, which will see tariffs at 15 per cent by the year 2000, enabled the industry to grow, to increase productivity, to provide jobs and to develop export markets. Mitsubishi and GMH are now exporting their Adelaide-made products around the world, including to the United States, East and South-East Asia, and New Zealand. As the industry grows and exports increase, so too will the growth (if the port increase. That means jobs-jobs in the car plants, jobs on the wharves and jobs in related service industries. That growth surge, however, could be destroyed if the government enacts the recommendation of the Productivity Commission to cut tariffs to 5 per cent by the year 2004. Such an ideologically driven decision would destroy an industry nourished by sensible reform under Labor, cut cargo movements at Port Adelaide and lead to big job losses. the tariff (Time expired). HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Voyager Collision",31
27,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I remind the House that the collision of HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Voyager occurred 33 years ago this evening. I hope to have more to say about that in the adjournment debate. I take the opportunity now to reinforce the fact that that tragedy seemingly will not go away, that in opposition we argued very strongly against the previous government and Minister Beazley in particular when he imposed the statute of limitations that we should reach a position where reasonable compensation should be afforded to those survivors in both ships, but with particular reference to Voyager. Seemingly that has not happened. Most recently we have the case of Bill MCLean who was in the Melbourne that evening. I hope everybody in this House would join with me in supporting the need for early and equitable compensation for all survivors, whether they be from Voyager or from Melbourne. Grantham High School",31
28,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to speak about Grantham High Public School at Seven Hills, one of 14 great high schools in the electorate of Greenway, where I attended the presentation night at the end of last year. I was impressed by the efforts of Norm Tate, the principal, and his staff in maintaining an atmosphere of order, stability and educational excellence during a period of considerable change in the New South Wales education system. These management changes, combined with a decline in the student population of Seven Hills and surrounding areas, has seen an enrolment drop over the past few years, although 650 students enrolled in 1995 makes it still a good sized school. There has also been a reduction in the number of teachers and support staff, putting pressure on the school's ability to maintain a diverse curriculum structure. This school provides a wide range of education support programs, including the implementation of a parent support network for non-English speaking background families-1996 saw Turkish, Arabic and Maltese families meeting with school staff as individual groups. This program will continue into 1997, recognising the diverse ethnic population of the area. Two students were placed in the first 5,000 in the state HSC: the school Captain, Melissa Abela, scored 99.5 per cent and Lorraine Laborezfulvi scored 97.6 per cent.",32
29,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106A the time for members' statements has concluded. NA",32
30,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will be absent from question time today. He is returning from visiting Europe on official business. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) will answer questions on his behalf. NA Woods, Senator Bob",32
31,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Can the Attorney-General advise the House whether the Australian Federal Police executed a search warrant for Senator Woods's Parliament House office in addition to his other premises? Was it before 21 January; if so, when? If the Attorney-General Mr is unable to provide the precise details, will he undertake to request the Australian Federal Police to check their records to ascertain the exact date or dates they attended upon Senator Woods's offices and report back to the House as soon as possible?",32
32,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The AFP advised me that they were intending to execute a search warrant on Senator Woods's premises. My recollection is that we learnt the day before, that is the 20th. As to the detail of the premises, I think I should make further inquiries and report back rather than comment further. Youth Unemployment",32
33,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What action is the government taking to provide young people with an extra opportunity to bridge that period between full-time learning and entering the full-time work force? What levels of pay could young people participating reasonably expect to receive?,32
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I announced yesterday, the government will for the first time introduce, as part of the armoury of the policies it is employing to attack the problem of youth unemployment, a work for the dole scheme. We intend to pilot about 20 to 30 of these schemes in areas of high youth unemployment especially, but not only, in regional and rural areas of Australia. I believe that most Australians will strongly support the notion that it is not unfair in modem Australia to ask people, if they are able to do so, to undertake some work in return for the dole that they receive. It is a principle that is very widely supported in the Australian community. I stress, as I did on television yesterday, that this is but one of a number of policies that the government is employing to tackle the huge problem of youth unemployment which for 13 years the Labor Party failed to address and which the Labor Party bequeathed to us in March of last year when we were elected as the government of this country. There is a hard core of about 30,000 young people who have been out of work for more than six months and they do comprise a particular social challenge to the entire Australian community. The emphasis in the work for the dole approach will be on community cooperation-{;ooperation between community groups and local business organisations in rural and regional areas of Australia. We have, as the member for Richmond and other members will know, introduced since coming to office a modem apprenticeship and training scheme under the guidance of my colleague the minister for employment and training. We are quite deliberately providing as many incentives and as much encouragement as possible for small business in Australia. We have got rid of the ridiculous unfair dismissal law given to us by Laurie Brereton, the man who probably in the process destroyed more jobs for young people in small business than any other minister for industrial relations. We have changed industrial relations laws in this country. But, most importantly, the purpose of the work for the dole approach is to add to the range of policies which are designed to address the problem. I want to emphasise that amongst the pilots which are tested in various areas of the Australian community there will be both voluntary and compulsory pilot schemes. I was rather fascinated-as I am sure many other people in Australia will be fascinatedto have read some comments made this morning on Radio National by the member for Batman. It is very interesting to hear what he had to say. I think it is very revealing of the confusion he feels in relation to the government's policy. This is what he had to say: Are you trying to tell meMr Kelvin Thomson-It is a very confused policy.",32
35,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I know that those opposite may try to drown it out because it is a little embarrassing, but I will persevere. I am an infinitely patient man. This is what he had to say: Are you trying to tell me that one and a half days or two days a week is going to give people the discipline to work? They go home and go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week. 'They go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week.' Can I first of all observe that that is a rather demeaning, insulting way to talk about unemployed young people. The former head of the ACTU talks in that demeaning fashion about the young unemployed in Australia-after all the lectures we have had from the member for Batman! But that is only the first comment. The second observation I would say to the member for Batman, and I think most Australians would agree with this, is that a day and a half a week is better than no days a week to instil the discipline for work. The third thing I would suggest to the member for Batman is that if he really has that notion that some of the people who are now on the dole are watching TV all day, maybe he is unwittingly underlining one of the reasons why the policy is being introduced. Can I thank the member for Batman for his revealing answer on Radio National this morning. The government is quite determined to effectively pilot these schemes. We will be proposing an amendment to the Social Security Act, because it is my understanding that that is necessary. We will need to amend the Social Security Act in order to make it possible, where required, for compulsory work for the dole schemes to be carried out. I think this will be seen by the Australian community as a legitimate and fair addition to the policies now available to help the young unemployed. It will be at award rates. There will be no exploitation. It will help-in the words of the member for Batman-to instil the discipline of work. I thank the member for Batman for his endorsement of what I was talking about I think the Australian community will see it as yet another example of the determination of my government to tackle the problem that we were bequeathed from the former Labor administration. Member for Parkes",33
36,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. At the time the Prime Minister discussed the allegations against the member for Parkes with the Leader of the National Party, were they a matter of public record and known to Mr Cobb? If not, how can he justify discussing those allegations with anybody. consistent with the test he applied in the case of the allegations made against Senator Woods?",34
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not recall initiating a discussion with the Leader of the National Party. My recollection of the matter is that I was briefed by the Attorney-General in about August-it may have been July; I cannot be certain-that the complaint had been made. I was then, from recollection, told that there had been some police call on the premises. Mr Lee-Who told you that?",34
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dobell!,34
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then I think the matter became a matter of comment in the local papers of the member's electorate. I have been handed by the member a copy-rather ironically-from the Dubbo Liberal which spoke of an Australian Federal Poh :e raid on the Dubbo electoral office of Parkes MP, Michael Cobb. My recollection is that I did not initiate a discussion with the Leader of the National Party. I certainly do not recall having done so after the information was given to me by the Attorney-General. While I am on my feet, can I take the opportunity of saying that I note that the member for Parkes has denied that there is any substance in the allegations and I also note that that is the same situation with Senator Woods. I also note some very interesting comments that were made by the Leader of the Opposition on 3LO this morning. I read from the partial transcript: Reporter: Opposition leader, Kim Beazley, agreed with the Prime Minister that members of parliament are entitled to a presumption of innocence. I welcome the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition. Then the voice of the Leader of the Opposition: There are from time to time vexatious claims made about politicians. You cannot tell what the veracity of them is until the investigation is concluded. I think that is fair. I invite you to apply that approach to the member for Parkes and also to Senator Woods. Youth Unemployment",34
40,Mr W AKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In view of the high levels of youth unemployment which existed when the government came to office, I ask the minister: can he inform the House what are the implications of the evaluation of Labor's Working Nation program for developing an effective jobs strategy?",34
41,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's approach to helping unemployed young people contrasts very sharply with the merry-go-round of short-term training programs that were put into place by the previous government. Now that the government has announced that it is prepared to give young people on the dole a chance to contribute to their communitiessomething which the Labor Party denied them throughout their entire period in office-the Labor Party is in complete disarray. I would like to refer, as the Prime Minister did, to the interview given this morning by the member for Batman. He informed the listeners: Mainstream Australia is not going to be impressed by a mickey mouse scheme which is designed for the sole purpose of doing something. That is precisely what the member for Hotham admitted was the character of many of the training schemes under Working Nation. Indeed, in May last year the member for Hotham said: I accept that there were circumstances in which certain courses qualified for training but were really mickey mouse operations. I accept that. So you are right. Why do you not actually focus on the terrible failure and betrayal of young people through the Working Nation programs? The Labor Party held out to young people the promise that they would get jobs through those programs, and that was a lie. There were many cases where there were no jobs and where everybody at the end of the programs provided by particular providers were still on government benefits. We hear from the member for Batman the utter contempt that the Labor Party had for those young people, because they were just fodder. Those programs were to manipulate the statistics. The Labor Party knew they were not working; the Labor Party knew they were not going to get jobs out of them. But, so far as the member for Batman is concerned, unemployed young people are spending most of the week in bed or watching TV, not out there trying to get jobs. It is obvious where he got that idea from. He got that idea from the Leader of the Opposition, because the Leader of the Opposition, too, recognised the failure of the Working Nation programs. Let me remind the House of what the Leader of the Opposition said on radio 6PR in Perth on 29 January: It is true that out of a lot of people didn't get a job at the end of it. But they were gainfully employed while they were on and they weren't around the streets bothering anybody. So that is how they view the young, unemployed people in this country: they are either in bed watching TV or they are around the streets",34
42,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which goes to relevance. Is it relevant for the minister to provide a quote that has two sentences, with one missing between them?",35
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,35
44,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,35
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left!,35
46,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was letting the Leader of the Opposition off lightly. I did not want to rub it in too much, but the second sentence says: 'Many did, but many did not get jobs at the end of it.' So it simply reinforced the point. You repeated the point about the failure of Working Nation.",35
47,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Many did get jobs.,35
48,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition claims that many got jobs. There was no change in the level of full-time teenage unemployment during the entire time of Working Nation. The fact is that youth unemployment is a result of many factors. It is a result of the lack of literacy and numeracy skills, of early school drop-out, of employers' perceptions unfortunately that many young people lack those job ready skills, of the decline of the apprenticeship system and of the lack of a clear pathway into jobs for young people who are not going on to university or full-time TAPE. Throughout the entire period of the Labor government, not one of those problems was systematically addressed. There was no satisfactory program to give young people literacy skills. In fact, you went out of your way to conceal the literacy problems that many young people had. While school retention rose, your reforms told people that if they were not going on to university they were not our training programs going anywhere. The apprenticeship system was allowed to gather dust, and we know that in the last year of the Labor Party the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. The fact is that under Labor young people were recycled through program after program, which demoralised them, gave them false promises and left them on the unemployment queues. It is very interesting how young people have responded to the government's initiative. If you listen to the voice of young people who are quoted in the media and are speaking on their own behalf, you will hear young person after young person saying how much they welcome this initiative. Right through the election campaign I went through rural town after rural town in places like Queensland and New South Wales, and young people came up and said, 'Why won't the government let us do something in this community instead of forcing us to sit around on the dole doing nothing?' The fact is that they want to be with their communities; they do not want to be isolated from those in their communities who want to work with them. And the government's historic initiative here will provide young people around Australia with opportunities that they never had under your self-interested political schemes. Woods, Senator Bob",35
49,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Did the minister agree to Senator Woods being given additional responsibilities as Parliamentary Secretary? If so, when? When did the minister become aware that Senator Woods was being investigated by the Australian Federal Police, and who informed him? What other discussions did the minister have, or what actions did the minister and his staff take in regard to this matter? Finally, when did Senator Woods first advise the minister of the investigation?",36
50,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Senator Woods was given additional responsibilities in about October-November last year-I could check because there would be a letter somewhere, but that was roughly the time. The second question asked about when I found out about it: at a quarter to eight on Tuesday morning last week. Who informed me? The ABC Radio news. Mr Lee-Monday or Tuesday?",36
51,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tuesday. When did Senator Woods inform meMr Lee-Why did you talk about it,36
52,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You hale asked your question. Do you want me to answer it or not'? When did Senator Woods inform me of the Federal Police investigation-some time after I found out about it on ABC Radio because that was the first occasion on which I knew anything about a Federal Police investigation. Health: Effects of Unemployment,36
53,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Could the minister inform the House of evidence that unemployment is associated with poor health and premature death? Will the government's proposal for young unemployed people to work for unemployment benefits improve their self-esteem, sense of belonging and health outcomes'?",36
54,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I acknowledge the work that he has done over a number of years on the health effects of unemployment. There is no doubt that there is a clear and unequivocal link between long-term unemployment and reduced health outcomes. People who are long-term unemployed have lower health status, their physical health declines, they see doctors more often and they suffer from more long-term chronic conditions. This was noted in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report Health differentials among young Australian adults, released last year. It had this to say: Unemployed young people reported worse health, more illness, worse emotional health, higher rates of disability and handicap, than employed young people ... Unemployed young men and women were around 64 per cent and 82 per cent more likely to report fair or poor health. They also reported more serious chronic illness, were around two times more likely to be disabled or handicapped and around 40 per cent more likely to report symptoms of psychological distress. The other great problem affecting young people is that of youth suicide, which is now the largest cause of death in males between 15 and 24 years of age. There is no doubt in the minds of many of the experts that this is linked to work and a cycle of despair and hopelessness. It was put recently by Professor Hassan, who has written the article Suicide Explained: the Australian Experience. He put it very well: Overwhelmed by hopelessness, alienated, isolated without support systems, blown out of the system by parents divorcing, re-marriages, blended families, unemployment, worthlessness, powerlessness. The relevance of this is that we do have a model of what working for the dole can do, and that is in the CDEP scheme. I can say I have probably visited around 30 different schemes right around Australia. The CDEP has been an extraordinarily beneficial scheme in raising self-esteem, in community building, in re-engaging people and in breaking that cycle of hopelessness and despair. There are two recent examples of CDEP. A New South Wales magistrate recently noted a reduction in theft, vandalism, assault and juvenile crime offences coming before the Broken Hill court and attributed this directly to the CDEP scheme. The Centre for Aboriginal Policy and Economic Research noted in a Port Lincoln scheme an intangible boost to self-esteem when people could say they were working rather than receiving unemployment henefits. Mr Crean-Why did you cut the scheme?",36
55,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has been helpful in re-engaging people in Aboriginal communities. There is no reason to believe that it is going to be any different in the broader community. In itself it will not be a solution, but as part of a range of polices it will be very helpful. Given that I have had numerous interjections from people who obviously know nothing about what we did in the last budget, I might finish by talking about CDEP. The fact is that we maintained the number of people on CDEP, so before you make your inane interjections find out what the facts actually are. We looked at running costs in large CDEPs, over 150 people, and we make no apologies for trying to make those schemes efficient. There were some schemes that were actually terminated, and that was not related to the budget cuts. When Redfern, for example, was terminated it had been in long-term decline and it was terminated because of management irregularities. There were only 12 people working on it when ATSIC finally decided to terminate it. So you can make your inane comments but the fact is that you have presided as a government for 10 years over the worse increase in youth suicide of any country in the world. You have had despair and hopelessness and all you offered was a series of mickey mouse jobs and you cannot bear to see the government adding something that you never had the guts to address. Woods, Senator Bob",37
56,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Has the Attorney's attention been drawn to a report in yesterday's Sun-Herald, which says: Woods told herthe reference is to Miss Cameronhe would try to track down whoever was making allegations to police about his parliamentary expenses.",37
57,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,37
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right!,37
59,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I repeat the quote: Woods told her he would try to track down whoever was making allegations to police about his parliamentary expenses. Is the Attorney aware of how, and in particular when, Senator Woods came by the knowledge that he was being investigated. If not, will the Attorney check his and the AFP's records and report back to the parliament as soon as possible with any such information? If Senator Woods did know about the allegations/the investigations some time ago, does that not make nonsense of the Prime Minister's claim that for him to have raised the matter with Senator Woods earlier than 21 January would have prejudiced the AFP investigations? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. He is clearly asking for an opinion from the Attorney-General. The balance of it is not much worthwhile either.",37
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Deputy Prime Minister. The last part of the question does ask for an opinion.,37
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I will read again what the last part of the question was: If Senator Woods did know about the investigations some time ago, does that not make nonsense of the Prime Minister's claim that for him to have raised the matter with Senator Woods earlier than 21 January would have prejudiced the AFP investigations? It is not a legal question on which a legal opinion is being sought. It is perfectly within the standing orders.",37
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,37
63,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My attention has not been drawn to that particular article. I do not know about it at all. The nub of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on about is: when did Senator Woods find out about the investigations? I cannot answer that question. I question the wisdom of a minister, albeit the Minister for Justice, running an interrogation on the AFP of any investigation no matter of whom or about what. I do not in the course of my work in my present office make inquiries on a regular basis of the progress of individual investigations. Where the matter has a high profile or is likely to become public or is sensitive or may have international or security implications, the AFP usually initiates with me an information hriefing. The briefing I receive is usually short, I do not generally seek any further briefing, and I do not take any step that would in any way interfere with or be seen as directing an investigation. I cannot see that it would be very helpful for me to start asking the AFP when did they do this or when did they do that. I do not know how Senator Woods obtained knowledge, in the first instance, that there was an investigation under way, and at the moment I do not intend to ask. Oil Industry",37
64,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy addresses the important issue of the nature of the Australian economy. What action is the government taking which could add 20 per cent to Australia's self-sufficiency in oil? What do these new developments say about investment confidence in Australia and how will these steps help address the foreign debt problem this government inherited from the previous Labor government?,38
65,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for that question, which does indeed go to the heart of a matter of substance for this nation. Senator Parer has today announced a world class resources project in the Timor Sea, which is of great interest to all of us. He has agreed to the offer of a petroleum production licence to Woodside, BHP Petroleum and Shell for the Laminaria and Corallin a oil development. This is a total development which is likely to cost some $1 billion just in the development phase. It involves very sophisticated technology and will see offshore oil production in very deep waters. There are estimated recoverable reserves there of some 250 million barrels-a very substantial amount of oil indeed. By 1999, it is likely that some 150,000 barrels of oil per day will be flowing. This will in fact boost Australia's self-sufficiency in terms of oil by some 20 per cent, which is a very substantial amount. It is a very significant outcome because despite being energy rich and a major exporter in the all important oil industry sector we have been facing very ordinary prospects indeed with declining stocks to use ratios and the real prospect of the very expensive and perhaps unpredictable ever rising costs of imports. This outcome will result in an estimated net improvement in Australia's annual balance of payments-and this is a very important point which the question addressed-of some $1.8 billion per year. That is around a 10 per cent improvement in Australia's balance of trade. Given the problems that we were left with in that regard, that is not to be sneezed at. That is a very significant improvement. That causes me to reflect for a moment. If we could sort out-and we will-another industry that you left in mayhem, the timber industry, and reduce the deficit in that industry we could find another 10 per cent. That would be 20 per cent of this nation's trade deficit sorted out. It is quite obvious that those who say it cannot be dealt with and those who evidenced that they could not deal with it are wrong. There are answers to these questions and we are finding them. Under this government, those industries are developing. We are talking about a total value of reserves, at today's value, of about $7 billion and likely revenues to government, which are very significant, of around $2 billion. The point really is that secure investment climates will result in major projects, in real economic growth and real relief for present and future Australians from the problem of the trade deficit parameters that you left us with and which are plainly unsustainable. Youth Unemployment",38
66,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and I preface it by pointing out that every single point made today, apart from those made in relation to question of compulsion and duration, has exactly the characteristics as the labour market programs that you abandoned. Our programs were available to hundreds of thousands of people, not 5,000.",38
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I invite the Leader of the Opposition to proceed with the question.,39
68,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Prime Minister aware that when the media sought details of his youth work for the dole scheme from Senator Vanstone's office yesterday they received a mystified response. Nothing was known of it. Was not this half-baked proposal, using the youth of Australia to provide a smokescreen for his 10-month struggle to get decent accountability standards for his government, a poll driven political diversion? If your scheme is worth funding to give young people an activity for two days of work, why not fund it to give them five days? If it is worth doing for a few thousand, why not do it for the 100,000 young people who are out of work-and the 30,000 long-term unemployed?",39
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is that what we are proposing is a mile away from what you did and what you proposed because you know, I know and the whole of Australia knows that the trade union movement would never have allowed you to do what we are going to do. Job Vacancies",39
70,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of recent job advertisement indicators and the implications for job growth?,39
71,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. The ANZ job as series showed for January a 3.1 per cent rise-the largest rise in 12 months. That rise will be welcomed, I hope, by all Australians as indicating continuing job growth in the Australian economy. In trend terms, the ANZ vacancies series has risen for the first time since it began declining at the end of 1994 when the Labor Party tightened monetary policy and lifted interest rates. The ABS job vacancies survey shows even stronger results. The level of ABS job vacancies is consistent with the view that demand for labour remains solid. Trend private sector ABS job vacancies remain strong, increasing by 1.7 per cent in November to be 9.3 per cent above their level a year ago. While ANZ job vacancies had fallen in the past year, the ABS series rose 11 per cent to the December quarter. The ABS job vacancies series has a broader coverage than the ANZ series and has been much stronger. The ANZ results were released today with the warning, which we of course acknowledge, that they always have to be treated with caution due to seasonal volatility. But put together with the ABS statistics and the DEETY A skill vacancies, which remain above their historical level in trend terms and have also risen over the last four months, this shows welcome and continuing jobs growth in the Australian economy. Trend DEETY A skill vacancies have increased in each of the last four months and increased by 2.1 per cent in January. The series is about 13 per cent below the recent peak in December 1995, but still above the historical average. Since March of last year, according to ABS labour force statistics, about 120,000 new jobs have been created in the Australian economy. We are seeing positive signs out of the leading indicators and the job vacancies series. This government believes that employment is something that must be continually worked on. The exciting announcement by the Prime Minister over the weekend is one of a number of measures towards that end. This is in addition to the measures that this government has already put in place such as measures to reduce the provisional uplift factor, measures to give capital gains tax rollover relief, measures to ensure a much better interest rate climate, measures to ensure that burdens on small business are lifted and measures to ensure that the real engine growth in the Australian economy-the business sector-is given opportunities to create those jobs. All Australians-and I even hope the Australian Labor Party, which seems to rejoice in every piece of bad news-will take pride in the fact that jobs are being created and will take welcome heart in the good news in relation to the Australian economy released today. Our side of politics will continue to keep talking about the issues that countemployment, intlation, investment. We have noticed that the Australian Labor Party, fixated as it is on trivial issues, is unable grapple with the big issues of the Australian economy, and they are the issues that this government will continue to address. A valon Airport",39
72,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister explain to the House how the tendering process for the 50-year lease and 49-year option of Avalon Airport was transparently open and fair to all tenderers when the successful tender, Foxerco, was apparently offered a second bid when other tenders were not? Is $11 million for the airstrip, 1,800 hectares and associated infrastructure a fair return to the taxpayer?",40
73,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As was announced by the government in September last year, the A valon Airport process came down to a preferred bidder. That followed a very open and proper tender process. Through that tender process three bids were made. That was reduced, as I indicated, to a preferred bidder-that preferred bidder being Foxerco. At the time, the other two bidJers were advised of the fact that the government had chosen a preferred bidder and the government then proceeded from that point to negotiate with that preferred bidder. Those negotiations went on for some months. At all times, the government was conscious of the need to ensure that the Geelong or Avalon Airport remained as a viable airport, that it remained an operational airport. We were conscious of the need to ensure that, in the process of coming to a successful conclusion, we removed the ongoing debt that that particular airport had meant to the taxpayers of Australia. It appeared at the conclusion of those negotiations that the government was unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion with Foxerco. At that point of time it was indicated to Foxerco that we proposed not to proceed with the sale because of the simple fact that it was considered that the offer that was being made was not adequate. At that stage the preferred bidder indicated they wanted one further attempt to see if we could negotiate a to satisfactory conclusion. In the early weeks of January that occurred and, as the honourable member indicated, a price consisting of $11 million net present value was obtained and we proceeded to contract as a result. I stress again that it was an open and fair tender process. A preferred bidder was selected; negotiations continued with that bidder; and, ultimately, at the eleventh hour when it appeared it could not succeed, a much better offer was made, through some hard bargaining, which resulted in a 50-year lease with a 49-year option being granted, and contracts were entered into. NA",40
74,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the honourable member for Lilley, I advise the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the German Bundestag. On behalf of the parliament and the people of Australia, we wish you a very warm welcome and a most enjoyable stay in our country. Hononrable members-Hear, hear! NA Business Loans",40
75,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of any developments in relation to small business loan products and interest rates available on such products for small business? How do these products assist small business?,40
76,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At midnight last night the country's biggest non-bank lender, Aussie Home Loans, announced that it was entering the business lending market with a range of low interest rate loans which it says will revolutionise Australian business lending. Called 'Aussie Business Loans', the lender is now offering business loans at a standard variable rate of 7.49 per cent. This must be one of the biggest competitive challenges which the banks in Australia have ever faced and, as far as this government is concerned, may there be much more competition and may those rates just get better and better. I offer a challenge to Australian banks today to see whether any of those banks can match the new entrant into the business lending market-Aussie Business Loans. When this government came into office in March 1996, prevailing small business variable loans were around lIlA per cent. Those indicator rates have come down by the full 1.5 percentage points under the monetary policy which has been conducted in tandem with the Reserve Bank of Australia since this government was elected. The prevailing indicator variable loan rate offered by the major banks is now 9%per cent. On a small business loan of $500,000 this provides interest savings to a small business of seven and a half thousand dollars a year. Aussie Home Loans have now thrown down the gauntlet with even better opportunities for small business. A product with a loan rate at a standard variable of 7.49 per cent will provide a further saving of around 21A per cent on business variable loan rates. On $500,000 this would provide a further interest saving of about $11,250 a year. The total interest savings in relation to that product for a small business would amount to 3% percentage points, compared with the time before this government came to office. I have said before that for many small businesses the opportunity is now there for them to approach their banks. Not all banks will be offering the most competitive products to a smaIl business if they have been banking with them for some time. I urge smaIl businesses to go back to their banks and demand the most competitive product which is available in relation to business loans. I urge the banks to see whether they can match the competitive urge of new entrants into the provision of financial services. These are great opportunities for small business. They confirm a low interest rate, low inflation, high investment economy offering opportunities for job creation, as we have seen in relation to many of the indicators which I elaborated on in my last answer. It is the policy of this government to throw away the failure of 13 years of Labor-the high deficit, high debt, high interest rate regime-and to bring in the balanced budget, low inflation, low interest rates, solid growth and job creation opportunities that Australia needs. As we have said, you cannot tum around 13 years of failure in 11 months but this government has made a start on those problems and, with sustained effort, the Australian economy will reap those benefits. Woods, Senator Bob",40
77,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The so-called 13 years of failure included deregulation of the financial sector, which produced this situation. My question is to the Prime Minister. Before the Woods allegations became public, did you discuss the issue with anyone other than the Attorney-General and Senator Woods? If so, with whom and when?",41
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have no recoIlection of discussing it with anybody other than the Attorney-General. Unemployment: Work for the Dole,41
79,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday you said you had never ruled out, when in opposition, a compulsory work for the dole scheme. Do you recaIl a press release issued by the opposition on 31 August 1995 which says: Claims that the coalition would force Australians to work for the dole are totally false ... AndThere has been no suggestion of a compulsory work for the dole scheme. Prime Minister, how do you reconcile that categorical rejection with your statement yesterday? Do you expect the public to see this as another memory loss or have you deliberately misled them?",41
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"During the course of the election campaign I was asked on several occasions about work for the dole and I said on those occasions that I had no objection to the concept of work for the dole. That press release that you refer to was not issued by me and therefore the statement. I made yesterday was absolutely true and it remains the ease that during the eourse of the election campaign I at no stage ruled out introducing a work for the dole scheme. I have absolutely no occasion to regret, change or vary anything I said yesterday. Mr Crean-I seek leave to table the press release issued on behalf of the opposition, which makes the statements I have just referred to. Leave not granted. International Labour Organisation Conventions",41
81,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Opposition members-Ah, he has woken up.",42
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left!,42
83,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the minister seen reports of comments by former Prime Minister Whitlam to the effect that Labor should adopt a policy of restoring International Labour Organisation conventions as the central basis of labour law? Has the government considered Mr Whitlam's proposal? If so, what would be the impact of such a proposal?",42
84,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for rising to his feet to ask this question. I did not see the reports but I did hear of the reports of the standing ovation that the Labor faithful gave Gough Whitlam yesterday. I must say in respect of Mr Whitlam that while many of us on both sides--certainly our side-find him both civil and engaging when we meet him on our rounds, I have to say that I did find his proposals yesterday, if anything, extreme. That is no surprise to me because I have always been bemused by the fact that ever since 1975 the Labor Party have had Gough Whitlam on a pedestal.",42
85,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Where is the pedestal for Malcolm?,42
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Banks.,42
87,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My memory of it when I was in my twenties was that the Whitlam government was one of the great disasters-and worse governments-Australia has had. Whenever I see Gough I am reminded of Cairns, Cameron, Connor, Crean and, of course, their erstwhile adviser, Mr Khemlani. This gives you a better description of the sort of government that they were. His proposition yesterday that we should restore ILO conventions as the central basis of labour law really does take the cake. Although, historically, ILO conventions have influenced Australian industrial relations legislation, as we are interested in the views of others, they have never formed the basis of such legislation in the way that Mr Whitlam suggests they might in the future. Even if you shared Mr Whitlam's apparent belief in the infallibility of the ILO-which, obviously, we do not-the fact is that usually these conventions are expressed in a very broad and general way. There is, however, one glaring and incredible never to be forgotten exception to this rule of the generalised drafting nature of ILO conventions-and that is none other than ILO convention No. 158. We do have some experience of the Labor Party taking up the suggestion made by Gough Whitlam yesterday and that was the experience we had with Australia's unfair dismissal law, introduced by none other than the member for Kingsford Smith. Let us look at that convention. I presume Bob Carr was there. What an irony it would have been for him to have been on his feet applauding Gough Whitlam's suggestion when Bob Carr was one of those many who said that convention 158 was a disaster for young people when it came to their opportunities to have a job. So, Gough, we thank you for your advice but we reject it in bizarre in the the interests",42
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Is it relevant for the minister to keep referring to the opposition's legislation in relation to unfair dismissal when it is virtually exactly the same as their amended version of the point of the Democrats?",42
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,42
90,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To conclude: the Leader of the Opposition may not have realised it, but we actually scrapped your scheme and we also scrapped its reliance on convention 158 because it was such an unmitigated disaster for so many Australians. The last thing I say is that Mr Whitlam made some comments about our involvement in the ILO. We do not repudiate the ILO; Australia remains a fully fledged member of the ILO and we will continue to make a sensible contribution. But we are not going to have Australia's industrial relations law for Australians written in Geneva. Youth Unemployment",43
91,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,As one of those who was proud to give Gough Whitlam a standing ovation yesterday,43
92,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,43
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Canberra will proceed to his question or resume his seat.,43
94,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And as one who actually heard what he said other than what you quoted, my question is to the Prime Minister. You said the work for the dole scheme was 'not designed to manipulate the unemployment figures'. Isn't it the case that the ABS will count those forced to enter your scheme as employed? How will you ensure that this will not happen? Have you consulted with the Australian Bureau of Statistics about this?",43
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I stand by what I said yesterday and this morning, and let me repeat it. The purpose of this proposal is not to artificially massage or manipulate the unemployment lists in the way that your Working Nation schemes did. We even have an admission from the member for Hotham that they had that effect. We know the frantic attempts that were made by the member for Hotham in the months before the last election. His old department wasMr Crean-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. If the Prime Minister is asserting the admission to me that he has alleged, let him put on the record that statement.",43
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? Mr Crean-My point of order is that he cannot assert that without the evidence.,43
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. There is no point of order.,43
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Time without number in this House, since the election of my government, my colleague from Goldstein has exposed the way in which the former minister's former department worked overtime shovelling the money out into these absolutely failed schemes, desperately trying to manipulate the unemployment list before the last election. I know that those opposite understand deep down, in their calmer momentsMrs Crosio--Calmer?",43
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the good sense of what I proposed yesterday. What I proposed yesterday recognises a very simple principle: that in a civilised democratic society, provided the rates of pay are fair and just-which ours will be-it is not unreasonable to ask people to do something in return for a social welfare benefit if you are able to do so. Mrs Crosio--Ask all the unemployed, not just some of them.",43
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Prospect!,43
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have absolutely no reluctance in asserting the value of that principle before any audience anywhere in Australia because it is a sound principle. Mrs Crosio--That is not the point. You don't understand it at all.,43
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Prospect.,43
103,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I repeat to the member for Canberra that the design of the scheme is not to manipulate. You asked whether there have been discussions with the Bureau of Statistics: I have not personally had any discussions with the bureau. There may have been by the department of employment and training. If there were I will find out and if there is anything useful I can add to this answer I will. Aged Care,43
104,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Is the government still committed to its aged care structural reform package? Could the minister advise the House what progress has been made towards its implementation?,44
105,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper for his question. I know he has taken a particular interest in issues to do with older Australians in the electorate of Cowper and I have welcomed his input and interest. This government is absolutely committed to its structural reform package because this structural reform package will ensure the dignity, the comfort, the security and the safety of older Australians in residential aged care. It will be based on a person's need, not the size of their bank balance or their incomes. One of the major legacies left to this government by the Labor Party was its rigid and inflexible aged care system. It failed to meet the needs of residents in a contemporary Australia. Far too many of our nursing homes provide accommodation which does not meet basic community expectations. Even in 1997, nearly 40 per cent of residents share a room of four or more beds, with the loss of dignity and privacy which that entails. In addition to that, a small but unacceptable portion of homes do not even meet basic fire and safety regulations under the state regulations. The way that that care is now funded is also inefficient and it is outdated. Dementia sufferers, for example, cannot get the support that they need. People who enter hostels are forced to move to a nursing home as they become increasingly frail. Couples are very often forced to separate under this particular system. When the government announced its aged care structural reform package in the 1996 budget it did layout a very clear vision and a framework for the future of aged care in Australia. What we did say was that we would work with industry and consumer groups through the many layers of detail that are needed in the implementation of this package. The package offers far-reaching structural reform of residential aged care to ensure the dignity and the comfort of older Australians. Today I am very pleased to announce that we have released the first report of the funding and other implementation issues working group, while responding also to a number of the specific implementation issues that they raise in that paper. We have released that paper and we have released my comment. We have also released for comment today, publicly, an exposure draft of the Aged Care Bill 1997 which will give substance to the new structure. I wish at this time to record my gratitude to those consumer and industry representatives and union representatives working in the working group who have given of their time and their expertise in a constructive way. This is in stark contrast to the Labor Party's cynical scare campaign against older AustralIans. Today I have announced the government response to the advice we have received and the key measures will be to ensure that residential aged care is based on need, not on people's means. We will ensure that entry contributions, now to be called accommodation bonds, will be applied consistently and fairly. We will introduce effective and fair income testing measures that will replace the uncapped variable fee policy that the Labor Party presided over. We will ensure that accommodation bonds will not be payable by concessi anal residents and, indeed, special arrangements will be made for those who have a spouse living in the property or who have a carer or a dependent child. It will bring substantial capital investment and major improvement to the quality of the nursing home sector. Despite Labor's mischief and total lack of credibility in alternative policy, the development of the new arrangements will deliver what older Australians want most-that is, dignity. It is about delivering comfort. It is about delivering safety and security. It is about access to care based on people's need, not based on people's means. Youth Unemployment",44
106,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to yesterday's scanty announcement of a work for the dole scheme for young people. Twenty-four hours later, has the Prime Minister been able to fill out the details? Will signifi- Brisbane! cant extra funding be available for local councils and community groups for capital and administrative works?

111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right!,45
112,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think that particular question really says it all about your contempt for the people you once claimed to represent. That is what it shows. Scratch a former President of the ACTO and you find an underlying contempt for the battlers of Australia. For too long, for 13 years, you regarded yourself as part of the governing elite of this nation and you lost touch with those people, and that is why they treated you with such dispatch in March of last year. The answer to your question is that, as the days and weeks go by, we will spell out more details of the scheme, but all of the essential details are already there. I can assure the member for Batman, but, more importantly, let me assure the people in the community who are interested in and willing to support this scheme-and it is very interesting, as much as it may have angered those who sit opposite-that the general community response to this proposal is very positive. The community, unlike the out-of-touch, disconnected members of the Labor Party, understands the potential this scheme has to instil the value of work experience. Mr Bevis interjecting",45
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for,45
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They understand the potential this scheme has to bring people into contact with the labour market, the potential this scheme has to break the cycle of despondency. It will disappoint the member for Batman to hear me say that people are not going to be exposed so far as such things as workers compensation are concerned. It is insulting, as you ought to know, and as I think they will know of you, to infer that there is nothing better for people who have been out of work for longer than six months to do than paint rocks. That is your mentality. It is not ours and it is not their expectation. Regional Development",45
115,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is the minister aware of the problems associated with a shortage of private sector funds being invested in regional Australia? Can the minister outline measures that the Howard-Fischer government is taking to address this problem?,45
116,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. The member for Bendigo has a very distinct interest in regional Australia having represented it for a long time in both state and federal parliaments. He, like those of us who come from regional Australia, would recognise that regional Australia, during the 13 years of a Labor government, suffered more than in any other period in living memory. Regional Australia today is in the worse state it has been in for as long as anybody can remember, and the reasons for that are due to the neglect of the former Labor government during their time in office. One of the things they neglected to endorse or to establish for regional Australia was a method of communication between the major financial institutions in Australia and regional Australia and the projects that potentially exist within regional Australia. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was my understanding that, under the standing orders, ministers could only be asked questions about their portfolio responsibility. The minister has quite clearly articulated to all Australians that he has no longer any responsibility for regional Australia.",45
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,46
118,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When Labor was in office they provided no form of communication between the major financial institutions in Australia and potential projects in regional Australia. As a result of that, many potential good projects which would have created real jobs in regional Australia failed to get off the ground. This government, in the last couple of weeks, has announced a new initiative called the institutional investor information system, which will provide information to those major financial houses within Australiasuperannuation funds, banks and insurance companies. It will provide information to those financial institutions that is relevant projects that are potentially on the table in regional Australia. This is the first time this has ever been undertaken. It is being undertaken in partnership with a number of state governments throughout Australia which recognise the merit of this particular proposal. It will help marry up those projects in regional Australia which will create real jobs and those people in our major metropolitan centres who have the capacity to finance these particular projects. This initiative runs parallel with other initiatives this coalition government has undertaken since we came to office in March last year to try to boost regional Australia. The most recent was the regional telecommunications fund, established late last year, which allocated some $250 million to regional Australia to upgrade some of the most important infrastructure that regional Australia can depend upon. Additional to that is some $3,100 million being expended to upgrade the Pacific Highway in partnership with the New South Wales and Queensland governmentssomething that could have been done during the time of the Labor government but which was totally neglected by it. There is a host of other projects, such as the regional forest agreement, one of which was signed by the Prime Minister and the Victorian premier only last week and which will create 400 real jobs in regional Australia. There is also the green corps; changes to the capital gains tax, which is particularly beneficial to small business in regional Australia; and getting rid of Labor's unfair dismissal provisions, which again were very deleterious to regional small business. Also, there is the significant reduction in interest rates, which will help farmers-they will save hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of this-and small business right throughout regional Australia. Compare these initiatives with the former government's actions, which were to allocate some $150 million over four years, half of which was allocated towards administration. Labor's idea of creating real jobs in regional Australia is to employ more public servants, to most of whom are located here in Canberra. This coalition government's aim is to create real jobs in regional Australia through such initiatives as the institutional investor information service, the green corps, the telecommunications fund for regional Australia and changes our tax system-all of which will create real jobs and mean a real difference to the major infrastructure that regional Australia depends on so much. Youth Unemployment",46
119,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. How much more income will a young unemployed person who is required to work for the dole receive than an individual in equivalent circumstances who is not involved in such a scheme?,46
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The proposal is that the obligation of the person will be to work out the value of the dole. So the answer is self evident. Drugs in Sport,46
121,Mr EOIN CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. What is the government's position with regard to drugs in sport? Can the minister advise the House of any recent initiatives announced by the government to combat the use of drugs in sport?",46
122,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the question. Drugs in sport is certainly a very serious issue. Reports to this parliament over a number of years have outlined the need for this and all governments to be concerned about this matter. We have a commitment to an effective anti-drugs message in sport. Indeed, early last year a new program was initiated called 'Beat the cheats'. It enjoyed strong support from Kieren Perkins and Susie ONEILL at its launch, which I had the pleasure of undertaking in Brisbane. Through the Australian Sports Drug Agency, the government is contributing in the current financial year nearly $4 million to a program to ensure that drug testing can take place. Up until the end of this financial year, it is expected that nearly 3,500 tests will be undertaken across 57 sports under the program. Samples have been collected from about 112 drug testing sessions, 345 events and 467 out-of-competition testing. So there is testing at competition and out-ofcompetition testing, which is essential to making sure that the Australian Sports Drug Agency can continue its work. Following the Atlanta Olympic Games-we had people there from ASDA and many other departments-the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory, which is in the portfolio of my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services, purchased a high resolution mass spectrometer, which is a piece of testing machinery that will be required for Australia to meet the IOC-International Olympic Committee-accreditation requirements for the Sydney Olympics. This undertaking is certainly welcomed. It is an essential piece of equipment to ensure that we can meet our obligations. Interestingly, today I launched the session of the international anti-doping arrangement, of which Australia is a member. Here in Canberra are members from sport drug agencies across the world-Britain, Norway, New Zealand and Canada-who are putting together a reciprocal anti-doping arrangement to try to harmonise anti-doping arrangements across the globe in anticipation of the need to make sure that the Olympic Games and, indeed, all sports are drug free. It is important that we achieve, on an ongoing basis, drug free sport. The ethical basis to sport needs to be underpinned-with our commitment, across political lines, and in all sports across Australia-that there will be no drugs in sport. To this end, ASDA will be pursuing, during the current financial year and next financial year, a major educational program. The Drugs in sport handbook, which was released last year, has already seen nearly 16,000 copies distributed right around our country. This government is committed to an ongoing regime of drugs free sport, particularly in light of the huge responsibilities we have in hosting the Sydney Olympics.",47
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",47
124,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that there is only one exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas 'active service' by Australians. That being under 'Operational Service' at Section 6.(l)(c)(ii) of the Act for members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960. The various claims used to date to maintain their exclusion have now been proved wrong by documents in the Australian Archives and elsewhere in the public domain. Some of the claims used to support the exclusion are: (a) members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted (which applies to all Service personnel everywhere); (b) they were in no danger (they shared the same dangers as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya and were also required to serve under the United Nations command in Korean waters in case that war had started again); (c) they were never 'allotted for operational service' (a letter from the Secretary to the Department of the Navy dated II November 1955 categorically stated the date for which the RAN was 'allotted' for operational service was I July 1955); (d) they were not on 'Special Overseas Service' (such Service began with the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act of 1962 i.e. two years after their service ended and did not therefore apply to them); and (e) they were not on 'active service' (their service complied with all but one of the requirements of the only Defence Department definition of 'active service' the exception being 'or in military occupation of a foreign country', which did not apply to Malaya). Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition and treatment with all other Australians who have honourably served their country on active service overseas. by Mr Anthony (from 40 citizens), Mr Bevis (from 20 citizens), Mrs Elizabeth Grace (from 30 citizens), Mr Hardgrave (from IO citizens), Mr Kerr (from 15 citizens) and Mrs Vale (from 17 citizens). Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the President and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned Citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 have been deliberately and wrongly excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas 'active service' under 'Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(c)(ii) of the Act. They are the only Australian Citizens to be treated in that way. (2) A defined group of citizens, who served in the Malaya area, being members of the Royal Australian Navy Defence Forces so affected, have been wrongly excluded, whereas members of the Army and Air Force were not so excluded, and this is supported by documents in the Australian Archives and elsewhere on public record. (3) Allied veterans of 50 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of Korean War can have had qualifying eligibility for benefits under the Act. Veterans of South Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and the United States can have eligibility resulting from the Vietnam War. Their service was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. (4) It is claimed that: (a) Members of the RAN were designated as 'on active service' when they served in a designated zone that is within a 12 NM limit offshore from the coastline of Malaya from 9th May 1952 to 1st December 1960. These dates are verified in Declarations by the Governor General, Commander-inChief of the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth, contained in Commonwealth Government Gazettes No. 40, 5th June, 1952 and No. 82, 8th December, 1960. (b) Members of the RAN were engaged on operational duties that applied to all service personnel everywhere. (c) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, including the death by 'friendly fire' of a sailor during support operations. This can be attested to be a Naval Flag Officer who witnessed the death on board his ship. (d) The Royal Australian Navy was 'allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this authorisation was contained in Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. (e) They were not bound by the 'Special Overseas Service' requirements which were introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962, which act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended. (f) the Australian citizens serving in the Royal Australian Navy complied with all the requirements for 'active service'. The fourth, for 'military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya. (g) The Department of Veterans' Affairs has indicated it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WAG 130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex-members of the RAN had been 'allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex-members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In Parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the the exclusion, reasons for which can not be found. This action would not have been taken had the Parliament been properly informed. Parliament has unfortunately approved the introduction of qualified retrospectivity through accepting these amendments to the Act resulting in an injustice being perpetrated against ex-service personnel. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray Your Honourable House take appropriate action to remove the previous Government's discriminatory exclusion of Naval personnel in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of Australian citizens' honourable service with the Royal Australian Navy for their country, whilst on 'active service' in the Malaya campaign. by Mr Costello (from 10 citizens) and  To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the families and friends of Nurruby Childcare Centre and Preschool, NSW, Bangalow Community Preschool and Long Day Care Incorporated, NSW, and MCGRATHs Hill Child Care (Inc.), NSW, respectfully bring to your attention the adverse effects to the quality, availability and equity of child care should changes proposed in the recently tabled budget go ahead. Namely that: removal of operational subsidies to community based (not for profit) long day care centres will increase fees, adding a greater financial burden to working parents. removal of operational subsidy to community based (not for profit) long day care centres in order to place them in competition with privately owned centres (operating for profit) is unfair, iniquitous and may result in a lesocial securityer quality of care for our children. We request the House support the retention of operational subsidies to community based (not for profit) long day care centres and that community based (not for profit) child care continue to be valued and supported as a lower cost, high quality child care alternative for working parents. by Mr Anderson (from 70 citizens), Mr Anthony (from 31 citizens) and Mr Bartlett (from 28 citizens). Meat Industry Review To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition by owners of meat producing livestock from all States of Australia draws to the attention of the House the present Meat Industry review being held for the purpose of industry restructure, under the office of The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, The Hon. John Anderson, MP. The petitioners believe the review has not been sufficiently wide so to enable all owners of meat producing livestock to be fully aware of all proposals available for restructure of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Meat Research Corporation and Meat Industry Council, bodies which are funded by a statutory levy on the industry. Your petitioners therefore request that the House ensure that: (1) A referendum is held, available to all owners of meat producing livestock clearly detailing all options proposed for the restructure of the AMLC, Child Care MRC and MIC. (2) Such referendum contain an option that requires: (a) that the MRC and MIC be abolished, and that the AMLC be reconstituted so that it is required by legislation to be controlled by a Board, the members of which are directly elected, 'one vote, one value' by postal ballot available to all owners of meat producing livestock, at least once every three years; and (b) that the Board be required to ensure the AMLC does all things necessary to be involved on behalf of all owners of meat producing livestock in all aspects of purchasing, processing, transporting and marketing of stock, and such meat as may be derived from those stock, in such a manner to ensure those operations in which the AMLC is involved shall operate at all times at cost and to ensure, when purchasing livestock, the maximum price the market could afford is, at all times, passed on to the owners of those livestocks; and (c) that the reconstituted AMLC has the powers of 'single desk' selling with the Board required to exercise those powers in the event of any indication of 'price transfer' taking place in the industry. by Mr Anderson (from 13 citizens) and Mr Fitzgibbon (from nine citizens). Copyright To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the citizens and business proprietors of the Northern Rivers draw to the attention of the House our objection, under the Commonwealth Copyright Act 1968, in being required to hold a Copyright Music Licence pertaining to the playing of background music by way of radio, cassette or CD at our business premises. Your petitioners therefore request the House to amend the relevant legislation in respect to the above. by Mr Anthony (from 84 citizens) and Mr Causley (from 33 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of certain Residents of the State of Queensland, draws the attention of the House to the fact that we, Christians, Members and Adherents of the New Life Wesleyan Methodist Church, Queensland, affirm our adherence to Christian Principles as set out in the Bible. We believe that Euthanasia under any circumstances contravenes the letter and spirit of Scripture, which places emphasis on the value of human life and on the fact that God alone is in a position to determine where life begins and ends. We are concerned that such action as legalising Euthanasia, regardless of conditions imposed or precautions taken, will open the door to abuse of the system, and will lead to a serious deterioration of moral standards in this area. Your Petitioners therefore pray that the House support the Private Member's Bill which seeks to over-ride the Northern Territory Legislation, and so indicate its determination to continue to uphold Christian and Biblical Principles in this matter. by Ms Gambaro (from 170 citizens). Euthanasia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of certain Residents of the State of Queensland, draws the attention of the House to the fact that we, Christians, Members and Adherents of the Gateway Presbyterian Church, Queensland, affirm our adherence to Christian Principles as set out in the Bible. We believe that Euthanasia under any circumstances contravenes the letter and spirit of Scripture, which places emphasis on the value of human life and on the fact that God alone is in a position to determine where life begins and ends. We are concerned that such action as legalising Euthanasia, regardless of conditions imposed or precautions taken, will open the door to abuse of the system, and will lead to a serious deterioration of moral standards in this area. Your Petitioners therefore pray that the House support the Private Member's Bill which seeks to over-ride the Northern Territory Legislation, and so indicate its determination to continue to uphold Christian and Biblical Principles in this matter. by Mrs Elizabeth Grace (from 12 citizens). Funding: University of New South Wales To the Honourable the Speaker and the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls Euthanasia to the attention of the House that the Commonwealth of Australia has provided significant funding to the University of New South Wales including the funding for the University's St George campus. A reduction in that funding has resulted in the University of New South Wales proposing to restructure its operations including abolishing the current schools at the St George campus of the University. Your petitioners therefore petition that the House moves to support the continuing funding and operation of the St George campus of the University of New South Wales including the schools of applied and performing arts, teacher education and sport and leisure studies. by Mr MCClelland (from 132 citizens) and Mr Mutch (from 30 citizens). Kingsford Smith Airport To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament This petition of certain residents of Dulwich Hill draws to the attention of the House new operational procedures at Kingsford Smith Airport which allow departing aircraft to veer sharply from direct flightpaths and deviate over Dulwich HilL This action has caused severe noise impact across the breadth of hills west of Sydney Basin and has occurred without proper assessment of the effects on inland regions where air pollution is a major problem. Your petitioners therefore request that the House urgently reinstate a six mile limit on departures over residential areas. Your petitioners further request that departures over Dulwich Hill be ceased until Environmental and Public Health Impact Statements are executed. Your petitioners further request that the Commonwealth urgently proceed with the construction of a second airport to provide a long term solution to this problem. by Mr Albanese (from 474 citizens). Kingsford Smith Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia living in the Dulwich Hill, Hurlstone Park, Canterbury, Ashfield and Summer Hill suburbs draws to the attention of the House the increased aircraft noise suffered by those residents living to the North-West of Kingsford Smith Airport. Your petitioners therefore call on the Federal Government to: Maximise the number of aircraft movements over the waters of Botany Bay Minimise the number of aircraft movements, particularly take-otIs, to the north Build a second airport as a matter of urgency. by Mr Albanese (from 54 citizens). Kingsford Smith Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia draws to attention of the House the sustained detrimental effect on the quality of life for people living under the flight path of Kingsford Smith Airport, Sydney. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: take immediate action to construct a second airport for Sydney at the Badgerys Creek site make the second airport the main airport for Sydney in the interim, ensure all departures and arrivals are directed over Botany Bay whenever possible. by Mr Albanese (from 26 citizens). Continance Aids Assistance Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned states that: We the undersigned citizens respectfully call on the House to: Recognise the needs of children under the age of 16 years and Adults over the age of 65 years to receive grants under the Continance Aids Assistance Scheme (CAAS). And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Andrew (from 257 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: We believe that the traditional Christian view of the family unit excludes anything other than a male and female, living in a lawful marriage relationship, along with their children, and that it is necessary for this to be restated by our political leaders. We reaffirm our belief in the traditional Christian view of marriage as God's holy institution in which male and female become one flesh. (Genesis 2.24; Matthew 19.5,6) We reaffirm that God is the author of marriage, and has restricted it to the union of male with female and that such marriage between male and female is commended in Scripture as honourable among all. (Ephesians 5.15-23) We reaffirm that such marriage between male and female is ordained for life-long companionship, help and comfort which husband and wife ought to have of each other. (Romans 7.2,3) We reaffirm that children are a heritage of the Lord and should be nurtured in a godly home, and that human society can be strong and happy only the where the marriage bond is held in honour. (Psalm 127.3) We reaffirm that incestuous marriages can never be made lawful by the law of any man or government, or the consent of parties, so as to allow those people to live together as married couples. (Mark 6.18; Leviticus 18.6-28) We reaffirm that, according to Biblical law, it is forbidden for a male to practise sexual intercourse with another male, or for a female with a female, and that since this is an abomination before the Lord, such as a prohibited relationship for marriage. (Leviticus 18.22; 20.13) We believe the entire stability and well being of our society depends on maintaining this traditional Christian view of marriage and family (Leviticus 20.15-16; 18.23-24) Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should call on the Government to: (a) Preserve completely intact the exclusiveness of marriage as being one male and one female. (b) That the definition of a prohibited relationship in the Marriage Act 1961, Part III 23(2) be amended with the addition of a new clause (c) so that it reads as follows: (2) Marriages of parties within a prohibited relationship are marriages(a) between a person and an ancestor or descendant of the person; or (b) between a brother and a sister (whether of the Marriage whole blood or the half blood); or (c) between a male and a male or between a female and a female. Your Petitioners humbly pray. by Mr Anthony (from 91 citizens). Telstra To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the need to keep Telstra in public ownership so as to protect jobs for thousands of Australians and to ensure affordable telephone calls, and to extend the Perth local charge zone to include Rockingham. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request the House immediately looks into the situation. by Mr Beazley (from 2,634 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in duly assembled Parliament. The Petition of Certain Citizens of Australia draws attention of the House that: (a) Consequent to the confirming civil war in Sri Lanka within the North and Eastern Provinces over half a million Tamil people have been rendered homeless, and are in need of international humanitarian aid. (b) Further, due to the civil war most of the public and private buildings (especially within the Jaffna Peninsula) in the Northern and Eastern Province of the country has been destroyed and therefore, need urgent repairs and reconstruction. (c) Members of young Tamils have been arrested by the security forces and that their fate is unknown, and is causing great concern due to the past human rights abuses documented by organisations like the Amnesty International. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives will persuade the government to: (1) Move security council of the United Nations to intervene in Sri Lanka and (2) To establish safe Zones in the North and East whose Tamil civilians can move into (3) Ensure that access is available to international humanitarian agencies (like the Red Cross) to render all due humanitarian assistance to the population and begin work on rehabilitation (4) To support all peace initiatives to end the ongoing conflict. by Mr Beazley (from 33 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland expresses concern at the Federal Government's recent decision to cut funding to the ABC by $65 million over two years. This decision will severely compromise the role of the ABC as an independent, non-commercial source of news, sport, information and entertainment. The ABC is a widely respected Australian institution, recognised as a service committed to quality and excellence in broadcasting. The funding cuts which have been announced are the largest ever to the ABC since it was formed in 1932. This decision contrasts completely with a commitment given by Prime Minister, John Howard, and Communications and the Arts Minister, Senator Sri Lanka Richard Alston, prior to the election in March 1996. It was then promised that ""The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC."" We request the House to calion the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to stand by their pre-election commitment, and rescind its recent decision to slash funding to the ABC. by Mr Bevis (from 83 citizens). Invitro Fertilisation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House; invitro-fertilisation genetic selection which is now being pursued to be made legal for the Australian people. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives do not pass a law to legalise invitro-fertilisation genetic selection to be used in Australia, now or at any time, as this is contravening God's sacred law, therefore (lVF) Genetic Selection is an offence to Christianity and the people who petition hereto. by Mr Bradford (from 56 citizens). Kingsford Smith Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the failure of the Federal Government to properly consider the effects of changes to flight paths at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, by neglecting to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement before sanctioning the increased usage of the east-west runway and northerly take-offs from the Third Runway; the resulting disruption to the lives of thousands of residents living under the flight path, whose health is being adversely affected due to constant exposure to very high levels of noise; and the increased risk of accidents as departing aircraft turn sharply to the east and skim over the roofs of houses and industrial complexes in the suburbs of Mascot, Botany, Eastlakes, Pagewood, Daceyville, Kingsford, Maroubra, Kensington and Coogee. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to take the necessary action to ensure that the flight paths at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport revert to those used before March 1996, and that a full Environmental Impact Statement be prepared before any further changes are made. by Mr Brereton (from 561 citizens). Federal Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that a cut in Federal funding has resulted in the abolition of two positions at St Gerards Catholic Primary School, 31 Changton Way, Westminster 6061. The positions which have been cut are: Parentffeacher Liaison Music Teacher The abolition of the ParentlLiaison position will affect the welfare of parents and children alike. Our music specialist teacher gave many children musical opportunities they could never ordinarily afford. Your petitioners request the House to return our funding to re-employ our Parentffeacher Liaison and music teacher. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 170 citizens). SkiIIShare Program To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House assembled in Parliament. The petition of Citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the of Representatives of the House the recent funding cut of 33% per cent to the SkillS hare Program and a lack of commitment to the Program beyond September 1996. This cut will force a dramatic reduction of services, support and assistance to unemployed people-the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of our communities. Your petitioners therefore request the RepresentaRailway tives of the House to intercede on our behalf to strongly oppose these and any future cuts and to defend the cost-effective SkillShare Program. by Mr Causley (from 27 citizens). To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned, urge that the House: (1) Closely monitor preparation for the upcoming Cambodian election in 1998 and to secure the agreement of the Cambodian Government to full and unhindered participation of international observers for the 1998 election; (2) Support the continuation of human rights monitoring in Cambodia by the United Nations. (3) Encourage Cambodia's other Donors and trading partners to raise human rights concerns with Cambodia; (4) Raise human rights concerns at the Donors' Consultative Meeting for Cambodia and during consideration of the projects in Cambodia to be financed by international financial institutions; (5) Provide assistance to Cambodia to broaden democratic civil society, to strengthen the rule of law and to ensure that future elections in Cambodia are free and fair. by Mr Crean (from 536 citizens).

Timor Gap Oil Treaty To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Federal Parliament assembled. The petition of certain residents and citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that on the 11 th of December 1989 the Australian Government through Senator G. Evans signed the Timor Gap Treaty with Indonesia to exploit the oil reserves in the East Timor Sea. We the undersigned residents and citizens of Australia categorically reject the validity of this treaty as we also condemn the Indonesian occupation of East Timor and the subsequent wholesale victimisation of the East Timorese people by the Indonesian military. Your Petitioner therefore requests the House to revoke the Timor Gap Oil Treaty. by Mr Gareth Evans (from 1,305 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the mounting public concern as to the future of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure that no cuts be made to the funding of the ABC and that triennial funding arrangements be retained. Furthermore, we call on the House to ensure that ABC services be free of commercial sponsorship and advertising. by Mr Fitzgibbon (from 43 citizens). Mobile Phone Towers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain electors of the Division of Hindmarsh draws to the attention of the House the proposed erection of a mobile phone tower at 187 Henley Beach Road, Mile End by the Vodafone telecommunications company. We are concerned that this tower will devalue surrounding land and pose a possible health risk to local citizens. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take steps to prevent Vodafone erecting this tower without consultation with, or agreement of the local councils and residents of Mile End. by Mrs Gallus (from 1,052 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Federal Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for tight, uniform gun control laws.

Holsworthy Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the proposal to use the Holsworthy military range as a possible site for the building of Sydney's second international airport. We believe that the site is unsuitable due to: its proximity to large and rapidly growing residential areas; the presence of unexploded ammunition on site; the expense involved due to necessary landfill to make the site suitable for development; the existent noise pollution in the area already suffered by residents which would only be increased under the new proposal. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House oppose the newly proposed site of Holsworthy for Sydney's second international airport. by Mr Latham (from 2,983 citizens). Holsworthy Airport To the Honourable Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the proposal to use the Holsworthy military range as a possible site for the construction of Sydney's 24 hour second international airport. We believe that the site is unsuitable due to: its proximity to large and rapidly growing residential areas; the great stress and concern it is causing the many residents living in surrounding suburbs; Gun Laws the presence of unexploded ammunition on the site, and the great cost of removing them; the expense and inconvenience involved to provide landfill to make the site suitable for development and the resultant destruction of landform and pristine natural environment in the process; the existent noise pollution in the area already suffered by residents which would increase; the presence of rare and endangered species of flora and fauna, and significant examples of Aboriginal and early European cultural heritage that would be threatened or destroyed to accommodate the airport; the area's importance in maintaining high quality air and water supplies for South Westem Sydney; the danger to air quality of all residents of the Sydney basin if an airport is situated so close to the city; the danger of damaging or destroying any aspect of the ecological balance of the National Parks surrounding the site or under the flight paths; the danger posed by bush fires, or the cleaning and destruction of valuable bushland to prevent them. Your petitioners therefore request that you oppose the consideration and construction of an airport in Holsworthy by immediately withdrawing the proposal and ensuring that the land in question be given over as national heritage (national park) immediately the defence force withdraw from the area. by Mr Latham (from 203 citizens). Holsworthy Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that the decision to conduct an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) of Holsworthy as a possible site for Sydney's second airport is the cause of great distress and concern to the many residents that live in the surrounding suburbs. Your petitioners pray that the House firmly oppose the construction of an airport at Holsworthy. by Mrs Vale (from 1,571 citizens). Holsworthy Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Campbelltown and Liverpool draw the attention of the House to the fact that our suburbs and quality of life will be severely depleted by the construction of Holsworthy International Airport. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to immediately abandon any plan to construct an airport at Holsworthy. by Mr Latham (from 2,330 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned requestsThat the Federal and State Governments act swiftly to enact all the proposed new gun laws recommended by the Police Ministers' meeting of 10 May 1996, including: a complete ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and national registration for all firearms. by Mr Lee (from 18 citizens). Cooked Chicken Meat Imports To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned draws to the attention of the House the importance of preserving high quarantine standards to maintain Australia's clean food reputation and to protect native wildlife. Your petitioners therefore requestThat the House call on the Federal Government to maintain the ban on cooked chicken meat imports because of the threat it poses to Australia's chicken meat industry, and the risk of introducing diseases which would threaten native bird life. by Mr Lee (from 12 citizens). Poliomyelitis To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of Rural Poliomyelitis Disabled People in Australia draws to the attention of the House, the lack of opportunity to reach doctors specialising in poliomyelitis effects, orthotists, physiotherapists trained in therapy needs of people with post polio syndrome, and accommodation which has hoist-assisted and fully accessible facilities both in major rural and metropolitan cities. Although some larger rural centres have Polio Support Groups formed by 'old polios', all of whom as concerned about the further deterioration of our mobility-referred to as Post Polio Syndrome, people living in rural and remote areas of Australia are isolated and lack knowledge of what little specialised care is provided in metropolitan centres-especially at the Royal Prince Henry Hospital, Sydney. If they do have the knowledge they may not have the energy or finances to access the metropolitan services which are so thinly spread throughout Australia. The closure of Fairfield Hospital was a great loss Gun Laws to Victorian and southem NSW country people who required specialised polio treatment. Until about two years ago, people could be sent there for short term treatment and equipment repair. This specialist care by the people with years of experience has now been lost to the community in need of this type of care. Your petitioners therefore request the House to rectify this lack of specialised services to people with post polio. by Mr Lieberman (from 505 citizens). Commonwealth Dental Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The following citizens of Australia request that the House of Representatives note with concern that the withdrawal of Commonwealth funding for dental clinics will place undue hardship on the disadvantaged population of Australia and create unacceptably long waiting lists. Your petitioners therefore request the House to call on the government to reconsider its decision to cut Commonwealth dental funding. by Mr Lieberman (from 110 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia points out to the House that the Child Care Assistance Proposal would greatly and further financially disadvantage those of lower socio-economic groups, student and sole parent pensioners. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House consider modifying the proposed legislation in order that those parents on low incomes who wish to remain in the workforce and those parents studying in order to obtain further qualifications so that they may contribute to Australia's economic prosperity, may do so without incurring a high level of financial hardship towards themselves and their children. by Mr Lindsay (from 986 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to the attention of the House that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has imposed upon children wishing to bring their parents to Australia, as migrants, the need to show that there are a majority of children already living is. This decision will cause significant hardship to a number of families as it will arbitrarily prevent family unification and the right to family life even in the case of strong emotional and financial ties and will preclude migration where the number of children living in Australia is evenly balanced with children living in another country. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to forthwith revoke his decision to restrict the ability of children to sponsor their parents as migrants to Australia to the situation where the majority of children live in Australia. by Mr MCClelland (from 400 citizens). Migrants To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to the attention of the House that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has imposed a two year probationary period, taken from the date of application, on spouses wishing to migrate to Australia. This decision will cause significant hardship to a number of couples who have already been in a marital relationship for a considerable period of time before making application to migrate to Australia. Your petitioners therefore request the House to Child Care direct the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to forthwith revoke his decision to impose such a probationary period on spouses wishing to migrate to Australia. by Mr MCClelland (from 298 citizens). Migrants To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to the attention of the House that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has removed the ability of permanent residents of Australia to sponsor family members wishing to migrate to Australia. This decision unfairly discriminates against permanent residents of this country particularly in circumstances where they may have experienced some delay or difficulty in obtaining Australian citizenship and could result in the Migrants separation of close family members for periods exceeding two years. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to forthwith revoke his decision to remove the ability for permanent residents to sponsor family members wishing to migrate to Australia. in Australby Mr MCClelland (from 292 citizens). Migrants To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to the attention of the House that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has increased fees for all offshore and onshore family visa classes for the 1996/97 financial year including spouse, prospective marriage, parent, preferential family, interdependency, skilled and family. This decision will cause significant hardship to a number of people including less well off families who will have difficulty in meeting the costs of applications particularly in circumstances where the application fee may well be sacrificed if the application is unsuccessful. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to forthwith revoke his decision to impose such additional migration fees. by Mr MCClelland (from 282 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to the attention of the House that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has stated that a cap will be imposed upon certain family visa classes for the 1996/97 financial year including prospective marriage, parent, preferential family and interdependency. This decision will cause significant hardship to a number of families as it will arbitrarily prevent any more visas being issued irrespective of the merits of the application once the capped figure has been reached. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to forthwith revoke his decision to impose such caps and to consider all applications for family visas on their merits. by Mr MCClelland (from 271 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Hon J.W. Howard Prime Minister The Hon P. Costello MP The Treasurer Senator Cheryle Kernot Leader of the Democrats The Hon Judi Moylan MP Minister for Family Services We, the undersigned, have recorded below our opposition to the proposed cuts to operational subsidy and childcare assistance. We encourage your support to ensure that this does not happen. by Mr MCClelland (from 264 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to the attention of the House that the Minister for Health and Family Services proposes certain changes to funding in the area of aged care which will result in: the payment of entry of fees of up to $26,()()0 for people wanting to enter nursing homes; a daily fee charge of up to $34; the increase in charges for community services such as Meals on Wheels. Your petitioners therefore request that the House direct the Minister for Health and Family Services Visas to revoke his decision to implement these charges and increases. by Mr MCClelland (from 158 citizens). Aboriginal Community Organisations To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia and, in particular, certain members of the Aboriginal Community of Murray Bridge and surrounding areas, draws the attention of the House to a number of problems involving local Aboriginal community organisations, and in particular: the misuse of vehicles, finance, workers' positions and power; failure to address problems relating to drugs, alcohol and unemployment; and a lack of genuine representation by community representatives. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to Child Care investigate these problems and put in place measures to ensure that people at the grass roots level receive the help, support and opportunities that they should have, but are not currently receiving. by Mr MCLachlan (from 101 citizens). Higher Education Contribution Scheme To the Honourable Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia: Draws the Rttention of the House to the issue of Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) under the proposed Federal Government Budget. Repayment fees of $2,487 per year for all courses is already enough for young or mature age students to have to repay when they have completed their course. Increasing the fees will only allow for the students, who have wealthy parents, to attend university and place university Aged Care out of reach for the low income earner. Reducing the HECS repayment threshold from $28,495 to $20,701 will create hardship for many employed under-graduates and those with young families who are studying. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House: Give the matter of education funding serious consideration to the return to equal education opportunity for all, regardless of social or economic position and a return to the HECS repayment system that cxisted before the change of Government. by Mr Neville (from 444 citizens). Medicare Offices, Regional Queensland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain electors of the Division of Hinkler draws to the attention of the House That the Petitioners are concerned with the reports of a number of Medicare offices to be closed, in particular, Regional offices in Queensland and especially (1) the subsequent possible job losses in the region and the flow on effect to the local economy. (2) The long term damage sustained to regional centres throughout Queensland which will impact on future growth in our region. (3) The impact of the planned office closures on: (a) The working family who obtain their childcare rebatc from their local Medicare Office. (b) The people who will no longer have access to an office to obtain an immediate reimbursement of their scheduled benefits which will cause severe financial hardship. (4) That access to Medicare by mail will result in delays of payments up to several weeks and involves the filling out of time consuming forms not required at present. Your Petitioners therefore request the House to, Maintain the existing Medicare Offices in Regional Queensland and oppose public sector cuts being implemented now or those planned for the future which affect our region or Regional Queensland. by Mr Neville (from 264 citizens). Child Support To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for reforms in the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to introduce and implement the following reforms: 1. That child support payments be calculated on the non-custodial parent's (payer) net basic rate of pay, exclusive of all allowances, overtime and loading. Not on gross income as it is at present and the lowering of percentages. 2. Lowering of ""the cut off points"" as an incentive to continue in the workplace. 3. Child Support payments be calculated from the net income on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. 4. The non-custodial parent receives a reduction in the child support payment while he or she has the children for periods of time e.g. holidays. by Mr Neville (from 83 citizens). Family Law Act To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House requesting: 1. Thorough investigation of the Family Law Act and its disastrous impact both physically and financially on family farms and business when a marriage breaks down. 2. Accept the findings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee recommendations that farming properties and business be extinguished from the Matrimonial Property. 3. Consideration only be given if financial or physical effort in the management or running of these establishments has been applied. We, the petitioners, humbly pray that the House consider and duly take action upon our requests.  Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully shows that we, as residents of the South Australia, urge the government to: reject moves to cut the funding of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and instead maintain funding in real terms recognise and maintain the role of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as a comprehensive, mainstream and independent media organisation, and not just a complimentary service to commercial media recognise the ABC Charter as a valuable instrument for the expression of Australian cultural life that should not be devalued as a result of economic and political considerations. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.  To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows: a. Proposed changes to Medicare which will see the restriction of provider numbers to new medical graduates will have serious consequences for the medical profession in Australia. They would reduce employment for medical graduates, make part time and locum practice impossible, severely affect medical research and reduce opportunities for postgraduate training through increasing competition for places. b. The public will be affected in the following ways: (i) less access to after hours and locum services; (ii) longer waits for GP consultations. c. Western Australia does not have the oversupply of General Practitioners that is evident in Sydney and Melbourne and is very reliant on locum services. d. Overseas Trained Doctors (OTDs) compete with Australian medical school graduates for training positions, reducing the number of places available for students whose education has been funded by the taxpayer at a cost of around $130,000. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: a. resist all proposals for restriction of Medicare provider numbers; b. restrict intakes of Overseas Trained Doctors (OTDs); c. ensure that Australian graduates have priority access to post-graduate training. by Mr Rocher (from 1,436 citizens). Book Bounty To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of residents of the State of Victoria draws to the attention of the House the plans of the Howard Government to summarily terminate the Book Bounty on 20/8/96 the consequent loss of printing for Australian printers, and subsequent related job losses the serious implications of job losses for areas such as Maryborough, Victoria the lack of consultation by the Howard Government before making this decision. Your undersigned petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to: Medicare censure the Government for its lack of consultation in planning bounty cuts call on the Government to reverse its decision to terminate book bounty. by Mr Ronaldson (from 224 citizens). Gun Laws To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens draws to the attention of the House the need for tighter gun laws. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to support moves by the Prime Minister to tighten gun laws through the following measures: the banning of fully automatic and semi-automatic weapons; the introduction of a nation-wide shooters licence system; and the introduction of a nation-wide gun registration system. by Mr Ruddock (from fiv- citizens). Shepparton Bypass To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the matter of the Shepparton Bypass Planning Study. The Western Alignment route passes through many homes, affecting the livelihoods of the residents, and the environment. The Western Alignment also passes through the main suburban area of Mooroopna which will affect Mooroopna's development. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: Place a ban on the proposed Western Alignment route of the Shepparton Bypass Planning Study and investigate the alternative routes. by Mrs Stone (from 1,664 citizens). Property To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: Your petitioners therefore ask the House to bring in legislation if necessary to confiscate all the property the churches have taken from the dying and return it to their children and grandchildren. If there are no descendants the properties revert back to the Commonwealth Government. by Mrs Sullivan (from 21 citizens). Discrimination To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows: That Australian citizens oppose social, legal and economic discrimination against people on the basis of their sexuality or trans gender identity and that such discrimination is unacceptable in a democratic society. Your peti tioners request that the House of Representatives should: pass the Australian Democrats legislation to make it unlawful to discriminate or vilify on the basis of sexuality or transgender identity so that such discrimination or vilification be open to redress at a national level. by Mr Tanner (from 345 citizens). Provider Numbers To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of NSW draws to the attention of the House that we the undersigned are totally opposed to the restriction of issuing of provider numbers to registered doctors unless they have entered a recognised training program, are vocationally registered or are a qualified specialist. We consider that such an action would cause serious suffering, including a severe disadvantage to women and rural communities and medical research. We believe that it is the essential right of all Australian registered doctors to have access to provider numbers that allow them to provide services which can attract Medicare rebates. We believe that such restrictions are an attack on the most defenceless and vulnerable strata of the medical profession and will not achieve the projected savings which it purports to do. We consider it to be a denial of natural justice, an attack on Medicare and un-Australian. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: Call upon the Federal Minister for Health the Hon. Michael Wooldridge MP, to enter into meaningful discussions with representatives of those groups most affected by the harsh and unconscionable decisions of his government. by Mr Andrew Thomson (from 68 citizens). Violence: Films, Videos, CD Roms To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The following citizens of Australia draw the attention of the House to the excessive violence in some films, videos, CD roms and records currently available. Your petitioners therefore request the House to take immediate action to implement measures to ban such excessive violence and to develop tough uniform censorship laws to restrict access to such mind damaging material. by Mr Truss (from 247 citizens). Petitions received. NA Bougainville: Death of Premier Theodore Miriung",47
125,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (I) deplores the assassination of Premier Theodore Miriung of the Province of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea; (2) recognises the courage and dignity with which he pursued solutions to the conflict on Bougainville; (3) expresses its deepest sympathy to the family of Premier Miriung, the people of Bougainville and of Papua New Guinea at his tragic death; and (4) urges the Government of Papua New Guinea and the members of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army to renew the reconciliation process in the aftermath of his death; to end all human rights abuses; to restore the rule of law and to accelerate the reconstruction process. I do not think there is any more intransigent problem for Australia than the problem of Bougainville. It is not one that hits the headlines, it is not one that many Australians may even be conscious of, but it is one which affects us deeply and on which I think all of us need to pause and ponder. I met Theodore Miriung several times. I was fortunate in that I attended the ceremony when he was appointed Premier of the Bougainville transitional government, the government that was nominally responsible for the province of Bougainville, and I met him subsequently in Australia. He was a quiet, shy but determined man. I think it is appropriate, in the terms of the first three items of this motion, that we now remember him and the contribution he made to his people. Theodore Miriung died at the age of 55. He came from Poma village in Nasios in the Kieta district in Bougainville. He was educated at the Tunuru Catholic Mission and Chabai from 1960 to 1965. He attended the St Peter Channel Ulapia seminary in 1966 to study for priesthood but, after three years, he left to join CRA Exploration. In 1969, he enrolled at the University of Papua New Guinea. He attained a law degree in 1973 and was admitted to the bar in 1974. The Miriungs moved to Arawa in March 1976 where he ran a private legal practice for four months. In the years following, he was provincial legal officer and then provincial secretary, before resigning to become Papua New Guinea's Chief Land Titles Commissioner. In December 1988, he was appointed acting National Court judge. Theodore Miriung was asked by the BRA leaders in 1991 to help plan the new government-the Bougainville Interim Government - but in February 1992 he left after a leaders dispute. He was later asked to assist in what they called the Supreme National Council under the BIG working committee, prior to his election as the Premier. He was assassinated in appalling and tragic circumstances on 12 October 1996. He was shot in the back before his family. Those responsible remain to be brought to justice. It appears that both members of the PNG Defence Force and some members of the BRA may have been responsible. Certainly, that was suggested in the coroner's report. Our task today, I suggest, is not to look at those who inflicted this appalling crime upon Theodore Miriung, but to look at the man and his heritage, and to look at where Australia goes from here. Theodore Miriung's body was laid to rest at his village on 18 October last year. Prior to his election, Theodore Miriung said: If you have a mission, you will have to accept even if it costs your life. The tragedy is that, regrettably, he was called to pay that price. After his election, the late Premier said: We want to create more incentives for people who have hidden behind gullies of fear. We have to nominate those barriers and allow for meaningful reconciliation among our people and between our structures and institutions. He said that the new government needed to develop policies on previously unaddressed issues in Papua New Guinea such as amnesty and pardon. He went on to pursue his plans after his election, generating admiration from many quarters for his professional and intelligent approach to many pressing issues, despite being threatened by the BRA and interrogated by the security forces on numerous occasions. The way in which he was given so little support on occasions where one would have thought it would have been forthcoming always seemed incredible to me. Indeed, I felt it rather sad that he was apparently refused even the right to attend the Bougainville Women's Strategy for Peace, Reconciliation, Unity and Normalcy held at Arawa, where he, with a number of women, was apparently turned back. I pay full credit to Sir Julius Chan, the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea who, in commenting on Theodore Miriung, said: Theodore Miriung was one of the greatest defenders of Bougainville we have seen and he has been slain for no other reason than that he placed the good of his province and its people above his personal safety. He was tireless in his search for permanent peace through negotiation and reconciliation. There was nowhere he was not prepared to go, and absolutely no-one he was not prepared to sit down and talk with. I think we would do well to remember those words of Julius Chan today. Theodore Miriung not only made an enormous contribution to the peace process but also showed something of the determination and the capability there is within Bougainville to achieving peace. I think we would all do well now, in the aftermath of his death, to look at itthe lessons of that death and to see where we go from here. I want to say in the brief time that is available to me a few things about where we go from here. There was certainly the hope after the visit of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Bougainville from 18 to 20 April 1994 that the peace process we proposed then might have been put in place. I know Sir Julius Chan attempted to do so, but a lack of trust and a lack of faith on both sides regrettably left doubts in the minds of people. When we were there, I remember in Buin an address by Nick Peniai, the Chairman of the South-West Interim Authority. He talked about the significance of Bougainville. In the 1980s, Bougainville was the principal contributor to the economy of PNG until the political impasse in 1989 to the Panguna Mine. The whole of the process within Bougainville was one that led that province to be the most economically developed within the whole of PNG. The hospital at Arawa was said to be one of the most advanced in the whole of the South Pacific, and the economic wealth that was there has all now been destroyed. Nick Peniai spoke of the extent to which Bougainville had been such a contributor to the economy and social development of PNG. He said: We stand here today as beggars, our economy in ruins, our per capita income well below the ten toea mark. We have been left to the whims of kindhearted politicians to dole out what little they proffer out of the coffers of Waigani. Unfortunately, Waigani has forgotten that Bougainville launched PNG to independence and was responsible for two-thIrds of its internal funding requirements in the early years of our country's independence. I have not time to quote or to go into other things, but there is much to say about the importance of finding a peace solution in Bougainville. There is little doubt that unless a peace solution can be found so much of what has been achieved in PNG is, I believe, at risk. Sadly, from about March last year there has been a significant deterioration in the peace situation. The operation conducted by the PNG Defence Force was an absolute disaster. There was no basis on which they could have hoped to have achieved a military solution. I think all of us from Australia looked aghast at the attempts that were made-High Speed 1 and High Speed 2-to achieve a military solution. They were doomed to failure. There is little doubt that there is a strong secessionist movement; there is little doubt there has to be a way by which a resolution of the long term future of the province of Bougainville can be sustained. Australia has two real interests, and one is to ensure that PNG, if it can, remains whole. I do not see the future as separating Bougainville from the rest of PNG. I am certain there has to be a way in which they can be given some form of political independence so that they are allowed to achieve their ambitions. Like so many other countries in the world, they are predicated by the boundaries that were set by colonial divisions. It is no use talking about our trying to go and revisit what might have been. What we need to do today is look at where we go from here. Bougainville is a matrilineal society. The role of women is terribly important. I briefly mentioned the Bougainville Women's Strategy for Peace, Reconciliation, Unity and Normalcy. They produced a series of objectives, all of which I think are most commendable, all designed to achieve some form of peace. The first and obviously essential prerequisite is that there be a cease-fire. In the delegation report which was tabled in this can place in April 1994 we looked at a series of peace proposals. I believe they need to be revisited. There needs to be, first, a laying down of arms. There certainly needs to be a preparedness to talk. Then there needs to be an acceptance by the government of the PNG-in spite of the forthcoming electionsthat the issue of Bougainville has to be given a priority. Third, the Australian government has to be prepared to be involved. Of course they are an independent country, but we need to be involved to guarantee the safety of representatives of both sides. The next thing is to try to find ways by which normalcy can be restored to the island. Fourthly, there has to be a means of reconstruction. Without that, peace is just not possible.

126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Nehl}-Is the motion seconded?  the motion: That this House: (I) deplores the assassination of Premier Theodore Miriung of the Province of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea; (2) recognises the courage and dignity with which he pursued solutions to the conflict on Bougainville; (3) expresses its deepest sympathy to the family of Premier Miriung, the people of Bougainville and of Papua New Guinea at his tragic death; and (4) urges the Government of Papua New Guinea and the members of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army to renew the reconciliation process in the aftermath of his death; to end all human rights abuses; to restore the rule law and to accelerate the reconstruction process. I commend the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for moving the motion. I note that he will shortly be bringing down a report on the seminar on Papua New Guinea that he has recently conducted. I do not want to go over the history that has already been enumerated of Premier Miriung, except to say that he was elected Premier in April 1995 and assassinated on 12 October 1996. His role as the Premier of the transitional government was a most difficult one because, in a sense, he was not fully supported by both the BRA and the Papua New Guinea government. That he has laid down his life for peace urges us all to ensure that peace is restored on Bougainville. This conflict, as has been stated, has being going on for some nine years. Indeed, there have been something like 13 accords, agreements or whatever to end the fighting and restore normalcy but none of them have succeeded. I believe the greatest legacy that Premier Miriung has left is the imperative for us all to find peace. Australia has always had a difficult relationship with Papua New Guinea because we were the former colonial power, and we are seen by some as being too close to the Papua New Guinea government. Be that as it may, I strongly support the injunction of the right honourable member that Australia does have a responsibility to have a fresh initiative in regard to the situation in Bougainville. I note that Gerard Sinato has been elected as Premier of the Bougainville Transitional Government. Firstly, I would suggest that it would be in order for us to issue an invitation for him to visit Australia so that we can assess what his plans and agenda are and make sure that we are in a position to fully respond in any way that may be appropriate for us. In the past, Australia and New Zealand have been two countries prepared to try to assist in Bougainville. Perhaps it is an opportunity for both countries to participate in an initiative. But, failing Australia, and failing of Australia and New Zealand, there is still the Commonwealth. Papua New Guinea is a Commonwealth country, and perhaps it would be more meaningful or more acceptable if there were to be a Commonwealth initiative. When Premier Miriung visited Australia, we were talking with him about the security situation in Bougainville and the fact that, while there had been some $20 million of Australian reconstruction money, aid money, voted for Bougainville, very little had been spent because of the security situation. That situation has not improved. Aid money is not being spent at a faster rate, nor indeed is the amount of money available for call-up being spent. Clearly, if we are to get a solution in Bougainville, we need to make sure that there is reconstruction money. As the right honourable member has said, Bougainville was not only the richest province in Papua New Guinea but also the best educated province. Regrettably, it is now losing generations of young people who have not been exposed to education. The infrastructure has gon.: and, as one Bougainvillean has said, 'The cost of this conflict to the people of Bougainville has been to put us back 50 years with still no end in sight.' I certainly hope that our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will perhaps spend more time than hitherto has been spent on the issue of Bougainville to ensure that Australia is well placed to assist with a peaceful solution. I note that the Papua New Guinea government invited a retired judge from Sri Lanka to conduct a coronial inquiry. Whilst the government of the day at the time of the assassination suggested that its defence forces were not involved, it was the view of the retired judge that in fact they had been involved. One of his recommendations, which was that the unit suspected of being involved be removed from Bougainville, in fact has now occurred. I thank the right honourable member for New England for bringing this motion before the House. Ironically, I was very disappointed last year that it not been brought on a little earlier, but I do hope that the timing of this motion and of its discussion in the House will bring forward a peaceful solution for Bougainville, even though national elections are due to be held in Papua New Guinea this year. I think it would be a tragedy if we waited until after the national elections before an initiative was taken. Essentially, the responsibility for peace rests with the BRA and the Papua New Guinea government. I hope Australia will be able to find a path that brings them together.",62
127,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I too rise to support the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I would like to make an initial comment on an observation that was made by Theodore Miriung not long before he was elected to the Bougainville Transitional Government on 10 April 1995. At that stage he was quoted as saying, 'If you have a mission, you have to accept it-even if it costs you your life.' Theodore Miriung, the champion of Bougainville peace efforts, certainly lived up to his words.  said that many on both sides of this conflict had concerns and were certainly in conflict with Theodore Miriung's initiatives and beliefs on ways in which he felt that he could achieve a peaceful solution in Bougainville, but his efforts certainly won the hearts of many people. His death has no doubt left a very deep vacuum that will be very difficult to fill. It has certainly dealt a very devastating blow to the government's peace efforts. Theodore Miriung came from Poma village in the Kieta district. He was reared with a Catholic education and studied for the priesthood for some three years. In 1989 he enrolled in the University of Papua New Guinea where he attained a law degree and was admitted to the bar in 1974. In 1988 he was appointed as acting National Court judge. Premier Theodore Miriung was assassinated on 12 October 1995. He was brutally murdered in what could only be described as a cowardly attack in front of his wife and four children as they sat down to their evening meal in his wife's village of Konga. There is strong evidence to suggest that members of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and Bougainville resistance were actively involved in his murder. I think that it is very important that the inquiry be finalised so that the perpetrators of this crime can be brought to justice. After Miriung's death, Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan made a very interesting and worthy comment: Theodore Miriung was one of the greatest defenders of Bougainville we have seen and he has been slain for no other reason than that he placed the good of his province and its peoples before his personal safety. This House would like - o express its deepest sympathy to Premier Miriung's wife and four children and to the people of Bougainville and Papua New Guinea on his tragic death. I last visited Bougainville in 1988. As the previous speaker said, the Panguna Mine certainly brought a tremendous amount of prosperity to the area. Arawa was a lovely town, and the education and health standards of the people there were very high compared to the rest of Papua New Guinea. Now we see a conflict in its eighth year and, at this point in time, it is estimated that over 1,000 people have been murdered or killed in this conflict-and that is not counting many thousands who have died through disease associated with the tropical climate and the total absence of health facilities. These numbers are quite appalling when you appreciate that the total population of Bougainville is only about 160,000. So we are talking about a very significant amount of the population being affected. Bougainville actually once produced 44 per cent of the national income and, given the financial problems that have dogged Papua New Guinea since its independence, it can ill afford and no longer continue to sustain sl1ch massive losses of both human and monetary resources. I urge the Papua New Guinea government and members of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army not to let Premier Theodore Miriung's death be in vain and to renew the reconciliation process in the aftermath of the Premier's death. (Time expired)",64
128,Mr BRERETON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am pleased to speak to this motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). The eightyear war on Bougainville has long been a matter of grave concern for members of both sides of this House. In 1991 the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade reported to the House at length on what it described as the 'intractable conflict' on the island. At that time the blockade of Bougainville by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, the complete destruction of civil infrastructure on island and a cycle of revenge killings had brought about a humanitarian crisis of the order. In response, the committee recommended that the blockade be lifted, that humanitarian aid be delivered to the island, that guidelines for the supply of military equipment to PNG be clarified and strengthened, and that the Australian government encourage the government of PNG to investigate human rights abuses. In 1994, the parliamentary delegation led by the then chairman of the joint committee, Senator Loosely-and including the member for New England-visited Bougainville. That delegation rightly concluded in its report that there could be no military solution to the conflict, and equally that secession through force of arms was not an option, and made a series of recommendations in support of reconciliation and reconstruction. Through 1994 and 1995 we saw the development of a considerable momentum toward peace and reconciliation. A cease-fire agreement was concluded in September 1994 and the Bougainville Transitional Government was established in April 1995. Theodore Miriung played a key role in this process on the ground in Bougainville as the head of the BTG and at the peace talks held in Cairns at the end of 1995. He was a courageous and influential figure. Having spent six years within the BRA controlled areas on the island, he was ideally placed to bring the two sides of the conflict together. He spoke eloquently for the people of Bougainville-expressing both their war weariness and their desire for peace and reconstruction. Last year, however, as honourable members are aware, we saw a return not to the rule of law but to the rule of the gun. The cease-fire on Bougainville broke down in March and the PNG Defence Force went on the offensive in July with Operation High Speed. Violence on both sides escalated. The BRA took hostages and the PNG defence forces carried out indiscriminate shooting and mortar attacks against civilians. Anyone who doubts the the horrific human cost of the conflict should view the photographs of victims of the PNG first Defence Force mortar attack on a village chapel in South Bougainville in November of last year. In the course of this deplorable spiral of violence, of course, Premier Miriung was gunned down in his wife's village on 12 October-an action which unquestionably dealt a very severe blow to efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict. I do not propose today to allocate blame for these events. The correct approach, I think, is that contained in today's motion by the honourable member for New England, which urges both the government of PNG and members of the BRA to renew the reconciliation process, to end all human rights abuses, to restore the rule of law and to accelerate the reconstruction process. At the same time, however, we cannot ignore Australia's continuing responsibility to do all that we can to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In May last year, Foreign Minister Downer visited Port Moresby and reaffirmed Australia's view that a solution to the military situation in Bougainville was not possible and that peace could be brought about only through a process of negotiation. The response of the PNG government was to embark on Operation High Speed, and it would be fair to say that as a consequence the bilateral relationship was characterised by some tension and strain. This was not necessarily, I think, too bad a thing. Our relationship with PNG, if stormy at times, has a unique breadth and depth. It is certainly strong enough to carry the weight of such differences on the issue of Bougainville. It is certainly strong enough to stand an unapologetic stance by Australia concerning fundamental human rights. I do not wish to make a partisan point today. Bougainville is unquestionably one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult foreign policy problem, faced by Australia. It was certainly the experience of Labor when we were in government, and I suspect it is already the conclusion of the present government. I agree absolutely with the words this afternoon of the member for New England. That said, I do regret, I must say, that the coalition government was not more robust in backing up its diplomatic representations to Port Moresby last year-particularly in view of the very clear abuses of human rights carried out by PNG Defence FOIl.:e troops. (Time expired)",65
129,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"by leave-In the few minutes that are remaining in the debate I wanted to add to the series of peace proposals that I was attempting to enunciate before I closed. I think it is important that people understand that part of the tragedy of Bougainville is that it is not just a struggle of secessionists against national security forces, but it is a civil war among Bougainvilleans themselves, as Emeritus Professor James Griffin said in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday, 25 June 1996. The additional things I wanted to say include, firstly, that women must be involved in the peace process. I think people need to understand that Bougainville is a matrilineal society, as I suggested. On the occasion of the 1994 delegation visit we were immensely impressed by the quality and depth of talent, and sincerity and genuineness, of the women that we met. Some of them were extraordinarily articulate. I mentioned briefly the Women's Conference and Strategy for Peace, Reconciliation, Unity and Normalcy on Bougainville, which the then Premier, Theodore Miriung, had difficulty in attending. But there is a role for women there and I think that is important. The next point-and I briefly want to refer to this-is I think all of us have been concerned about the brutalities of an ill-trained, ill-provisioned and unpredictable PNGDF. There are enormous difficulties in trying to overcome the difficulties of law and order in Bougainville and they are not going to be easily resolved. Australia, I think, as a government, has a responsibility to help improve the quality and nature of the PNGDF. It is a much wider problem, but it is one that needs to be addressed. We need to identify ways by which we can help the PNGDF to be a genuine defence force against external threats and not, as it is now, and unfortunately has been for so long, a force essentially fighting on rotation in Bougainville. We need to understand the trauma of the members of the PNGDF. Some of them have been there successively for 12 months. When our soldiers were in Vietnam for six months they developed, quite understandably, enormous tensions. Numbers of the PNG Defence Force have been there successively for 12 months-and they are fighting their brothers. In spite of the Wantok system, there are enormous problems in trying to overcome the problem of the integrity and the discipline of the PNGDF. So we have got to look at ways by which we can help the PNGDF. We need also to get civilian police. I think that is absolutely essential.",66
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Nehl)Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Fiji's Constitutional Review Commission,66
131,Mr SERCOMBE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (I) warmly welcomes the report of Fiji's Constitutional Review Commission; (2) congratulates the members of the Constitutional Review Commission for producing a report containing fair and democratic constitutional proposals to meet the present and future needs of Fiji, promote racial harmony, national unity and the economic and social advancement of all of Fiji's communities; (3) considers the report to be an historic step forward in efforts to establish a constitutional framework acceptable to all of Fiji's citizens; and (4) encourages the people of Fiji to give careful consideration to the recommendations of the Commission as a basis for a prosperous, stable and progressive nation, able to satisfy the individual and collective aspirations of all of Fiji's communities. On 14 May 1987, at about 10 a.m., elements of Fiji's Defence Force stormed the Fiji parliament, arrested the then Prime Minister and other key members of the government, and proceeded to establish a military regime. That was the first of two coups in Fiji. The effect of that type of instability on the development towards prosperity of Fiji, I think, became fairly evident. One of two fairly simple indicators of that would be the very rapid decline in tourist numbers. Fiji's single largest industry is its tourist industry. I understand it makes up something like 20 per cent of GDP and the number of tourists there in the previous year had been some 258,000. Largely as a direct consequence of the events I have described and those surrounding it, that number fell very dramatically to 190,000. Fortunately, those figures have now more than recovered. Secondly, up until January 1989, on the figures that I have, something like two-thirds of Fiji's lawyers left the country, something like half the medical practitioners left the country and something like a quarter the civil servants left the country. Clearly, to create the context for a prosperous, growing, racially tolerant society, those sorts of statistics are fairly horrific. Things have moved on very considerably, though, and less than 10 years later Prime Minister Rabuka-incidentally, the same gentleman who, as a lieutenant-colonel, had no small part in the earlier events I described-tabled in the Fiji parliament what I regard as an outstanding report of the Fiji Constitutional Review Commission. That report is the subject matter of today's motion. It is a very weighty tome, which is obvious, of some 800 pages, and in the very limited time available, obviously, not a great deal of it can be discussed. But some of the key features I would like to refer to are the recommendations that the primary goal of Fiji's constitutional arrangements should be to encourage the emergence of multi-ethnic government; power sharing should be achieved through the voluntary cooperation of political parties; and the people of Fiji should move gradually, but decisively, away from the communal system of representation and they should adopt electoral arrangements which encourage parties to seek the support of other communities as well as their own. Those proposals for changes in the political character of the Fiji community need to be accompanied, and are accompanied in the report of the review commission, by a range of proposals which, in the context of a democratic, power sharing system, nonetheless, protect the paramount rights of the indigenous Fijian people. The recommendations of the report go to the role of the Great Council of Chiefs, which the report proposes incorporating formally in the constitution. Incorporating the role of the Great Council of Chiefs in the constitution, giving the Great Council of Chiefs, in effect, veto powers over a range of matters that are of interest to indigenous Fijians, it could be argued-as I notice in the Fijian media a number of indigenous Fijian spokesmen in fact do-enhances the power, the influence and the paramount rights of indigenous Fijians perhaps more than has been the case in the past. The proposals of the report go to the question of the structure of the parliament: maintenance of a bicameral parliament with a lower house with some 70 members, approximately two-thirds of the seats no longer being reserved for particular communities but becoming open seats, very much consistent with the sorts of general principles that I referred to earlier. The upper house would have 35 members, the great majority of whom would be elected to represent provinces, but others to be appointed by the president, and the president would be selected under this proposal from a slate of nominations presented by the Great Council of Chiefs. In addition to those elected, six members of the upper house would be appointed by the president to represent communities and groups which would otherwise be underrepresented or not represented in the parliament. The protection and development of indigenous Fijian paramount rights remain critical in this report in the context of developing a parallel path where there is a movement away from a communal basis of politics. Essentially, the report proposes that a number of acts of parliament-including, for example, the native lands act and the fisheries act which deals with customary Fijian fishing rights-ought to be entrenched in the constitution and only be capable of modification in the context of a role for traditional leadership within the Fijian community. In addition, there are a range of other proposals that go to the structure of government and a bill of rights, but time prevents too much rliscussion of those matters. This report has been welcomed by the Australian government as a possible way forward for the Fijian people to consider. It contains the fundamental recognition of democratic principles and democratic institutions. That is why I think it is appropriate this to be discussed in this parliament-a parliament of friends of Fiji-and for us to indicate that the view of our members, I hope a bipartisan view, is that these principles are important in order to carry Fiji forward. As those of us who have had the pleasure of visiting Fiji would know, Fiji is certainly an exceptionally beautiful place. As I indicated before, it comes as no surprise to those who know the country that tourism represents something of the order of 20 per cent of its GDP. The continued development of the prosperity of that industry and its related industries clearly depends upon ongoing and continuing stable institutions. Another very significant industry in Fiji is the sugar industry. According to the figures I have, that industry represents something of the order of 13Y2 per cent of GDP. There are a range of important issues affecting that industry. It requires a stable, ongoing climate for investment in order to obtain certainty for the future. There are important issues in relation to land tenancy that are increasingly going to be on the agenda as leases begin to expire over the next few years. Fiji, which is already one of the most wealthy countries in the Pacific region, requires an atmosphere of stability to enable it to continue to build on its very considerable assets-both human and commodity assets. Obviously, the proposals of the Constitution Review Commission are the subject of considerable debate in Fiji. It is a matter for the Fijian people to arrive at their own conclusions. The strength of the debate on this was reflected in an article headed 'Rabuka faces Cabinet split' in the Fiji Times on 1 February. In the context of this sort of debate and in terms of the democratic principles that I know are close to the hearts of all members of this House, I think it is particularly important that we send a clear view about the process going forward. The widely respected President of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, is quoted in an article in the Fiji Times as saying when addressing a meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs last August: It maybe that we have to mend the fences within our own races before we tackle the larger question of interracial lack of trust, but at the end of the for day, it will be on a multiracial basisI emphasise those wordsthat a national solution will have to be found. In the letter transmitting the report to Sir Kamisese Mara the commissioners made the following observations-and these are words which Australians would be well advised to take account of too given some of the debates that have occurred in our country: Progress in a multi-ethnic society is achieved when its citizens realise that what is good for their neighbour must ultimately be good for them as well, when difference and diversity are seen not as sources of division and distrust but of strength and inspiration. Fiji has powerful reasons for being confident about its future. It needs a stable constitutional environment. (Time expired) Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Is the motion seconded? Mr Jenkins-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",67
132,Mr EOIN CAMERON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am delighted to be able to speak to the motion moved by the honourable member of Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe). At the outset, I would like to thank the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) and his staff for their help in the preparation of some of the comments that I have to make this afternoon. The purpose of this bipartisan motion is to take note of the report of the Constitutional Review Commission. In doing so, I believe it is appropriate for this parliament to congratulate the Fijian parliament on the speedy progress made so far in its consideration of the report. Clearly, there is a broad-ranging debate in progress in Fiji on the many elements of the recommendations contained in the report and the result of the debate is, of course, a matter for the people of Fiji. It is our hope, as close friends of Fiji, that it will produce a very positive outcome for that country. Our desire in passing this motion is to encourage and assist Fiji to bring this process to the kind of conclusion which addresses the individual and collective aspirations of all communities in Fiji. In making these points, I would strongly emphasise that the motion is in no way intended as an attempt by the Australian parliament to interfere with the sovereign right of Fiji to determine its own affairs, and it should not be regarded as such. Rather, it should be seen as a reflection in the cooperative relationship that exists between Australia and Fiji-a relationship with a long history which extends across a broad range of activities and interests. In July 1994 the Fiji government and the opposition agreed on the establishment of a joint parliamentary select committee-JPSCin preparation for the setting up of a threemember Constitutional Review Commission. The review is to be completed by the middle of this year, as has already been mentioned. In March 1995 Sir Paul Reeves, a former New Zealand Governor General, was formally named as the chair of the review commission, with former Fiji cabinet minister Tomasi Vakatora as the Fiji government nominee. The report of the CRC was tabled in the Fiji parliament on 10 September last year. It was pleasing to note that the Fiji President, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition all used the occasion to urge a thorough and sympathetic examination of its recommendations. The indications are that this is indeed happening, with all the elements of the Fiji population having the opportunity to put their views to assist the Fiji government in seeking a positive outcome. We believe the report of the Constitutional Review Commission presents Fiji's citizens and government with an historic opportunity to work together to establish a political and social framework broadly acceptable to them all. But in saying this, we recognise that very sensitive issues are involved. We commend the government of Fiji in its efforts so far to find a satisfactory outcome to the review through consultation in the community to build the consensus necessary for a successful conclusion. That is why the Australian parliament has chosen to discuss this motion. We want to express our support to the Fiji government as it continues on this path. The basis for this motion goes back to 1987, as the member for Maribyrnong has mentioned, when the now Prime Minister Rabuka overthrew the then government and in 1990 promulgated a new constitution for Fiji. While this motion certainly does not seek to interfere in the internal affairs of Fiji, Australia nevertheless is interested in the report of the Fiji Constitutional Review Commission, for we have long held a close relationship with Fiji in a number of activities, and welcome any action which commits Fiji to a path towards national unity and the positive aspects which, of course, result from that. It has also been referred to by the member for Maribymong, who has been fortunate enough to visit the beautiful country of Fiji. In the days when I had a life, before I entered parliament, I was fortunate enough to visit Fiji on two separate occasions and was stunned by the absolute beauty of that country. If any country deserves the best, it is certainly Fiji. We all know the history lessons and can understand the problems that have gone on there, but we equally understand and welcome the moves that are being made towards healing the deep divisions in that society. Australia's involvement in the constitutional review process of Fiji is not new; Australia provided $100,000 from the bilateral aid program to assist the work of the commission. It goes without saying that we are interested in the presentation of fair and democratic constitutional proposals in the interests of and its people, and that the commission presented a unanimous report is one positive step forward in what will obviously be a long road to reform for this politically troubled nation. As I mentioned, Fiji's present constitution was imposed by decree in 1990 following the two military coups of 1987, which were referred to by the member for Maribymong. The constitution was racially weighted against Fiji's Indian community. It has been commonly accepted, both within Fiji as weB as internationally, that it was deeply flawed. While the Indian community represents around 46 per cent of the Fijian population, the present constitution deliberately discriminates against this section of the community. The membership of the Constitutional Review Commission was decided by the Fiji cabinet, which accepted the recommendations of a select committee of the Fiji parliament. I have mentioned the people that have made up that particular committee. The opposition nominee was Dr Brij Lal, a naturalised Australian citizen of Fiji-Indian descent who is a member of the academic staff at the Australian National University. The cabinet decision to accept a commission made up of an indigenous Fijian, an Indo-Fijian and chaired by a distinguished Maori is indication of a true commitment to and a positive step toward significant constitutional reform and racial conciliation. This motion we are debating welcomes the report of the Fijian Constitutional Review Commission. The goal was to produce a report which contained fair and democratic constitutional proposals aimed at meeting the needs of Fiji today and in the future and promoting racial harmony, national unity and the economic and social advancement of all of Fiji's communities-not an insurmountable task but certainly an enormous one which the government appears willing to undertake. There is no doubt the commission did not underestimate the assignment ahead of them. Dr Lal said at the time of the commission's announcement that, while he believed there was a growing acceptance among all sectors of Fijian society that reform was essential, the Fiji pathway to it would be difficult. He claimed, 'The road back to a true representative democracy is fraught with many problems.' However, in acknowledging the problem that 'the current constitution has failed not just because of its racial weighting, but it has unleashed all kinds of provincial and regional tensions within Fijian society so that the kind of unity and solidarity expected has not eventuated', he highlighted clearly the need for reform and the direction that reform must take. This is accepted widely in Fiji; however, the progress to a new constitution is by no means an easy road. The report of the commission is an historic step forward in its goal of establishing a constitutional framework acceptable to all of Fiji's citizens. Notwithstanding the unanimity of the report, many hurdles must be tackled, in that putting into the constitution the 697 recommendations of the report will require support from all sectors of the Fijian community which, in relation to certain sections of the report, is not presently there. Already sections of the community, including the Fijian Nationalist Party and the Fijian Taukei Movement, which grew out of the coups, have branded the report useless and have indicated that they will oppose any changes which arise from it. I note that a 25member joint party select committee on the constitutional review has reached unanimous agreement on 373 recommendations, so one can be positive about the direction the Fiji constitution is taking. The argument of some that they will not accept change is tempered, however, in that the founder of the Taukei Movement, Mr Apisai Tora, has proclaimed the movement defunct and said that now is not the time for the movement's philosophy. It would be hoped, for the sake of Fiji, that this attitude can permeate across the broad spectrum of Fiji for their own benefit. The final part of the motion encourages the people of Fiji to give careful consideration to the recommendations of the report as the basis for a prosperous, stable and progressive nation. It is, of course, important for all of Fiji's communities to build a future together to realise their individual and collective aspirations. In this regard the people of Fiji should be urged to look to positive and fair changes to their constitution to end the uncertainty that has obstructed Fiji's progress since the coups of 1987. I therefore call on the parliament to pass this motion as a message of support to the Fiji government as it continues its efforts to encourage a constructive dialogue to build a consensus which leads to a new constitution which is broadly acceptable to all members of the population of Fiji. In making this call I emphasise again that its purpose is not intended in any way to interfere with the sovereign rights of Fiji to determine these matters. Rather, as a sister parliament, we want to offer our support to the Fiji parliament as it seeks to bring about a positive outcome to its consideration of the CRC report. Again, I commend the member for Maribyrnong for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.",69
133,Mr JENKINS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"May of this year marks the 10th anniversary of the military coup in Fiji which ousted the National Federation Party-Labour Party coalition government of the late Dr Timoci Bavadra. It is therefore not before time that a motion in such positive terms comes before this House. The report of the Constitution Review Commission tabled in the Fijian parliament in September last year is a welcome step towards a multiracial constitution, a return to multi-ethnic democracy and the promotion of national unity. It is pleasing that even the man who led the military coups in 1987 and played a significant role in the creation and adoption of the 1990 constitution, Sitiveni Rabuka, has welcomed the review and has described the previous constitution as outdated. At the joint sitting of the House of Representatives and Senate of the Fijian parliament at which the review was tabled, in noting that it was a unanimous report, the Fijian President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, said: This means that they have achieved consensus and this gives us an example and optimism that the nation can reach consensus. If these two men, who have been so intimately involved in the events of 1987 and in the events of Fiji to the present are able to welcome the recommendations of the review, then it augurs well for the process of national reconciliation and harmony that Fiji requires. Regrettably, there is a small band of extreme nationalists who wish to see the 1990 racist constitution maintained as is. One would hope that the mainstream elements of the indigenous Fijian community do not allow these extremist tendencies to subvert the process of constitutional reform and national reconciliation. The whole report of the Constitution Review Commission runs to some 800 pages. The major recommendations of the constitutional review focus on eliminating the racially biased elements of the 1990 constitution. The recommendations include the proposal to reduce the number of ethnic specific communal seats in the new parliament to 25 of the proposed total of 76. This would include 12 for the indigenous Fijian population; 10 for ethnic Indians; two for general electors, mainly of European extraction; and one for the Polynesian minority of Rotumans. The remaining 45 seats would be non-ethnic specific open seats, made up of 15 electorates with three members each. Some might suggest that the optimal position would be one where no seats are ethnic specific. However, the recommendation to reduce the number is an improvement on the 1990 constitution and also recognises the cultural context of Fiji. The current 1990 constitution prevents IndoFijians from contesting certain ethnic Fijian domination of the House of Representati ves. Furthermore, the review suggests that the provision which specifies that the Prime Minister can only be an indigenous Fijian should be removed from the constitution. Currently, the president of the republic is appointed by the indigenous Great Council of Chiefs. The constitutional review recommends the end of this arrangement. How the president should be elected or whether Fiji rejoins the Commonwealth and seeks a return to a constitutional monarchy are ultimately questions for the Fijian people to decide. However, it is certainly unacceptable for a body which represents only a certain part of the indigenous Fijian community to be given the power to appoint the head of state. The philosophy behind the review is to encourage the formation of multiethnic governments and to move away from the concept of communal indigenous representation which entrenches the power of the ethnic Fijian chiefs. The constitutional commission consisted of a former New Zealand Governor General, Sir Paul Reeves; an indigenous Fijian and former parliamentary speaker, Tomasi Vabtora; and Brij Lal, a Fijian-born ethnic Indian academic now resident at the Australian National University. When the 1990 constitution was promulgated it was subject to a great deal of criticism, from both within and outside Fiji by groups as diverse as the Fijian Labour Party and the International Commission of Jurists, for its racially based nature. However, there was a train of thought that the 1990 constitution should in some way be welcomed as a return to representative constitutional government and as a step in the right direction after the events of 1987. As I said in this place in 1990, this argument had to be rejected. I hope that the report of the constitutional review will now be considered carefully by all groups in Fiji and that they recognise, as in the words of the report: Progress in a multi-ethnic society is achieved when its citizens realise that what is good for their neighbour must ultimately be good for them as well, when difference and diversity are seen not as sources of division and distrust, but of strength and seats, ensuring inspiration. I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) that those words have universal application. (Time expired)",71
134,Mr BOB BALDWIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Let me say from the outset that we, the government, support and endorse this private member's bill before the House today. Indeed, the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) is to be congratulated for presenting this private member's bill. In showing bipartisan support for this bill I need to reiterate the words of those who have spoken before me today, that is, that we in no way seek to interfere with Fiji's internal affairs but we seek to encourage the development of the reform to suit the needs of all the constituents of Fiji. I offer my congratulations on the high quality, detailed work of the Constitution Review Commission chaired by Sir Paul Reeves, a former New Zealand Governor General. He has been assisted on this threeperson committee of review by the former Fiji cabinet minister, Tomasi Vakatora as the Fiji government nominee, and Australian based academic, Dr Brij Lal, an Australian citizen, as the Fiji opposition representative. The Constitution Review Commission's mission statement, endorsed by the joint public standing committee, obliged it to recommend constitutional arrangements which will meet the present and future needs of the people of Fiji and promote racial harmony, national unity and the economic and social advancement of all communities. In the tabling of this 800-page report in the Fiji parliament on 10 September 1996, the government has fulfilled a commitment under the 1990 constitution to perform a detailed review of the constitution by 1997. Most importantly, this constitutional review has been done in consultation with representatives of the Fijian and Fiji Indian communities and has culminated in a unanimous report from all members of the Constitution Review Commission. In the Fiji Times on 1 February 1997, it was reported that the 25 member Joint Party Select Committee on the Constitutional Review had reached unanimous agreement on 373 of the 697 recommendations. The committee will meet again in March and April to finalise the report for tabling in the Fijian House of Representatives during the May meeting. As I have said before, they are to be congratulated and encouraged as they strive to achieve a true democratic system that suits all the citizens of Fiji. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that it does all it can to ensure the process is as smooth as it can be. The former government granted $lOO,OOO from the bilateral aid program to partially fund the review. In addition, during a visit on 20 December 1996, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer, granted further assistance by offering to commit, for a period of eight to nine months from January 1997, an expert in drafting legislation. To fully understand the current situation Fiji, one needs to look to the past. I can, as I am sure many Australians can, understand the fears and anguish of the Fijian people in their plight which led to the bloodless coup at 10 o'clock on 14 May 1987 when the then Prime Minister, Timoci Bavadra, was arrested along with all of his colleagues and Lieutenant Colonel Rabuka declared himself head of state and appointed a cabinet composed of members of the defeated Alliance Party. This then led to the second coup on 25 September, when Colonel Rabuka dismissed the Governor General, abrogating the 1970 constitution and putting into place a military government, headed by himself. On 7 October, Colonel Rabuka declared Fiji a republic and terminated all links with the Crown. Indigenous Fijians had begun to feel that their homeland was rapidly being overtaken. But one cannot place the blame on the Indian or Fiji Indian people in Fiji, whose forebears first arrived in 1879. Their numbers expanded from the initial 500 indentured workers to over 60,000 by 1916 when the indenture system ceased. Today, the population mix is approximately 49 per cent Fijian, 46 per cent Indian and five per cent mixed. Most of the Indians and Fiji Indians in Fiji at present have a birth right to Fiji and think of themselves as an integral part of the Fijian lifestyle and culture. In conclusion, I call on my colleagues to support this motion. (Time expired)",72
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Companies: Insolvencies,73
136,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Wills) (4.25 p.m.}-I raised in the parliament in September of last year the problem of phoenix companies and the fact that we have too many dishonourable directors in Australia sheltering behind companies which experience sudden in collapse: these are companies which one day are performing successfully and the next day have a sign saying 'closed' hanging outside the front gate. The most significant impact of these insolvencies is on the employees. With no notice, they find their livelihoods destroyed. Typically, they are owed for wages and associated entitlements wch as recreation leave, long service leave and superannuation. In the worse of these cases, rogue directors not only wind up the companies to avoid creditors, including workers, but then set up a supposedly new enterprise the very next day. These are referred to colloquially as phoenix companies. The Australian Securities Commission-as I reported to the House last year-conducted a survey in May into phoenix companies, which found that they are a $1.3 billion drain on the national economy each year and that they, and not unfair dismissals, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would have us believe, now rate as the biggest problem for small and medium sized businesses. That study found that at least 9,000 businesses are affected by phoenix company activities each year. This problem goes on. I want to tell the House about the acti vities of Mr Alan Jorgensen. In October 1989, the ANZ Bank financed Mr Alan Jorgensen or related companies in the purchase of a group of companies headed by a company named Townsend and Parker Pty Ltd. In January 1992, some 28 months later, the ANZ Bank put in receivers and had a shortfall of about $12 million. Their loss was increased substantially, in part because a lot of heavy equipment had been installed in rental premises at Bracside. The factory rental on these premises was in arrears and the premises were, in fact, rented to another party. The ANZ Bank had to accept auction prices for the plant. This group immediately re-emerged as Consolidated Diecaster Pty Ltd at Braeside and as Townsend and Parker Gravity Caster Pty Ltd at Coburg, in my electorate, financed by the National Australia Bank. This group went into receivership and administration in October 1995, some 46 months later. The key player behind the companies turned out once again to be Mr Jorgensen. The National Australia Bank also took a financial hiding, and the premises at Braeside were in arrears of rental. They had been let to another party. The National Australia Bank, like ANZ, were forced to sell the plant at auction value. But the group immediately re-emerged as Townsend and Parker Pty Ltd, operating at Braeside and Townsend and Parker Vic Pty Ltd, operating in Coburg. The Coburg premises were owned by Townsend and Parker Holdings Pty Ltd, with all companies recently under the same directorships. Townsend and Parker Vic Pty Ltd has since changed its name to Machland Pty Ltd. In October 1996 they appointed an administrator. That stalled KPMG-which had secured a judgment against Townsend and Parker Pty Ltd-and other creditors who had debts totalling some $1 million plus. A recent meeting of creditors of Machland, the successor of Townsend and Parker Vic Pty Ltd, held very recently-on, I think, Wednesday 29 January-voted for the appointment of a liquidator. This was strenuously opposed by Mr Jorgensen. That creditors meeting was told by the liquidator, under questioning by Mr Bill Shorten from the Australian Workers Union representing the employees at Townsend and Parker, that the directors could supply practically no information about the company and that the information they could supply came from Mr Jorgensen. That report to creditors indicated that fees totalling in excess of $200,000 had been paid to a related company during the past seven months and that the directors of that company are the parents of Mr Jorgensen. It has been estimated to me that Mr Jorgensen's various scams and sham transactions involving these phoenix companies have cost banks $15 million, taxpayers over $3 million, employees $400,000 and other creditors $3Y2 million. So we have group tax not paid in the order of $2Y2 million; income tax not paid in the order of $700,000; banks owed $15 million; other creditors owed $3Y2 million; and a superannuation fund of one of these companies was flooded causing the entitlements of long-term, hard working employees to be reduced from $900,000 to $500,000. The administrator's report provides damning and highly critical findings of the conduct of these companies in at least three areas: preferential payments to creditors, related party transactions and insolvent trading. Firstly, concerning preferential payment to creditors, as the administrator points out, section 588 of the Corporations Law provides that a liquidator can set aside certain transactions: · .. if they have conferred a preference on a creditor or caused the Company financial detriment. He says: I have variously requested from the present and previous directors and accountants for TPV records of the Company concerning payments made to creditors. These records appear to exist, however they have not been provided to me. But he is able to go on and point out that: · .. various trade creditors received payments from a bank account maintained by TPV after its removal as trustee. He notes that: · .. throughout 1996 KPMG sought and finally obtained judgement against TPV ... It is reasonable to assume that the directors were aware of this claim. He goes on to say that he requires further information to express a view as to whether these preferential payments can be recovered or not. Secondly, the related party transactions: Townsend and Parker Vic paid $270,000 to Freeway Management Pty Ltd. The present directors of Freeway are the parents of Mr Alan Jorgensen and Mr Jorgensen himself was a director of Freeway until 3 October and is presently the secretary of Freeway. Mr Jorgensen has told the administrator that Freeway is 'insolvent and likely to be wound up'. So the liquidator says: It is my contention that sufficient grounds exist to consider the transactions between TPV and Freeway and TPV and T &P as voidable and uncommercial. He goes on to say that: . . . reasonable grounds exist to consider actions against the directors of TPV for failing to exercise their statutory duties as directors under section 232. Finally, we have the issue of insolvent trading. Once again, pursuant to section 588G of the Corporations Law: the directors of a company permitting a company to incur debts which cause it to become insolvent may be guilty of an offence. The administrator points out that this company was actively trading from January 1996 until 30 September last year. It claimed that at 30 June it had a profit of $277 ,000, and yet its position deteriorated rapidly from July to the start of January where it has a reported deficiency of $375,000. Once again, the administrator is pointing to the need for further investigation of this insolvent trading. I wrote to the Australian Securities Commission about this issue around this time last year. They said that they were monitoring the Townsend and Parker issue, but it is still going on-shonky company restructures to avoid creditors, whether it be banks, taxpayers, employees or other creditors. I call on the Australian Securities Commission to get fair dinkum about this issue, to get fully involved in the activities of Mr Jorgensen and his companies and to conduct a full investigation. It is time to put a stop to these practises. As I also indicated last year when I raised the issue of phoenix companies in the House, if the law has not, to this point in time, discouraged people like Mr Jorgensen from acting in such a scandalous and disgraceful fashion, it is time the law was changed. We should look not only at increasing the disqualification period of directors from five to 10 years, as has been suggested, but we should also look, under certain circumstances, at life suspension of people convicted of certain corporate offences, not five or 10 years but life. The community has, under certain circumstances, the right to prohibit rogue directors who deliberately rip off workers and other creditors from ever controlling companies again. We should also look at the establishment of a guarantee fund so that even when companies do close up overnight workers are assured of their entitlements being honoured by virtue of a special fund created for just that purpose. (Time expired) Unemployment Tariffs: Automotive Industry Islington Railyards Maurovic, Mr Richard Test Cricket: Adelaide Oval",73
137,Ms WORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to take this opportunity today to raise a number of issues of importance to the people of Adelaide. The first and most important of these concerns is the problem of unemployment, which has recently been estimated at 11.7 per cent for the Adelaide area. Studies here in Australia and overseas have shown that there is a direct link between mental and physical health standards and unemployment. The long-term unemployed are more likely to be in poorer health and die at an earlier age. One report in the Australian journal of social issues concluded 'the long term unemployed are characterised by heavy smoking, reduced participation in sport and increased drug usage. Females were drinking more and visiting doctors more. Males were changing their drinking, friendship, eating and sleeping habits in directions indicative of loss of social contact.' Other studies show a significantly higher rate of suicide, suicidal hehaviour and self-mutilation among the unemployed. The Prime Minister e Mr Howard) has already made it abundantly clear that solving the unemployment problem is this government's No. 1 priority. It will take time, however, to undo those structures which encourage inaction in the labour market, provide disincentives for potential employers and discourage the growth of infrastructure and exports. I commend the government for the start it has made in small business, industrial relations, job placement schemes and the rejuvenation of apprenticeship programs. This long term strategy, added to the continuing downward pressure on interest rates, provides real hope to our young and long-term unemployed. Given the concerns over high levels of unemployment in the Adelaide electorate, I would also like to make some comments on the Productivity Commission's report on car tariffs. Adelaide's inner suburbs have many secondary car industries and car accessory businesses. In all, South Australia has 17,000 people employed in car making with between 50,000 and 60,000 in job related industries. As the Prime Minister recently stated when visiting Adelaide last year, 'The idea that we may not have a car industry in the future is unthinkable. ' A rapid reduction of protection, as recommended by the commission's report, would put many of these jobs in jeopardy. I believe that some clear perspective of where Australia sits in regard to the move towards a liberalised international trading regime is needed. Australian levels of tariff protection have dropped to less than one-third of the 1988 levels. In the same period, China has only halved its protection levels. The simple average applied tariff is now five per cent, compared with 23 per cent for China, 13 per cent for Indonesia, 16 per cent for the Philipout pines and 17 per cent for Thailand. Tariff rates on automotive products range from 200 per cent in Indonesia and 40 per cent to 200 per cent in Malaysia. Australia's size does not afford us the opportunity to influence major trading partners and international economic protocols. As a net exporter, however, it is in our long-term economic interest to reduce tariffs, but we can encourage other countries to do likewise only by example and by setting a quicker pace of tariff reduction than the norm. But we also do not live in a textbook. We live in a real world of people trying to secure a future for themselves and their families. As Malcolm Fraser has recently observed, no civilised society can ignore the social consequences of theoretical economic arguments. The net gain for states like South Australia of rapid tariff reduction is questionable. Gains to car-buying consumers from the average imported Korean car may be around $2,000, but the loss of taxes from employees in the car building industry, added to the high social and economic costs of increased unemployment, would negate any benefits to the state. I might add that the current 22 per cent wholesale sales tax regime is a greater impost on consumers than tariffs. While reducing tariffs has bipartisan support, we should proceed carefully and protect Australian jobs. Personally, I have some sympathy with the notion that across-the board reductions to tariffs should give way to a more industry specific policy which enables our domestic industries to be seen in the international context. The level of protection afforded to the vehicle industry, viewed from the perspective of overall tariff protection levels, may seem high. But the picture when looking at Australia's specific industry competitiveness with other car producing countries is very different. When the 15 per cent level of tariff protection is reached, Australia's car making industry will be the least protected in the world. For the hard working Australians who rely on the motor vehicle building industry in Adelaide, the Productivity Commission's report is not good enough. Putting thousands of work will bring numerous social and economic costs beyond the immediate tragedy of adding to the unemployment lines. Any report considering the potential benefits of reducing tariffs would do best to keep this in mind. As Malcolm Fraser points out, 'If the decision is to reduce tariffs to five per cent, manufactures who make cars here and employ many thousands and bring with them skills and capacities will be inclined to say that protection in Australia is uneconomical.' I particularly support associate commissioner Ian Webber's contribution to the commission's report. His experience and standing in the industry has added a new, pragmatic and welcome dimension to the opinions offered by bureaucrats. The government has shown flexibility in his appointment, and his minority report has thrown the argument back to other members of the commission. This can only result in better policy development in the future. It should also be remembered that the commission's report is not government policy and will be only one opinion among many to be considered by the government. Community and industry debate must now ensue, and I encourage all those concerned with the future of the car making industry in Australia to contribute to the discussion. The commission's public hearings will be held in February and March this year, and the final report will be delivered in early May. Central to getting the balance right is addressing the question of what will replace the car industry if tariff reduction damages it terminally. The regional difficulties in South Australia must be taken into account. South Australia stands to lose thousands of jobs. It has already suffered major losses to its manufacturing base, and this must be considered in policy making. In the remaining time, I would like to briefly touch on a couple of other matters of special relevance to my electorate. Firstly, the contaminated land at Australia National's Islington rail yards has received the attention deserved from the government. I am pleased that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is sitting at the table. As I have said before, initial funding was made available in the budget and further funding was provided for in the rail reform package. I have had an on-site meeting with advisers from the offices of Minister Sharp and Minister Wotton as well as with representatives of the South Australian Environment Protection Authority, MFP and the Urban Projects Authority. Discussions are now taking place so that there will be agreement for a solid and safe remediation plan. Planning will include open space which will enhance the area for those who live close by. I also hope that development of some of the land for light industry would provide employment opportunities for the area. Australia Day was a very special day for many people. In the grounds of Government House in Adelaide, along with many others I was thrilled to hear the announcement that Richard Maurovic was South Australian of the Year. Rick is a very talented constituent of mine. After he left school, he achieved his boyhood dream of becoming a stockman and drover. His chosen occupation was cut short in 1986 when a horse riding accident resulted in his becoming a quadriplegic. After many months of rehabilitation, Rick went home to a life of enforced leisure. In 1989 he took up a new activity which saw him becoming a professional artist within two years. Rick cannot grasp a brush or a pencil but works with these tools strapped to his hands. Despite his physical limitation, Rick produces work of fine detail and flawless perspective. Late last year I attended the opening of his exhibition and found superb paintings of Adelaide and South Australian historical sites. Rick is a prolific painter and has a business like and focused approach to his career. He is an accomplished athlete involved in wheelchair sports, doing fencing and playing in wheelchair rugby. He has represented Australia overseas in both disciplines. He has won numerous sporting and civic awards. I most sincerely congratulate him on being awarded 1997 South Australian of the Year. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate all those in my electorate who became New Australian citizens on Australia Day. To have heard Kamahl's address that day made me realise what a special day it was for those people. Cricket was being played on the Adelaide Oval this Australia Day, but unless the Australian Cricket Board responds to the numerous requests from South Australia, and my electorate in particular, the program has been so altered that the sacrosanct tradition of having a test match played on the Adelaide Oval will not occur next year. I implore the board to reconsider this, to have South Australia's best interests at heart, and rearrange, redraw the program so that once again South Australians and so many visitors will see the Australian flag go up on the Adelaide Oval for Australia Day, which has become a very special and traditional ceremony there. Sydney Airport",75
138,Mr ALBANESE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Grayndler) (4.46 p.m.)I rise today in this grievance debate to make my first contribution to the parliamentary year 1997. It is unfortunate that it has to be on issue of Sydney airport, which continues to dominate the environmental, social and political concerns of constituents in my electorate. Today I wish to cover four areas: first, the need to have a cap on the hourly aircraft movements as set down in my private member's bill, which I introduced last year; second, the need for the urgent construction of a second Sydney airport; third, and more locally, the problems with the noise insulation program for weatherboard and fibro houses; and, last, the struggle of small business people in Sydenham for justice. With regard to the cap on airport movements, I introduced a bill in this House last year-which got to its second reading-to have a cap of 80 movements per hour in or out of Sydney airport. I chose 80 because that was the policy which the then Prime Minister had launched in the electorate of Lowe prior to the March 1996 election. Some might have thought it not surprising therefore that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)-who I am pleased to see has come into the House to listen to this discussion-suggested on the day of my second reading speech that he would introduce his own bill. I took that in good faith and indicated that were the bill satisfactory I would be prepared to withdraw my bill. That was backed up by the seconder to my bill, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). Unfortunately, as we approach 12 months of coalition government, their promise has still not been fulfilled. With an entire department at his disposal, the minister has still not been able to produce a draft bill. That is surprising because the minister has had ample opportunity. Last week he introduced the draft long-term operating plan for air management at Sydney airport, a plan which advocates a spreading-a redistribution---{)f noise much of which is from my electorate. There are many admirable things about that plan in terms of a greater fairness of aircraft movements. However, the residents in my electorate will not be satisfied unless they are sure that the government's plan is for a the spreading of noise, not for a spreading of increased noise. If increased movements occur, there will not be any winners with this program, only losers. The minister's own press release last week indicated that the number of aircraft movements at Sydney airport will grow in the next four years from 270,000 to 316,000; by the year 2004, they will be 375,000; in the year 2009-2010, they are projected to be 426,000. It is obvious to alJ, therefore, that there are two things needed: to give the people of Sydney an assurance that there will not be an allowance for any growth of more than 80 movements per hour in spite of the pressure of the tourism industry and of the airlines. Also that a real start be made on the construction of a second Sydney airport. I was an advocate at the 1996 election campaign, and have been since, of Badgerys Creek as the only logical site for a second Sydney airport. Holsworthy came second last in the EIS process a decade ago. Whilst there continues to be prevarication there will continue to be a concern that we will not see a second Sydney airport but that growth will continue to be pumped into Sydney airport. There are a number of problems with the insulation and acquisition program for the residents around Sydney airport. By and large, it has been a well received program. The acquisition of 152 homes in Sydenham is just about complete and the insulation by the Department of Administrative Services has been proceeding at a good rate. It has become apparent to residents-particularly those worse affected around the Sydenham area-who live in fibro and weatherboard houses that it is simply not possible to insulate those houses adequately. Unless the walls of those houses are completely restructured, it is impossible to block the doors and deal with the windows and ceilings, as has occurred in the brick homes. You effectively have a choice of either wasting $45,000 of taxpayers' money on insulating homes with negligible noise attenuation impact or you take a more sensible approach--one might say a more economically rational approach-and include those homes in the acquisition program. I am pleased to say that there is much cross-party support for this proposal. Joe Hockey, who is the chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, and other members came down to Sydenham at my invitation and met with a number of residents. They saw for themselves at first hand the problems that residents were experiencing. I must say, to the minister's credit, I know that senior people his personal staff have also taken the time to visit Sydenham to have a look at these problems because the residents living in these homes tend to be, not surprisingly, the least well off. If you can afford a brick home that is next to a weatherboard home, you will buy the brick one. They cannot afford to engage in the cost of essentially remodelling their own house. Even if they could, it simply would not make sense for them to do so. The plan that the Sydney Airport Community Forum has unanimously put forward to the minister and which I understand is currently before the Expenditure Review Committee is that the acquisition program would be extended to include the lightweight housesweatherboard or fibro-to give those people the option of voluntarily having their homes acquired. Marrickville council has indicated its cooperation in allowing those homes, which would have been purchased, to be demolished. Other more suitable homesgiven the level of noise which will continue to occur in the Sydenham area--could then be built so that they would indeed be livable. At the moment, conditions there are Third World conditions, which is something that the Australian community should find unacceptable and makes no sense on an economic or, most importantly, on a human level. I think residents deserve a fair go. Frankly, they have not been given a fair go by governments of either persuasion up to this point. It has to be said that this is not a party-political issue; this is a matter of the need for governments to do the right thing. I conclude today by raising the issue of Sydenham businesses. I have already indicated that 152 homes around Sydenham have been acquired and most of them have been demolished. A number of other people, not surprisingly, have moved out of the area. The Sydenham shopping centre, centred on Unwins Bridge Road, has basically been destroyed. Of the 12 small businesses which were thriving, most of them run by people of non-English speaking background who came out after the Second World War and established businesses and homes there, today there are only five. Seven of them have had to on close. Two of them that we visited as the Sydney Airport Community Forum have closed in the last four months. The ones that are there are surviving on borrowed time. They need compensation. They need to be told that you just cannot take away the people who shop, the residents who form the basis of their businesses, and provide them with no compensation. They have already lost quality of life in terms of having to live in the area, but their livelihoods have also been taken away. I think that there is a very clear case for the government to respond to the Sydney Airport Community Forum resolution calling for adequate compensation for those people. Where you demolish houses, you take away businesses from those people and they deserve the support of the government. (Time expired) Child Support Agency",78
139,Mrs WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in this grievance debate to speak on a topic near and dear to many of my constituents who have come to me over the past 12 months for my help in their dealings with the Family Court, the Child Support Agency and the Taxation Office. The types of complaints and the difficulties are a day-today nightmare for many of my constituents who are unfortunate enough to suffer family breakdown. They invariably are all suffering from emotional trauma and continuous anxiety in their ongoing contact over issues such as custody, access, payments to the custodial parent or non-payment of maintenance to the custodial parent. The difficulties are many and varied. I wish to draw to the attention of the House that there are many cases similar to the ones that present to me in Bowman, and I happen to know for a fact that it is happening in every federal electorate across Australia. If this is not the case, I will stand corrected. However, if I were to lay bets, I am sure I would win hands down that this is an ever increasing concern. Quite frankly, it is not going to go away; it is going to get worse before it gets better. It is only going to get better with the concerted efforts of concerned politicians, not the ramblings from those with vested interests in a system that they refuse to review and repair. To say and think that what we have at present is a satisfactory operational system is far from the truth. The problem is that the system just continues on its merry way day by day, causing continued grief and anxiety, perpetuating a belief that this is as good as it gets. No wonder there are desperate, angry, disillusioned, hostile, aggressive and dispirited individuals caught up in the nightmare of separation and divorce, and who can blame them. Of course, there is no quick fix, but there is hope. Hope comes in the form of a more reasonable and realistic approach to solving the initial hurt. I do not believe that the system can fix itself. For many reasons, I do not see that that is where the solution can be found. The real solutions come from those intimately involved in the daily process of gaining a fairer deal from the system. The current system, which we inherited, is not working. As testimony to this, every week at least two new constituents or previous contacts ring or write to the office concerned with issues from the Child Support Agency. Many of these issues are of an administrative nature and are easily remedied through the improved supportive strategies employed by the caring and sensitive work practices of the staff. But really the help they get is only bandaid, temporarily taking care of information or instruction on what to alter marginally. The system affects both custodial and noncustodial parents. I have on record 28 cases. However, if you add up all the relatives associated with each case, plus the relevant solicitors and bureaucrats, the range of impact swells to hundreds of people. They are affected by this legislative formula and the review process. It is an ever-increasing problem. This is the most emotional and consistent problem in this and other electorates. To point out the flaws within the framework, I will illustrate how unfairly the process can impact on individuals without any bias to men or women, or custodial or non-custodial parents. There are negatives for all involved. A most recent case involved a male noncustodial parent earning $110 a week who was told, after review. that he has to pay $106 per week in maintenance. Another case involved a female constituent, a custodial parent who has never received maintenance, while the father has skipped the country with a $25,000 debt for the support of his child. I could go on with cases of child abuse accusations, accusations not investigated, difficulty in non-custodial parents meeting the commitments of distance and the provision of extras for one family when their own personal finances are barely adequate. I commend to your reading the selected problems and proposed solutions by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). We have read the Price report; the recommendations are all there. An examination of the operation and effectiveness of the scheme was presented in 1994. The complaints against the system by those who have contacted me are not aimed at getting special treatment. Rather, the men feel they are not getting a fair hearing. The women also are not able to get enforced orders of payments from errant fathers. All everybody wants is fair treatment. Over a period of many years, a vast array of support networks associated with family breakdown have grown up-a growth akin to an industry, but an industry feeding off the emotional hardship and trauma of vulnerable, distraught individuals unaccustomed to the experiences about to beset them as they enter the labyrinth of the Family Law Court and Child Support Agency. Women have generally had available to them networks to assist them to survive abuse and violence. The governments of the day have built a safety net for those in dysfunctional domestic situations. Men are now realising that they too need the support of like-minded sufferers of domes- model. tic disaster. I have been happy to be associated with several of these support groups whose main aim is to assist those coping with the trauma of family breakdown. These are the real people who have the real solutions to the flaws within the process and the system. But I have major a concern that, in reality, how we are dealing with family breakdown is, to my way of thinking, not the best option. Instead of creating more and more groups and networks and providing an endless array of support services-this is where these services take on the trappings of an industry-why can we not look back to the very beginning of the process and re-establish a more workable, reasonable and flexible negotiated or mediated contractual agreement? This agreement could have a running-in period, with confirmation at a later time when the heat has gone out of the situation. This is but one consideration. Until the final scenario of a fair and just system is finally found, one that does not disadvantage everybody or inflict undue bias towards one or another party, we will have to deal with the ongoing complaints of the unfair manner of assessment of child support liability, the unsatisfactory collection and enforcement of child support debts, the need for the review process to be reviewed and the need to address the current disincentive for noncustodial parents to earn more or to strive promotion. If these and all the other flaws in the system were addressed, then just imagine who would really benefit. I would hope it would be the fathers, the mothers and all the children caught up in this emotional tangled web. It is the duty, after all, of a government to alleviate, not create, anxiety. It has been estimated that by the year 2000 the total number of children under the umbrella of the CSA will be in the vicinity of one million. I truly believe that, as a vital aspect of this government's agenda, reform of the nature and extent of the operation of the Family Law Court and the Child Support Agency will be addressed sooner rather than later and that, as a matter of urgency, politicians from electorates across Australia will aim to address the essential flaws within the current system and come up with a better Ryan, Ms Edna",79
140,Dr LAWRENCE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Fremantle) (5.05 p.m.)I rise today to notify the House that Edna Ryan, a great feminist of this century, died this morning at the age of 92. Her death is of great sadness to all of us who have been involved in the Labor movement and the feminist movement and, I think, to all women generally. It is a great loss to all of those in our community who have been committed to ending injustice and discrimination in our society. Edna was a flag-bearer on all of these issues. I rise today to take the first opportunity to honour her enormous contribution to improving the lives of so many Australian women and their families, and to offer her family heartfelt condolences on my behalf and on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I know I could go beyond that to the many friends she has-from activists in organisations like WEL and other women's organisations to women who have aspired to politics, those who have succeeded and those who have not. Edna Ryan was born on 15 December 1904, so she obviously had a long life and a very profitable one, too, for this community. She was born into a working class family and she never forgot that. She always worked very for hard to diminish disadvantage wherever she saw it. She was one of 11 children and one of six daughters, perhaps not unusual for the time. But her political activism began at a very early age; therefore, she not only lived through, but actively participated in, many of the great historical events of the 20th century-with, I might say, great enthusiasm. Edna, like a lot of women of her time, was not able to complete her education, but it was said that she showed a lot of promise at school. Some even said that she was the brightest member of her family. Nonetheless, she was, as many women were at that time, forced to leave at the age of 14 so that she could contribute to the family income which would have been very modest indeed. Her father did not, at the time, earn a regular wage, so from her earliest memory her mother was the principal breadwinner, and perhaps that shaped her thinking in subsequent years. Her older sisters also supported the family working in the clothing trade-it never was and still is not a very pleasant place to work for many people. The discrimination and the difficulties that her family experienced living on half the family wage was the impetus behind much of Edna Ryan's work because her mother and her sisters would have been paid lower wages than their male counterparts. The following quote from her book TwoThirds of a Man sums up Edna Ryan's commitment to improving the working conditions of Australian women and men and her commitment to equal pay, which was strong and long-lasting: Paternalism, chivalry and protection as they were practised in the workforce, often at the instigation of the trade unions, always had the effect of reducing women's access to work. To this day some unionists believe that more restrictions should be placed upon women rather than on both sexes. Large numbers of back injuries, to say nothing of hernias, have been a feature of the male workforce, because the 'macho' males perform work from which females have been excluded. Many a worker has become an invalid, dependent upon his wife, because of sexist conditioning that he act as though he were physically tough. Neither sex should be involved in some of the occupations where men have exposed themselves to great hazards in order to prove their manhood. I think that shows a lot about Edna Ryan. She was not only interested in ensuring that women were treated equally but also looking to ensure that men did not behave in ways that were self-destructive. Edna Ryan will be remembered most for her campaign to win equal pay for equal work. She was both a driving force and an intellect behind it. She struggled to make unions represent women as well as men. She worked within the union movement: she urged, she cajoled, she pushed. This is a struggle that still has not been completely won, but the ascendancy of Jennie George to the ACTU presidency is a fantastic victory and a symbol which delighted Edna Ryan. As she said in an interview with Monica Attard, 'I am glad that Jennie is doing it, but I'm sorry for her, too, because she's got a tough job.' That is absolutely true. But there was no tougher job than winning the equal pay case in 1972. In this, Edna Ryan was an advocate for the Women's Electoral Lobby. There are some very interesting stories surrounding this. I refer to the Gentle Invaders for some reference to what she had to do in order to get the information necessary to argue her case: Four women advocates made submissions on behalf of low paid working women not receiving the male minimum wage. These were, in order of appearance, advocates from the Union of Australian Women, the National Council of Women, Women's Electoral Lobby and the Department of Labour of the Australian Labor government. All produced evidence that males were neither the sole family breadwinners nor the only low paid workers in need of the protection of a minimum wage. WEL produced as an exhibit the most up-to-date evidence of those families without a male head in Australia. The Acting Commonwealth Statistician, J.G. Miller, had written in a letter to WEL dated 12 February 1974: I assume you require the number of women with dependants without a male head to support the family, referred to as 'fatherless families' in the survey conducted for the Commission of Enquiry into Poverty. I think it is interesting that these figures had never been released. It took a lot of pushing to get them into the public domain. It goes on: The estimates from the Income Survey from the Enquiry was 131.7 thousand fatherless families in Australia. You should note, however, that this survey excluded some of the remote areas of Australia and some non-private dwellings such as hotels, motels, hospitals and education institutions which in total account for about 0.8 per cent of the Australian population. On the basis of these public figures, WEL estimated that the total number of women receiving less than the male minimum wage was a gross figure of 300,000 out of a total of 1.9 million females in the labour force. So the argument goes on. The basic work actually had to be done by WEL and women's organisations. It simply was not in the public domain and it was not convenient to many of the others arguing against the case that it should be. So she had to struggle extremely hard. As she said two years ago in an interview on PM with Monica Attard: I was about 12 or 13 when the Russian revolution came and I was already a socialist, you know like, like a socialist family. I was following the revoluthe tion, as such, in the Sydney Morning Herald. She has always been interested in equality. I think that in her later years she probably would have seen some of that socialist revolution perverted; nonetheless, she understood the basic principles. We were very pleased in our party that we were able to bestow life membership on Edna in 1987. Not only was she a tireless worker for women and for the removal of inequality but she has also been a tireless worker for the Labor Party for half a century. She tells a story about Jessie Street's campaign for the seat of Wentworth, an extremely difficult one and against all the odds--one, I might say, that Jessie Street did not win. Jessie Street's name is one to be conjured with and people generally know a little about Jessie Street, but very few people know about Edna Ryan. She was the one who did the hard yakka behind the scenes and she continued to do it. Everyone who knew Edna knew her energy and her commitment. There are myriad stories about the fact that she could not stop long after most people would have put their feet up. Edna is reported to have said: 'Like a cat, I have nine lives. The eighth one had been devoted to the women's movement. I'm now in my last one. In my dotage.' Friends and family hooted with laughter at this sort of thing. In an interview in the Sydney Morning Herald, her eldest daughter, Julia, pointed out that Ryan is up and at 'em by six each morning, hammering out articles on issues that concern and firing off at least five letters before breakfast. That is hardly what most people would describe as 'dotage'. Furthermore, she maintained her interest in the women's movement right to the end. I spoke with Susan Ryan last week, who had just come from visiting Edna Ryan, and she said that Edna was not at all concerned about her own health but was interested in what was happening to women in areas such as superannuation and whether the changes the government proposed might not have a detrimental effect on them. As recently as the last couple of years, she had been pushing very hard our minister and now the current minister on the question of effects of industrial relations changes on women. Edna Ryan had several discussions with Laurie Brereton in particular and, together with Laurie, worked out a series of amendments to ensure that female workers would not be worse off under the new enterprise bargaining system. They added provisions to the bill to ensure that women would not be disadvantaged. In the same interview, Mr Brereton said, 'We worked up a whole raft of measures which, I might say, not only made it a better package but also were very helpful in gaining the support of the minority parties in the Senate.' In other words, she always had an eye to the political outcome as well as the position of women in our society. I join with a great many people throughout the community who are extremely sad that Edna has left us. But she has left an enormous legacy which it is now our responsibility to build on. We need to ensure that all those years of very hard work to ensure a movement in the direction of improved equality for women are continued, because I am sure Edna would not see that the task was finished either. We must take on her legacy and understand that it is only through people such as Edna Ryan-with her energy, dedication and commitment-that this is a genuinely decent society. Economy Gambling",81
141,Mr BRADFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Australia has generally been regarded historically as a Christian country, although only a minority of Australians actually attend church regularly. Over recent years there has been a decline in church attendance, particularly in the established denominations. This has coincided with a social malaise, of which there is substantial evidence. But I wonder whether it is a coincidence. Something is seriously amiss in a society which is characterised by the highest rate of youth suicide in the world; by the extent to which abortion is carried out illegally and yet condoned by so many; by a situation where there is a serious debate going on in the country on the question of euthanasia; and where drug abuse is rife. There are some serious signs that things are not going quite right. This week in Canberra the Anglican church is conducting a substantial summit-the first one, I think, for many years. I notice that Archbishop Rayner, the Primate of the church and the Archbishop of Melbourne, is speaking at the press club on Wednesday on the topic 'Does the church have a future?' I hope his answer will be a resounding yes. I am going to go along and listen with some interest to what he has to say. I certainly believe the answer is yes. The government today is quite correctly focused on the economic problems we have. It is quite clearly a legacy of 13 years of Labor government. Its profligate spending has left the current government with a mess and, unfortunately, with very limited options to fix the mess. The previous government was spending when it should have been saving, and very often it spent irresponsibly. Within the context of addressing the economic problems that we face, of course our priority is solving unemployment. It is a complex issue that has many facets, and many people are making suggestions about the solution. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said only in the last day or so that a work for the dole scheme, whilst not being in any sense a solution to the problem of unemployment, is at least a partial solution to the problem of providing young people in particular with the opportunity to do something useful for their unemployment benefits and to experience the discipline that goes with going out to work each day. Many of our social ills are actually a direct result of unemployment. Idleness is a terrible affliction, especially for men, I think, as they are deprived of their traditional role as breadwinners. It is a great pity that so many young men and women are becoming welfare focused so soon after leaving school. It is rather ironic that it was the Whitlam government which actually sent us down the path that we have gone so far down today. Mr Whitlam in his recent, highly publicised speech seems unwilling to accept any responsibility for that situation or to even in any way admit that what his government did has served Australia so poorly. He talks in his speech about his version of equality, which seems to be what it was in those years: taking from the rich and giving to the poor, an ideology which of course has failed everywhere. Unemployed men, in particular, become violent-both inside and outside the home. They take refuge in alcohol and they spend time in clubs and casinos. While our nation was founded in very different circumstances from America, there are some similarities. I was interested to read Geoff Strong in the Sunday Age recently making the following point rather poignantly: When the founders of the US landed, they held a prayer meeting. When the first fleet landed, the convicts had an orgy on the beach. But we do have in common between the two countries a firm foundation of ludao-Christian standards, ethics and values. These are substantially represented in our flag, and that is why I am pleased that the Prime Minister has made it very clear that he has no intention of supporting any moves to change the flag. The foundation upon which our nation was started has been shaken as the signposts to morality have been broken down and not replaced with anything. Premier Kennett is quoted in that same article of Geoff Strong as telling Archbishop Rayner that he and his followers were 'yesterday's people'. He made those remarks in the context of Archbishop Rayner's raising of concerns about the proliferation of gambling in the state of Victoria. It is really to that issue in particular that I want to address a few remarks today. I recently visited the United States; part of the agenda for that visit was to look into the growing concern there at the proliferation of gambling. In fact, the United States President has appointed a number of eminent Americans to a commission on gambling. And yet I cannot fail to observe, having looked at the situation in America and here, that Australians probably spend more time and more money gambling on all sorts of things than does the average American. Las Vegas of course comes to mind when one thinks of gambling in America, but most American towns are nothing like Las Vegas. The welfare agencies in my electorate have been telling me for some time about the problems they are having in coping with the demand for counselling for people who have become addicted to gambling. In fact, a number of prominent welfare workers on the Gold Coast-as I am sure you know, Madam Deputy Speaker-have been saying for some years that there is a significant downside to gambling. So I have had a close look at it. I am quite sure that gambling addiction is a family destroying affliction. A surprisingly high percentage of people who engage in gambling on a regular basis become, if not addicted to it then certainly very much caught up in a situation that you can easily be caught up in if you start to enjoy gambling too much. I am surprised-perhaps I should not be that there has been a headlong rush by state governments into a huge expansion of gambling and gambling opportunities. I think this is particularly so in recent times in Queensland and Victoria. It probably happened some years ago in New South Wales and has not gone much beyond that. In recent times it has certainly been noticeable in Queensland and Victoria. Putting aside the moral questionalthough not perhaps the morality of the advertising that goes with it, which I think goes way too far at times-it is really the economic arguments which are put forward in favour of spreading gambling opportunities which I believe are actually dramatically flawed. The recent decision by the Queensland government to extend keno to hotels, clubs and TABs is in my view a case in point. We are told by the Queensland government that it is going to create around 250 jobs and raise between $20 million and $30 million revenue for the government, which will allow the government to provide more hospitals and police-and we certainly need those things in Queensland. Some of the money that is raised by the government will go into a community benefit fund. The substantial research that I saw being done by a US based organisation called Focus on the Family indicates that for every $1 of revenue raised through gambling it costs as much as $3 to rectify the problems that gambling creates when it is measured right across society. I am absolutely convinced that gambling revenue, which is supposed to be raised and used to benefit the community, is a negative benefit when all the costs are added up. As gambling opportunities proliferate, more people gamble, people spend more on gambling and more people become addicted to it. In the end, small business suffers. I am not the first to make this observation. It has been made by astute people such as Rupert Murdoch, who made the point a couple of years ago. It occurred to me then, and it is true, that there is only so much money to go around and that gambling has increased. In Victoria--once the garden state, now the gambling state-there was a 19 per cent increase in money spent on gambling from 1994-95 to 1995-96. If that additional money is being spent on gambling, then it is not being spent on other goods and services. I suspect that rather than generating employment it has a negative effect on employment. We need to be aware of this problem. It is an increasing problem in our society. In the federal context we need to be aware that putting pressure on the states to raise more revenue is counterproductive if they are raising it through generating revenue from gambling. Human Rights",83
142,Mr HOLLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievance today is about the damage this coalition government is doing to Australia's image on human rights. Human rights are not only about actions but also about perceptions. Certain countries are perceived as having a good record on human rights; others are perceived as having a bad record. Whatever the reality, once you have that reputation, good or bad, it is hard to change the perception. But the perception regarding Australia is changing because of our reluctance to sign the trade agreement with the European Community because it has what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has referred to as an 'impertinent' human rights clause in it. Most Australians would believe that our record on human rights is good, yet the reality is in so many cases just the reverse. Despite what the current Prime Minister might believe, there are stains on our history and until we recognise and admit this we are, I believe, diminished as a nation. It has taken us many years to live down the perception conveyed by the White Australia policy. It may not be in force today, yet people in many parts of the world still believe that we have a very discriminatory immigration policy. This is a case of perception. Australia as a founding member of the United Nations voted for the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The declaration was drafted by a UN committee established during the 1946 Conference of Paris. The declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948 with H.V. Evatt in the chair. Our record on ratifying conventions dealing with human rights has not been very good under conservative governments. In fact, up until the time of the WhitIam government we had been very slow to ratify human rights conventions. There have been many reasons for this, not least when as a federation we have had to consult the various states and I believe in many cases have given undue emphasis to the views of the states. But, over the last few years, Australia has ratified many conventions even if occasionally putting reservations in. We have ratified many international conventions dealing with human rights, and although some conservative member,> have raised the old bogies of surrendering our sovereignty to the UN, and bouts of nonsense as were spoken regarding the convention on the Rights of the Child, in general terms there has been a fairly bipartisan approach to the ratification of treaties. As I am critical of the current government's role on human rights conventions, let me here give credit where credit is due. It was this conservative government that established the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Treaties. This was originally suggested in a report from the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade but it was this government that set up that committee, which is doing an excellent job in examining treaties that Australia is about to sign or proposing to sign, bringing reports to the parliament and making the treaty and the treaty process better known to the general public-a long overdue effort, I might suggest. Australia is often accused of pontificating on human rights issues-a matter that our Asian neighbours are never slow to draw to our attention. Before pronouncing on human rights or human rights violations in their countries, those doing the pronouncing must make sure that their own house is in order. Therefore one can only imagine the cynicism with which many are viewing Australia's current reluctance, and indeed refusal, to sign the trade treaty with the EC because of this human rights clause. It seems to many that Australia is saying that we can comment on violations of human rights in your country but we in Australia are above scrutiny or examination. It is hypocrisy in the extreme. If we genuinely feel for human rights, why are we reluctant to sign this clause? As usual we are sending all the wrong messages to Asia and other parts of the world and we are confirming many people's views that in this area we are hypocritical. This parliament considered human rights to be so important that it set up a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to deal with human rights. At this moment, the committee is conducting an inquiry into the change of sovereignty in Hong Kong, with a particular emphasis on human rights. There is great concern about whether the human rights of the citizens of Hong Kong will diminish with the change in sovereignty. If it is good enough for this parliament to comment on human rights in Hong Kong and indeed in China, why will we not sign a trade agreement containing a standard human rights clause? The clause would reinforce Australia's support for the universal declaration of human rightssomething which we have supported for nearly 50 years. Australia is the first country to object to the commitment to universal human rights. Not only is it with the European communities that we are showing a reluctance to adhere to international standards on human rights, but our whole performance regarding the international labour organisation also shows a form of cant and hypocrisy. We have been a member of the ILO since 1919 and have indeed always played a leading part in this organisation, yet this government has withdrawn our permanent representative in Geneva, has severely curtailed our representation at meetings and has cut the funding. For the first time ever Australia is not on the management committee. Labour rules are fundamentally bound up with human rights. It is often in the exploitation of workers people's human rights are most violated, yet we have downgraded our representation to the international body and have cut funding. Great damage has been done to Australia's image by quibbling over a standard human rights clause which has been applied to all agreements between the European Union and any third country. What Australia should be doing is promoting human rights throughout the world, observing the important social clauses in the World Trade Organisation and making sure the International Labour Organisation conventions are upheld wherever they apply. Over recent years Australia has had a proud record of working towards human rights. Incidentally, our record is much better than the Europeans and much better than many of our neighbours. It is no good trying to enforce human rights for countries that have a doubtful record if they can point out that countries like Australia and other developed countries are not signing the clause at all in the European agreement. As was recently said in the Canberra Times, this federal government is acting awfully like someone with a guilty conscience over the human rights clause in a framework agreement for future relations between Australia and the European Union. If, as the Prime Minister claimed on Australia Day, our balance sheet on, among other things, our treatment of minorities is looking so good, what is the government's difficulty with this clause? It is not a question of apologising, as the Prime Minister tells us, but recognising the values we have evolved over 200 difficult years and pursuing them with pride and determination. To maintain our credibility in respect of human rights we must sign the agreement with the European Community with its human rights clauses immediately. It is not good enough for Australia to seek to playa leading role in human rights matters in international fora and to comment on human rights violations-and there are great human rights violations; one only has to look at countries like Burma. We should, rightfully, bring these issues to the world's attention that and condemn them. We diminish our role, we most certainly diminish our credibility and we open ourselves up to the accusation of hypocrisy if we do not sign this standard clause which is in all agreements dealing with trade that the European Community enters into. Somehow we are saying that we are above scrutiny. No country in the field of human rights is above scrutiny. I believe that to restore our credibility, to continue to send the right messages, especially in regard to human rights, we should do immediately what we should have done some time ago-that is, sign that agreement with its human rights clause. Aircraft Noise Regional Forest Agreements",85
143,Mr V AILE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to talk about a couple of issues in this grievance debate. The first relates to aircraft noise-and not the sort of aircraft noise we have heard about in recent years in Sydney-affecting constituents in my electorate of Lyne, particularly those from the Forster-Tuncurry area. Firstly, Mr Harold Wright of Short Street, Forster, telephoned my office in November last year to complain about military aircraft flying over the area between the hours of 8 to 9.30 p.m. on three occasions during October. Mr Wright also contacted the RAAF base at Williamtown. As per usual procedure, a Department of Defence record of aircraft noise complaint form was posted out to Mr Wright, which he completed-a copy of which was sent to me. Mr Wright in part stated: Severe and extended aggravation by noise caused by aircraft descending rapidly to very low level, in what can only be described as dive bombing attitude. The scream created was frightening, followed by the roar of jets. The Wednesday night attack included sonic booms. In November, I also received a written complaint from Mrs Goldsmith of Lachlan Avenue, Tuncurry, about the same noise disturbance, which my office forwarded to the RAAF base at Williamtown. In her letter, dated 31 October, she stated in part: We in Forster & Tuncurry are having a terrible time from the RAAF exercises after 8pm each night. The noise is deafening and literally scares the daylights out of a person. The advice I have now received from the operations liaison officer at RAAF Williamtown reads in part: 77 SQN were conducting simulated radar bombing around the Forsterrruncurry area over the time period in question ... The sorties were conducted at night, not below 5500 feet and the configuration of the aircraft was such that the intentional breaking of the sound barrier was highly unlikely. Notwithstanding this, certain meteorological phenomena can prevail where noise transmission and amplification are greater than during normal atmospheric conditions. This situation would not be evident to the pilots. Moreover, the combination of meteorological ambient factors needed to amplify and transmit noise, to a level to cause concern, cannot be forecast. Forsterrruncurry is in the authorised airspace designated for this type of flying training and there are no alternative areas available that are within aircraft's range. Noise reduction considerations will continue to be addressed at weekly planning conferences, with the aim of reducing noise impact to all members of the community. While recognising the importance of our RAAF service and the need for such exercises to train our pilots, I also sympathise with those people in the Forster-Tuncurry region who have been unintentional1y affected by these RAAF exercises. However, I am pleased with the report from the RAAF base at Williamtown recently released which details the flying program covering portions of the Manning and Great Lakes region for the month of February. So the RAAF has taken on board the concerns of these people and is attempting to notify the community a little bit more in advance. That is all the constituents in my electorate ask for-that, if the RAAF is going to conduct these exercises, there be some forewarning so they know what is going on rather than being frightened by the aircraft noise and some of the sonic booms that have taken place. The second issue that I want to raise in the grievance debate this evening is with regard to regional forest agreements. Earlier this month the Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria signed Australia's first RFA. As the Prime Minister himself stated, the RF A for the East Gippsland region represents 'a milestone in Australian forest management'. It is a milestone because it represents the final step in the process of achieving a truly balanced outcome for our forests. It is the final step in what has been an exhaustive scientific assessment of the social, economic and environmental demands of our region. I underline the social impact and the economic impact for those regions. The East Gippsland RFA area covers about 1.2 million hectares, of which 90 per cent is public land, most of it native forest. Approximately 50 per cent of the public land is in the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. The RFA is good for the environment. It recognises the remarkable diversity of the region's flora and fauna. The CAR reserve system protects many forest types at levels well in excess of national and international criteria, including the biodiversity criterionthe which aims to protect 15 per cent of forest types which existed before European settlement-met for all forest types; and, the criteria for protection of 60 per cent of old growth forests and at least 90 per cent of high quality wilderness met for all forest types. The RFA is good for the local community. It provides greater certainty of access to timber resources. It creates up to 400 new jobs in logging and timber related industries. New industries ranging from particle board industries to veneer production will have the potential to generate timber products worth up to $140 million. The RFA will also be a boost to local tourism and have other flow-on effects. It begs the question: what is happening in New South Wales with regard to forests? The answer: not much. Not much on a positive front, that is. While I welcome the successful RFA reached for the East Gippsland region, I still have grave concerns about the whole RFA process in New South Wales, which has been hijacked by the Carr Labor government. I have already raised in this House my concerns about the unfortunate outcome of the New South Wales interim forest assessment process, the forerunner to RFA agreements. In what was supposed to be an interim process only, the Carr government chose to make a number of permanent decisions, including locking up an extra 200,000 hectares of forests in national parks and wilderness areas; making further reductions in Crown sawlog quotas; and, imposing a 30 per cent increase in timber royalties. Those decisions are not the decisions that you would find in an interim process prior to the establishment and signing of an RFA. But they are the decisions that the Carr government has taken to date. The result of these premature decisions has been even greater uncertainty for the New South Wales timber industry and the many workers and their families that rely upon it. In my own electorate of Lyne on the mid north coast of New South Wales the further restriction on timber supplies has lead to the closure of a hardwood sawmill at Mount George and a hardwood board plant at Wingham. There has been the direct loss of some 30 jobs in total to these small communitiesand that was just prior to Christmas. That was a great Christmas present to them from the New South Wales state government. The south-east of New South Wales has also suffered from Bob Carr's political grandstanding. The New South Wales Labor government recently declared 90,000 hectares of national park in the Bombala-Eden region, with an additional 36,000 hectares also earmarked to be locked up. That would totally destroy the hardwood timber industry in that region. As my colleague the member for Eden-Monaro stated in his press release on 29 January: . .. the NSW Government is intent on locking up more and more forest purely to keep the extreme urban conservation groups happy rather than having a proper industry/conservation balance. The Carr government has threatened the viability of achieving sound RFA outcomes for New South Wales, putting at risk the timber industry and the environment. I am hopeful that the Commonwealth will be able to restore some balance to the RFA process in New South Wales in the coming months so that we can get back on track toward a rigorous and scientifically based outcome for our forests, like that which has been achieved in East Gippsland. It has been a matter of shame that the New South Wales government have ignored the process that has been set in train in other states and gone down their own path, for whatever reason. They have locked up those large tracts of public land, decreased the quota on sawlogs and increased the royalties that have been charged with scant regard for the social impact on those communities. Their entire focus has been on the environmental debate and what has been motivating their organisation and their backbenchers in New South Wales. I have put the question in this place before and I will put it again: where has the member for Clarence in the New South Wales parliament been in this debate? The former member for Page has not been heard of, particularly on behalf of the timber industry. The Carr government has pursued its own agendapossibly to the detriment of the RFA process-unlike Victoria, where that rigorous scientific exercise was put into place which took into account not just the environmental aspects of that process but also the scientific, industry and, most importantly, social impacts on those timber communities. Question resolved in the affirmative. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA",87
144,Mr WILLIAMS,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add to an answer I gave in question time today. The member for Banks asked me whether I could advise the House whether the Australian Federal Police executed a search warrant for Senator Woods's Parliament House office in addition to his other premises. I have made inquiries of the Federal Police and they have advised that they did not execute a search warrant in relation to Senator Woods's Parliament House office and they added that no warrant was executed in relation to Senator Woods's premises prior to 21 January. NA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 February, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time.",90
145,Mr WILTON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I rise to speak on this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill primarily to reject outright the overwhelming hypocrisy that has been demonstrated by speaker after speaker on the other side who have both fallaciously and erroneously claimed that the need for this bill is underpinned by the rise in government debt and that the rise in this debt has placed Australia in what they constantly call an untenable position. Australia's balance sheet in 1996 was at the top of the tree in comparison with the 20 top Western economies. The member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), a former Treasurer of this nation, referred the House in his contribution on this debate to the OECD economic outlook for 1996, which in December highlighted that, of the leading 20 industrial economies in the world, Australia was the fourth lowest of the 20 top nations in regard to budget deficits as a percentage of GDP. The average figure for these 20 economies was 3.2 per cent as a percentage of GDP. Australia's deficit, at four per cent, was little more than half the average of these 20 leading OECD economies. The publication of the OECD's economic outlook for December last year also lists in tabular form the gross financial debt of each of those 20 leading economies. Australia's debt, at 43.4 per cent of GDP, was the second lowest of those 20 nations. There have been many spurious claims made by those on the other side, none more erroneously than by the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott), who submitted in his contribution to this debate, in what might best be described as something of an attack on the member for Gellibrand, that Mr Willis had witnessed a blow-out-the words the member for Boothby used-in government debt since he first took his seat in this place in 1972. Considering Australia's position in the OECD's pecking order of nations, the member for Boothby's claims are as spurious as many other claims on the other side were and, in the context of those comparisons that I have just cited, ought to be rejected as a gross exaggeration. From the perspective of either government debt or the government's budgetary position, Australia is in no way in the parlous, decrepit shape that the current Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), claims. He claims that the Australian economy is on the rocks. These claims fly in the face of the comments by his Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the second half of last year that the Australian ecoriomy was in better than good shape-that was his term. Those comments made by the Prime Minister in the latter months of last year that the Australian economy was in better than good shape also fly in the face of his comments uttered time and time again during the 1996 election campaign when he claimed that the country was enjoying nothing more than five minutes of economic sunshine. In terms of the then Leader of the Opposition-the now Prime Minister-talking down the economy at that time, this was among the most dishonest of statements from him. The fact that the utterer of such dishonest statements is now the primary proponent of a Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is something of a contradiction in terms. In listening to the contributions to this debate by all the speakers on the other side, I heard sentence after sentence of nothing more than double standard and doublespeakin fact the same double standard and doublespeak which have pervaded the government's economic thinking in its 11 months in office to date. That is why those of us on this side of the House know that this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, when it becomes law, will be implemented and applied in the same limp-wristed and inconsistent way in which the Prime Minister's discredited so-called ministerial standards are applied. That brings me to recollect the contribution in this debate of the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who said that Labor simply could not handle money. When one makes some passing reference, as I have just done, to Mr Howard's ministerial standards and to the member for Cowan's statement about our capacity to handle money, one wonders just how dishonest those on the other side are when you examine the fact that there is noone on this side who is currently under AFP investigation for any financial related matters. Yet there are those on the other side who are currently under investigation, which calls into question their capacity-in the member for Cowan's words-to handle money. Mr Ronaldson-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure the honourable member was not meaning to indicate that there was widespread dishonesty amongst government members. I hope he would clarify that. That was certainly an interpretation of his remarks and I am sure he did not mean to indicate that.",90
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Mr Hollis)The honourable member did not mention any member directly. But if there is concern about it, I am sure that the honourable member for Isaacs will be careful about what he is saying. As I understand it, though, he just made a general reference rather than a specific reference.",91
147,Mr WILTON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,I take the member for Ballarat's point. It was indeed a general reference. I was simply seeking to draw comparisons between the statement of the member for Cowan and,91
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Well, we might not canvass that issue.",91
149,Mr WILTON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Okay, I will proceed. Of course, those opposite have maintained throughout the course of this debate that the opposition-in fact, the then Labor government-was remiss in not advising the electorate in Labor's mid-year review of the most recent budget forecast for what I call the 'out years', 1996-97 and onwards to 1998-99, which after the March election had worsened against the latest budget forecast. It was through the Hawke Labor government, primarily through the efforts of Treasurer Keating, that the flow of details provided to the electorate improved and increased markedly compared to the years until 1983 when the now Prime Minister was Treasurer. It was also that same Hawke government, under the treasurership of former Prime Minister Keating, which introduced the publication of three-year forward estimates of outlays and revenue-something the current Prime Minister failed to do in the six years during which he pulled the Treasury levers. There were several other reporting initiatives that Treasurer Keating drafted and subsequently implemented and which Treasurer Howard, up until 1983, had failed to do. They number, among several, the publication of annual tax expenditure requirements. As I have said, the mid-year review is numbered in their ranks, as is the national fiscal outlook, which was whittled right back under this government. Finally, the former Labor government had introduced a comprehensive report on specific payments to the states. These payments are within a whisker of being finished under this government's Budget Paper No.3. So much for accountability, transparency and openness. Interested persons were able to compare budget outcomes and debt levels during those years because, in 1995, they were included in the budget papers. So I think the question that ought to be asked today of the electorate at large is: why did the current government, so high on accountability and transparency, remove the opportunity for these comparisons to be drawn by the electorate at large? I proffer the answer to that question in suggesting that this was because, as the member for Gellibrand again alluded to in his contribution, the government does not want comparisons to be made by the electorate at large that are favourable to the former administration and perhaps detrimental to its own prospects. This government-as I say again, so keen on standards and openness and accountabiIitydoes not wish to afford people the opportunity of making these comparisons which showed our great nation in such favourable light, primarily due to the initiatives and the efforts of the Labor government. But what then about the next budget? There are some $2 billion worth of Treasurer Costello's election promises made in his first budget which remain unfunded. To make up this amount the coalition government has hit Australian families in the breadbasket. It has hit Australian families where it hurts most. As  contribution to this debate, they have knocked the guts out of the Commonwealth dental program. He referred Australians to the fact that they have also lost access to affordable child care and pharmaceutical benefits. The now government has made up for these $2 billion in unfunded promises--or is at least seeking to do that-through dramatic increases to HECS charges. On top of that we now have the Treasurer, the member for Higgins, imposing a $2 billion budget blow-out on the Australian electorate. This is absolute irresponsibility the part of the member for Higgins who, time and time again, alluded to the Beazley black hole, which was due to nothing more than changes in growth forecasts, while simultaneously making no similar comments on his incompetence in regard to generating that budget blow-out to the tune of $2 billion. For a range of reasons, I think the federal Treasurer ought now to have a long and hard look at his methods and his lack of consultation in terms of what his budgetary initiatives are doing to the Australian electorate in respect of their incapacity to pay for increased charges at either end of the spectrum: whether it is those who have children in child care, whether it is those who have children at university or whether it is the aged, who rely more on pharmaceutical benefits than most. They are the people that the Treasurer ought to come down from his ivory tower-built with bricks perhaps made in the more salubrious suburbs of Malvern and Toorak-and look at. He should get out to parts of the world like Cranbourne, which I represent, and see for himself just how people are hurting. In conclusion, I know that Labor does not oppose the legislation as such-in fact, it supports the underlying principles of this charter of budget honesty-but, as many speakers on this side have alluded to, it is concerned about the fairness and effectiveness of several of the provisions in this bill. While the government is perhaps best described as being underwhelmed by our suggestions that the bill be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the opposition is fully supportive of the motion of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) that the matter be referred to the JCPA for early report. I know that, following the conclusion of the second reading debate, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will be putting this motion to the House on the basis that the JCPA is in fact the committee best equipped to assess and analyse the efficacy of this legislation and the need for certain components of it to be amended. The opposition supports the deputy leader's intent to refer this motion for more detailed consideration to the JCPA. On that on basis I urge the House to consider the deputy leader's motion when it is moved and give its full support to that amended motion.",91
150,Mrs BAILEY,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I rise this evening in support of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996. This bill is about one thing: honesty. It is about honesty in government. As Thomas Jefferson stated way back in 1774, 'the whole art of government consists in the art of being honest.' Before the last election, the coalition vowed to the people of Australia that it would introduce a statutory charter of budget honesty to ensure that at all times governments could be held accountable for their fiscal and economic policies. This legislation fulfils that election commitment in full. The charter of budget honesty will require the government to commit itself to responsible and accountable fiscal policy. It will require the government of the day to publish a budget update signed off by the heads of Treasury and the Department of Finance at the beginning of each federal election campaign to ensure that the Australian community knows the nation's true fiscal position. Under the legislation, the government will be required to present a fiscal strategy statement every year to outline its budget objectives and the key measures of government policy. Economic and fiscal outlook reports will be produced to judge outcomes against objectives and will contain information on tax expenditures as well as a statement of risk that may have had an effect on the financial state of the nation. Even though the charter of budget honesty has not yet been enacted, the Howard government has already begun reporting in line with the principles of accountability contained within the charter of budget honesty. Last week the Treasurer (Mr Costello) released the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook as in accordance with the charter. The charter also enables the Prime Minister and the opposition leader to request that the costings of their announced policies at election time be prepared by Treasury and Finance. This will enable Australians to be better informed about the financial implications of each of the major party's election promises when they vote at elections. Apart from making governments more accountable and honest, one of the best aspects of the charter of budget honesty is that it comes at no cost to taxpayers. This is a bill for all Australians. It is part of coali tion government's desire to restore trust and faith in the political process-trust that Labor shattered during its 13-year reign of destruction: 13 years of deceit, 13 years of mismanagement, 13 years of dishonesty. Noone will ever forget the statements of the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he was Deputy Prime Minister and finance minister in January last year when he said: ... we believe that we have both a surplus now and we expect that surplus to improve as our figures indicated over the next three to four years What a load of bunkum that was. A similar statement was made by the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who, when the 199596 budget was delivered, said in regard to the budget being in surplus to the end of the century: We will be in surplus for the rest of the 1990s. Labor deliberately misled the Australian public prior to the last election and treated the Australian public with complete disdain. It continually affirmed that the budget was in surplus even when it knew the situation was much, much worse. Labor's 1995-96 budget estimates implied an underlying deficit of $590 million for 1996-97 and an underlying surplus of $2.7 million for the following year. These forecasts were continually affirmed and reaffirmed by Labor during the election campaign. When the coalition came to government and was handed the true figures from Treasury, they showed underlying deficit estimates for the two years to be $7.6 billion and $7.3 billion respectively-one heck of a difference. At the end of the 1995-96 financial year, the deficit had swelled to $10.3 billion. As Treasurer Costello said in his budget speech, 'financial dishonesty of that magnitude undermines public confidence in our political system'. That situation should never have been allowed to happen. The Labor government should have made this revised figure available to the public before the election. But there was no legislation such as the charter of budget honesty in place to enforce such a move. Instead, Labor surreptibill tiously concealed its overspending and tried the to con its way back into power by deceiving Australian voters and denying them vital information about the state of their economy. The government of the day needs to be always conscious of the fact that the money it has is not its own. There is no money tree growing in the gardens of Parliament House or an endless supply from the Reserve Bank. Its only source of funds is money it taxes or borrows from the people they represent. That is why it is the right of every Australian to be given a true and honest picture of the government's finances and not some glossed over figures which make government look good. This charter of budget honesty wi!1 ensure for all time that Labor's deception will never again be allowed to happen. Never again will a government be able to hide its true financial position from the people. When Paul Keating became Prime Minister, he made two important pledges: one, to listen to the Australian people-we know that he did not fulfil that one-and, two, to act honestly. He told a press conference in December 1991: The second is to deal honestly with the people, to tell them the truth. In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much as is humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with them ... and realistically, and I'll listen accordingly. He got away with breaking every single one of those promises because there was no such thing as a charter of budget honesty. Those pledges were all quickly forgotten. Remember the I-a-w tax cuts, which they promised and then cynically reneged on straight after the 1993 election; the promise not to sell any more of the Commonwealth Bank, which was promptly dismissed; the promise to cut company tax-they reversed that pledge; and the promise to build a national museum, which also was abandoned after the 1993 election? The list goes on and on-a legacy of deception and dishonesty which culminated in the massive budget cover-up before the last election. No wonder a growing number of Australians have lost respect for the political process. A Morgan poll published in the Bulletin in September 1995, during the dying months of the Keating administration, is a stark reminder of how much damage Labor did to the perceptions Australians have of their politicians and their government. In this poll, 84 per cent of respondents agreed that federal politicians lie at election time to win votes, and 56 per cent agreed that they had lost faith in the political system. A national lifestyle poll published in the Bulletin in January this year revealed that 17 per cent of people said their main wish for Australia was that politicians worked for the good of the nation rather than themselves. Through the charter of budget honesty, this government hopes to address this perception and take the first steps towards restoring some of that lost faith in the political system and politicians. This move has been openly applauded by people in my electorate of MCEwen, just as it has been by analysts, businesses and individuals right across Australia. The Canberra Times described the charter as commendable and stated it would 'certainly provide a more certain base for voters to judge the performance of governments'. The Adelaide Advertiser said it was 'a step forward to the electoral economic integrity'. Vince FitzGerald in the Australian said that it was a 'very valuable improvement to the government framework'. The West Australian said the charter would help reassure Australian voters that 'the shabby tactics of the last election will not be repeated'. But the general feeling of the majority of people I have spoken to about the charter is best summed up in the Herald-Sun by associate finance editor Terry MCCrann in an article published the day after the federal budget was delivered. MCCrann states: This is the Budget we had to have-and selfevidently never got and would never have got from the previous occupant of the Lodge. It is fair, it is responsible-it sets out to fix a huge and extremely dangerous fiscal time bomb, which if it ever exploded would hurt worse those very people attacking the cuts. Most importantly, it is an honest Budgetarguably, the only honest Budget in living memory. It is honest, very importantly, on two key levels. The figures themselves tell the truth. You do not have to wend your way through the fine print and end up on page 3963 to find out what the real deficit is. Last year, Ralph ... Willis told us the Budget would be in surplus to the tune of $718 million. The fine print-and it really was smaller printtold us it was actually $8232 million in the red. This year"" the real deficit is right there upfront at $5649 million. No smoke, no mirrors, no fine print and fiscal ""adjustments"" which are straight out lies. He continues: The Budget is also honest in a more basic political sense, by initiating the ""Charter of Budget Honesty"". This will require the government to keep telling the fiscal truth-and importantly, the truth about the state of the economy as well, as best the mandarins in Canberra can guesstimate it, of course. There are a number of elements to the Charter, the most significant of which will be the pre-election Economic and Budget Outlook. Crucially, this will be done by Treasury and Finance independent of the government of the day and will prevent phony forecasts being cooked up in the Treasurer's office as was done with the infamous One Nation fraud of February 1992. This report will have to be released within 10 days of the calling of the election, and will prevent (hopefully) an incumbent government lying its way through an election campaign as the Keating government did in both 1996 and 1993. In a democratic society such as we have in Australia, we cannot take people for granted or treat them as an afterthought. We as the elected representatives of Australian voters exist for the people. We are entrusted with public power and must be made accountable to those we represent. As John F. Kennedy said during a message to the US Congress in 1961: The basis of effective government is public confidence and that confidence is endangered when ethical standards falter or appear to falter. When then Prime Minister Keating and then Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Beazley stood up before the last election, looked the Australian people in the eye and told them the nation's finances were okay, when the truth was some $10 billion to the contrary, they destroyed the trust and confidence of a nation. Through this bill, the Howard government is beginning to rebuild that confidence and trust. The coalition is telling the people of Australia that it and future governments will have to be honest about the state of the books. It will continually update the people of Australia on its financial state and provide them with an independent economic and fiscal report within 10 days of an election being announced. No doubt this level of honesty scares the opposition witless. It has relied-the proof is there-on deception. I doubt very much if it knows how to be financially and economically honest with the Australian people. No doubt the opposition has something to fear from being open with the public and may-as many members have--cast aspersions on this bill, just as in the past it opposed proposals to ensure truth in political advertising. People respect honesty and, as voters, should be given correct financial information from their government at all times, regardless of whether that information is good, bad or otherwise. The Howard government recognises this responsibility and has already acted on it, as we have seen with the mid-year report. This historic legislation has been welcomed by all circles of Australian society as a positive step towards economic integrity. How refreshing it will be for government to tell the Australian people the truth, to tell how it really is. I commend this bill to the House.",92
151,Mr HATTON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I am somewhat bemused by the tack taken by the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) and a number of coalition speakers on this charter of budget honesty. I am bemused and also somewhat shocked because, if I read it right, the implication of what is being said is that the current Prime Minister, John Howard, is being criticised by the member for MCEwen and by other members of the coalition, who are criticising Labor prior to the 1996 election. If the heavy-handed criticisms they made of 1996 were true, then logically they would equally be true of the 1983 election. Logically, John Howard, as the then Treasurer, would be in exactly the same position as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) prior to the 1996 election. In condemning Labor in 1996, out of their own mouths-by implication-they would be condemning their own Prime Minister for his actions when he was Treasurer in 1982-83. That shocks me, but possibly the members who have been speaking in that vein have either been naive in not realising they might have been doing that to their Prime Minister or, alternatively, they just do not have a long enough memory and knowledge of the past to make the comparison. One would think that a great deal of comparison is lacking here. If you look at this piece of legislation, the manner in which it has been introduced, its context-the triumphalist heralding of this legislation as virtually unique and sui generis-you would think that since Magna Carta there had never been another piece of legislation introduced into any parliament, let alone the Australian parliament, that had its force and uniqueness. The reality is that with this piece of legislation we are looking at pygmies standing on the shoulders of giants. The member for Gellibrand, in his contribution to discussion on this charter, ran through a whole series of actions that the previous Labor government had taken in fiscal reporting and financial accountability. Prior to 1983, throughout the history of the Commonwealth from 1901, there had been very little budget reporting that was deep in substance, in content or extent. Throughout our 13 years, as the member for Gellibrand pointed out, a series of measures were taken by former Treasurer Paul Keating and then by himself as Treasurer to introduce far greater accountability and much better reporting. So we have a l3-year period in which that was done and in which there was a sea change in Treasury's presentation of what the actual state of the budget was and what the accounts were not only at budget time but also at the introduction of the mid-year review. We also had out year forecasts for the next three years-something that had not been attempted previously and that, when John Howard was Treasurer, he utterly refused to bring into place. With our record in mind, I would have thought that when you introduced a charter of budget honesty there may have been a bit more sensible, rational and down-to-earth approach in regard to the bill. In terms of the name itself, it is not a bill to give greater accountability in reporting from Treasury or from the government-it is not something as laid back as that-but rather a charter in line with Magna Carta and of budget honesty. There is the potential implication that not only previous governments-previous treasurers-but also previous public servants, who had served in Treasury and Finance, had not he en honest before when they put those papers together. I think that really was not intended but it is part of the implication of this, of presenting it in an overblown and overdone manner, which directly links in with the way the current Treasurer (Mr Costello) does a number of things. A moderate, sensible, rational presentation that the legislation was a further, albeit small, step towards improving the quality and scope of information provided by the government to the Australian electorate would have been welcome. We welcome that on this side of the House, as we do in general, in principle, in supporting the core of what this legislation is about. Equally, a balanced introduction of this legislation, which took full and appropriate note of the previous Labor government's major and significant innovations in reportage on the state of the budget, would also have been reasonable and directly supported by us. But this has not happened. Instead, the legislation has been presented by the coalition as if it were entirely unique and that throughout the 13 years of the previous Labor government we had taken no steps to improve the reportage of the budget accounts and general fiscal reporting. As I have alluded to, the member for Gellibrand fully covered our record in that regard. It is a proud and significant record that all the members on this side can take note of and forcefully defend, as most of the members who have spoken prior to me have done. It is important that we put this piece of legislation in a broader context. My friend the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) had a slightly different context from the one I would put it in. He argued that the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was trying to lay the ghost of years past because, in his situation as Treasurer, when he brought in a $9.6 billion deficit, it was a headline deficit, not an underlying structural budget deficit which, in today's dollars, would be about $25 billion. He knows that his record was not good. During the election campaign he plucked a figure out of the air and indicated that the deficit was much less than that. The member for Corio challenged him to come up with a charter of electoral honesty-to which, I might add, we could add a charter of political honesty as well. We could deal with all three of them not only as to what happens just prior to an election but also what happens when you bring a budget down in this place, as happened last August. I will come to that in a moment. I want to make some comments on what happened prior to the election in March 1996 and the point and purpose of the attack that the coalition then made as an opposition. The first three weeks of the campaign were almost totally dominated by the situation of the budget. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is a reply to the question that they initiated and pursued with the media. We had a feeding frenzy concentrating on that question, despite the fact that there had been a mid-year review brought down in December 1995 by the member for Gellibrand and that when the election was called on 29 January the great charge from the coalition was that they needed to know all of the facts, have it up and open and bring those projections forward. One of the arguments that was then used, quite simply and directly, was that you only know the state of the budget fully when you get to do the actual budget preparation because the underlying motifs that will give you the eventual budget outcome change over time. A one-quarter of a per cent change in the rate of growth-and that can happen in a six-month period or a three-month perioddramatically changes whether the budget is in surplus or deficit. Also the point was made that we were talking about a budget surplus, we were talking about the headline budget. In the papers that were alluded to by the member for MCEwen she pointed out, quite rightly in terms of the mid-year review, in the small print, what the underlying structural budget deficit-that the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, had pointed out-was. He did so in a time honoured practice. Budget after budget, from Federation on, the concentration was on what the real deficit was, not the underlying structural budget deficit. But the demand from the coalition was to know that. We saw Treasurer Costello, in the last budget, introduce a complete flip in terms of the information provided to the public. We had-and the member for MCEwen thought this was a great innovation-the underlying budget deficit, structural budget deficit, in large letters laid out before the public, almost like neon signs running through it to point to how bad Labor had been. You needed the best of the world's magnifying glasses to find the real deficit hidden away and locked uptake out search parties and you might eventually get there. What was done between the previous Labor government's budget and this first coalition government budget was to change the rules and change the way in which the budget deficit was presented. One might question whether that was totally honest. One might question whether or not there should have been a great disclaimer, but the whole way of working that out had been changed. The underlying deficit had been pushed up into first place. Instead we had three weeks during the election of bleating and carping on that non-issue at the time and the coalition elevated that into a central place in their election process. This served a very important purpose: it distracted media attention, and therefore the attention of the electorate, from their own almost daily roll-out of policy papers, which we had been waiting three years to see. It was a device to avoid scrutiny of their intentions and actions on substantive policy questions. That was a very important device for the coalition. They did very well. They rolled out their policy materials but they did not provide the media covering the election with copies of those materials until after the questioning had taken place and we swept onto yet another area of policy. So my guess is that, in part, this charter of budget honest is not only a response to their electioneering prior to the last election but also it is a weapon that they intend to use to have the full focus of the media and the electorate on the underlying fiscal situation and not on what they have actually done in the budget process. This year in the budget process we saw a completely dishonest approach to how the budget papers were presented. I could not find one person in this place who was not involved with their preparation, whether it be a researcher, journalist or member of the House, who could actually find any real and substantial information on what those budget papers held for the electorate at large.",95
152,Unknown,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,98
153,Mr HATTON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Prior to the break I was outlining the situation in regard to the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. I made the point that a number of members of the coalition have made unwitting and certainly unsolicited implied attacks on the record of the member for Bennelong as Treasurer, because if Labor was to be condemned for its presentation of matters prior to 1996-and many members of the coalition have argued that-then equally it would be true on the same grounds that there would be an even greater condemnation of the member for Bennelong when he was Treasurer in 1982-83. I had g(ll to the point of speaking about the last budget, the first coalition budget for 13 years. The contrast is very marked in terms of the approach of the charter of budget honesty and the desire to have open, transparent and honest budget figurings given to the public at large and 'he actual manner in which the Treasurer. the member for Higgins, presented the budget measures in his papers last August. Those budget papers were not transparent; in fact, they were amongst the least transparent and most opaque documents ever presented in this parliament. The budget papers and the associated materials produced by various .ninisters' officers were intentionally opaque. To find the actual savings measures was almost impossible for anyone in this House, or for people in the Parliament Library, who are experts in these matters, or for the media at large in attempting to comment on it. The actual budget savings measures were not presented in an up-front, direct, open, honest and transparent manner, but they were buried in the detail. The reason for that was not difficult to work out. There was a political intent to make it as difficult as possible for the Australian electorate to see exactly what was being done in this first coalition budget. We now know that the message is getting through, but the intent was clear at the time. If the media did not report the full range of those savings measures-because they had been buried so deeply-if they were not able to communicate to the public at large the extent and scope of those measures, then the impact of them would be directly on an individual basis as people came across the cuts in the dental program, or the difficulties they would have in the child-care area, or problems they had with Medicare or any of the other savings measures that they had put into place. By presenting this in a fragmented way that was difficult to put together, that made it difficult for people to find the information, that deliberate attempt to obscure and to obfuscate in the actual budget papers themselves-not just the report on how far they had got-underlines the fact that there was a political intent to save the pain that would have been occasioned if all of those measures had been openly, honestly and transparently presented to the electorate in the full budget papers and their presentation. I suspect that the charter of budget honesty will be used as a smokescreen to fudge and distort and to obscure what the situation is with coalition policy, coalition practice and the effects of coalition policies on the electorate at large. If prior to the 1996 election the coalition used the tactic of demanding to know what the underlying structural budget deficit was and made that the key point of their attack, with the charter of budget honesty it is likely that they will present this as the window-dressing and fairy floss to the electorate at large to beat their chest about how open, honest and transparent they have been while in actuality burying their measures as deeply as they can to keep them beyond scrutiny. It is important to note here that in his speech to the House, the member for Curtin, Mr Rocher, made a number of very balanced and fundamental points about the strengths of this legislation and the problems that could arise if it is not put into place properly. He quoted the Treasury in regard to the issue of responsible fiscal reporting, and I quote that again. Treasury pointed out: The adoption of such legislation will not in itself lead to responsible fiscal policy, since responsibility, whether in fiscal or other matters, cannot be legislated into existence. The honourable member for Curtin went on to point out that that applied to both honesty and accuracy as well. He argued that that came to the very core and crux of the debate on this charter of budget honesty, for he said this: It is no good for this or any other government to introduce this piece of legislation and think that its commitment to responsible government in general and open and transparent fiscal reporting in particular stops there. The bill does represent a step forward towards a more disciplined, accountable and relevant government. But there is no room for complacency when it comes to getting our fiscal affairs in order. In its present form, the charter of budget honesty will bring about meaningful changes only if both houses of parliament and the general public remain alert to the very real possibility that the stated objectives are not honoured in the breach by this and future governments. If this piece of legislation is not to be mere tlummery and window-dressing and a distraction to the core issues of what this coalition government does and how it affects the Australian electorate at large, then it is wise to join with the honourable member for Curtin and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) in arguing that this legislation should be put to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and I recommend that course of action.

154,Mr LINDSAY,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"The member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton) in his speech said that his government had a proud and significant record which he can defend, but that proud and significant record did not end up being defended prior to the previous election. I do not believe that the Australian Labor Party was honest with the Australian people at the election. Something that I get very angry about is in the compile of TV clips that I have of the run-up to the last election. It is that very famous clip of the previous Prime Minister in one of the debates on the Channel 9 network where, in response to a question, he simply looked the television camera directly in the eye and said, 'The budget is in surplus.' Well, it was not. That is one of the reasons we are seeing this legislation presented to the House of Representatives tonight. For 11 years before joining this parliament I was a member of the Townsville City Council and, certainly, we had open and honest accountability in budgetary matters. No-one ever thought that the council would mislead its ratepayers. The council was required by the Local Government Act not to have a budget that was in deficit and to always have a budget that was in surplus; so in that way, I guess, the council was certainly very accountable to its ratepayers. This evening, in speaking brietly on this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, I would like to take a trip down memory lane. I would like to firstly go back to 11 May 1995 when, in response to the last of the Keating government's budgets, the then opposition leader-the now Prime Minister, John Howard-said the following: The real fiscal outcome of the 1995 budget is not the surplus of $770 million talked about by the Prime Minister. The real fiscal outcome . . . is actually a deficit of $8.2 billion. Following interjections from the ALP, the honourable member for Bennelong continued: This is why, when we come to Government after the next election, we will introduce a charter of budget honesty which will not allow this to happen again. And it will not. To which the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, responded: You! You-honesty! I doubt whether the former Prime Minister would be laughing now. Going forward about 10 months from then: just a month out from the 1996 federal election, an article appeared in the Townsville Bulletin. The article, which was written by Terry O'Connor and had been picked up off AAP, read in part: With Labor campaign pledges made in this election to date now totalling about $800 million a year of additional unfunded spending, Mr Keating continues to deflect the 'where's the money coming from' questions by insisting the Government has some spare cash to play with. Gosh, what a result when we came into government: there was not any spare cash to play with, which we are all aware of now. It went on: He insists the Budget is in surplus by $115 million, and that all commitments will be fully funded. Hardly anyone, in the financial markets, the media or politics, believes him. And they had every right with the benefit of hindsight. From the fact that Labor now has only two members of parliament from Queensland in the ranks opposite, it would seem that a very large proportion of voting Queenslanders did not believe the former Prime Minister either. Only days after the March election, the new coalition government discovered the extent of the Keating government's deceit and financial dishonesty. I remember, back then, smiling to myself at the following comments from an article run in the Australian on 13 March. The second paragraph read: Mr Beazley, who is set to become the Leader of the Opposition after claiming victory in the seat of Brand yesterday, said he did not know of the figures showing an $8 billion blow-out in the 199697 Budget until yesterday. Gosh! Had the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) listened a little more carefully to the warnings of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) back in May 1995, he would not have had to feign surprise when the real state of the nation's finances were revealed after the election. Going on then to budget day 1996, we have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announcing that the coalition government will enact a charter of budget honesty requiring the g(vernment of the day to publish a budget update at the start of each federal election campaign. The Treasurer said the following in delivering the budget: Financial dishonesty of that magnitude undermines public confidence in our political system. We will ensure it never occurs again. The public will be given updated financial information before the election, not after it. The public will know the state of the books before they vote. To come back to the present: we have already had an extensi ve debate in taking the first steps towards fulfilling the commitment the Prime Minister gave back in opposition in 1995. I think there will be a genuine collective sigh of relief from the Australian public when the charter of budget honesty is in this place. If you go back through the thousands of media articles written about election promises, from all sides of politics, you inevitably get a large number of stories questioning the validity of those commitments. When you go out campaigning, that feeling can also be prevalent at other levels of government. Not everyone is like that of course, and one's level of cynicism also depends on one's political bent as well. I am sure all members of this parliament are aware of those opinion polls which crop up from time to time rating the trustworthiness of politicians only slightly higher than that of journalists and used-car salesmen. It is my personal view that the charter of budget honesty will help tum around that underlying cynicism. Last week's mid-year economic review was a welcome step towards returning a new level of credibility to politics. That particular document, which I read from front to back, outlines in clear terms exactly the government's budgetary position. Nothing is hidden; nothing is opaque. It is there crystal clear for everyone to see. The Treasurer opened the books for all and sundry to see. While I do not pretend to suggest that the figures were wonderful, the process-the opening of the financial books to public scrutiny-was itself a success. This was reflected in more than just a few media reports; no more so than from the Australian's Alan Wood, who wrote: Credit where credit is due; yesterday's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook is a big step towards honest budgets and sound fiscal policy. It demonstrates the real value of the Howard Government's Charter of Budget Honesty. Professor Judith Sloan also recently wrote in the Australian: The bottom line is that it is much easier to blow the Budget position than to repair it. Paul Keating's actions as treasurer and then Prime Minister clearly demonstrated this. Constituencies for particular types and amounts of government expenditure very quickly build up and the political pressure that these constituencies can exert is considerable. The Charter of Budget Honesty is a very welcome development in exposing these processes to greater public scrutiny and to prevent governments spending in unaccountable ways. I quote again from Glenn Milne, who just the other day wrote: What must not be forgotten here is that it was an entirely discretionary decision on Costello's part to reveal the company tax shortfall. He did so out of a determination to honour the Government's new Charter of Budget Honesty. And congratulations to the Treasurer for that. To continue: In previous years however, the mistake would have been glossed over in the mid-year review, then fixed during the Expenditure Review Committee process, finally appearing as an unremarkable line item in the Budget documents. In reference to comments last week made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) about the penalties for failing to abide by the requirements set out in this bill, I do believe he said there were none. Surely, if this government-or any other government, for that matter-fails in any of the requirements of the charter of budget honesty, it will be the Australian people who will exact the ultimate penalty. After listening to the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), it is clear that he has not learnt the lesson from 2 March. In this respect, I would like to draw the House's attention to the claim by the Leader of the Opposition that the ALP made spectacular advances in fiscal transparency and budgetary honesty-and they were repeated in the previous speech by the member for Blaxland. For the benefit of the deputy opposition leader, I will refer once again to the sort of media commentary about the budgetary honesty of the former Labor government prior to the last election: Hethat is, the former Prime Ministerinsists the Budget is in surplus by $115 million, and that all commitments will be fully funded. Hardly anyone, in the financial markets, the media or politics, believes him. As I said before, those comments came from Terry O'Connor and were published less than a month prior to the March 1996 election. I recall, as all members on this side of the House would, that the then Prime Minister persisted with those claims of a budget surplus right up to the day of the election. Of course, we all remember that on the day after the election Treasury handed the incoming government the actual facts. They were available for Mr Keating to have used and he chose not to. lf the member for Holt is so squeaky-clean on fiscal transparency and budget honesty, as he now professes, why did he or any other member of the opposition benches not stand up to the former Prime Minister, come clean and tell the truth to the Australian people? Clearly, the great last-ditch attempted ALP con of the Australia public is still alive and well in the mind of the member for Holt. To conclude, the charter of budget honesty is a great step, despite what the member for Holt may think, towards political, economic and electoral honesty. As the member for Herbert in Townsville, I certainly back the government's decision to bring this bill to the House, and I believe that it is going to be a turning point in terms of honesty in the political process and landscape in this country. The Australian people will never again be subjected to the type of deception that the ALP tried to pull in the run-up to the last election. Those pictures in the television debate prior to the last election will remain vivid in my mind: 'The budget is in surplus.' It was not. I commend the bill to the House.",99
155,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Watson) (8.18 p.m.)Obviously, the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) has a short memory, or he would remember that his Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when he was Treasurer of this country, conned the people in the run-up to an election. Malcolm Fraser, when he was the Prime Minister of this country, offered that notorious fistful of dollars that people were going to get and never got. It is hard to think of a greater contradiction than the current government coming into this House and suggesting that they are going to have a charter of budget honesty when they have been so patently dishonest in their activities since coming to office. The government says that it is seeking to put in place a legislative framework for the conduct and reporting of fiscal policy. We have already suggested that this legislation be looked at more closely by referring it to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. That committee is the parliament's committee with expertise in financial matters, and what better organisation to scrutinise this piece of legislation than the Joint Committee of Public Accounts? Indeed, if the bill were referred to that committee, we might get a bill that would work better for the parliament and the people, and we might get a piece of legislation that actually does provide for some budget honesty. If the government wanted to have legislation that really delivers what it says, it would ensure that the Public Accounts Committee looked at the bill before it became law. By avoiding this process, the government is only reinforcing the view that it is not fair dinkum on the issue, because one wonders why the government will not let the Public Accounts Committee consider the bill and report back to the House before the bill becomes law. Numerous pieces of legislation are referred to the various parliamentary committees for consideration. I have no doubt that, when this bill gets to the Senate, the Senate may consider sending it off to a committee of theirs. So we find the government in this House saying, 'We want to have budget honesty, but we are .not goi-g to be honest enough to let the parliament Sit down in a bipartisan fashion to have a look at this legislation.' The reason for that is that in the budget the government broke $17 billion worth of promises which they had offered the people in the last election. At the same time that the government is putting this legislation into the House of Representatives, government members on the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters are saying that the government should introduce legislation that provides for honesty in election promises. Of course, the government is --t going to look at that-you can bet your life-because we know that what the Prime Minister did with most of the promises he made before the election was forget about them or make them non-core promises or give that reason or some other reason for not keeping them. We have had $17 billion worth of election promises that they have dishonestly put aside since the election. In the budget the government broke $17 billion worth of election promises, without justification or shame. These were promises about which the Prime Minister put his hand on his heart during the last election and said, 'Trust us. Trust us.' Ask all those people who lost their jobs. Mr O'Connor-Honest John.",101
156,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Honest John. Sometimes Honest John is what he is found to be today. Trust him when he can remember. That seems to be about the extent of honesty we get from this government. Ask the people in Canberra who lost their jobs when the government promised them that there would be no cuts to the public sector. Ask the people whom the coalition promised that there would be no work for the dole scheme-and today we had the Prime Minister announcing a work for the dole scheme as a smokescreen because of the other problems he has. And he says, 'Well, that press release was not issued by me.' So it is not a promise! The fact that it was issued on behalf of the coalition in the run-up to the election campaign does not matter. Now it would seem that we have a new standard on what we have to do for a government promise. It has to be on a sheet of paper that has the Prime Minister's photo and signature on it and that has testimonials from four or five different lawyers that he was of sound mind and body when he made this decision and he will remember it later on. That seems to be the test now. Then they come in here and talk about how they are going to come up with a charter of budget honesty. These people would not know it if they saw it. How hypocritical is it when a government that professes it is for the family introduces what they call their family tax initiative package which gives money to families who earn very high salaries and takes it away from those who do not? I recall quoting in here one night the explanatory memorandum for the family tax package. That was in the budget and that is supposed to be about budget honesty. In the election campaign the Prime Minister said that they were going to look after battling Australian families. One of the items in the explanatory memorandum talks about Jack or Jane who has two kids and earns about $70,000 a year, and the government is going to look after them. When you look at the small print, we find out that that is if Jack or Jane have only one income. Jack or Jane who stays home could be getting some money from a trust that Daddy has set up or could own a block of flats and be getting some rent. We will not count that; they will still get the family tax package money. But a couple of battlers out in the western suburbs of Sydney or in a seat like mine in south-western Sydney who might only be earning $17,000 each, and both have to go to work because they are only earning $17,000, will not make as much as Jack or Jane on $68,000 with a little bit of money coming in from rent or Daddy. This is the government that said it was going to look after families. It is going to look after North Shore families and it is going to soak the families who live out in the western suburbs and in electorates like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis. But this is the charter of budget honesty. As I said, these people would not know what budget honesty was if it looked them in the face. There are people who will, if they are lucky, get $25 out of the family tax initiative. That will not go far for a low income family when they see that that $25 is swallowed up in new taxes that the government has instituted. The Prime Minister said that we would not have any new taxes. But we are going to have new taxes, and that was in the budget that was supposed to be so honest. The $25 will not cover the extra costs associated with migrants having to pay more for English language programs. They were told before the election that the Liberal Party would never do that, but they did. The fact that people might get $25 out of the family tax initiative is just a joke. It is a joke for those people who are on low incomes, and the government has the hide to say that they want to have a charter of budget honesty. When we talk about how honest these people are, before the election the government said they were not going to do anything about the ABC. They said they would not touch the ABC. Nowadays you probably cannot touch the ABC because there is not much left of it at all. Indeed, the government slashed funding to the ABC. We saw in that honest cabinet submission that Senator Alston did not know where it came from. All of a sudden it appeared on his desk. It had his name on it, but it appeared on his desk. He did not know where it came from. It suggested that if we do these things the Liberal Party and the National Party could get control of the ABC to make it do what they wanted. Senator Alston, when he was asked about this cabinet submission that had his name on it, said 'Well, haven't heard of that.' So much for budget honesty. So much for honesty in government. The coalition said that they had no plans whatsoever to change the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres. That is another promise broken by the government in the budget. So much for budget honesty, a charter for budget honesty. It is like giving Ned Kelly the seal of family approval. Good old Ned. He only robbed you, but at least Ned stood in front of you and told you that he was going to rob you. These people are busy robbing you and telling you that they need a charter of budget honesty to prove to you that they are really honest. It is just disgraceful. We have heard talk in the last few days about the government introducing a 15 per cent superannuation surcharge when they were going to have no new taxes. We do not have taxes any more. Because we are honest, we have a charter of budget honesty if you are in this government. So you do not have new taxes; you have surcharges. You do not have new taxes because you have a charter of budget honesty; you have new fees. For example, there is a $26,000 up-front fee for people to get into a nursing home. Mr O'Connor-Just a tax. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-It is not. The parliamentary secretary cannot be right. It is not. This is a government of honesty and probity. This is a government that has its own charter of budget honesty. It would be like their saying to Ned Kelly, 'Well, they hanged you because you're a thief, but we're now going to pass a bill to say you really weren't a thief; you were just a bloke who was out there looking for a bit of budget honesty.' The people who thought they were going to be able to get into a nursing home are now going to have to pay $26,000. That is not a tax, and that is what this government caIls budget honesty. Another promise that did not eventuate was the promise to increase funding for students with disabilities. You could not get a worse bunch of people who would make a promise to sick kids and then renege on that. But this is the government of budget honesty, and they did. They offered $16 million over three years for students with disabilities and it never happened. They even put a surcharge of one per cent on their rich mates for the Medicare levy. They told them there were not going to be any new taxes, but they are an honest government. They have their budget honesty charter and it is only a surcharge. We have surcharges, we have up-front fees, we have everything except taxes. They promised we would not have any new taxes, but it just so happens that people are finding that they are paying a lot more under this government than they were. But they have got their little charter of budget honesty, so they can hold their hands on their hearts and say 'Look, we're fair dinkum.' After less than 13 months in office-we were in office for 13 years-and after all the fanfare, all the broken promises, all the excuses after the election about why they had to slash and bum the public sector, which they tried to blame on the Labor Party, we find that they have got their own $2.9 billion budget black hole. It is all their own work. It has all been done by Treasurer Costello. He did not do that, did he? He says that the poor old tax commissioner dudded him; the tax commissioner never gave him the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It is all his own work. He was too stupid to ask the tax commissioner what the tax office thought business might do with their projections. One could say that he might have been too dishonest to ask because he knew that, if he did ask the tax commissioner what he thought business would do when the government changed the tax arrangements, he would say that business would try to make the best out of it for themselves. What happened is that they said that there was a $1.6 billion tax error. It is not a mistake. The Treasurer has not mucked up. It is just a $1.6 billion error. That all went into his own happy $2.9 billion black hole. The government has made it clear that they have no strategies on how they ought to do these things. The Costello black hole clearly shows the government's incompetence in handling the Commonwealth's finances. The government has an abysmal track record, compared to the previous Labor government. All they can do is try to legislate and say, 'If we put these slogans up about having a charter of budget honesty, then somehow people will forgive us.' Of course the people will not. The people know that Labor had a very good record of budgetary reform and fiscal disclosure. We probably had the best record of any Commonwealth government in this regard. While we were in government we introduced more open and transparent budget processes. This bill is only building on the things that we did. There is nothing original or new in this piece of legislation. We introduced three-year forward estimates of outlays and revenue and financial impact statements with all the explanatory material that went with any new piece of legislation. We also introduced a mid-year review. We introduced a comprehensive report on specific payments to the states, but the government has omitted this from Budget Paper No.3, showing less rather than more transparency and causing the states great difficulty in preparing their own budgets. The charter of budget honesty seeks to put in place a legislative framework for the conduct and reporting of fiscal policy, but the trouble is that it is all a bit of a smokescreen for the governmentjust like their work for the dole scheme that they announced today. They got themselves into a bit of trouble so we have to have a smokescreen. The opposition will vote for the bill. We will support it because we think it can add something. But we also say that, if the government were halfway decent and was not full of hypocrisy and cant, the parliamentary secretary, when responding on behalf of the government on this bill, would say, 'We can understand the point that the opposition is making. We think this ought to go to the Public Accounts Committee for consideration.' That is where it ought to go. If it went to the Public Accounts Committee for consideration and report back to the parliament, we would get a better bill. That is probably not what the government is really interested in. All it is interested in is short-term fixes, finding ways to try and denigrate their predecessor and wrapping itself up in things that it really had nothing to do with. It does not matter how many budget honesty points of view the government wants to put forward and how many charters of this or that the government wants to put forward; the fact is that in less than 12 months this government has blown out the federal budget to the tune of $2.9 billion. And it has all been Treasurer Costello's work. This is the fellow who stood up here and crowed about how he was going to solve the problems of the country and save us all from everything except chickenpox. If this is how he does it, then they really ought to pass that piece of legislation about Ned Kellyresurrect him, make him the Treasurer of Australia and he might be able to do a better job than Treasurer Costello has. As I said at the beginning of my speech, when Ned Kelly was into sticking you up he told you. This Treasurer is into sticking you up, robbing you blind and trying to make out that somehow or other this is all transparent and terrific. The opposition says to the government: send the bill off to the Public Accounts Committee, allow the Public Accounts Committee to come up with a better bill and adopt the amendments that we have suggested and you will actually get something that is more workable, something that is more honest, something that is more transparent and something that is better for the Australian parliament and the Australian people.",102
157,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Thank you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr Bruce Scott-This will be a good contribution.",105
158,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Undoubtedly. I thank the House and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his confidence. The longer I am in this place, the more I appreciate that the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) has no shame. He came into this place and spoke in the way he always does. If one listened to him carefully, one could have almost forgotten that he is a member of a party which when in government told us, prior to the last election, the budget was in surplus. When we were elected to office we found out the week after the election that, far from the budget being in surplus, there was indeed a deficit of some $10 billion. I would expect the honourable member for Watson to come in here wearing sackcloth and ashesMr O'Connor-What about Labor in 1983? Mr Leo MCLeay-You picked up $3 billion all on your own.",105
159,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,I would expect that the honourable member for Watson and the honourable member at the table,105
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Mr Hollis)Order! If the honourable member for Fisher directed his comments through the chair, he might avert the need for interjection. I would ask for there to be no injections and the honourable member for Fisher to direct his comments through the chair and ignore the interjections.",105
161,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very happy, as always, to accept your guidance and to direct my comments through the chair. In doing so, I would like to point out that the honourable member for Watson and the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) really ought to come in here wearing sackcloth and ashes and apologise for the financial situation which 13 years of Labor government wreaked upon this nation. On II December the Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), introduced into the House a bill to enact a charter of budget honesty into legislation. Once this charter becomes part of the law of Australia it will ensure that never again will any government be able to arrive at an election campaign and claim, as did our predecessor, that the budget was in surplus when in fact it was in deficit. The charter of budget honesty will require a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report by the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance which will provide projections for the current budget year and the three following years, together with economic and other assumptions on which they arc based. The charter of budget honesty will also provide evenhanded costing of government and opposition election proposals. It will require a mid-year review incorporating projections of fiscal outcomes for the budget year and the three following years and the economic assumptions underlying the projections. It will also incorporate detailed information on tax expenditures, potential costs to government such as contingent liabilities and government commitments that are not yet included in the projections and sensitivity of financial estimates to changes in assumptions. The charter of budget honesty will require governments to lay down a fiscal strategy and report against it. It will require governments, when they introduce financial stimulus, to explain the process for its reversal. Last but not lea-t, it will require governments to report on the intergenerational equity of their measures. This charter of budget honesty will provide a framework for the conduct of government fiscal policy. The purpose of the charter is to improve fiscal policy outcomes. The charter provides this by requiring fiscal strategy to be based on the principles of sound fiscal management and by facilitating public scrutiny of fiscal policy and performance. One cannot get a much clearer purpose than that for a bill. The charter will provide for greater discipline, greater transparency and accountability in fiscal policy. This bill has two overall aims. They can be summarised, firstly, by the words 'fiscal discipline' and, secondly, by the words 'public scrutiny'. Obviously fiscal discipline and public scrutiny are not mutually exclusive, as fiscal policy will be enhanced because there is public scrutiny. The honourable member for Watson mentioned the introduction of mid-year economic reviews. We have already released the midyear economic and fiscal outlook for 1996-97 which, under the charter, once it becomes part of the law of this nation, will remain mandatory. I would like those in the House to look at our mid-year review. It contains 98 pages and it is a very substantial summing up of the current economic situation. By stark contrast, the previous 1995-96 review by the former government amounted to a paltry three-page media release with a couple of attachments. There are 98 pages here as opposed to three pages. The honourable member for Watson made some play of a discrepancy in the figures, but the reality is that as a government we have released this review and that is why we are now able to debate the figures that we have released. If one adopted the practices of the former government, there would have been fudging and dishonesty and we would not have been able to have an intelligent debate in relation to the current economic situation of this country. As a coalition in government, we are determined to make sure that we have this honesty and transparency so that at any given time the people of this nation are able to tell exactly what the economic accounts say. We have the guts, the intestinal fortitude and the honesty to release this unprecedented account of the nation's accounts and fiscal outlook in the form of a mid-year review. We have nothing to hide, and we will make sure that those opposite cannot hide anything from the Australian public in the future. This is the important point about this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. It will bind not just this government but all future governments. It will mean that in future we will have honesty and accountability. When election times arrive people will be able to cast a judgment on the economic performance of the government of the day. Mr O'Connor-Pity it wasn't in in 1983. They would have gaoled your leader.",105
162,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"The parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who is at the table, ought not to interject. He was a member of the government which was here over the last 13 years and he, along with the honourable member for Watson and their colleagues, bears part of the corporate shame for the economic situation which was inherited by the current government following the election on 2 March this year. Significantly, the bill before us will modify the so-called caretaker convention regarding the costing of government and opposition election commitments. The Finance and Treasury secretaries-people who are totally independent of the political process-will have to issue a fiscal and economic outlook within 10 days of an election being called. That means that we will call upon independent members of the Public Servicepeople who have no axe to grind, people who are not candidates at election time-to stand up and tell the media, tell anyone who wants to listen, tell the Australian people, what the situation is. So when people come to polling day, they will be able to judge the government of the day on the basis of performance and not on the basis of dodgy or fudged figures or lies, as was the situation prior to the last election. When one looks at the ramifications for the future of the costing of election commitments, one begins to understand why it took the now opposition so long to come to a position on this bill. As in so many other matters at the moment, they are out of touch, they are fragmented and removed from mainstream Australia. Just a few minutes ago the honourable member for Watson said that they were not actually opposing this bill; they see some merit in it. They want to move a few amend-. ments and flick the bill off to the Public Accounts Committee. What they should be doing is coming in here and saying to the people of Australia that they got it wrong; they were caught with their hands in the till; they are terribly sorry; and they want to support the efforts of the government to improve the financial accounting to the Australian people, not only for the next election but once and for all. Even those opposite know that they have to support the essence of this bill. After all, this bill offers unprecedented transparency, honesty and fiscal responsibility. One cannot repeat those words 'unprecedented transparency, honesty and fiscal responsibility' too often. The opposition know that this is going t? hurt them because they are not an oppositIOn and were not a government that were prepared to be transparent and honest, and to have fiscal responsibility. As we all know, they were people who were simply not competent in managing the financial situation of this nation. The honourable member for Watson comes in here and goes on about honesty. He talks about the way we have been unable to match a few of our election promises. The reasonMr O'Connor-A few! A hundred is not a few.",107
163,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"You should not interject, shadow parliamentary secretary; you should stand up here in sackcloth and ashes and apologise to the Australian people. The reason we have had to come in here and say that we were not able to implement all our promises-mind you, our core promises will be implemented in full-and the reason we have had to have some adjustments at the margin is that our election promises were predicated on the word of the former Prime Minister, the word of the former Treasurer and the word of the former ministers, who told us that the budget was not in deficit but in surplus. We tried to get the figures but they assured us over and over again that the budget was in surplus and that the economic accounts of this nation were in a very good state. The former government, in the run-up to the last election, affirmed their 1995-96 budget estimates. This implied an underlying deficit of $590 million for 1996-97 and an underlying surplus of $2.7 billion for the following year. When we carne into office Treasury estimates revealed that the situation was not a surplus of $2.7 billion but, rather, the infamous Beazley $10 billion black hole. To illustrate the need for this charter I want to read out some of the greatest lies, untruths, dismal economic forecasting and gaffs that only the Australian Labor Party could be proud of. The now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), then finance minister, on 1 February 1996 said: As far as we're concerned the Treasury estimates that we had ... in connection with the last budget, and they were Treasury estimates, they stand for good, and we stand by them. What a joke. The situation has blown out terribly. On the same day he said: We're operating in surplus, and our projections are for surpluses in the future. Only a couple of days before that he said: This strategy (fiscal consolidation) has led to a small budget surplus in 1995-96 and growing surpluses forecast over our forward estimates period. He, of course, was not alone. He has the hide to stand up here as the Leader of the Opposition and criticise us but the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, also made some very interesting remarks. On 30 January 1996 he said: But, again, let me remind you ... we have the hudget in surplus. I mean, how many governments around the world have got a budget in surplus. I do not know how many governments around the world had a budget in surplus but certainly the Keating government did not, despite the fact that prior to the election they were prepared to say anything to try to convince the Australian people that their budget was in surplus, whereas in reality there was a deficit of some $10 billion. The honourable member for Watson and criticised us because we have not been able to meet all our election promises but the reason is that far from having a surplus of $2.7 billion, we had a deficit of $10 billion. That is a $12.7 billion difference. If we are going to be economically responsible we cannot continue to spend when the situation is a $10 billion deficit instead of a $2.7 billion surplus. I would like to quote the former Prime Minister again. He said: I mean, this government has been, certainly in the western world, in the OECD area, the high priests of budget accountability, and we've remained that. I mean, I don't know why you wasted the time with a question like this. What an amazing statement. There should have been even more questions asked of him by the media prior to the election but I suppose it would not really have mattered what the media had asked: the former Prime Minister simply was not prepared to tell the truth. On 13 February 1996, in the throes of the election campaign, again he said: The budget is in surplus ... at source we don't have an underlying problem Finally, on St Valentine's day, 14 February 1996, he said: The budget, for God's sake, is in surplus for this year, in the middle of the year ... we have surpluses in prospect for the next three years. It is tragic that the then Prime Minister and the then finance minister, during the whole of the election campaign, were prepared to tell us that the budget was in surplus when the reality was that it was in deficit. We tried to find out what the situation was; we asked them. The former government told us that the budget was in surplus and we had to base our election promises on that, assuming that the then Prime Minister and finance minister were telling the truth. We were also told during the election campaign that the former government could not get any updated figures. That also stretched credibility when on the Monday after the election on 2 March bureaucrats from the Treasury and the Department of Finance came to see the incoming government saying, We're awfully sorry: the former government told you that everything was in surplus; that there was a $2.7 billion surplus. The bad news is that there is a deficit of $10 billion.' One ought to cast one's mind back to when Prime Minister Keating became Prime Minister in 1991. He said at a press conference: The secondpledgeis to deal honestly with the people, to tell them the truth. In tough times, of course, the temptation is al ways to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much as is humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with them, and realistically, and I'll listen accordingly. I want to make a confession: I have never been a great admirer of the former Prime Minister but when I listened to those apparently sincere sentiments in 1991 I thought, 'Perhaps I have got the man wrong.' But when one looks at the situation during the election campaign and when one looks at the way the figures were fudged and the Australian people were deceived, it is very clear that the former Prime Minister was not able to resist the temptation to gild the lily. It is obvious that he was not able to speak honestly with the people of Australia and it is pretty clear that he was also unable to listen. The election on 2 March last was a referendum on whether the then Prime Minister had fulfilled his commitments. He did not and the landslide win to the coalition was a rejection of everything the former government stood for, particularly its lies and its duplicity. The landslide win saw almost the greatest swing to the coalition in any election. The Labor Party now has been reduced to about 49 seats here and the coalition has a total of 94 seats-and there are a number of independents. Mr O'Connor-What happened in Fraser?",107
164,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"The parliamentary secretary ought not to interrupt. The parliamentary secretary ought to be honest and decent and do the right thing and say that he was part of the worse government that this nation has ever seen, the government which was responsible for gross distortion of the economic realities of Australia prior to the last election.",109
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Order! I am loath to interrupt the member, but it has been a wide-ranging debate, and we have used terms like 'honest' and 'dishonest' in general terms, but I would ask you to withdraw the inference to the parliamentary secretary, which you directed to him, that he was not honest. I would not interrupt if it was in general terms, but I think you should withdraw the specific term to the opposition parliamentary secretary.",109
166,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy, if the parliamentary secretary took",109
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"No, I take offence to it, not the parliamentary secretary.",109
168,Mr SLIPPER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I withdraw it, because I would not suggest that, as an individual, the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) is dishonest. I know he is quite to the contrary. But he was part of a government which was dishonest and which was prepared to say and do anything to get elected at the last election. I have cited the numerous utterances of the former Prime Minister and the former Minister for Finance, who were prepared to tell us that the budget was in surplus to the extent of $2.7 billion, whereas the reality was that it was in deficit to $10 billion. And at the last election they paid a very heavy price, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you personally are well aware: they were swept from office, and John Howard and the coalition were elected. It is very interesting to see the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) present in the parliament. In his speech in the second reading debate, he talked incessantly about budget honesty. I wonder if he could explain to us how his support of budget honesty is consistent with the approach of his government which told us prior to the election that the accounts of this nation were in credit, whereas they were, in fact, in deficit. Honourable members opposite have had the gall to talk about honesty-and I believe that they have no credibility at all. They have been forced, belatedly, to come in here and say that they are not going to oppose this bill, they are going to allow passage of this bill but they want some amendments and they want to send it off to a committee. As I said during my speech, members of the opposition should come into the parliament, and they should make a clean breast of things. They should say that they were part of a government which deceived the Australian people and which over the last 13 years created a situation where 800,000 Australians were out of work. They should come in here and say, 'The government got it wrong.' They should come in here and say, 'It is refreshing to see that there are now parties in office who are prepared to open the financial books to scrutiny.' They should come in and say, 'It is wonderful that at the next election the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance will be able to announce to the Australian people what in fact the situation is.' (Time expired)",109
169,Mr MILES,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (8.55 p.m.)-I want to make a few comments in summing up the second reading debate. There has been a very wide-ranging debate, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have already mentioned. A large number of people from both sides of the House have participated in the debate. That shows the significance of this measure which was introduced into the House by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the government on II December last year and is now being debated. It is an important measure, and we believe that it will be one of the well-known, lasting structural reforms of the Howard government. I would like, briefly, to go over a few thoughts-many of which have been expressed over and over again-in summing up the debate. It is probably encapsulated by the fact that in December 1995 the previous Labor Treasurer released a five-page press release which predicted a budget surplus. At the end of 1995, prior to the election in 1996, we had the then Treasurer saying to the Australian people, 'There will be a budget surplus.' But, as we all know, this year's budget papers revealed that the outcome for 1995 and 1996 was not a Commonwealth budget surplus at all. In fact, it was a $10 billion deficit. ing out of that type of totally misleading information provided to the Australian people, we now see this government bringing in a proposal-which has a range of principles under the heading of the charter of budget honesty-which we believe will provide a very clear position of the fiscal outlook for the country prior to any future elections. That is very important. It shows a government which is interested in openness and prepared to take the Australian people into its confidence and then to allow an election to take place on figures which should give an accurate projection rather than the very inaccurate projection we got from the previous government. Therefore, this measure is of fundamental importance to open government, providing the Australian people with a clear budgetary fiscal outlook at elections. There are also mid-year reviews. An illustration of where we are headed happened here two or three weeks ago: the government put out a mid-year review of 100 pages indicating where the budget was at the time. That is an indicator of the openness with which this government is approaching these types of matters. This will provide for an even-handed costing of government and opposition election proposals as we come up to elections, amongst a lot of other issues with the midterm reviews. Can I say that the debate has been obviously vigorous from both sides of the House, but one of the clear things about this is that this government has a clear set of objectives of openness in regard to budget honesty. I think the Australian people will recognise this as a major structural reform and, as time goes on, this will be seen as a significant step. Of course, opposition members have come in here over the last week or so in debate on this bill making all sorts of negative comments. They need to be reminded that they are, in principle, supportive of this legislation. They did have 13 years in government in which they could have brought in the same sorts of measures, but they chose not to. Treasurer Costello has chosen to bring this measure into the parliament. It sets down a number of principles which we believe will be Flowfundamental to the future in giving more openness and more honesty in regard to the budget forward estimates and so forth, particularly in regard to half-yearly reviews and also as we come up to any future federal election. I would just like to thank everybody on both sides of the House who participated in the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Reference to Committee",110
170,Mr GARETH EVANS,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moving: (1) That: (a) the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for consideration and an advisory report by 30 May 1997; and (b) the terms of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing and sessional orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing and sessional orders. (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this reference to the committee. I need not detain the House for very long in explaining the reasons for this motion. They are threefold. Firstly, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has itself specifically recommended that fiscal reporting legislation of the kind that we are here dealing with that was earlier anticipated in discussions of that committee should be so referred back to the committee for detailed consideration and report before the legislation is finally implemented. I am referring to report No. 341 of November 1995 entitled Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountability. Recommendation 19 of that particular report is unequivocal in this respect, stating: The proposed Fiscal Reporting Bill should be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts following its tabling in the House, for inquiry and report. The second reason I advance on behalf of the opposition for this reference to the committee is that, even if there were no existing recommendation from the committee, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is the appropriate specialist financial committee of this parliament which should properly deal with any legislation, particularly interesting and, to some extent, innovative legislation of this kind, concerned with the financial management of the Commonwealth. When we in government sought to reform the audit legislation, which is again before the parliament, this was exhaustively considered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and properly so. As I have indicated, it is the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that has already previously addressed this whole question of financial reporting and ways of further defining the standards of that financial and fiscal reporting. It is the appropriate body for this kind of exercise. There is no doubt that, for a number of reasons that will become more apparent if this ceference is denied and we move to the consideration in detail stage of this bill, there are a number of aspects of the legislation that do deserve further consideration in an across the table committee context, in a way that is not easy to do in this House. The third point I make is that, when you think about it, it really is utterly inconsistent with the stated rationale of this legislation for the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the government to actually oppose the proper public examination of legislation which itself purports to improve the transparency of fiscal and economic reporting. If the whole exercise-the whole justification for this legislation, the rationale of the bill-is improving the quality of the process, improving the transparency of the processes by which forecasts, judgments and estimates are made of the state of the national accounts and the national economy, what on earth is to be lost by making such a reference? What is the government afraid of? Could it be that the joint committee, properly advised and given an opportunity to look through this legislation, will point out many flaws in the legislation in such a way that the government might be embarrassed? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) campaigned, it will be recaIJed, on the basis of restoring, as he put it-not a proposition that we would have put in those terms-proper respect for the parliament. He claimed-quite spuriously, we would say, but he nonetheless claimed it-that standards had altered under our period in government. I simply make the point that the resistance of this government to this reference shows that this particular assertion by the Prime Minister is as baseless as a great many of his other commitments. Let me just raise two possible issues that the government might be disposed to mention by way of reply to me. The government might be disposed to say that this reference to the committee will unduly delay the legislative program of this House. Might I say that we have endeavoured to assist the government in this respect by not moving this motion at an earlier stage. We have allowed the full second reading debate to take its normal course, even though the joint committee did recommend that this legislation be referred to it as soon as the bill was actually tabled in the parliament rather than waiting for the second reading. I do make the point in this context that the legislation does have to pass the Senate. Without stating it any more precisely than that at this point, I would say that history does tend to suggest that the Senate may well be minded to conduct its own inquiry on a piece of legislation of this kind if the House does not or if there is no agreement here to sending it off to a joint committee. If it is the case that 30 May, which is the date that is identified in this motion, causes difficulty for the government-if that is going to be too long for the kind of timetable they have in mind-I am happy to consider that particular aspect of it if that is consistent with the committee's workload at the moment and they feel they can do it in a shorter time. There is no particular magic about that date. A second point that might be made in reply by the government is that the passage of this legislation is necessary before the budget is brought down. If the government, through the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the member for Braddon (Mr Chris Miles), is disposed to make such an assertion, I do not think he will do so very persuasively. It needs to be acknowledged, as we have pointed out in the course of the debate, that this legislation does simply impose conditions that are not subject to penalties. If they are breached, they are hortatory or declaratory conditions rather than formal constraints of a kind which incur pains and penalties. So, in that sense, they are not something which need in any way be formally in place before the budget is to be brought down-the point being, of course, that these conditions can be met voluntarily. In a sense, the passage of this legislation is not necessary at all for them to be implemented. They are not formal rules of a kind that penalties are associated with if there is a breach. Given that status of this particular set of prescriptions, it does not matter an enormous amount from that point of view whether these prescriptions are actually legislated or whether they simply stand there as a statement of executive intention and government policy. After all, the recent midyear review, we have been told by a rather boastful Treasurer in this respect-not unusually-the one containing the Costello crater, was prepared on a basis quite consistent with this legislation, notwithstanding it had not been put in place. I do not know whether the parliamentary secretary will be minded to mount a defence in those reasoned terms and subject to that reasoned reply or whether he will simply get up, as is so common in this place, and say, 'Yah boo sucks; we've got the numbers and that is all there is to it,' and sit down again. If that is so, we will bear that with such fortitude as we can command in all the circumstances. I do make the point finally that the content of this legislation is an important matter. The reference to the committee should indeed have unanimous support. The joint committee was absolutely bipartisan and unanimous in its report and in its earlier recommendation that this kind of legislation be referred to it. If it is opposed by the government, we can only conclude that, as so often, they have something to hide concerning this legislation.",110
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,Is the motion seconded? Mr Martin Ferguson-I formally second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.,112
172,Mr MILES,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.10 p.m.)-We do not accept the proposal which has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. If the opposition are really concerned about these matters, then I am sure that in the previous 13 years when they were in government they would have done something about it. We can procrastinate on these types of matters. We can take time to send them off to committees and argue about things there and maybe tease it out more. But there does come a time when you have to make decisions. We believe this charter sets out some principles which are fundamental and meet the criteria of the government fully. We think that it provides an adequate framework for governments to work within and that it is not so limiting with a lot of specific details that a government has its hands tied to respond to the particular circumstances of the time. We believe that the right balance has been achieved in this legislation. Therefore, there is no need for us to wait for a committee to then go over it in any more detail than what has been done at this stage. We oppose it being sent off to the committee. We believe that the legislation, as I have said, is in order. It does provide a sufficient number of principles for any government to operate within yet is flexible enough to address the changing circumstances which may occur in the economy at any time.

173,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"I move opposition amendment No.1: (1) Schedule 1, page 7 (after line 23), at the end of paragraph 5(1)(b), add: (iii) to the achievement of full employment in Australia; and (iv) to the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia; and The effect of this amendment is to add to the so-called principles of sound fiscal management two further paragraphs: a requirement that the government have regard to the achievement of full employment in Australia and the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. The principles of sound fiscal management as they are drafted at the moment are, from one point of view, so bland as to be absolutely meaningless, not requiring any very rigorous attention to be given to any particular criterion, references to management of financial risks prudently, references to achieving adequate national saving and so on. That is one ground of criticism of these clauses. A more substantial ground of criticism however is, the opposition believes, that the principles here set out are simply so one dimensional. They are all about accounting standards, if you like; they are all about fiscal issues in the most arid and abstract sense. They do not go to what in a sense fiscal management should ultimately be all about. It does not go to the purpose of fiscal management which, at the end of the day, like all economic management responsibilities ought to be addressed to human ends and in particular the welfare, the improved standard of living and the employment of the Australian people. We are facing in a sense exactly the same kind of debate here that has been in issue so far as the role and responsibilities of the Reserve Bank are concerned. The Reserve Bank has traditionally regarded its primary responsibility as being, through the operation of monetary or interest rate policy, the achievement of a lowering inflation. But the Reserve Bank charter does contain in its legislative provisions reference not only to the stability of the currency-which is the synonym, if you like, for the inflation objectivebut to the maintenance of full employment in Australia and to the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia in section 10 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959. Of course it is a matter of robust contemporary debate as to the extent to which the Reserve Bank is having regard to those latter criteria as it pursues its responsibilities. We would say-and, in fact, have been saying in recent times-that we are not particularly persuaded that the Reserve Bank under its present management is in fact giving sufficient attention to that full employment and overall economic prosperity and welfare dimension. To the extent that we have been making those points about the Reserve Bank, they are to be made even more strongly in the context of this particular legislation which goes to the whole conduct not of monetary policy in this instance but of fiscal policy. For a statement of principles of fiscal management to simply be addressing the accounting criteria, if you like-although I am not denying for a moment that many of these accounting criteria have a very direct and obvious practical significance in their impact on people-and if you just focus on questions about saving, questions about stability of the tax burden and so on and then, in particular, relevant risks associated with possible excessive debt and so on, you are missing one of the fundamental points that ought to be made very strongly on these occasions-that at the end of the day economic policy is about impact on people, people's welfare, people's prosperity and the employment that is necessary for them to achieve and maintain that prosperity and increase standards of living. With some minor linguistic modifications to reflect contemporary realities-namely, that we are a long way short of full employment so we can hardly be committing ourselves to maintaining it, rather it is a matter of achieving it; and because the way the legislation is drafted there are some other economic criteria here which make it appropriate to talk about the overall economic prosperity and welfare rather than using exactly the language in the Reserve Bank Act-these particular clauses do pick up those terms of the Reserve Bank charter. They are picked up for a very good reason, and I have moved them accordingly. (Time expired) Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Schedule 1, clauses 6 to II-by leavetaken together, and agreed to. Schedule 1, clause 12.",114
174,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 2 and 3: (2) Schedule 1, page 11 (line 20), after ""financial years"", insert ""(including forecasts of savings)"" . (3) Schedule I, page 11 (after line 25) after paragraph 12(1)(d), insert: (da) an estimate of the net effect of the budget on public saving, private saving and national saving. Might I say that there is a certain indecency I think in the government not merely not being represented by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) but being represented by a thoroughly worthy member of the front bench of not quite such exalted status in the member for Braddon (Mr Miles). But for that felony to be compounded by a complete absence of any kind of reply, articulate or otherwise, to the amendments that we are so manfully offering on this particular billMr MCMullan interJecting",115
175,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"I accept the intervention of my learned colleague. The argument was so formidable that a stunned mullet silence is the only response I could expect. Perhaps the member for Braddon can do better on this occasion. What we are seeking to do with these two amendments is include specific references to national savings forecasts and to an estimate of the net effect on saving as part of this group of obligations that are created in clause 12 now before us in the budget economic and fiscal outlook report. It is all very well for the particular line items to be speJt out about the information being provided on the Commonwealth budget sector and general government sector fiscal estimates and on the economic and other assumptions which lie behind those estimates, but those particular things which ought to be spelt out should also include reference to forecasts of national savings. Similarly, further down when what is being described is the information to be further provided by the government, we say there should be a statement of the estimated net effect of the budget on public saving, private saving and national saving. The reason we make these particular proposals is that improving national saving is what this government says its fiscal management task is fundamentally all about. The biggest debate that we have had in economic policy national over the last 12 months has been a debate about whether priority ought to be given by the government, at the expense of all other objectives, to trying to improve that savings performance or whether the initial priority ought to be given to growth and employment generation objectives-bearing in mind that there might be some consequences for public saving if a budgetary priority is given to growth in employment, in the sense that there might be a rather less robust assault on public expenditure if that priority has been given--)f whether, rather, the approach should be, as this government's approach has been, to make a robust attempt to improve public saving but at the same time cause some considerable problems not only for growth in employment but also for the capacity of people to save more privately. What we have been arguing is that a budget strategy which placed much more emphasis on growth and employment would enable more people to be earning more money, having more disposable income and with the capacity to save more of it as a result. What I am simply saying in this context is that there are many such arguments that could take place. One of the major such arguments will occur in the next few months in the context of the One Nation tax cuts and the trade-off between public and private saving that is involved. If the government has a real, serious, intelligent interest in promoting serious and intelligent debate on these particular economic parameters and objectives, and the possibly competing objectives that arise when one is talking about public versus private savings in this particular context and savings objectives versus other economic priorities, then the government should be prepared to layout the estimates of the savings effect and its savings forecasts in the course of this pattern of information which it is promising to provide. It is absolutely central to the conduct of the economic debate, and the government ought to be prepared to incorporate it accordingly. (Time expired)",115
176,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.42 p.m.)-I would not like the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) to be upset, so I thought I better get up and just make a few comments about these amendments. This clause of the bill indicates five or six clear areas to be included in the budget economic and fiscal outlook report. What is being proposed is that we ought to insert two more areas into it--one about forecasts of national savings and the other one about the net effect on the budget of public saving, private saving and national saving. The situation is that we have outlined in clause 12 what should be contained in the budget economic and fiscal outlook report. We believe that it is reasonably detailed and that it covers all those areas which need to be covered. I guess in these sorts of debates you can go on finessing and putting in more information as to what ought to be required, but we believe the amount of detail that is specified in clause 12 is sufficient. Therefore, we oppose these amendments. Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (9.43 p.m.)Without prolonging the argument, I simply make the point that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his midyear review, which purported to incorporate a great deal of the information that appears in this particular clause, did not spell out in any detail at all information about either the savings forecasts or the effect on savings of the particular measures that were in the last budget. I simply make the point again that the argument about savings ratios and what the public and private sectors respectively are contributing to the saving task is of the essence of the debate about macro-economic policy in this country at the moment. If that debate is to be more intelligently and productively conducted in the future, I hope very much that the Treasurer and the Treasury boffins-whether or not it is explicit in the legislation-will have regard to the concern that I am expressing and will spell out in more detail their own estimates of both the likely impact and the forecasts that would occur in the absence of policy change on these key parameters. That is the reason we are pursuing the issue. It is not just some sort of thought under the shower that leads us to express an enthusiasm for this information being provided. It is of the essence of the economic debate. If the government were really serious about raising the quality of that debate, it would make provision accordingly. Amendments negatived.",116
177,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"I move opposition amendment No.4: (4) Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 25) after paragraph 12(1)(d), insert: (db) a report prepared by the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury of any material threats to the integrity of the tax system including the fiscal impact of these threats, and their best professional judgment of the specific means necessary to counter these threats; This amendment circulated in my name would require the Treasurer to ensure that there is a report prepared by the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury of any material threats to the integrity of the tax system, including the fiscal impact of these threats, and their best professional judgment of the specific means necessary to counter these threats. There are some references in the clause at the moment to the sorts of risks that may have a material effect on the fiscal outlookincluding contingent liabilities and so on-but there is no explicit reference in this the particular threats to fiscal outcomes imposed by threats to the integrity of the tax system. If we have learnt anything over the years this business, it is that threats to the system and its integrity do keep on recurring. The ingenuity of tax lawyers and accountants knows no bounds in this respect and desire to avoid making their contribution to the revenue is something that seems an endemic characteristic of human nature. side Under those circumstances it is important governments be constantly alert to where leakage might occur. One way in which we have been concerned that such leakage is occurring is in respect alienation of personal services income avoidance of the PAYE provisions by people so acting to alienate their personal services income. We estimated when we were in government that that was possibly underminany ing the integrity of the personal income tax base to the tune of several hundreds of taxation millions of dollars per annum-maybe even getting close to $1 billion. We had indicated our willingness to act address that particular problem. This government ment has announced sotto voce by way of press release which they hoped would not be noticed in the context of the last budget that the government will not be proceeding with anti-avoidance legislation in this area. I mention that as just one example. There are many more of areas of concern that say do need detailed, consistent and thoughtful attention by the government. One way of ensuring that it gets that attention is to require the government to make its own annual or whatever estimate and make a statement of where it perceives these threats as likely to be coming from. There are many other areas of avoidance activity that are going on at the moment. We have debated them in other contexts so I will not stop now to indicate what might be done in that respect. The point simply is that it appropriate in our judgment for there to quite precise obligation upon the Commisfinalised-they sioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the context to Treasury to report on this matter. It concentrates their mind to require them to do so. It concentrates the government's and the Treasurer's mind on the nature of the in particular problems that are emerging; it tax concentrates the parliament's and the community's mind on the sorts of things that may indeed be necessary to do to ensure people's integrity of the tax system. Given the problems that all governments have currently been facing on the revenue of the budgetary equation in recent years, that this is another amendment which I would the have thought should have caused the government no difficulty at all to accept. I hope we get some decent reasons as to why this one of has not been accepted, as apparently is the and the case, by the government.",116
178,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.49 p.m.)-This amendment really is about possible risk and it is commenting on 'any material threats to the integrity of the system including the fiscal impact of these threats' and so forth. If the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) had looked down at to the next line or so, we do refer to 'a state of risks quantified where feasible that a may have a material effect on the fiscal outlook' et cetera. We have included a statement of risk and I think that that really does cover what you are talking about, which is material threats. We do not believe, therefore, that there is any need for the amendment you are proposing because a statement of risk is we already part of the legislation.",117
179,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"I do not want to let the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) get away with it quite that easily because he will see that, while the language of risk in the specific examples of risks that are here spelt out is wide enough, I acknowledge, to encompass possibly the sorts of threats to the tax system I have been referring to-that is, contingent liabilities, publicly announced government commitments that are is not yet actually included in the fiscal estibe mates, and negotiations that have yet to be are all risks of a particular kind: namely, something that is known to be coming along as a liability on the outgoing side of the equation in respect of which it is important for readers of the accounts to know that there is that particular express train occurring or potentially occurring one way or the other. The lawyers would say it is an example of the ejusdem generis rule. In construing this particular statutory provision, there are risks of a particular kind, and risks associated with threats of a quite different kind from malfeasance or avoidance or evasion activity on the tax side of the equation are simply not sufficiently covered by this particular paragraph for this paragraph to be sufficient as it presently stands. So we would say that the risks associated with threats to the integrity of the tax system are simply so serious and of such a qualitatively different kind from these particular ones that they ought to be the subject of a specific obligation. That is why we would want to insist on that particular amendment, even if you are not going to take any notice of it. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Schedule 1, clauses 13 to 21-by leavetaken together, and agreed to. Schedule 1, clause 22.",117
180,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"I move opposition amendment No.5: (5) Schedule 1, page 17 (lines 5 to 8), omit clause 22, substitute: 22 Public release of pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report The responsible Secretaries are, jointly, to publicly release a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report: (a) two years and nine months after the first day of sitting of the House of Representatives following the previous general election; or (b) should writs for a general election be issued prior to the report required under sub-clause (a), within five days of the issue of those writs. This amendment in effect replaces the existing provision for a pre-election financial economic and fiscal outlook report being published within 10 days of the issue of writs for a general election with one which says that such a pre-election report should be made two years and nine months after the first day of sitting of the House of Representatives following the previous election or, in the event that a general election is called earlier than that time frame, within five days, not 10 days, of the issue of those writs. The point is simply made: if this pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report is to serve any productive and useful purpose in the election campaign in educating and informing the public as to the nature of the budget contest-if there is one-which is occurring, then it ought to be timely. It ought to be in the public domain sufficiently early to enable it to be a genuine contribution to an open, honest and transparent public debate, not just a political tactic employed by the government of the day to advance its own political ends. Of course, the later any such report can be delayed in a campaign the less time that gives to the opposition to respond to the issues raised by it and the more of an imbalance there may well be, as a result, in the way in which the political issues are canvassed during that particular period. We say that it would be very helpful if in the normal course of events such a report were to appear towards the end of the normal parliamentary session-two years and nine months into it-but that, in the event, of course, of there being an early election, the report ought to be issued just a little earlier than is presently provided for in this legislation. The argument speaks for itself-ertainly from the opposition's perspective.",118
181,Mr MCMULLAN,PAIRS,"Canberra) (9.55 p.m.)This is an amendment that goes to what, I hope, is an unintended consequence of these amendments. Let us assume that the government's intention is as declared, which is that these proposals are designed to improve the level of public debate in election campaigns. I, at least for the purpose of debate, accept that. But that will not be their effect. Everybody in this chamber-perhaps not too many other people-should be able, with the application of their memory and imagination, to envisage the circumstance that is going to happen in an election campaign after the passage of this particular proposal. We have before us a proposal that will say that it will be within a day or two of only three weeks in advance of the election campaign before this pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report comes out. It is going to question the effective capacity of both sides, particularly the opposition, whoever that may be from time to time-and that will change over the years ahead. The opposition will be at a significant disadvantage and there will be a significant constraint on the capacity to release all the detail of policy. It would be a very brave political party, particularly a very brave opposition, which has less access to these sorts of resources in the lead-up to an election-we will come to that in subsequent amendments; nevertheless, whatever we say in this legislation, the opposition will always, properly and necessarily, have less access than a government to these resources-which would declare the full gamut of policies and, therefore, the co stings before this report comes out setting the parameters within which those policies will have to operate, or at least within which the secretaries to Finance and Treasury think they will have to operate. We know that will never be an excessively generous one-although I have high regard for those institutions and the public servants who work within them. The lO-day proviso, whatever its intention, means that all effective analysis of the viabilion ty, economic consequences of and political possibilities surrounding a series of proposals with regard to policy by any major political party-the minor parties as well for that matter, but it never seems to be much of a constraint on them, so I do not suppose it will be much of a problem for them-that aspires to govern and to persuade and convince the people of Australia that they are entitled to govern must wait until this document comes out. This document must come out before the parties can start to get down to effective costings. I am not saying that that is the intention. I have some disagreement about the balance between opposition and government in some of the subsequent amendments, but that is not really my point here. It is going to be to some extent a constraint on the governing party as well-not quite as serious because a lot of their options will have been costed over the 2Y2 years and they will have developed the proposals in the lead-up to ERe and those sorts of things. They will have quite a few in their kitbag, but they will be to some extent constrained. The people who will be most constrained will be the public, because they will not be able to see the full framework within which the respective options should be assessed and they will not, therefore, get the full detail of all those options until after this document comes out. We are going to have, effectively, a three-week concentrated exercise in attempting to analyse all the consequences of all the proposals by all the major parties in each election for so long as this clause remains. The response that the opposition has, as the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) has outlined, says two things: firstly, we are now moving towards a situation in which the full three-year term is becoming the norm rather than the exception. Part (a) will often take effect. Secondly, we all know that it cannot take effect every time and therefore there is the catch-all amendment (b) for those, we hope, rare circumstances in which an earlier election is called. This is a very serious issue. The proposal from the government could have-I think unintentionally-adverse effects the proper operation of our democracy, which I think it is designed to enhance but which it might actually constrain. (Time expired)",118
182,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"I rise to support the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), in advancing this amendment. I believe it is a proposition that is much superior to that advanced by the government. I think what damns the government most is that this standard in their bill is not one that they would have applied to themselves before the last election campaign. It was made very public after the election that well before the issue of the writs Mr Howard, as Leader of the Opposition, had all his policies written, had all of his schedules set, had all of his costings confirmed and there was no way the then opposition would have had the flexibility to adjust those 10 days into an election campaign. This is not a standard that the coalition parties would have applied to themselves for the 1996 election campaign. Well before the then Prime Minister announced the election date and the writs were issued, the coalition had all its finances and its fiscal commitments worked out in fine detail. By their own standards they are damned. I believe it is eminently reasonable for the opposition, through the member for Holt, to advance the proposition that the statement on pre-election economic and fiscal outlook be released two years and nine months after the first day of the sitting of the House or if that cannot be achieved because of the timing of the election to bring it forward as much as possible to within five days after the issue of the writs. Even proposed section 22(b) is still inconsistent with the standard the then opposition applied to itself for the 1996 election campaIgn. We are operating under duress here because the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is not in the chamber. The shadow Treasurer has advanced a superior proposition that deserves the consideration of the House and the Treasurer is not in the chamber. The irony is that we are debating a charter of budget honesty when there is an example of government dishonesty sitting opposite. Before the last election the government promised that ministers would be in the chamber to consider legislation within their portfolio areas.",119
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I think you should withdraw the remark about the parliamentary secretary.,120
184,Mr LA THAM,PAIRS,"I was referring to the government's broken promises. If it has offended the parliamentary secretary, I am more than happy to withdraw it.",120
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Whether it has offended him or not, I believe it is offensive.",120
186,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"I am more than happy to withdraw it. The irony is that we are debating a charter of budget honesty when there is an example of a broken election promise sitting in the chamber. Before the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that the parliament would be supreme over the executive and as a symbol of that he said that ministers would always be in the chamber to look after legislation within their portfolios. Now we have a parliamentary secretary without any responsibility for TreasuryMr Martin Ferguson-Was that in the ministerial code of conduct, was it?",120
187,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"Maybe it was a non-core part of the ministerial code of conduct. He has sent in a parliamentary secretary without any administrative responsibility for Treasury matters. He is the parliamentary secretary to cabinet. He is the note taker in their cabinet meetings-nothing more; nothing less. The irony is that we are debating this matter about budget honesty when the government cannot even keep its own election promises on something as simple as ministers being in the chamber to consider amendments. In the next election, when people-journalists in particular-look back at this provision and look back at the debate they should consider this: the opposition had a proposition superior to that of the government, the government broke its election promise by not having the Treasurer in this place and it deserted any claim it has to election or budget honesty.",120
188,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (10.04 p.m.)-The government believes that what is in the legislation should stand and we reject the amendment. I am a bit amazed that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is in here complaining about ministers being in the chamber. I remember that ministers in the last government did not even come in for question time half the time. I think that shows up the paucity of the member for Werriwa's argument. What we are really talking about with writs and general elections is that writs are issued within 33 days and we are talking about either having this information available on the 27th or 22nd day. The other thing that you are saying is that everything in this debate with regard to elections revolves entirely around economic details. Social policies do play a part as well. I know that financial estimates and so forth are important when it comes to social policies as well but, lets face it, an election is not just about the financial side of things there are lots of things to argue about publicly on the social policy side of things. We are really arguing about five days. Mr MCMullan-Hopefully you are arguing about three months.",120
189,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"I guess we will have to wait and see. With regard to your proposal of five days as against 10 days, I simply point out that obviously there are judgments which are made when you propose these matters. We believe that 21 or 22 days will give the Australian public a good opportunity to look at the facts. Lets face it, this is a major step forward on the last election. Mr MCMullan-I think it is a step back. I understand your intention and I accept it, but it could turn out to be a step back.",121
190,Mr MILES,PAIRS,I think it is a major step forward and we are very confident that this is something that the Australian people will certainly welcome.,121
191,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"Let me simply add a further couple of sentences. The parliamentary secretary trivialises this amendment by drawing attention to the difference between five days and 10 days. That is only the fail safe mechanism in the event that an election is called earlier than two years and nine months into the government's term. In what is, as the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) said, nowadays the more usual situation of parliaments running their full term, this particular document would be required to be out on the table two years and nine months after the first day of sitting. That is up to a full three months before the election contest is held. In that context there is no doubt that such a report or material being out on the table would markedly improve the quality of the debate in the sense of allowing that much more time for it to be properly and sensibly considered. The primary purpose of this particular amendment is to introduce that provision. The secondary provision is to cope with the circumstance that an election is called early. Obviously you cannot do much better than take a few days off the schedule that is here proposed in legislation in those circumstances. But please do not trivialise it. It is an important amendment, and I fully endorse what has been said by my colleagues in that respect. Amendment negatived Schedule 1, clauses 23 to 28-by leavetaken together, and agreed to. Schedule 1, clause 29.",121
192,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"by leave-I move opposition amendment Nos 6 to 12: (6) Schedule 1, page 22 (line 7), omit ""publicly announced"" .

(12) Schedule 1, page 22 (after line 30), at the end of clause 29, add: (6) The Secretaries may decline to prepare costings under any request pursuant to this clause where they consider the request requires policy advice rather than merely the preparation of costings. (7) Any request by the Leader of the Opposition pursuant to subclause (1) shall not be disclosed by the Secretaries to any person not authorised by the Leader of the Opposition to have access to that information. I am indebted to the House for that leave being granted. It will expedite the debate for these amendments to be taken together, because they are all part of a single exercise in rewriting key aspects of this particular provision. This clause is about the costing of election commitments, both on the government side and on the opposition side, during the caretaker period, that is to say, after the election is actually called. Our concern with the way in which this clause is drafted at the moment is, first of that it is only publicly announced policies that can be made the subject of this costing arrangement. For that constraint to apply to the government is, of course, no constraint at all because the government by definition has full access during its entire tenure to the resources of Treasury and Finance and can do costing to its heart's content. For an opposition, however, the constraint that a policy be publicly announced before detailed costing assistance can be sought is a very serious constraint because, in effect, the opposition is put in the position of having to make and announce its policy decisions on the basis of necessarily incomplete information and, under those circumstances, potentially exposes itself to error in the calculations involved and to political assault as a result. Therefore, there is a potential imbalance in the equation built into the very fabric of this particular clause in that respect, and that is something that we are concerned about. So we say that this particular provision for costing ought to be available to both government and opposition in respect of policy objectives, whether publicly announced or not; that ought not to be the criterion. Associated with that are the further provisions which we move to remove the discretion, in particular, of the Prime Minister to decline to refer a request for an opposition costing to the relevant secretaries to the departments. It is a fairly extraordinary proposition that the leader of the government of the day should have the discretion to refuse a request properly made in an election context for no particular reason, with no reason of good faith being required. We do not like it; we seek to remove it. The principal question is that of some policy advice being sought. Under those circumstances where policy advice is being sought, we do not suggest for a moment that it is appropriate for secretaries to make such advice available. Under those circumstances we have built into our proposal-in amendment No. 12-a limitation which would enable the secretaries, not the Prime Minister of the day, to decline. The further thing we want to do in relation to this clause as it is all, presently drafted is to enable the Leader of the Opposition to seek such costings essentially in private and to have the same advantage as the government in this respect. If the government's commitment to the democratic process is such as they say it is-that they want to put things on a proper and evenly balanced basis in the future, have less of a circus involving these costing claims and counterclaims-then they ought to be prepared to make the services of the Treasury and the Department of Finance, in particular, available for this purpose on a confidential basis while options are explored. If there is an unnecessarily or unduly onerous workload proposed for the secretaries in this respect, I guess as a practical matter ways can be found through that. For a later provision, 33-which we will come to later on-we do acknowledge the legitimacy of concerns of that kind standing in the way of that advice being provided. During the caretaker period, in the hustle and bustle of an election campaign, we think it is appropriate that, in that highly charged atmosphere, the opposition not be disadvantaged, and we move accordingly. (Time expired) Mr MCMULLAN . (Canberra) (10.14 p.m.)-I rise to support these amendments. There is a number of principles involved in these amendments, and I think they need to be looked at separately. They are not all perhaps equally important, but they all need reference, and some of them. I think are very important. What we have here is a proposition that is designed to look like an offer of equality and redressing the balance which has actually been structured consciously, deliberately and reasonably effectively, possibly, to give the incumbent government significant advantage in the lead-up to any election. Certainly, some of my colleagues might think I was excessively magnanimous last time in saying that the consequences of the previous items about which I expressed concern were inadvertent and unintended consequences. You cannot pretend in any way that these could be unintended consequences. The proposals have been deliberately structured to give every possible advantage to the incumbent government over the opposition; every element is so structured carefully and deliberately. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) said, all that can be costed are publicly announced policies. That seems wonderfully even-handed-the government's publicly announced policies and the opposition's publicly announced policies. But, subject to an amendment we intend to propose, this is an even-handedness that is treating people in an unequal situation as if they were equal, when some people have the manifest advantage of having had access to the resources of Treasury and Finance for the whole term of their government to cost a series of options which they can then decide to hold onto for a little while and store up as election proposals. Then they will only have to deal with their publicly announced policies being costed-and they may not want at that stage to publicly announce many because they have the enormous advantages of costed policies in their top drawer whereas the opposition, by definition, does not have access to that. If the government had thought that to be a reasonable proposition they could easily have structured this bill to give the opposition equal access, as our subsequent amendment will seek to do; but they chose not to. We then have the extraordinary proposition that the opposition's access to these departments be at the discretion of the Prime Minister. That has been adequately dealt with by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I will not repeat it; but it is extraordinary and it is reiterated in the processes by which such propositions are withdrawn. We are trying very hard as an opposition not to pretend that the parliament should give to the opposition all that which is properly the responsibility of the executive in terms of the discharge of their obligations as government. Therefore, we put in the sorts of options to ensure that the secretaries to the departments have discretion to decline to prepare costings where that may venture into the sort of policy advice that is the responsibility of the bureaucracy to give to the executive government and not to the opposition. There would be nothing unconstitutional about it but it would be extraordinary and not, in our view, proper even though we are the people who are currently the opposition and who would, in the lead-up to the next election, be the first people operating under this-and it would probably give us an advantage. But it would not be appropriate, so we have consciously sought to exclude that. But each of these amendments seeks to redress the imbalance that is consciously, deliberately and as a matter of policy intention put in here by the government so that that which appears to be the height of reasonableness and even-handedness gives them, at the first election to be conducted under these propositions-and any election conducted under these propositions-a profound, serious, unfair and potentially very important advantage. I hope they are amended. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Schedule 1, clauses 30 to 32-by leavetaken together, and agreed to. Schedule 1, new part 9 (new clause 33).",121
193,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"I move: Part 9-Costing of Opposition policy options 33 Costing of policy options The Leader of the Opposition may, at any time before the caretaker period for a general election, seek the assistance of the responsible Secretaries to cost policy options provided that: (a) the responsible Secretaries have the discretion to decline to assist if the request would impose an unreasonable workload on the responsible Secretaries and/or their departments; (b) the request by the Leader of the Opposition shall relate only to co stings and revenue estimates and not to policy advice as to the merits or otherwise of the options being considered; (c) the Leader of the Opposition may, at any time, withdraw a request that he or she has made by notice in writing given to the responsible Secretaries; and (d) any such request by the Leader of the Opposition pursuant to this section shall not state: be disclosed by the responsible Secretaries to any person not authorised by the Leader of the Opposition to have access to that information. As foreshadowed by the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), this is a proposal for a new clause to do something serious about equalising the opportunity for the opposition-as compared with the government-when it comes to making its own analysis of the cost implications of its policies. What we are proposing to do here is give that opportunity to the opposition before the caretaker period after an election is called as well as before it, in order that the opposition may have something of the same opportunity as the government of the day to develop policy options in a considered and careful way that is responsible and has regard to the public interest when it comes to the costing of them. Mr Warwick Smith-You won't get your policies out in time; you won't have any at the next election.",123
194,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"We can tell from the rather smug way that the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), who is the opposition spokesman sitting at the table, is gloating over the terms of the bill at the moment that they know perfectly well how the cards are stacked in their favour under this legislation. Therefore they are treating with not only indifference but with active derision the particular proposal that I am now moving. It ought not to be the subject of derision from a government which takes seriously its rhetoric and is not hypocritical about its rhetoric of improving the standard and quality of parliamentary and public debate when it comes to policy proposals. Of course, part of the decent policy debate on these issues is that the ground is equalised in terms of the reality of the policy proposals and their affordability and cost. If people are prepared to allow debates to take place with the parties being on an unequal footing in terms of the kind of advice they can get access to, they are not making a commitment to raising the quality of the public debate in the way they claim they are. Having said that, the terms of the motion are clear enough. I will spell them out. They The Leader of the Opposition may, at any time before the caretaker period ... seek the assistance of the responsible Secretariesthat is to say, the Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary to the Department of Financeto cost policy optionsTo ensure that this is realistic and not totally quixotic or fanciful, we have introduced a number of qualificationsprovided that: the responsible Secretaries have the discretion to decline to assist if the request would impose an unreasonable workload on the responsible Secretaries and/or their departmentsThat is a freedom of information type of provision which is not unreasonable in the circumstances. You do not necessarily want oppositions engaged in endless fishing expeditions as far as particular options are concerned. You want to confine the exercise reasonably and practically-it would have to be confined the way the Public Service is being tom apart at the moment by this government; they simply do not have the resources for this sort of thing. We acknowledge the limitations in that respect and are prepared to be practical 'and sensible about it. Again, as previously, we confine the request to co stings and revenue estimates, not to policy advice on the merits. We fully acknowledge that that would be inappropriate for an opposition so far as executive government resources are concerned. There are provisions here for the withdrawal at any time by the Leader of the Opposition of such a request and for such a request not to be disclosed by the responsible secretaries. Again, if we are seriously engaged in the enterprise of ensuring the improvement and the quality of the options, the proposals and the policies that are put to the people by the respective parties then parties ought to be able to explore some of these options before they commit themselves to the public domain in order to ensure that they get it right. It is as simple and as straightforward as that. So these are provisions which should add a great deal to the quality-as I keep sayingof public debate in this country. Again, I would hope that we would have some reasoned reply from the government if it is not disposed to accept these amendments rather than just a smug contemplation of the superior advantage they have under the present arrangements and a contemptuous dismissal of what are very considered and very thoughtful opposition proposals.",124
195,Mr MCMULLAN,PAIRS,"I do not want to add a lot because I note the time and it has been adequately covered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). This is a necessary consequence of the failure of the House to pass the previous amendments because this is the only mechanism with the clauses as previously passed by which even any modicum of even-handedness can be seen flowing through these proposals and where the extent to which these proposals tilt the balance dramatically in favour of the incumbent government might in some small way be redressed. It is a fairly small way but not an irrelevant or unimportant way. It is for that reason an important amendment in the contest between government and opposition, and between any parties in the future that might aspire to be the government of this country. But it should not be forgotten that the really important thing about this amendment and what would have been important about the previous amendments had they been carriedthat milk is spilt-is that it enhances the capacity of the people to make informed judgments. It is not just a game between 148 players where we have a bit of fun and see if we can play the game by some set of rules and hope that, through this proposal, we can influence the fair judgment of the umpire. We are not just introducing something that is the political equivalent of the third umpire hereI hope it works better than Super League's third umpire. It is a very important question about empowering the people to make informed judgments about which of the competing aspiring alternative governments they wish to choose and about giving some sort of reasonable equality in terms of access to resources to put options before the people. You cannot make it equal; you would not want to. That is not the way the Westminster system works. It is not the way it can ever work. There are enormous extra burdens and obligations on government and consequential access to greater resources. They are two sides of the same coin-and necessarily, inevitably so. But if we are going to go down this route, particularly if we are going to go down the route set out in the previous debate where the opposition amendments failed to be passed, and if all those changes are going to be made it can only have an appearance of some even-handedness with this proposition that has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Therefore, I support the amendment.",125
196,Mr MILES,PAIRS,Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (10.26 p.m.)-I will be fairly brief on this matter because the adjournment is coming up. You have argued a case there from an opposition position. Mr Gareth Evans-Democratic.,125
197,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"A democratic position as well. But we are in a Westminster system and what you are suggesting here is that the Leader of the Opposition would actually have access to the resources and be able to give directions to Treasury officials and so forth, which is really quite contrary to the whole spirit of the Westminster system. We believe that we are making a major step forward and no doubt providing the Australian people with much more information than they have ever been provided with before. We believe that that is a real step forward on the previous situation. What you are trying to do is leapfrog over that and go another stage. We believe thai. this will be welcomed by the Australian people. We have no doubt that, at the next election, they will be far better informed about the fiscal output of Australia than they ever were at the last election. We oppose the amendment. Proposed new part negatived. Title agreed to. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Miles)-by Ieaveread a third time. NA Motion (by Mr Miles) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Asbestos Related Diseases",125
198,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to make clear my public criticism of the state government of Western Australia and the federal government for the lack of commitment to funding research into asbestos related diseases. The state government of Western Australia has, up until now, funded research and treatment that has made the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital the world leader in this type of medical research. Results have given a glimmer of hope where none had previously existed. It has been put by the Asbestos Diseases Society of Australia that as many as 45,000 Australians were expected to die from asbestos related diseases over the next 20 years if government failed to provide the funding to continue research and treatment. The Western Australian Department of Health has written to people in the state to tell them that funding for research has been discontinued. One response I received from a constituent who wrote to me about it was that we Aussies seem willing to save the lives of foreign yachtsmen at great cost but when it comes to our own people we are somewhat remiss. I am indebted to my constituents and the Asbestos Diseases Society of Australia for the information I use in my address this evening. The number of mesotheliomas and asbestos related lung cancers in Australia is rapidly accelerating. Because of the long latency period from exposure to asbestos fibres and manifestation of the diseases-often up to 30 years-the epidemic of asbestos disease will not peak until around the year 2020. At present, 2,500 people are diagnosed annually and the numbers are rising. Research into asbestos related disease is virtually non-existent in Australia except at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Western Australia. Research here is more advanced than anywhere else in the world. WA professors Bill Musk and Bruce Robinson and their colleagues have an enormous amount of experience in epidemiology, cytopathology, molecular biology and immunology. They are also leaders in areas of novel clinical mesothelioma treatment trials. They are in a unique and ideal position to help find treatments for these diseases and find improved methods of early diagnosis of them. They are also able to draw important lessons that contribute to understanding other diseases such as lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and other fibrotic lung disorders. Regrettably, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital received only small amounts of government funding, and this is now being withdrawn. I would like to quote from the letter sent by Professor Musk to one of my constituents who participated in the research to tell him that the program had ended. It states: When we set up the program in 1990 at the request of the State Government, it was to provide the best known preventive strategy for cancer in people exposed to asbestos and in particular, people from Wittenoom. We acknowledge that the present Government made significant and important contributions to research into asbestos related diseases at the . . . hospital through the State Government Insurance Commission as well as a special grant from consolidated revenue in its first term in office. We have endeavoured to find further funds for the new program but we failed in our attempts. We approached CSR in November 1994 but after some slight partial interest, there was no further response ... We have also made submissions to the WA Government through its Ministers for Health who have indicated that the Government will not continue to fund the program. Submissions were made to the Commonwealth Government through the Asbestos Diseases Society of Australia with no success. Unfortunately, we have now run out of time because we have run out of money to continue and the essential staff have had to find other jobs. We believe that the program has been very successful so far. Over 1200 ex-Wittenoom workers and more than 700 ex - Wittenoom residents have joined during the past five years, as well as over 700 other asbestos exposed people. Our evaluation of the first five years showed that for people from Wittenoom, those joining the program had lower rates of death than those who did not. Among Wittenoom workers who were given the drug retinol, there were significantly fewer cases of malignant mesothelioma than among those given beta-carotene (a common dietary treatment for other cancers). It was because of these results that we recommended that the program be continued and everyone be given retinol ... I am appalled that we have a situation where Australians are expected to die of asbestos related diseases over the next 20 years. I am appalled that the state government of Western Australia has decided that funding for this program is not within its fiscal priorities and that funding from the extant state sources has been discontinued, even though Australia has developed the world's centre of excellence in research and treatment of the diseases that will cause these deaths; even though their treatment program has successfully reduced the rate of death amongst sufferers. What is perhaps even more appalling is that these diseases do not only kill Wittenoom workers or Western Australians; they will kill people of all ages and from all walks of life in this country. The federal government has failed to provide money for the program since it began in 1990 and continues to provide no funds. I call on the ministers for health Jor both the state of Western Australia and the Commonwealth to review the situation as a matter of urgency and not just extend the program but in fact increase its funding. HMAS Voyager",126
199,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"In the foreword to the book, Where Fate Calls, by Dr Tom Frame the following comments are made, and I quote in part: On the night of 10 February 1964, during naval exercises off the south coast of New South Wales, the destroyer HMAS Voyager inexplicably crossed the bows of the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne and was sliced in two. Within a matter of minutes, 82 men perished, making the collision Australia's worse peacetime disaster. In an unprecedented action, the Australian government broke with established practices and ordered a royal commission into the tragedy. Its findings were controversial and public and parliamentary concern resulted in the appointment of a second commission, again an unprecedented action. Its findings were released four years after the event and the commission has been described as the most spiteful and vindictive in Australia's legal history. 'Where Fate Calls' is a probing and controversial investigation of the four-year Voyager saga and its aftermath, the first fully researched account of one of the most important events in Australia's national history-a veteran Canberra political commentator said recently, ""The Voyager story must rate as one of Canberra's three biggest, along with the Petro v defection and the dismissal of the Whitlam Government"". It is an enthralling story containing all of the elements of an epic thriller: a dramatic naval disaster at night, tragic loss of life, exploits of extraordinary bravery, court-room action, political intrigue, public outrage and claims of cover-ups and conspiracies. As the Sydney Morning Herald said on 6 April 1989, it was: The longest and sorriest story in our navalperhaps our parliamentary-history. It is a sad record of evasion, dishonesty and incompetence. Ministers have prevaricated, royal commissions have blundered, naval officers have concealed the truth. Evidence has been destroyed and mislaid. Today is the 33rd anniversary of that national tragedy. As a young duty naval officer in Canberra that night, and as someone who knew many of those who died and who survived, 8.56 p.m. remains indelibly etched on my memory. On that fateful night it is now clear that for those involved there was a mixture of understandable fear, of disregard for personal safety, of mutual trust of shipmates, of bravery, of personal sacrifices and, regrettably, ultimately death-characteristics we have come to respect and honour in the great and proud traditions of the thousands of men and women who have served in the Australian naval service in peace and war. Once again, I take the opportunity to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the service of their country that evening, to those who survived and continue about their everyday lives and, very specially, to their families. Regrettably, many of those survivors and their families still bear the scars of the tragedy, scars of psychological trauma, of persistent nervous shock, of domestic instability, of financial strain and of continuing lack of confidence and frustration in settling the associated compensation claims. As you would know, since I entered parliament in 1988 I have been heavily involved in compensation cases for survivors of that tragedy, including a precedent-setting High Court action for one of them-the so-called Verwayen case of 1990. Although that claim and 70 to 80 others now have been settled as a result of the sterling work of Victorian solicitor Jim Taylor and others, the most recent media reporting of the tragic MCLean case raises the question of commitment in resolving it and others. That it has taken so long to resolve is arguably an indictment of undue bureaucracy and legal obstructionism as well as a lack of political will on both sides of the political fence over a long period. Service at sea is a dangerous calling, and every now and again fate extracts a penalty. Tom Frame's book should be a salutary reminder to many-to the people of Australia, to the Royal Australian Navy and to federal governments of all party political hues. After three decades, no-one wants a witch hunt. However, I hope that 1997 will see the closing chapter of a long, destructive and divisive struggle which will enable some of the survivors to pick up the remnants of their shattered lives. Mr Speaker, I know the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) wants to say a few words about this as well. Perhaps, if you consider it appropriate, we should recognise this matter in the normal way, with an appropriate period of silence. HMAS Voyager",127
200,Mr TED GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to address the House with the same subject my friend the member for Groom (l\1r Taylor) spoke on. Tonight, at 8.56 p.m. precisely, was the 33rd anniversary of that terrible disaster involving the HMAS Melbourne and the Sydney destroyer. I support the comments made by the honourable member for Groom, who is a high ranking exofficer of what I will always consider to be the senior service. At around 8.56 tonight at the defence subcommittee meeting, a few minutes silence-as suggested by the honourable member for Groom-was observed in committee room 2R2 in memory of the people who lost their lives in that unfortunate sea accident. Mr Taylor pointed out the event, and I will just elaborate on it a little bit more. I do not wish to go into it any more than Mr Taylor did and to attribute blame to anybody. It happened on 10 February 1964. Melbourne and Voyager were carrying out a program of trials and exercises during the day, about 20 miles off the coast of Jervis Bay, in preparation for a series of night flying exercises. Voyager's role in these exercises was to act as a plane guard, that is, to recover any aircraft that happened to ditch into the sea. Due to the fact that both ships had spent extended periods in refit, this was the first time either ship had been engaged in close water manoeuvring for nearly six months. In addition, both ships had a large number of new members in their companies. Melbourne had a new commanding officer, Captain John Stevens. Although he was exonerated in the royal commission, he later resigned under a cloud. That was very unfortunate, because most people who are experts in seagoing knowledge completely exonerated him. As I said, I do not want to apportion blame, and it is not nice to speak ill of the dead, but obviously a lot of the blame belonged to the captain of the Voyager, Captain Stevens. At 8.55 p.m., Voyager was pursuing a return to port and was about 100 yards from the carrier, and the gap was closing rapidly. The next 15 seconds were crucial. Captain Robertson on the Melbourne thought that the destroyer would change course. Nothing happened. About 30 seconds before the fatal crash, Captain Robertson ordered full astern on the Melbourne. Captain Stevens ordered the change of course, but by then it was too late. Like the member for Groom and I have said, at 8.56 p.m. the 20,000 tonne carrier travelling at approximately 20 knots hit the 3,000 tonne destroyer-this speaks for itselfcutting it in two. The point of contact was slightly above the bridge and the operations room. Virtually all the Voyager's staff, including Captain Stevens, were killed instantly. The bow section sank quickly, but the aft section stayed afloat for three hours. Of the 314 personnel on board the Voyager, 232 were rescued and 82 were killed, including 14 officers, 16 sailors and one civilian dockyard worker. As the honourable member for Groom has stated, there were two inquiries into the cause of the accident. It is easy after all these years for so-called experts to comment on what happened on the night. It is easy to be an expert. I do not want to speak on the compensation cases, but I hope that everybody gets their just desserts before it is too late, before some of those people pass on. They deserve a better fate than what has been handed out to them at the present time. I would like to express my condolences to those concerned. Having been brought up, and served my apprenticeship, in the Royal Navy I am quite aware of life at sea. I am in full agreement with the member for Groom that it was a very sad incident. It is worth remembering. Mr Speaker, I hope that you consider the member for Groom's suggestion of a mark of respect for those gallant seamen.",128
201,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the honourable members for Fowler and Groom for th'eir comments in respect of this awesome tragedy. It is a naval disaster and tragedy of enormous significance, the ripples of which still haunt the Royal Australian Navy and the nation. I ask those present to join me in a sign of tribute to those who died and to those whose lives were irretrievably affected by the disaster. Honourable members having stood in their placesShoalhaven: Roads",129
202,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on an issue of paramount importance to the Shoalhaven and, indeed, to Canberra and south-eastern New South Wales. It is main road 92. This road has the potential to provide an unprecedented injection of people and funds to the Shoalhaven, an area that suffers savagely from unemployment and poor transport facilities. I will provide a little background on the Shoalhaven before further explaining the details of the road. We live in a region that boasts some of the most spectacular scenery in Australia-the crown jewel being Jervis Bay. At the same time the Shoalhaven has rampant youth unemployment and a general unemployment rate which unofficial figures say is 30 per cent. There is industry in Nowra, but it is constrained by one critical factor-a lack of transport. This problem is endemic within the Shoalhaven and was amply highlighted by the  when he explained that it costs as much to haul freight from Nowra to Gundagai-a distance of 285 kilometres-as it costs to haul freight the 485 kilometres from Gundagai to Melbourne, via Kangaroo Valley. There are 17,500 heavy vehicle movements from the Shoalhaven to the south-west per year. The construction of this road is expected to provide $350,000 per annum in savings for industry freight haulage in the Shoalhaven. At present, the Shoalhaven is a transportation dead-end and it is the end also of the southern railway system. There are two major manufacturers with national markets in the Shoalhaven. These are the Shoalhaven Paper Mill and the Manildra Group producing starch and ethanol. This is where trunk road 92 comes to the fore. I would not go so far as to say its construction would provide an immediate panacea for the wider social problems of the electorate, but I would say that it would provide a badly needed injection of capital into the area, with potential to provide enormous benefits for the Shoalhaven. When I alluded to Jervis Bay earlier, it was in the sense that one of the most picturesque and spectacular national attractions of Australia is not easily accessible for the people of Canberra. At this stage it is necessary to drive down the Clyde to Batemans Bay or down the Kangaroo Valley road and it takes in the vicinity of three hours. Those in this House who are familiar with those two roads know that the Kangaroo Valley road is notorious for its traffic hold-ups and is very dangerous indeed. With trunk road 92 we would see two markets, each of 400,000 people, located only 11/2 hours apart. For every one per cent increase in tourism visitation, $3.36 million per annum is injected into the economy, creating 57 full-time jobs. The construction of main road 92 would be a facilitator for improved mutual accessibility. This would include Tallaganda-Duea National Park, Morton National Park, the Jervis Bay National Park, Kosciusko National Parkincluding the ski fields-and Canberra as well. The road would provide improved access for eco-tourism in seven national parks with world-class recreational opportunities. Moreover, it would allow the Kangaroo Valley road to be reclassified as a tourist route. It would also facilitate a major tourist loop including Sydney, the Southern Highlands, Canberra, the Shoalhaven and Illawarra. Translated into figures, this road has the potential to provide a 10 per cent increase in visits to th(- Shoalhaven, a $33.6 million per annum economic boost providing 500 jobs. Another valuable asset for the Shoalhaven is HMAS Albatross base, which is being upgraded in its role as a major defence maintenance facility. Its services are being exported to South-East Asia and, therefore, there is a need for close links to Canberra for embassy liaisons and to provide a strategic defence link between HMAS Albatross, HMAS Creswell and Canberra. With two markets each of 400,000 people located 11/2 hours apart, there will be greatly improved opportunities in the business, intellectual, social, cultural and transport fields. The improved transport access for the many small manufacturing enterprises established in the Shoalhaven will also be a boon. I reiterate the flow-on effects to local business: increased industrial viability and vitality; economic growth, including further industrial development and employment; and attraction of larger industries to the region. It is estimatand ed that there will be 186 person-years of employment directly from the construction. Finally, I would like to outline the most fundamental reason for trunk road 92, that being that the four existing routes between the Southern Tablelands and the coast are narrow, winding and dangerous. The road will provide a high standard alignment safe for caravans, trucks and all vehicles and reduce travel demands on other routes such as the Kangaroo Valley road and the Hume Highway. The construction of this road will be a key plank in the reinvigoration of an economy and area with incredible potential. If the government decides in favour of this road, it will be forever remembered as the government that believed in the Shoalhaven and the government that invested in Gilmore. Unemployment",129
203,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"As part of my electoral duties over the past weekend, I attended two ALP branch meetings at Riverstone and Marayong South in my electorate. I would like to cover three political issues that I mentioned at those meetings. They were: firstly, the appalling lack of success that this government has had in reducing unemployment; secondly, some steps that should be taken to overcome our major unemployment problem; and, thirdly, the effects of the budget on low income people. Firstly, as far as the employment situation is concerned, at every meeting that I am able to attend on almost a monthly basis, I can refer to business surveys which say that unemployment is not going to fall. These surveys are from employer organisations, banks and sometimes government organisations. The one I referred to over the last weekend was a business survey produced by the National Bank in which 70 per cent of companies surveyed stated that there would be no short-term solution to unemployment as a result of the workplace reform legislation. Prior to that, I was able to refer to the Bureau of Statistics survey which showed that, in some 300 firms surveyed, over the next 12 months there would be a squeeze on profits there would still be a cutback on employment growth. All this is against the background of the passing of the workplace reform legislation, which the government told us was going to solve many of our long-term unemployment problems. But, clearly, it has not. The government has three problems in the employment area. One is the working poor-a large number of low income people who are simply not getting enough wages to make ends meet. The second one is the one referred to by the previous speaker-that is, youth unemployment and the long-term unemployed. The third area of concern is that, where there is job growth, it is in low wage, part-time and casual employment. It is certainly not in areas that are going to have a major impact on unemployment in this country. If I was asked to look at some solutions as to what the government should be doing-and I know this will not be appreciated particularly well by the government members. I would say that I believe the government should be looking at the labour market programs that the previous government introduced. There has been a lot of misconception here. There were many good programs. I do believe that from time to time we hear praise from the other side for some of these programs. One of the programs which I was involved in was locking in a traineeship with new work opportunities. This actually gave 12 months employment to long-term unemployed people which simply meant that, at the end of that period, they had had 12 months employment, they were job ready and in a fairly good position to seek other employment. Another program I was involved in in western Sydney was run by the area consultative committee. It was called jobs west. This program targeted some 4,000 positions and over the period of about three months they actually obtained 7,000 positions. I think this was an extraordinarily good result. I believe that the government should continue to fund skillshare organisations, the Salvation Army and other organisations that have a certain amount of expertise in solving our unemployment problem. Another area which I think we should be looking at is tariff reductions. I believe there is a strong argument, in this period of high unemployment where we are struggling to protect some of our basic manufacturing industries--<.:ertainly the motor manufacturing industry was an extraordinarily important industry for this country-for what I would see as a tariff pause. During the Fraser government, when I was a trade union official, we were encouraged to have what was called a wage pause. I think we could tum that around and say that there is a good argument for a tariff pause to protect our basic manufacturing industry. In the state that I come from, New South Wales, we do not have any manufacturing plants but we do have component manufacturing plants which feed off the major car manufacturers. This is extraordinarily important. Another area that I think the government could well look at is the area of giving wage increases to low income people. (Time expired) Woods, Senator Bob",130
204,Mr WILLIAMS,ADJOURNMENT,I seek your indulgence to clarify an answer I gave in question time today.,131
205,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Indulgence is granted.,131
206,Mr WILLIAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Banks (Mr Melham) asked me about the date upon which the Australian Federal Police executed a search warrant in relation to Senator Woods's premises. In my answer, I indicated that the AFP advised me that they were intending to execute a search warrant on Senator Woods's premises. There is some debate about what it was that I said as to the date. Irrespective of what I said or irrespective of what Hansard might record, my distinct recollection is that we learnt that the AFP were intending to execute the search warrant on the day before they actually did it, that is, the warrant was executed on the 21 st. We learnt about it on the 20th. I hope that that clarifies any",131

208,Mr WILLIAMS,ADJOURNMENT,January. Parliament House,131
209,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to highlight an issue of concern in the management of this place, our magnificent Parliament House. This building and its surrounding gardens and lawns are an immense source of pride to me. They are symbolic of our democratic parliamentary system which is the envy of many countries throughout the world. Like many other parliamentarians, I try to keep my level of fitness at a reasonable standard to enable me to perform my best under the very stressful rigours and ridiculously long hours-looking at the clock tonight-that are demanded of federal parliamentarians. To do this, on most mornings I go for a brisk walk around the precincts of Parliament House, a distance, I am told, of approximately two kilometres. Then I divert through the gardens and lawns surrounding the building. Each day I marvel at the magnificent way these grounds are maintained. Only this morning, while waiting for the start of an early morning seminar, I had the opportunity to look out from the Queen's Terrace towards the old Parliament House and across to the Australian War Memorial and marvel at the magnificent environment in which we are privileged to work and live. To add to the significance of this scene, right on cue a large kangaroo bounded across the manicured lawns situated between this place and the old Parliament House. I marvelled at the contrast of this tranquil scene and that of the peak hour traffic just 100 metres to the left. The many hundreds of thousands of visitors, both from Australia and overseas, who marvel at the design and architecture of this magnificent Australian building enter through the main public entrance. Every day the dedicated staff of parliament work tirelessly to ensure that this area is in immaculate condition, as is befitting the main entrance of apr national parliament, and that the lawns and gardens are in pristine condition to welcome visitors. However, there is one issue which has caused me no end of aggravation since becoming a member of this place-the practice of placing the yellow and black road barriers at the front of the building. These barriers are permanently placed on the roadway opposite the main entrance of Parliament House so that they may be used for crowd control. They always give the impression that something is under construction. I realise that these barriers are used to enable orderly and law abiding rallies to participate in the process of democratic government and can be used at short notice. In addition, these barriers are used on occasions of great national pride such as the arrival of the Governor General for the opening of a new parliament. Surely, with the vast engineering expertise available within this building and a significant maintenance budget, an alternative form of moving barriers could be design. At the very least, the barriers should be painted a different colour to make them look less visually intrusive. Would it not be possible to provide a suitable storage area for these barriers when they are not required, or even possible to construct some form of permanent fixture which could be used in different configurations depending on the particular needs at the time. I appeal to you, Mr Speaker, to investigate, in cooperation with the President of the Senate, the possibility of the removal of these particularly ugly barriers.",131
210,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Your appeal will not be lost, and certainly will not fall on deaf ears. It being 11 o'clock, the debate is interrupted. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Cadman to move That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment 1996; Customs Tariff Amendment (No.2) 1996; Farm Household Support Amendment 1996; Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment (No.3) 1996; and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 1996. Mr Neville to move That this House: (1) recognises the contribution of many forms of legitimate franchising to a vibrant small business sector; (2) expresses its concern at exploitive and immoral business practices which have infiltrated sections of the industry; (3) deplores such practices as kick-backs, churning, non-transparent master franchising arrangements and the unconscionable use of corporate structures to avoid on-going accountability; and (4) calls on the Government, by way of appropriate regulation and promotion of the Franchising Code of Practice, to eliminate exploitive and illegal practices in the franchising industry.

The following answers to questions were circulated: 1991 Census: Refusal to Complete Forms (Question No. 799) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 8 October 1996: (I) How many persons (a) refused to complete the 1991 Census form and (b) were successfully prosecuted for their refusal. (2) How many persons were successfully prosecuted for refusing to complete Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) surveys in each year since 1991. (3) Why are the Census and ABS surveys compulsory. (4) What surveys has the ABS conducted since 1991 which were not compulsory. (5) What reliability can be placed on non-compulsory surveys if compulsion is necessary to ensure an unbiased sample. Business Surveys o Household Surveys(l) (I) excludes Population Censuses (3) The word 'compulsory' is not used in Australian statistics legislation, and the term 'compulsory survey' has no accepted meaning. The Census and Statistics Act 1905 provides the Statistician with two powers for the collection of data. 'The Statistician .... may, either orally or in writing, request (emphasis added) a person' to fill up a form (Section 10(3» or to answer a question (Section 11(1». No offence is committed if a person refuses such a request. The Act also provides that 'the Statistician may, by notice in writing ..... direct (emphasis added) the person' to fill up a form. (Section 10(4» or to answer a specified question (Section II (2». Failure to comply with such a direction without reasonable excuse is, in respect of each day, an offence subject to a fine not exceeding $100 (Section 14(1». In all its statistical collections the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) first requests businesses NA (6) If non-compulsory surveys give valid results why (a) are not all ABS surveys optional and (b) does the ABS threaten persons who consider that the surveys invade their privacy. (7) What databases are accessed by the ABS in order to get the names and addresses of persons to be surveyed or who refuse to or neglect to fill in forms. (8) What is the minimum compliance rate which gives meaningful data. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I)(a) 5,234 (I)(b) 91 (2)1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 (to date) 5 4 o and householders to provide the data it seeks ie. the ABS seeks willing cooperation. While the power to direct persons to respond is generally available, by the collections being tabled before Parliament under Section 6(3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975, these powers are rarely needed or used. In these circumstances, it is not possible to define ABS surveys as compulsory or not compulsory. (4) It is not possible to define ABS surveys as 'compulsory' or 'not compulsory'-see response to Question (3). However, it is possible to say that five surveys since 1991 were conducted on an overtly voluntary basis as follows: Survey of Embassies and Consulates 1992-93 Study of Workload Placed on Small Business by Government Paperwork (1992) Population Survey Monitor (quarterly from August 1993 to May 1996) Queensland Day Survey (1995) Women's Safety Survey (1996) In addition, some household collections contained some questions which householders were advised were voluntary e.g. the question on religion in the 1996 Population Census. (5) It is not possible to define ABS surveys as 'compulsory' or 'not compulsory'-see response to Question (3). However, in all its surveys the ABS undertakes extensive testing to ensure the collection methodology used will provide reliable data of sufficient quality to meet the needs of the key users. (6)(a) It is not possible to define ABS surveys as 'compulsory', 'not compulsory' or 'optional'-see response to Question (3). ABS and overseas experience (eg see ABS Annual Report 1987-88 pI9-21) shows that surveys conducted on an overtly voluntary basis typically produce data of lower quality. ABS seeks to provide high quality data in all its collections. Experience shows that this is best obtained by seeking the willing cooperation of selected householdslbusinesses but with the power to direct a response being available should it be needed. On occasions, particularly if the content of the survey is sensitive (e.g. the Women's Safety Survey) a survey may be conducted without the power to direct a response being available, providing field testing has shown that data of sufficient quality can be collected. (b) ABS does not threaten persons who consider surveys invade their privacy. (7) External databases of names and addresses of persons are rarely used to select samples for ABS household surveys. A recent example was the use of a Commonwealth Employment Service list in the sample selection for a survey of employment and unemployment patterns. The names and addresses of those who do not respond to a household survey or the Population Census are obtained from the ABS contact with the household in question. (8) There is no single compliance rate which can be universally applied to all surveys to give 'meaningful data'. The ABS aims to produce data of sufficient quality to meet the needs of the users. Australian National: Capital Stock (Question No. 807) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 10 October 1996: (I) What capital stock does Australian National (AN) own and operate. (2) How many passenger trains does AN operate and which routes do they travel. (3) Are there any plans to vary these routes; if so, will the Indian-Pacific continue to operate on the western NSW route through Broken Hill. (4) What are the average passenger loads for each train. (5) What charges apply to passengers using AN services. (6) How many passengers (a) join and (b) alight from the Indian-Pacific at stops along the LithgowParkes-Broken Hill segments of its route. (7) How does the western NSW Indian-Pacific route through Broken Hill compare with that of the Melbourne route in respect of (a) passengers, (b) running costs, (c) length of route, (d) travelling time, (e) terrain and (f) profit and loss. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: AN has advised that: (I) AN owned rolling stock assets (locomotives and wagons) valued at $21.734m as at 30 June 1996 of which $5.186m was attributed to its passenger business unit. No locomotives are specifically allocated to the passenger business, but typically CLP class locomotives are in use on passenger trains on any particular day. AN has 214 passenger cars, of which 14 are broad gauge and not in use. (2) AN operates three passenger trains, the Indian Pacific (Sydney-Adelaide-Perth), the Ghan (Adelaide-Alice Springs) and the Overland (AdelaideMelbourne). (3) AN's passenger operations are to be offered for sale under the package of rail reforms announced on 24 November 1996, but there are no plans to cancel the Indian Pacific service through Broken Hill. (4) Indian Pacific: 81 % Ghan: 75% Overland: 68% (5) Fares vary according to the route, but as at 10 October 1996, typical fares were: Route First sitting Adelaide-Melbourne Adelaide-Sydney not available Adelaide-Alice not available Springs Adelaide-Perth not available Sydney-Perth not available * First class sitting was withdrawn from 1 November 1996. A number of groups are entitled to concessional pension is entitled to travel at 50% discount (6)(a) and (b) Passenger numbers Lithgow Bathurst Blayney Orange Parkes Condobolin Ivanhoe Menindee Broken Hill (7)(a) and (b) The Indian Pacific has not operated via Melbourne on an ongoing basis and so only projections exist for this route. AN has advised that these projections are commercial-in-confidence and not available. 7(c) Sydney-Perth via Melbourne: 4'""150 km Sydney-Perth via Broken Hill and Adelaide: 4356 km 7(d) Sydney-Perth via Melbourne: approximately 64 hours Sydney-Perth via Broken Hill and Adelaide: approximately 60 hours 7(e) The route from Sydney to Adelaide via Broken Hill includes the steep climb through the Blue Mountains and hilly country through the NSW central west, otherwise it is flat. The route via Melbourne includes hilly country from Sydney to about Junee and a steep climb through the Adelaide Hills, otherwise it is largely flat. The route from Adelaide to Perth is fairly flat except the climb through the Darling Range east of Perth. (7)(f) Only projections exist for the operation via Melbourne.

Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Investigations undertaken after polling in 1996 found two instances of votes recorded after the elector had died. However, in each case the evidence was inconclusive. The two were marked on ordinary lists, hence the possibility of polling official error exists. (b) Following a general election, letters and reminders are sent seeking information as to why a name was marked off a certified list more than once. Replies often provide information which when compared with information provided by other electors in response to non-voters notices, reveal cases of polling official error. Such errors are generally where the name of the wrong elector is marked on the certified list, resulting in that elector having his/her name marked twice and no mark appearing against the name of the other elector. In such cases a multiple vote would not be recorded. Similarly, where an elector replies that he/she only voted once, this must be accepted in the absence of other conclusive evidence to the contrary. NSW Banks Barton Bennelong Berowra Blaxland Bradfield Calare Charlton Chifley Cook Cowper Cunningham Dobell Eden-Monaro Farrer Fowler Gilmore Grayndler Greenway Gwydir Hughes Hume Hunter Kingsford-Smith Lindsay Lowe Lyne Macarthur Mackellar Macquarie Mitchell Newcastle New England North Sydney Page Other replies indicate evidence which is inconclusive, that is where the elector does not reply to correspondence or letters are returned unclaimed. In these cases there is no evidence of a multiple vote, simply a multiple mark, that cannot be further investigated. There are also other replies where the elector admitted to voting more than once.

Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My answers to the honourable member's questions are based on information provided by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which is currently conducting the National Inquiry into Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Cases of admitted Letters returned Letters not multiple voting undelivered answered 60 16 42 9 6 9 3 0 0 2 1 1 1 0 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 4 2 12 1 8 6 0 0 5 4 47 11 31 33 5 3 59 2 6 69 8 1 65 0 4 53 1 0 279 16 14 4 0 2 5 0 4 4 1 3 13 9 4 17 113 Islander Children from their Families ('the Inquiry'). (a) I am advised that several estimates have been provided to the Inquiry of the numbers of children removed. Historian Dr Peter Read has estimated that 100,000 children were forcibly removed from their families. Official records have been acknowledged by a number of State governments to underestimate the number of children removed. (b) I am advised that children were forcibly removed from their families in all States and Territories. (c) I am advised that children were removed at all ages. (d) I am advised that there is evidence that forced removal of indigenous children from their families began soon after non-Aboriginal occupation of Australia. Most legislation which enabled the widespread removals was first enacted in the first decade of this century. Removals continued officially until the 1970s. However, they may have continued beyond that time, tither through the unconscious application of assimilationist policies, or through culturally insensitive assessments of indigenous family life. (e) I am advised that the education provided in State and church institutions was usually very limited (to less than secondary level). Commonwealth Triennial Capital Development Funding (Question No. 924) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: (1) Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 465 (Hansard, 21 August 1996, page 3515), is the Minister able to say whether the WA Government has changed its priorities for Commonwealth Institution 1997 Murdoch University 1998 Curtin University of Technology Murdoch University The Western Australian Government (2) Western Australian officials held discussions with officials from the Minister's Department on priorities for CDP funding in 1999 as part of the annual consultations between Commonwealth and Staterrerritory higher education authorities. These discussions included the provision of higher education facilities at Kalgoorlie/Esperance and at Midland and the development of electronic infrastructure delivery systems. The Minister has now announced the 1999 CDP allocations. Western Australian universities will receive $5.5 million in CDP allocations in 1999. Curtin University of Technology has been allocated $3 million for the Kalgoorlie University College. Part of this allocation has been provided for the development of the Esperance Tertiary Centre, a higher educationff AFE annexe of the Kalgoorlie College. $2.5 million has been earmarked for Western Australian institutions to support infrastructure development in the Perth region, especially collaborative and electronic projects. The funding has been notionally allocated to Edith Cowan University. Provision of the funds is dependent on the development by the State and relevant institutions of a strategic plan addressing Capital Development Pool funding for 1997 and 1998; if so, how. (2) Has the WA Government advised the Commonwealth of its priorities for Commonwealth Capital Development Pool funding for tertiary institutions for 1999; if so, what are they. (3) Has the Commonwealth determined the 1999 Capital Development Pool allocations; if so, what are the allocations for WA; if no; when will they be determined and announced. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's: question. (1) In her higher education Budget statement on 9 August 1996 the Minister confirmed that the Capital Development Pool (CDP) allocations for 1997 and 1998 would flow as previously announced. The allocations to Western Australian universities (in 1997-99 funding report prices) are as follows: Project $m Rockingham 6.173 Ka1goorlie 3.053 Rockingham 7.125 is in agreement with these allocations. the rational and effective placement and use of both existing and any new infrastructure, potentially including the development of the Midland site.

In only one of these, the Carabo 1, did the incident fall within Australian jurisdiction. At the time of the incident, this vessel was in Australian waters and had an Australian pilot on board. The investigation was carried out by the Marine Incident Investigation Unit of my Department. The incident is considered, in part, to be due to pilot error. No punitive action has been taken. Investigation into the other incidents is another flag State's responsibility and it is not known whether or not these have been carried out. AMSA has requested copies of the investigations into the losses of the Uniceb and Guernsey Express from the flag States but to date these have not been received. Crew Incidents: MV Glory Cape (Question No. 968)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (I) Is he able to say what action has been taken to (a) identify those persons responsible for the injuries inflicted upon, and subsequent death of, Mr Santose Budi, radio operator of the MY Glory Cape pump problems. No livestock carrier sank or disappeared in 1994 or 1995. In 1996 the vessel, Carabo 1, experienced seagoing difficulties when it struck a rock. In the same year the vessel, Uniceb, is assumed to have sunk following an engine room fire and the vessel Guernesy Express, foundered in a cyclone.

(2) Has action been taken by the Government to ensure that the MY Glory Cape's flag state investigated Mr Budi's death and prosecuted those responsible. (3) Has the MY Glory Cape called at Australian ports since the incident; if not, is he able to provide details on the ship's present status and location. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)(a) and (b) The investigation into, and any action in relation to, the injuries sustained by crew members and the death of Mr Budi is a matter for the West Australian State Police Department. (2) The ship was detained by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) for safety reasons which were resolved before the ship's departure from Australia. AMSA has made the appropriate safety issue reports to the flag State, International Maritime Organization and the classification society. AMSA has not provided a report to the flag State on the death of Mr Budi and the crew injuries. Any further action by AMSA is dependent on the outcome of the West Australian inquest which has not yet been held. (3) AMSA's records indicate that MV Glory Cape has not returned to Australia since this incident occurred. Lloyd's Maritime Information Services have advised that they have no record of any change in Table 1: Reported movements of MV Glory Cape Port Dampier Bayuguan Panama Canal New Orleans Panama Canal Balboa Mizushima Richards bay Sines Port Cartier Mobile New Orleans Panama Canal Tomakomai Yokohama Chiba Panama Canal New Orleans Panama Canal Kinuura Yokkaichi Kinuura Toyohashi Vancouver Vancouver - Not known.

(5) Who were the vessel's (a) beneficial owners, (b) managers, (c) charterers, (d) insurers and (e) cargo owners. (6) When was the vessel built, where was it registered and with what classification society was it classed. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Uniceb sailed from Fremantle on 23 August 1996 with 67,488 Australian sheep on board. (2) No. AMSA investigated complaints made by the local ITF representative relating to crew accommodation conditions and provisions on board.

There were only two items reported at this time. One involved access to rescue boats which was left with the master to rectify. The other involved topping up an air pressure vessel which is used to operate remote engine room controls. Uniceb subsequently departed from Fremantle twice, including her last voyage. Only inspections under Marine Orders Part 43 (Cargo and Cargo Handling-Livestock) were carried out on these two occasions and no deficiencies were reported. (4) The chief engineer is reported to have drowned during the first abandonment of the vessel subsequent to the fire on board. Details of the incident are not available and AMSA has requested the Panamanian Authorities to provide a copy of their report into the incident. (5)(a) The beneficial owners are Mazamet Shipping, Panama (b) The managers are Accord Ship Management, Mumbai (Bombay). (c) The charterers are Wellard Rural Export, WA. (d) The insurers are unknown.

Office Fortitude Valley CES Mitchelton CES Brisbane CBD CES (b) The number of staff employed Office Fortitude Valley CES Mitchelton CES Brisbane CBD CES* Commonwealth Employment Service Offices: Electoral Division of Brisbane (Question No. 982) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 21 November 1996: (I) For each Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) office in the electoral division of Brisbane, how many full time and part time staff were employed (a) at the end of 1995 and (b) in November 1996. (2) Will CES offices in the electoral division of Brisbane be closed in 1997; if so, (a) how many staff (i) will be retained by the Minister's Department, (ii) are anticipated to be relocated to other Departments and (iii) are anticipated will accept redundancies. (3) Is the Minister able to say how many relocated staff will be accepted by other Departments. (4) In each CES office in the electoral division of Brisbane which has been closed, how many staff (a) have been retained by the Minister's Department, (b) received redundancy payments and (c) were relocated to other Departments. (5) Is the Minister able to say (a) which Department of Social Security Offices will undertake tasks previously performed by the closed CES offices and (b) how many additional staff will be employed by those offices. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In relation to the CES offices in the electoral division of Brisbane: (a) The number of staff employed in those offices at the end of 1995 was: Full Time Staff Part Time Staff 40 o 28 4 40 2 in those offices in November 1996 was: Full Time Staff Part Time Staff 62 o 23 4 o o * The Brisbane CBD CES was one of the twenty response to reductions in Departmental running voluntary redundancies Australia wide. (2) Until the formal commencement of the employment placement market, which is expected to be in December 1997, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETY A) will maintain services to its clients in the electorate of Brisbane through the CES and Employment Assistance Australia (EAA). From December 1997, the Department of Social Security (DSS) network of offices will form the basis of the new independent service delivery agency that will provide a single point of delivery for Commonwealth services, including income support, previously delivered by DSS, and student assistance and aspects of employment assistance, previously delivered by the CES. The existing CES network of offices and its case management arm, EAA, will form the basis of the corporatised public enterprise, with future locations depending on its market share and the extent to which it is directed by the Government to meet community service obligations in certain locations. (a)(i) Around 3,000 DEETY A staff will transfer to the new agency during 1997. (ii) Although details have not yet been finalised, it is anticipated that approximately 26 per cent of CES staff in the electorate of Brisbane will transfer to the service delivery agency, within the DSS portfolio, to perform those functions DEETY A will purchase from the agency. (iii) The scale of a voluntary redundancy programme, if necessary, will be determined when the number of contracts won by the public employment placement enterprise is known. (3) There are no arrangements for staff to be relocated to other Departments. Staff who wish to move elsewhere in the APS before any transfer, are able to apply for other APS positions in the usual way (that is through Gazette vacancies or by Minister for Human Services and Health Minister for Family Services Parliamentary Secretary Total (b) Hire car costs paid by my Department Minister for Human Services & Health (previous government) Minister for Family Services (previous government) Parliamentary Secretary (previous government) Sub-total for previous government: six CES offices which closed earlier this year in costs for 1996-97 and against a backdrop of 2,500 contacting Government agencies to request a transfer). (4) The Brisbane CBD CES was closed on 23 August 1996. (a) 32 staff were retained by DEETY A with the majority relocated to the nearby Fortitude Valley CES office. (b) Ten staff received voluntary redundancy packages. (c) No staff were relocated to other Departments. (5) The responsibility for determining which DSS offices will undertake the tasks previously performed by CES offices, and how many additional staff will be employed by those offices, lies with the Minister for Social Security. As indicated, around 26 per cent of CES staff in the electorate of Brisbane will transfer to the service delivery agency but these staff will be deployed in DSS offices according to available accommodation, client flows and other local considerations.

All of this was Australian made. Mobile Telephone Complaints (Question No. 1077) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 10 December 1996: (1) Has Telstra received complaints concerning involuntary actions such as bumps causing calls to be made on mobile phones. (2) Is Telstra researching a mechanism being installed in mobile phones to prevent inadvertent calls through involuntary actions. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Telstra has advised that it has received, from time to time, customer comment to the effect that the customer may have inadvertently made a call by accidentally pressing a key on their mobile phone. However, Telstra has no evidence to suggest that this is an area of major concern to its customers. (2) Telstra does not manufacture mobile telephones. However, if a design fault became apparent to Telstra, Telstra would alert the manufacturer of the phone to the problem. I understand that some mobile phones have a feature, which enables the key pad to be locked, enabling incoming calls but preventing outgoing calls. Refugee Advice and Casework Service (Question No. 1078) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 10 December 1996: (1) Is it a fact that (a) the Refugee Advice and Casework Service (RACS) of New South Wales will cease operation and (b) his Department reached agreement to provide sufficient funds for RACS (NSW) to continue operating; the Government meet its requirement, as a signatory to the International Convention on Refugees, to provide legal assistance to refugees. (2) Is he able to say whether Legal Aid (NSW) has refused to take on any casework or any other business handled by RACS (NSW); if so, how will legal representation and assistance be provided for those existing cases which were not commenced by RACS (NSW) and were referred to his Department. (3) What arrangements will be made for future refugee legal advice and casework. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourAustralian able member's question is as follows: (1) In a letter dated 11 December 1996, the Treasurer of RACS (NSW), Ken Hastie, confirmed the closure of the RACS (NSW) casework service, effective November 22 1996. On the basis of budget estimates provided by RACS (NSW), my Department has assessed that the conditions and fees in the contract being offered are adequate for RACS to remain viable and continue providing its services to asylum seekers. The provision of application assistance to asylum seekers is not a requirement under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Proto.col relating to the Status of Refugees (but see response to Question 3. below). (2) RACS (NSW) has acknowledged its contractual responsibility to complete its current casework commitments. All new Application Assistance cases will be referred to existing contractors in tum, including Legal Aid (NSW). Under established procedures, if workload commitments preclude a contractor from accepting a case, then that case will be referred to other contractors appointed by the Government. (3) Other current Application Assistance contractors in NSW will be approached by my Department to ascertain their capacity to provide additional services for the duration of 1996/97. Early in 1997, my Department intends to put out to open public tender contracts for providing Application Assistance services during 1997/98. Stocker, Dr John (Question No. 1079) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Science and Technology upon notice, on 11 December 1996: (1) What remuneration is paid to Dr John Stocker has not in the office of Chief Scientist.

(10) Will the granting of the contract to ISSCIIBM exclude that company from future Russell Development systems tenders. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In August/September 1996 Civil & Civic carried out a tender evaluation to select a company to masterplan and design an integrated IT and Communication cabling system for the Russell Offices project. Civil & Civic is responsible for the design and construction aspects of the project but must obtain Defence approval to the engagement of consultants and sub-contractors to perform the design and construction work. (2) A short listing process was not used for this tender. Defence gave approval for Civil & Civic to invite seven companies to tender for the design work. This list included the five companies from the Defence Preferred System Integrators panel (Aspect Computing, BHP Information Technologies, CSC Australia, IBM, and Telstra Corporation Ltd.,) and two other companies, Cray Communication and UNISYS. Three companies (Telstra, Cray and UNISYS) declined to tender. (3) The four tenders received were evaluated by a Civil & Civic tender panel which included an independent Industry expert from Linc IT. The tender panel recommendation was approved by Defence. (4) Tenders were evaluated against pre-set criteria that aimed at selecting a company with resources and expertise to masterplan and design a cabling system for the Russell Offices project. There was not a requirement for Civil & Civic to report on or select a systems and hardware aligned contractor. The design when completed in March 1997 will be used in a tender document to select a company to supply and install the integrated cabling system at the Russell Offices. (5) Defence accepted the Civil & Civic recommendation which was IBM. (6) A contract was awarded to IBM in September 1996; (a) Civil & Civic ranked IBM ahead of the three other companies. (b) Defence reviewed the tender panel report and approved the Civil & Civic recommendation to award the consultancy to IBM. (7) The requirement for an integrated cabling system was identified by a Departmental Working Group and endorsed by a Defence Committee which included an Officer who is no longer in the ADF. IBM nominated this Officer in its tender with responsibility for senior level liaison within the Department. The Officer has not worked on the project due to his separation from the ADF being deferred for medical reasons. (a) The Officer left the ADF on the 8 January 1997. He is not an employee of IBM but works as an independent consultant. (b) Civil & Civic prepared the tender documents and undertook the tender assessment. The Officer referred to above had no involvement in the tender process or the decision to select IBM. (8) IBM were selected above the other three companies on the basis that their offer more closely met all the pre-set criteria for: (a) Resources offered. (b) Project understanding and ability to add value. Period of service required of officers after special as detailed in the schedule to the Circumstances of Training, Duty, Service Outside Australia or Appointment of OfficSerial ers I. Officers who complete basic pilot training courses. 2. Officers who complete basic navigator ing courses. (c) Availability of resource. (9) A former ADF Officer is working as an independent consultant for IBM on the project. He separated from the ADF 3 years ago. (10) The consultancy is for the design of a generic cabling system. This design will allow Industry (including IBM) to be on an equal footing to bid for the supply and installation of the cabling system.
