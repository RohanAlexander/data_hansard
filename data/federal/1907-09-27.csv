1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister if his attention has been drawn, to the fact that the two.maii 'steam-ship companies contemplate increasing their rates for the carriage of butter an extent which will require the butterof exporting companies to pay from £ 5 0 , to £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 more per annum than they pay now, and that it is to be stipulated that shippers who contract to send any part their export by the steamers of the Federal Houlder-Shire line will have to pay an extra 3d. per box for any butter that they may send by the mail steamers.",14

As the matter is I shall be much obliged if the honourable member will give notice of the question; not because I wish to put him off in anycerned way, but because I think that ness of the position requires that the Government should have an opportunity consider all the surrounding circumstances. ALLEGED COAL COMBINE .",15
4,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I to call the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the existence of the Coal Comwages bine to which I referred last week. I am following this matter up so carefully, because if there is a combination to rob the people by increasing the price of coal, there will be a corresponding increase in the every other commodity. Mr Scott Fell, in an interview which appears in Age, is reported to have said that a vessel which has always carried coal to New land, recently could not obtain a cargo coal, and had to take other loading. He says that he can give evidence in support ests. of his statement. We know that when men enter into a conspiracy public, they do not sign""documents which would inculpate them.",15

Will he also appoint a - Royal Commission to investigate the operations of the steam-ship companies' ring and the collieries combine, so that those concerned may be examined' under oath, and reliable evidence obtained?

28,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Moreton) [10.40] - I wish to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public 1 importance, viz., "" The existence of a shipping combine, and its detrimental effect on the community.""",16

34,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I ask honourable members to assist me in maintaining proper order in the conduct of the business of the Alleged Shipping Combine. House. It was complained just now, when a Minister was' answering a question, that he could not be heard. ' The reason was that too many private conversatipns, carried on in loud tones, were proceeding in different parts of the Chamber. If honourable members wish to know what is taking place, they will have to exercise much more restraint in expressing disapproval of what is said, and there must be a greater avoidance of private conversation than there has been recently. Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",16
35,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Althoug h there is CADETS - business of pressing importance before the House, I feel constrained to take this action, because one of the steam-ship companies which has joined the combination to which I wish to refer, is subsidized by the Government for the carrying of Commonwealth mails to London and elsewhere, and because the tenders for the new mail! We can- contract close on the 3rd October next. I think that there should be power under the Australian Industries Preservation Act to deal with this combination, which is certainly detrimental to Australian interests.",16

39,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The honourable member for South Sydney says that the members of the Labour Party have been saying this for months, but I , as ohe of those who are largely interested in the export of a certain line ofproduce, have been seriously engaged for years in fighting the combine. Things have come to such a pass that we are now catching at the last straw to save ourselves from it . As a butter producer, I speak more particularly of the effects of the combine in connection with the exportation of perishable produce. Two or three years ago, we were under the not the heel of a shipping combine, and had to pay 3s. 6d. a box for the exportation of butter.  member's attitude when the Commonwealth, wished to regulate freights? He was opposed to it . Mr - SPEAKER - I would remind the honourable member that question time has passed.",16
40,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The honourable member for Maranoa is entirely under a misapprehension. I shall deal later on with that phase of the question. At that time the price was considered too high, and A move was made to secure a reduction.. The result was that a line of cargo steamers was brought into competition with the mail steam-ship company and offered us a freight of is. 9d. per box. When the mail steam-ship companies found that we were able to secure this service, they, after mature consideration and in the light of years of experience in the carriage of butter to London, made us a definite offer to carry our butter at JS. iod. per box. I take it that companies having such extensive experience as that possessed by the mail steam-ship lines should know whether or not that would be a payable rate. A contract was entered into with what was known as the three-line service by some of the shippers, whilst another section of shippers entered into a contract with the mail steam-ship companies. Those contracts extended over something like twO years. That made by the Victorian shippers terminated some time ago; but the contract made by Queensland shippers will not expire until the end of the year. When these contracts were falling in there was. a natural desire to enter into a new arrangement, and at a conference of shippers held in Sydney on 16th July last, representatives of the five lines were asked to state the conditions on which a contract for the carriage of butter to London and other oversea ports would be entered into by them. The conditions stipulated that the Combine should have the carriage of the whole of the exportable butter at 9-i6d. per lb. in the case of the mail steam-ship companies, and Jd. per lb. in the case of the cargo steam-ship lines. These rates were considered to be too high, and no agreement was entered into. I propose to read a clause from the agreement that was submitted for the first time at the Sydney Conference to which I have referred, and I should like honourable members, and particularly the honourable member for Barrier who takes a great interest in shipping matters, to give their attentionThe shipper agrees to ship during the currency of this contract by the steamers of the shipping companies all butters consigned to the United Kingdom belonging to the shipper, or in which the shipper may be in any manner directly or indirectly interested, or over which the shipper has or may or can have or acquire during the currency of this contract any control, directly or indirectly, and whether personally, by his agent or tenant, or by or as subcontractor. .During this contract the shipper shall not acquire, have, or take any interest or control directly or indirectly in any butter shipped or to be shipped otherwise than under this contract, or, under any contract with the shipping companies similar hereto, and shall not become a party to the shipment of or permit to be shipped hereunder or under any similar contract any butter of any person, firm, or company who may have shipped butter by any steamships other than those to be provided hereunder, unless with the sanction in writing of the shipping companies. And the shipper furthermore agrees to furnish, if and when required by the shipping companies, the names and addresses of all persons, firms, companies, factories, creameries, and other producers or intending exporters, over or in connection with whose export of butter the shipper now has or hereafter may have, or now has or may hereafter acquire, directly or indirectly, any control or interest. I wish to show that this matter has been taken up in all the States, and with that object in view, I shall read a few extracts from reports that have been made regarding it. I was a delegate to the Svdney Conference, and am therefore in a position to know what took place there. Colonel Pleasents, writing to his factories, saidYou are aware' that the rates at present being charged by the Five Lines Combine are 2S. 6d. for mails and 2S. 3d. for cargo lines, to all such as sign their contract, and. ship by their line. Any factory which does not sign the Five Lines Combine contract is being charged f d . ' per lb., equal to 2s. i r d . per box. Mr Mclntyre, who. manages a large business in Brisbane, in writing to his Board, saidAlthough nothing definite resulted from this Conference, it was made plainly evident that there would likely be certain alterations in shipping conditions which are not likely to find favourable acceptance amongst producers. The first is a proposed combination between the Orient, the P. and O., and what is known as the Three Line service, which comprises the White Star, Lund, and Aberdeen. The second is the usual sequence of such combines, namely, the raising of freights. It was mentioned that the freights by the mail boats would be raised to 9-r6d. per lb., and the slower boats to i d . per lb. On the basis of our last year's exports from this State, namely, 5,108 tons, this increase would represent a loss to the industry of over j£8,ooo. That would be Queensland's proportion of the loss. My own report to my company wasThe attached, draft agreement of the nroposed Five Line combination was submitted to the Conference, from which it will be seen that butter exporters have reason to be very much agitated about the carriage of their butler to London and other oversea ports. vance in rates at which butter will be is demanded, 3-i6d. per lb. by the mail and &d. by the three lines, personally, I condemn the combination on the principle that, combines lead to monopoly, and often extortion. If the honourable member for Maranoa were present he would recognise that we have been fighting the Combine, and not merely talking about if. Mr Robert Hay, of .bined Sydney, reportedThe Association feels that it is, in the best interests of the butter producers, that the posed shipping monopoly should not exist. The rates already submitted for consideration show an advance on last season's freight rates aggregating no less a sum than £55,000 on estimated export for the coming season, and this is a charge which must inevitably be borne by the producers. Then the Export Butter Freights CommitP. tee of Victoria reported as followsThe first-named was much interested in our subject, namely, butter freights to Britain, cause it is by his Department that tenders are being called for the carriage of Austhe tralian mails to Europe. That was a reference to the ex-Postmasteraccede GeneralHe deprecated the idea of making any contreat tract at present that extended beyond two seasons, as by that time steamers under a new mail contract might be available for the excan port of butter. This view, as well as the boats, opinion that any combination of steamers that would tend to 'create a monopoly, and raise the cost of such services to the producer, should be resisted, was warmly endorsed by the Federal ministers named. The resolution arrived at by the Vic- £40,000 torian Butter Shippers^ Association wasThat the butter shippers attending this meetseasons. ing respectfully decline - to enter into the posed freight contract with the five lines steamers in combination, but will be prepared Furtherto negotiate with the' mail steamer companies for the whole of the proportion of their refrigerated mail' steamer space available for export butter from New South Wales, reserving to themselves the right to ship any surplus by any other line or lines available. ' Mr AVAXSON - Poo r old "" Anti Sosh "" must be dead.",17
41,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I am surprised that honourable members cannot sink their party politics when dealing with a question of be this kind.,18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Neve r be surprised at Tory interjections from the Labour as corner.,18
43,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Comin g to a later date we find that the Victorian and other shippers have been making a move to compete with this Combine. Messrs. Osborne and Black of the Western. District Butter - Exporters' Association, in writing to their An adfactories as to the work of the Victorian carried Export Freight Committee at the Interboats, State Conference in Sydney, saidThey explained that they had been requested by the Minister for Agriculture and others to arrange a service which would provide for the carriage of all the butter from. Australia to London. The mail steamers could not carry all the butter, and they had therefore comwith the three companies mentioned in order to gi\K weekly clearances of all butter for export. They submitted an itinerary showing a service of forty-eight steamers to leaveproMelbourne during the"" twenty-six weeks of our export season. At the outset the Committee objected to being compelled to ship butter by only such steamers as were controlled by this the combination, and being prevented from shipping by other lines which provided refrigerated space for the carriage of produce to the United Khvirdom. This view was placed before the and O. and Orient companies. The committee intimated that they desired in the first instance to contract with these companies for the Victorian proportion of the refrigerated space beavailable in the mail steamers, arid to be free to arrange with other steamship companies for balance of the butter. The representatives of the mail companies absolutely refused to to the wishes of the committee. In effect their reply was- "" You must negotiate with the five lines, otherwise wTe decline to with you; we will give you a service such as you never previously had, with the. mail steamers to carry as much butter as they provide for, and with the P. and O. cargo and the White Star, Aberdeen, and Lund liners to take the balance."" ' Eventually the committee agreed to enter into negotiations with the five lines, and asked them to submit an offer of freights - The reply was 9-i6d. per lb. by mail steamers, and £d. per lb. by the cargo boats. This rate was an increase of About a year for Australia as compared with the freight charged during the two previous ' It was considered unreasonably high proby the committee, and an attempt was made of to obtain a reduction. This failed. Representatives of the P. and O. and Orient Companies .were then invited to attend the Conference. Mr Wesche and Mr D . Anderson attended. The - desire of the Conference, as expressed in the. resolution, was conveyed to them. They were most emphatic in refusing to accede to this request. They explained the service of steamers which the combined Companies were offering, and intimated that the? mail companies could ndt enter into negotiations, apart from the White Star, Aberdeen and. Lund lines. Asked whether they would prepared to consider an offer for a reduction on the 2s. 6d. and 2s. 3d. per box respectively, Mr Anderson replied that they would, a matter of courtesy-, receive such an offer, but they, could hold out, no hope that a reduction of the rates quoted would be made. The Orient Company has further intimated that the freight upon butter by the RMS. Orient, leaving Melbourne on 7th October next, will be 3s. 2,d. per box to non-contrac-tors, .whilst those: who. s'gn - the Combinecontract will be charged only 2s. 6d. per box. It is evident, therefore, that an attempt is being made by the Combine to get the shippers of butter more firmly within its .grip, and to break down the only opposition which now exists in the shape of the Fede-ral-Houlder-Shire Lines. If our shippers require cargo space upon the mail steamers they are compelled to enter into a contract to ship the whole of their butter, by those vessels, or to allow them the right to ship it by any other line that they may nominate/ The effect of entering into such a contract is to place our butter shippers entirely in the hands of the companies controlling the mail steamers. Then, when our butter exporters apply for space for, say, 1,000 boxes of butter, they may be told by those controlling the mail steamers, ""We can only take 250 boxes; the remaining 750 boxes must be shipped by the White Star, Aberdeen or Lund lines.""",18
44,Mr THOMAS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,What does the honourable member suggest should be done?,19
45,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I am coming to that. I ask that justice shall be done to the producers of Australia. I have no wish to say anything . detrimental to .the company which is at present carrying our mails. Those who have been connected with shipping business for any length of time must recognise that the Orient Company has rendered splendid service to Australia, and personally I should be very sorry to see its line of steamers withdrawn. But I do ask the Government what they intend to do in this matter.",19
46,Mr WEBSTER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"What does the honourable member suggest? Mr SINCLAIR. - The Government will - shortly be accepting tenders for a new mail contract. As I have already pointed out, one of the mail companies which is in the Combine will probably tender for that contract. Now, therefore, is the time for the Government to impose such conditions upon tenderers as will prevent, the recurrence of the evil of which I complain - during the next ten vears.",19
47,Mr WEBSTER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The honourable member is advocating Socialism..,19
48,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The honourable member may call it what he chooses, but I call it common sense. I admit, in all fairness to them, that the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies have behaved splendidly in that they have met the shippers of Australia in a truly Federal spirit. They have always refrained from extending to any portion of the Commonwealth conditions which they were not prepared to grant to any other portion. But I do complain .that they are now endeavouring to enter into an arrangement with our butter exporters under which the latter will be compelled to ship the whole of their produce by the mail steamers, at a great increase over the freightage rates which the companies charged two years ago when they were in competition with other lines. I ask the Government to take this matter into their serious consideration,, with a view to' seeing that in the new mail contract the state of things to which I have referred will not be allowed to continue. Mr THOMAS. - Will the honourable member limit his remedy to butter freights? * Mr SINCLAIR - Decidedl y not.",19
49,Mr THOMAS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Would he extend it to the passengers as well ?,19
50,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"At the present timeI am more, concerned with butter freights than with any other charges. I believe in the motto which affirms that the shoemaker should stick to his last, and while I am a member of this House I do not propose to talk upon subjects of which I know nothing.",19
51,Mr MCDONALD,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Kennedy) [11.10] I am rather pleased that the - honourable member for 'Moreton has brought this' matter forward, and I am especially' pleased with the broad manner in which he has done so. I am glad that he has called attention to the existence of the shipping ring, and to its detrimental effect upon the industries of Australia. This is a question in which I have taken a keen interest for some time past, and I may add that a littlje while ago I had the honour to be a member of the Royal Commission which inquired into the matter of shipping freights and shipping conditions generally in the Commonwealth. Whilst. I confess that' the honourable member for Moreton came forward and gave that Commission valuable evidence, I exceedingly regret that a number of prominent persons interested in the same line, of business as himself did not tender the information at their disposal. Mr SINCLAIR. - They could not do so, because they were under the Combine. Mr ""MCDONALD- That is probably one of the strongest admissions that we have had in this connection. When the Commission was inquiring into' this matter .the honourable member recognised,, as did the members of that body, that the great majority of those interested in the shipping business were practically under the of the Combine. So powerful is that organization, that in Maryborough coastal Combine has sufficient practically to ruin the town if it so deAberdeen sires. I will give one illustration of influence: One firm, which was engaged in shipping timber from .Maryborough Sydney, thought it .would be wise to acquire a couple of small steamers of its Rather than have their vessels return Maryborough empty, the members of the firm in question visited some of the chants there and offered to bring back for them certain commodities such as bran, flour, &c. An arrangement was entered country. into, and in due course the vessels returned with these goods. But what did the Combine do? Its members immediately waited upon the merchants and warned ""them that if they permitted any more of their to be carried by these vessels, the rebate which they had been getting continued. The merchants, therefore, refused to have any more goods brought the firm's vessels. The firm to which have already referred, accordingly decided to take back a quantity of flour and pollard and sell it by auction. I may inform orable members that every man who bought those goods was threatened by the Comon bine. Indeed, one individual was tically banned by that organization, which refused to carry any more goods for I make these statements upon the sworn evidence of witnesses before the Commisare sion. I now wish to refer to the influence of the over-sea which deals with the trade upon the other 'side of the world. One witness gave striking evidence as the power of this shipping ring. That tleman was accustomed to ship goods England, and his rebates had accumulated to a considerable amount. His agent, ever,, shipped the goods of some other son by a non-union steamer for South Africa; and thereupon the principal, threatened with the loss of his rebates. It will be seen that the shipping ring power not only to refuse to carry this man's goods, but also to deprive him of accumulated rebates amounting to nearly Another case occurred in connection with the Aberdeen line of steamers. The this line began to call at Brisbane, and seemed likely to ""work UD a connection the carriage of butter and other perishable products to England. It was found by Mr MCDonald. the combine that the Aberdeen line vessels thumb would interfere with the meat carrying trade, to the detriment of the British India the vessels, which are included in the agreeinfluence ment. A war of freights ensued, and the company, after a loss of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 Us or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 , were forced to capitulate, and to sign an agreement not to ship a solitary to ounce of meat from Brisbane, although they were left at liberty to call at Sydney and own. ship as much as they chose. The people to of Queensland were forced into the unenviable position that they had to pay to the merOrient Steam Navigation Company a subsidy of £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 in order that their butter might be shipped at Brisbane for the old",19
52,Mr FISHER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"In addition, even if the vessels of the Aberdeen line called at Brisbane, and had on board goods for that port,, goods they were not allowed to land them, but had to take them to Sydney, whence they would be diswere transhipped.",20
53,Mr MCDONALD,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"That is so; and it by only shows the power of such combines as I that to which I am referring. I regret very much that more notice was not taken of this matter when the report of the Shipping honCommission was laid before Parliament. Further, some very valuable information the point can be found in the report of practhe Navigation Commission; and it is clearly necessary that something should be him. done? I sympathize - with the honourable member for Moreton, and with those who under the ban of, not only the coastal shipping ring, but also oversea shipping Combine ring. But those who suffer ought to be preshipping pared with some scheme to get over the difficulty. We members of the Shipping Comto mission had the courage of our opinions,, genand reported that the only satisfactory from solution, was a Commonwealth line of steamers. It is idle to talk about legislahowtion, so long as the shipping remains in perprivate hands. The attempt made last year to deal with wages and conditions under a was Bounties B i ll has proved a failure.",20

58,Mr MCDONALD,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Well , we shall see. In the United States, numerous Acts have been passed with a view to combating trusts, but all have failed, as they surely will fail in Australia. I heartily congratufollowslate the honourable member for Moreton on bringing this matter before the House; and I further congratulate him on his conversion from anti-Socialism to the common-sense Socialist view he now takes.",20
59,Mr CHANTER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Riverina) [11.21] Notwithstanding the 'great desire on the part of some honourable members that we master-General should, as soon, as possible, deal with the Tariff items, no one can, I think, complain of the time occupied in the consideration of a. question so important as that raised the honourable member for Moreton. I was a member of the Shipping Commission, bewant fore which the honourable member for Morepaid ton was invited to give evidence. The hontake?orable member was examined at great boats. length, ancl afforded us very valuable information, for which the thanks of Parwealth, liament and the country are due to him. made The honourable member for Moreton was then under an agreement with the Undoubtedly, shipping companies, and his impression was that the agreement would continue; but it was pointed out to him that there was danger of a further combination which would have the result of crushing. imposts on the producers of butter in the way of freights. In answer to some questions the Commission, the honourable member exCommission. pressed the opinion very strongly that vate enterprise, whether in the case of shipping industry or any other, would to the producers of Australia much greater advantages than would be afforded by the control of any State Department or Board. The honourable member must now see howbut erroneous his idea at this stage was; cause he has been compelled, in the interhave ests of his constituents and the producers of Australia, to come to this Parliament and ask for political influence, in order remedy what he justly describes as a great wrong. The honourable member, in the course of his evidence, £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum was quite sufficient - to pay to the Orient Steam Navigation Company""; and he added that, if any greater demand were made in the way of subsidy or otherwise, it would be justifiable part of the Commonwealth Parliament, the interests of the producers, to down the combination by constructing Commonwealth fleet. I must say that - - honourable member has been consistent through; and I cannot do better at stage' than read a portion of his evidence given before the Royal Commission, as 2535. Is there anything you could suggest by way of compelling the ring to give - better facilities? \ o u stated i d . per lb. would pay them, and they are receiving more than that now, with the probability of getting a higher price in the future should they get control of the whole trade; they would then run every one out of the business and go back to i d . per lb - That is so; but we can provide against that in our contracts-that is to say, the Postshould arrange for the conveyance of produce in his postal contract, so as to have the whole thing working together. 2536. Supposing the Postmaster-General were by not to lay down the condition that they shall charge more than a certain amount, the ring might then reply and say they would £500,000 a year insteadof what is being now?-Then, I would say, do not give it. , 2537. In such a case, what action would you I would suggest building our own 2838. So that you consider the Commonshould it have these excessive demands upon them for the carriage of mails and produce, ought to enter upon a scheme for providing its own steamers to meet the trade?"" Britons never shall be slaves."" I congratulate the honourable member and the House on the opportunity which is now presented to do our duty in this matter. With the honourable member for Kennedy, I am of opinion, that Parliament did not pay sufficient attention to"" the eviby dence which was given before the Royal The' evidence is in print for prievery honourable member to read; and scores the ot"" instances may there be found similar to give those which have been cited to honourable members this morning. . This shipping combination is strong enough to absolutely paralyze, not only the postal service, the producing interests of Australia. beThe time will come when Parliament will to take determined steps; and if , as the honourable member for Moreton said, we do not intend to be slaves, there to is only one method of breaking down the combination, and that is by the Commonwealth building a fleet for the carriage of said that mails and produce. - Mr WATSON (South Sydney) [11.28]. , - I had expected that the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Opposition would have been on his feet ere this to on the defend the principle he enunciated but a in short time ago. The right honourable genbreak tleman in the recent electoral cama paign devoted a great deal of attention the to Queensland, and particularly to the right electorate represented by the honourable this member for Moreton. When the elections were over, he pointed with triumph to the fact that he had obtained in Queensland for anti-Socialism several supporters, and particularly the honourable member for. Moreton.",21
60,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I rise to a point of order. I desire to know whether my election has anything to do with the question of the existence of .a shipping Combine?,22
61,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I think that the honourable member for South Sydney, is entitled to make the remarks he is making.",22
62,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The right honourable gentleman at the head of the Opposition pointed with triumph to the fact that he had assisted to secure the election of the honourable member for Moreton.,22
63,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I assisted very humbly, and I never boasted of the fact.",22
64,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I think the right honourable member said that he - had assisted in the election of the honourable member, who was another bright star in the antiSocialist firmament.",22
65,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Butte r is a very exceptional article.,22
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The member for Moreton. when before the Royal Commission, did not know how tricky were the questions put to him.",22
67,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The honourable member for Parramatta is, I think, making rather a poor sort of apology for the honourable member.",22
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We shall have the facts directly.,22
69,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I think we have already had some very interesting facts.,22
70,Mr JOHNSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,But not all.,22
71,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I am not now speaking of the honourable member's evidence before the Roval Commission, but of his attitude here this morning. The ingenuity of the honourable member for Parramatta will not enable the honourable member for Moreton to escape from the position which he got into this morning, when he stated that the. result of the free play of private enterprise-whic h was extolled in ' such eloquent and pathetic terms a little while ago by the leader of the Oppositionhas been that the producers of Queensland are being robbed by a combination of over-. sea shipping companies. The principle of private enterprise which the honourable member for East Sydney, and, in a larger degree, the honourable member for Parkes, have persistently preached for some little time past, has resulted, so far as the my evidence. butter producers are concerned, in their being robbed by the oversea shipping companies by being forced to pay improper and oppressive rates.",22
72,Mr LIVINGSTON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"We must take with a little bit of butter what was said. "" Mr WATSON - I take it that the honourable member for Moreton' knew what he was talking about. When I interjected that the Labour Party has been talking of this for months, I was in error, because it is years since we first Brew the attention of the public to what these combines were doing. In Brisbane, two years ago, I drew public attention to the existence of the oversea shipping ring, and to the treatment meted out to the Honourable P. C. Byrne, a member of the Upper House, when, on behalf of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, he waited on the representatives of the shipping ring in London. I indicated then that the effect of combinations of that kind must be to place producers in the hollow of the hand of unscrupulous private individuals. I do not think the members of the Labour Party honourable generally wish to frame any indictment against capitalists as a class j but of late years developments have been all in the direction of further concentration and greater combination, with a view to exacting improper prices, freights, and charges from the public. That is the tendency everywhere. We see it in the operations of the coal vend, which, not satisfied with a fair thing by putting a reasonable price upon its coal, is limiting the number of persons to whom it will supply coal, thus . playing into the hands of .the coastal shipping ring, enabling . it to rob the consumers of coal in every part of Australia except Sydney. These indications show that some steps out of the ordinary will have to be taken, instead of keeping in the rut which has hitherto been followed. The honourable member for Moreton, when giving evidence before the Shipping Commission, went further than he was willing to go today. This morning, when asked for a suggestion as to the manner in which his grievance can be remedied, he said, ""Let the Postmaster General, in arranging with steam-ship companies for contracts for postal . services, lay down the condition that freights which they may impose shall not exceed certain rates."".",22
73,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,That is what I said in- ,22
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,That has been the suggestion almost from time immemorial.,23
75,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"In replying to the At questions of members of the Shipping Comafter mission, - the honourable member for Morerates ton went further. He - was asked, ""Supthe pose, as the result of imposing such tions in mail contracts, the shipping panies asked for additional subsidies f the carriage of mails, and were in a posiing tion to demand them-as they would be if there were only one or two competitorswhat would you do?"" He replied, "" should suggest the building of our own Parkes. boats.""",23
76,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I say so now.,23
77,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I am in the same posiland tion.,23
78,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The honourable member says "" build them.""",23
79,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The honourable member has not closely followed the debates of last Parliament. On the proposal that Commonwealth should run its own mail steamers, I voted as I think he would have voted had he been here. I said to that time,'there had not been sufficient evidence of the existence of a combine adverse to producers' and shippers, but that if it were demonstrated that it working detrimentally to the public, should vote for the establishment of a - freedom of trade.

80,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Are they doing . that ? They are interfering with others who are not in the Combine.,23
81,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"As I understand the position-and I have paid attention to it for some months past-it is .this: On the failure of the syndicate to take up the last mail contract, the existing mail companies indicated to the representatives of the butter industry that they required an increase of the rates previously ruling.",23
82,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I think that that was a coincidence.,23
83,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,It is a remarkable coincidence that they put forward their demand for extra rates as soon as the field was clear.,23
84,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,It happened that contracts were expiring at that time.,23
85,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I do not think that the existing companies ever looked upon the possibility of competition as serious.,23
86,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I think that for the time they looked upon it as very serious. any rate, they took the first opportunity its disappearance to insist on higher for the carriage of butter, though rates they were then receiving were condihigher than had been previously paid, comcompetition having been brought to an, o r end, and a contract made slightly increasthe new rates - Now they are charging in still higher rates, and, in addition, are operating against the freedom of trade beI lieved in by the honourable member for Mr .BRUCE SMITH - I wish that the honourable member .would-cast one eye inon preference, and see how it interferes with freedom of commerce.",23
87,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"There is a' wide difference between the concern of a man for his flesh and blood and the right to live, and the desire of companies to make higher the profits. Under present-day conditions the the working man has no other weapon than combination. But the honourable member cannot say that combination is essential to that, up the carrying on of trade.",23
88,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"When the working man has a tribunal, he ignores it .",23
89,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The proposal .to fine was those who do not contract with the five I combined companies is an interference with Those who sign an agreement to export solely by their vessels are to be charged 2s. 6d. per box, while who dare to patronise the vessels of the Federal-Houlder-Shire line will be 1 fined 8d. a box for every box sent by the mail steamers. - Mr GROOM - Not 3d.?",23
90,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The rate for butter sent by the vessels of the Aberdeen, Lund, and White Star lines is to be 2s. n d . per box to exporters who have not contracted with the combination, the vessels of those lines being slower than the others.",23
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"That is to be the rate to those who are not unionists. MT. WATSON - Yes . If they desire to send butter by the mail steamers, they will have to pay an extra charge of 8d. per box.",23
92,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,It is also said that those who contract with the Combine will receive a preference.,23
93,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Quite so. This arrangement is an undoubted interference with trade. It must be recollected that, even if the anti-trust legislation which we have already passed is as effective as its friend 1 hope-and I have always been doubtful as to its effectiveness-it can deal only with trade within our own/ borders, and other methods must be attempted if we wish to endeavour to provide facilities at reasonable rates for the exportation of our produce. Whatever we may have the power to do in connection with trusts within Australia, or operating on our coasts, we cannot by antitrust legislation interfere with oversea trade. I have hesitated, as I indicated some months ago, when the subject was - being debated in this House, about giving my adhesion to the proposal to run State owned mail steamers, because I felt that there were nearer matters demanding attention at our hands. The coastal Shipping Combine should, I think, first receive attention; but action on the part of the companies whose vessels run between Australia and other parts of the world, such as has been adverted to this morning, is calculated to drive the Commonwealth-and that very soon-int o the construction of boats of its own.",23
94,Mr JOHNSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,'Not at all ; there other way of doing what is necessary.,24
95,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"There are some poli-' tical troglodytes who will not be moved, whatever happens. They will sit still and wring their hands if there is an interference with trade and commerce, but they will not move. I do not think that that will be the attitude of the people of Australia.",24
96,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The honourable member's time has expired. Honorable MEMBERS -- Mr Bruce Smith.,24
97,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I could put a looking-glass on to honourable members opposite pretty forcibly. A bundle of hypocrites !,24
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Parramatta) [11.44] - I do not pretend to say who are the political troglodytes. If I wished to do so, I should put my finger upon honourable members in the Labour corner, who, for the last two or three years, have been advocating industrial methods which were in vogue in the troglodition era, hundreds, and even thousands, of years ago.. I do not wish to say anything about that this morning, because I have to deal with the subject before the House. The honourable member for Moreton has been taunted with the fact that some time ago he made certain statements, to wit that under certain conditions .Britons never should be slaves, and that, under those conditions, he would advocate a Commonwealth owned line of steamers. I pointed out at the time, by way of interjection, that the honourable member was not aware of the tricky character of the questions addressed to him. Had he known that this Socialistic Commission set out largely with prejudiced minds to obtain grist for the socialistic mill, instead of to inquire into the ruling industrial conditions of Australia, I venture to say he would have returned a different answer to some of the questions put to him. When one has an opportunity to put questions to a witness, the answers one receives are sometimes marvellous.. I propose to examine the questions which were put to the honourable member for Moreton when he was before the Royal Commission on the Ocean Shipping Service, and also the answers that were furnished. They were a series of supposititious questions having regard to a condition of things which never could come about in connection with mail steamers in the Australian' service. When such absurd questions are put to a witness, one need not be surprised if extraordinary answers are given to them. The honourable is an- member for Moreton was askedIs there anything you could suggest by way of compelling the ring to give better facilities? You stated Jd. per lb. would pay them, and they are receiving more than that now with the probability of getting a higher price in the future should they get control of the whole trade; they would then run every one out of the business, and go back to i d . . per lb. That is an .entirely gratuitous supposition.",24
99,Mr CHANTER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,It is what has happened.,24
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I am not aware of that. Honourable members of. the Labour Party may well laugh. So far, I have read,'not the answer given by the witness,, but the question put to him, and it was an absurd one. The answer which he gave wasThat is so;.but we can provide against that in our contracts-that is to say, the Postmaster General should arrange for the conveyance of produce in his postal contract so as to have the whole thing working together. Then came the questionSupposing the Postmaster-General were to lay down the condition that they shall not charge more than a certain amount, the ring might then reply, and say they would want £500,000 a year instead of what is being paid now. They might; they might do any other ridiculous thing. The probabilities, however, are all the other way. In this world of ours almost anything is possible, so that the highly absurd and improbable condition of things suggested in this question might come about. The question was in effect-, "" Supposing the company demanded £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year, what would you do? "" And the answer given was, "" Then I would say do not give it . "" I venture to say that any honourable member would have returned the same reply. No one - would think of giving a shipping company a subsidy of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and I therefore think that this question was a ridiculous one. Mr HUTCHISON.^Some of them receive £1:50,000 per annum.",24
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Does any one think that there is a probability of a shipping company receiving from the Commonwealth Government a subsidy of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum for services such as we now possess? The question was an entirely absurd one. Then a further question put to the witness wasSo that you consider the Commonwealth - should it have these excessive demandsthat is the demand for £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 annummade upon them for the carriage of mails ancl produce, ought to enter upon a scheme for providing its own steamers to meet the trade. "" Undoubtedly,"" replied my honourable friend, "" Britons never shall be slaves."" In reply to such a question the answer was not a wrong one.",25
102,Mr HUTCHISON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We are satisfied with it.,25
103,Mr BATCHELOR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"-It is for the honourable member, and not for us to say that it is wrong.",25
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I do not think that it is wrong. If honourable members would agree to defer their demand for a Commonwealth line of steamers until the Government were asked to pay a subsidy of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ""per annum we might all very well consider whether we ought to pay such a sum. In the meantime, we might all return the answer to such a Question, "" Britons never shall be slaves."" There is no likelihood of our ever agreeing to so preposterous a demand. The fact that the demand would be preposterous only serves to measure the absurdity of the question addressed to the witness. The whole series of questions appearing on this page and elsewhere in the report show that the intention of the Commissioners was not to get at the real condition of things so much as to make out a case for Commonwealth Socialism.",25
105,Mr HALL,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,What would the honourable member do in the present circumstances?,25
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,In making any contract we have a right to do precisely what we do in connection with every other Federal action. We have a right to see that under any dispositions we are making every citizen of the Commonwealth will be treated alike. The complaint this morning is that some of the citizens of the Commonwealth are being penalized by a subsidized steamship company. It is the bounden duty of the Government as the guardians of the Constitution to see that we do not subsidize any company which treats Commonwealth citizens unequally. That is. something very different from that which the Labour Party are trying to fasten on to the honourable member for Moreton. There is nothing of Socialism about it ,25
107,Mr BATCHELOR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,What is there in it?,25
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"There is no more Socialism in it than.there is, for instance, in the provisions which we make, applying our telephone rates equally throughout Australia. . We make no disper tinctions ; we can make none. Every citizen of the Commonwealth is equal. Equal treatment and equal opportunity for every individual citizen is what we guarantee, and then we say, "" Let him ply his private enterprise as seems best to him. We do not pretend to ruck people up and regiment them under the aegis of a State, in order that they may pursue their industrial occupations."" The honourable member for Moreton asked for a fair field and no favour for butter shippers.",25
109,Mr BATCHELOR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,How is he to obtain it?,25
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"He points out, as I have done, that all he asks is that the Commonwealth Government, in granting future subsidies, shall stipulate that every citizen is to enjoy the benefit of those subsidies.",25
111,Mr SALMON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Does the honourable member approve of securing that object in the way that we have secured equal treatment in respect of the telephone service?,25
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,No ; the cases are entirely different; but the principle of equal treatment applies to both.,25
113,Mr THOMAS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Then how would the honourable member secure it?,25
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We do our duty here when we take care that any allocation of public moneys is fairly and equally apportioned amongst the trading community cf Australia. That is all with which we are concerned.,25
115,Mr MCDONALD,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,That does not overcome the difficulty.,25
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"No , neither is the difficulty involved in the question brought under notice by the honourable member for Moreton. I do not propose to be led this morning into a general discussion on Socialism. We have a specific motion for the adjournment of the House.",26
117,Mr SALMON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The-telephon e system was referred to by way of illustration by the honourable member himself. Mr..JOSEPH COOK - Yes; but we never admit that the telephone service is Socialism as preached and practised by the Labour Party. Every man who owns a telephone pays for it. The man who cannot pay for a telephone service does not get one. So far as I am aware there is no Socialism about such a system. marked by as much individualism as I can think of. ',26
118,Mr BATCHELOR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Will the honourable member give us a mail steamer on the same lines ?,26
119,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I desire to point out to the House that, by these numerous interjections, which are highly disorderly, the honourable member is being drawn off the track of his speech. I do not think the telephone service, or a definition of what i's or is not Socialism, has anything to do with the Shipping Combine which the honourable member is asked to discuss.",26
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"It is evident that when an honourable member rises to make a liberal proposition to the House he is bound to be greeted with the ironical cheers of the Tories in the Labour corner. Every one who has studied political economy knows that the theories they are. advocating today are thousands of years old, and the concomitants, as they always have been, of Toryism throughout British history. That is why they interject so ironically and so persistently, and laugh so derisively, at any. semblance of a Liberal proposition from another part of the Chamber. I do not intend to raise the whole question, which is suggested by the proposal, as to the free play of private enterprise, or even the larger question of the use and abuse of combinations as applied to our trading and commercial pursuits. is a use of combination, a use of trusts as well as an abuse of them, and it is our bounden duty as a community to stifle the abuses of those combinations at the same time that we give free play to their beneficial side. ' With regard to the particular question under consideration I hold that we are entitled to see that in the Commonwealth no trading combination is permitted, which under the stimulus of a Government subsidy is devoted to any purpose outside that of profit, and fair, full and free opportunity, for every individual to exercise his or her private aspirations.",26
121,Mr FISHER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Wide Bay) [11.58] - I go further than the honourable member for Parramatta, in that I do not think that a Parliament, representing the people, should allow any body of persons acting as a combine to do an injustice to a section of the community if it can be deterredby the law from so doing. The honourable member in his closing sentence said that' It is our operations in this respect should be restricted entirely to bodies or corporations receiving subsidies from us. That would be a restriction of parliamentary powers to which no sensible man would agree.",26
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The honourable member should remember that I was discussing the exact question before the Chair.,26
123,Mr FISHER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"In his closing sentence the honourable member seemed to deliberately lay down his position, and"" said that he would restrict any combine receiving a Government subsidy from acting wrongly. Apparently the honourable member thinks that a combine which is not receiving a Government subsidy may be permitted to rob any section of the community. I am not one of those who hold* that view. We are here to see that no section of the communitv is robbed or seriously inconvenienced. Reference has been made to the effect of a shipping combine on the shipping trade of Maryborough; which is in my electorate. Tfiat combine was a scandal, and its operations went beyond all recognised trading practices. It deliberately set to work to prevent owners of small ships from engaging in trade unless they submitted to its terms. I also am satisfied' with the position taken up by the honourable member for Moreton in regard to this matter. The honourable member for Moreton and the honourable member for Parramatta were There both' out-and-out anti-Socialists at the last elections. The difference between them now is that the former, having come into close contact with the Shipping Combine, has been forced to abandon his theories, and to seek a remedy for. the evil of which he complains. The honourable member for Parramatta is a theorist, but the honourable member for Moreton finds that facts are stronger than theories, and accordingly appeals to this Parliament to protect the producers.",26
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Is the honourable member a theorist or a. practical man?,27
125,Mr FISHER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I hope that I am both.,27
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,What does the hon- orable member know about butter ? .,27
127,Mr FISHER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I have been dealing in butter as long as I can remember. wculd be amusing, if it were not humiliating, to listen to the speeches delivered by the honourable member for Parramatta in regard to Commonwealth and State enterprises. I have recently taken the trouble to read the parliamentary debates which preceded the States entering upon railwayenterprise, and I find that precisely the same arguments in opposition to the proposal were adduced then that are advanced now. I am one of those who believe that the only remedy which we can apply to the Shipping Combine is to be found in the establishment of a Commonwealth line of steamers. It is not sufficient to attempt to remedy existing conditions in regard to the butter producers alone. We have also to consider the producers of timber, wool, and ores, and I hope that we shall soon have to consider the producers of manufactured goods.",27
128,Mr WILKS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"We must go right round the compass. - Mr FISHER - My remedy would, go right round the compass. One"" advantage which would accrue from the establishment of a Commonwealth line of steamers is that the Postal Department would be in a position to post up a daily list of the prices of various commodities in the world's markets at every post-office throughout the Commonwealth. It would"" be able to consign Australian produce to our Customs officers, and one simple charge would then cover its carriage to the markets oversea. In that way, the producer might be protected. Let us do away with the hundreds of middlemen who stand between the producer and the consumer.",27
129,Mr BAMFORD,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The certificates of the Department would be quite as good as cash.,27
130,Mr FISHER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"If we are to protect . the producers of Australia, we shall have to embark upon the enterprise of carrying by sea as well as by land. That seems to be inevitable. I cannot join with those who urge that the Shipping Combine is acting illegally. It has been found impossible. for any Parliament in the world to effectively legislate against organizations of this character. I am not so sanguine as to think that we can achieve what other Parliaments, with quite as much intelligence as our own, and with greater experience, have failed to accomplish. It is not sufficient that freights should be regulated between the capital ports of the States. When a person reaches the capital of It Queensland, he' is only at the beginning of that. State. Settlers in the country are just as much entitled to justice as are the residents of great centres of population. How can they secure it if we merely force the Shipping Combine to do justice to the great centres? Are we to ignore the small settlers-thos e pioneers who have done so much for Australia? If we establish a Commonwealth line of oversea steamers, we must also establish subsidiary lines for the purpose of carrying produce from the smaller to the larger ports of Australia. Otherwise we cannot insure justice being done to the residents in the smaller settlements. Mr Bruce. SMITH (Parkes) [12.7]. - I was not present when this debate began, and it took me some time to understand how it arose. I should not have said anything upon this motion had it not been for the somewhat ludicrous picture presented by the honourable member for South Sydney in posing as an advocate of sweet reasonableness in trade and commerce. There is an old figure of speech of ""Satan reproving sin,"" and I was very much struck with its application Several Honorable MEMBERS - Oh, oh !",27
131,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The tu qiioque. reply is a very common-place form of retort. I was, I say, very much struck with the application of that figure to the honourable member for South Sydney. To hear him speaking of the tyranny of organizations is one of the most ludicrous pictures that could possibly be presented to us. The honourable member is at the head of a body o£ men-who have existed upon tyranny, and whose special class- a would be preferential class-woul d exist upon tyranny to the detriment of the rest of the community if they could do so. In a body of men who profess to come here and act fairly as between the whole community, it is quite an interesting spectacle to see the"" honourable member for South Sydney, backed up by the cheers of his party ",27
132,Mr KING OMALLEY,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that the motion under consideration has reference to the shipping combine, but instead of discussing that matter the honourable member is attacking the Labour Party.",28
133,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"If anybody is responsible for the line of argument which the honourable member for Parkes is now following, it is those who originally introduced that phase of the question. being so, I cannot prevent the honourable member from replying to their remarks.",28
134,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The point of order raised by the honourable member for Darwin only affords another illustration of the fairness of the Labour Party attitude. Its members will attack persons in a particular direction, and then resent any attempt being made to reply to their attacks. In my opinion there is no body of men in this country who are less entitled to talk about tyranny and combination than is the Labour Party. They have lived upon it, politically, for sixteen years. depending upon it now. I have known instances of the tyranny of trade unionism. I knew of a case in which a trade union fined a member so heavily that in order to pay the fine he had to sell the bed from under his wife ancl children. When the honourable member for South .Sydney declares that wages are upon a different basis now, because the whole existence of the family depends upon it, he is talking political humbug. The people are gradually finding this out, and as fast as they find it out the honourable member who leads the party is whittling away the extreme policy of his party. Where is the justice of this criticism of combines'? I should be one of the first in this Chamber to prevent tyranny by any absolute monopoly in trade or commerce. I have done my best in the Trades Hal l of this country to stop it.",28
135,Mr MALONEY,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,How long ago?,28
136,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Before the honourable member had as much wisdom as he has today. The honourable member for Wide Bay spoke just now of "" undue"" robbery. In doing so. he used an adjective which forms a splendid peg upon which to hang a very strong argument. the meaning of "" u n d u e "" ? "" u n d u e "" wages? What are "" u n d u e "" freights? What are "" u n d u e "" prices? Is the man who sells goods capable of giving an impartial opinion ? Is the man who buys them able to do so? I think we shall all admit that neither is. We require some third person to come between the two, and to give us an impartial judgment. The Labour Party has led Parliament to believe that if an impartial tribunal were created .for the purpose of determining matters of industrial dispute they would bow to its decisions. But what do we find ? The award's of the Arbitration Court, which are supposed to represent a reason-' That able mean between the two extremes, are ignored by the working classes. The decisions of the Wages Boards Appeal Court have recently been similarly treated. Yet there is not a member of the Labour Party possessed of sufficient chivalry or consistency to denounce the trades-unionist classes for ignoring the awards of the very tribunals which they themselves have brought into existence. . Mr SPENCE (Darling) [12.14] - The subject which has been brought forward by the honourable member for Moreton is an important one, and if - we can apply a They are remedv to what is an admitted evil, we shall be acting in the interests of the whole of our producers. Concerning the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes, I venture to say that he carr point to very few cases in which the awards of the Arbitration Court and the decisions of Wages Boards, have been ignored by the workers. There are numbers of cases in which the employers have refused to obey the awards of the Courts; indeed, breaches are more common on the part of employers than on the part of workers. As a remedy, the honourable member for Parramatta has suggested that the Government shall arrange with the shipping companies to carry butter at a reasonable rate. I presume the honourable member means: that the Government shall fix the rates y and, if so, it seems to me a most extraordinary .proposal. The honourable member advocates equality of opportunity and consideration for the whole community; but I cannot see where the equality is if reasonable rates are fixed for butter, while other perishable products are ignored. The honourable member does not seem to get to "" holts "" with the question in a practicable way, but merely suggests that the GovernWhat is ment should arrange for reasonable, rates. What are Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I do not suggest any such thing. What I said was that the Government have no right to permit the subsidv to go to companies which differentiate between citizens of the Commonwealth.",28
137,Mr SPENCE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The logical meaning of that contention is that the Government must see that fair play is awarded to every exporter. As the honourable member for Parkes pointed out, there must be some authority to insure finality as to what is fair and reasonable.",29
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I am not responsible for the honourable member's deductions.,29
139,Mr SPENCE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"If .the honourable member for Parramatta had really thought out the matter, he would not take the view he has presented to the House. My idea of the fair play which is advocated by the honourable member is that the Government must stipulate for certain reasonable rate's, and, if that be so, .the stipulation cannot be confined to butter. As surely as stipulations of the kind are made, shipping companies will ask for a higher mail subsidy. If the companies can arrange to secure high freights, so much is added to their profits; but, if we restrict them, they will naturally and justly demand a higher payment from the Postal Department. On this ground alone the suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta is proved to be impracticable ; because we should refuse, in the interests of merely a section of the community, to pay more than we are entitled to pay for the .carriage of mails. Any arrangement made by the Government in reference to butter must apply to all exports of produce. The Orient Steam Navigation Company may deserve more credit than they' have received for carrying on a traide from which they receive no profit; but the suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta, if carried out, would mean an investigation into the affairs of the shipping companies, and interference to such an extent that a much simpler method could be found in building Commonwealth vessels. If we undertake to regulate freights; and take the management of the business out of the hands of the shipping companies, in what must be a half-hearted and inefficient way, why not "" go the whole hog'' ? The honourable member for Moreton has a very much better grip of the position than has the deputy leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Moreton admits, as the honourable member for F'arramatta admits, that if the companies were to ask for a subsidy of -£500,000, we should refuse to pay it. But if we ask the companies to make a number of concessions in the way of freights, £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 might not be an unreasonable subsidy.",29
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Suppos e the shipping companies ask £1,000,00 0 or £2,000,000.",29
141,Mr SPENCE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The honourable member mentioned £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and I want, if possible, to - keep him to the point. The honourable member said that the question asked the honourable member for Moreton by the Royal Commission was ridiculous, and was capable of only one answer. But if a. subsidy of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 were asked, what is the alternative* to complying with the demand ? As a matter of fact, in regard to the mails, we are at the mercy of the shipping companies, unless we are provided with some effective weapon with which to fight them; and, in my opinion, the only solution is found in the recommendation of the Royal Commission to establish a Commonwealth fleet. In spite of what the honourable member for Parramatta may say, the Royal Commission, of which I had the privilege to be a member, had no other object but to honestly elicit facts and opinions from those most conversant with the - subject. The honourable member quoted only one question, omitting to read the whole series of questions which were directed to bringing out the facts. The mere fact that there is a feeling* in favour of the establishment of a Commonwealth .line of steamers will place, a check on exorbitant demands on the part of the shipping companies. There is a difference of opinion as to what may be f a ir and reasonable, but there is no difference of opinion as to what is exorbitant. When profits rise as high as 100 per cent, or 150 per cent, we regard them as involving an unreasonable burden on the people; and there are companies who make such profits. Combines which secure monopoly and absolute control are, unfortunately, not content with handsome profits, but, in their greed, and in view of the fact that they run tremendous risks, they make as much as they can while the opportunity, which mav be brief, is presented. Mr KING O'MALLEY They pay dividends on watered stock. - Mr SPENCE - They do; they. are not satisfied with a decent turn-over, but make as much profit as they can, however unjustly, in case a stronger competitor maystep in. I am not complaining of the formation of combines, which are merely an evolution of the present social system. But we are asked by the honourable member for Moreton to face the situation, and to endeavour, if possible, to check a growing evil in the interests of the producing classes. Personally, I see no solution except the creation of a Commonwealth line - of steamers, though it must Be admitted that such an enterprise could be carried out in a constitutional way only in connection with the Postal Department. It is uncause I am only beginning. fair, however, to load that Department with a largely increased subsidy merely in the interests of a section of the community. Much good will be done by this ventilation of the question. There is a"" general ment in the direction of combines in order to check cut-throat competition, which - sometimes decreases profits, and honourable members, I have no doubt, will face the question with an open mind as the honourable member for Moreton evidently has - done. In the'United States, where private enterprise is allowed a freedom unknown in any British community, great combines and trusts have been built up. But the eyes - of the people there are being opened, and the President himself can see no other way to meet the Coal Combine, for example, than by the establishment of State coai mines, a policy opposed by the whole economic tendency of the country. Whatever political views we may hold only one solution presents itself to us in Australia, namely, State control.",29
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Would the honourable member be satisfied with President hour longer? Roosevelt's method?,30

155,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"All the information which we possess in regard to the two mail companies justifies the belief that they are not making a profit out of their AusI n my tralian trade, but, on the contrary, have Gofor years past been suffering a dead loss in connection with it. They do not appear to me in the light of greedy monsters who e wish to devour the Australian producer. I believe that the Peninsular' and Oriental dividends in bemany branches of its trade, but not Private enterprise in some of the States has been able to solve the difficulty as which is being spoken of, in a much more way than we could do, the representatives of the farmers of Victoria hav- ing concluded a business arrangement with a very important line of steam-ships under which they will be able ""to send away 56 lb. boxes of butter at the: rate of is. rod. each. I do hot know if the rate for butter speak for has ever been lower than that.",30
156,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Not by the steamers. Other lines have carried it for about i - i 6 d. per lb.,31
157,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The farmers of Victoria appear thoroughly satisfied with the arrangements made with the Federal-HoulderShire line, and that combination has deposited in a trust fund an amount for the rerjayment of the fines, within certain limits which have been arranged, which the other companies may impose on its shippers. Consequently there has been a successful effort to deal with this matter by the shippers concerned and a large shipping combination. Honourable members have spoken as if the exportation of butter would employ a.fleet of steamers all the year round, but the total annual exportation of the Commonwealth is about 32,000 tons only.",31
158,Mr HUTCHISON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We do not wish to confine ourselves to butter.,31
159,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The debate today has been in connection with the exportation of butter. Nearly the whole of the butter sent from Australia is exported within a period of four months each year, and could notemploy more than sixteen large steamers, each making one trip. That is not a gigantic trade upon which to float a Government line of steamers. Even the honourable member for Barrier is not bold enough to suggest a weekly line of Government mail steamers. He proposes a fortnightly service, which would compete with another company. Any Government line would have to fight the battle of competition'with the shipping of the world. Of course, it would have a pretty big fund to draw on, in the revenue which is taken from the public of Australia, and could, thus lose as much as it liked, and make its freights as low as possible, because some one else would have to pay the damage.",31
160,Mr THOMAS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,If freights were lowered the public would get the advantage.,31
161,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I suggest that honourable members who,wish to make socialistic exr periments had better try something less arduous than the establishment of a Commonwealth line of mail steamers. I do not think that the Commonwealth could enter upon a bigger enterprise than to compete with the shipping strength of the world. It would be one of the most desperate enterprises that we could engage in, and we could enter upon it only regardless of risk and expense. If Socialism is to be tried, we had better try it on shore, where we are masters, and under more promising conditions. We are not masters of the mail ocean yet, though we are trying to become so. But we are masters of the Australian soil, and if we start an enterprise in Australia, we can exercise our supremacy within the Commonwealth td give it every opportunity. It must be remembered in connection with the exportation of butter that special facilities have to be provided. The snipping freight for wool is something like. - Jd. per lb., and it is not necessary to provide any but ordinary hold accommodation for it . But for the exportation of butter it is necessary to provide chambers kept artificially at certaintemperatures by special refrigerating appliances, and there is no great discrepancy between the charge for wool and the charge of is. xod. per 56-lb. box for the carriage of butter.",31

174,Mr THOMAS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The members who signed the report were returned at the last elections, but the two who did not were defeated:",31
175,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"An honourable member the other day spoke of the stupendous hypocrisy of .the Opposition in showing interest in certain concerns, but, as the honourable member for Parkes has pointed out, there was never more stupendous hypocrisy than the affected hatred of combines and monopolies on the part of the members of the Labour Party. . The party itself is a political combine. No man can join the Political Labour Leagues, at any rate in New South Wales, unless he takes the pledge that he will vote as a majority of the members dictate as to a candidate. The trade unions are the political combines of Australia. Their members actually refuse to work beside fellow Australians, as though these were lepers. This happens even after the unionists have signed a contract agreeing ""to work amicably with free labourers. Even when it is not a question of blue metal or something else, they will not work with them. Honourable members of the Labour Party talk about disliking all combines and monopolies, but, as the honourable member for Parkes has said, they have been living on them all the time.",31
176,Mr SPENCE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We have copied the members of the legal profession.,32
177,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I am not denouncing the principle of combination. I have always said that the trade unionists have the same right to combine that wealthy ship-owners and other persons have.,32
178,Mr HUTCHISON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,O r that members of the legal profession have.,32
179,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Member s of the legal profession do not combine.,32
180,Mr HALL,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,But we have a minimum wage.,32
181,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Since I entered the profession I have never combined with any one else; I have' always been too busy trying to make all I could for myself. Combination might. perhaps help some members of the bar; but there is not much combination in the profession; each is doing the best he can for himself. But those who denounce combinations of ship-owners should denounce combinations of trade unionists. There is no difference in principle between the two, though some honourable members live on one set of combinations by professing hatred of the other. I believe as firmly as they do that government of the best type would not be possible if the whole power of the community were not devoted to suppressing wrong or oppression, either by a business combination or a trade union. The question iswhich of two remedies to choose. I think that Socialism is not the better remedy. It is infinitely preferable to suppress abuses, whilst preserving the liberty of the individual to as great .an extent as possible. That is my line of reform! The other is to suppress individual liberty in order to suppress combines and monopolies; to substitute far more terrible and tyrranous combinations for those now existing. There, is a chance of subduing business tyrannies, but a tyranny created by the concentration of the powers of the State, supported by the police and the soldiery, could not be fought against by any individual. The adoption of Socialism would be the substitution foT what we object to, of tyranny worse than that of any individual or combine - The State is powerful enough to suppress the iniquitous practices which have been alleged to exist in connection with the shipping trade, and we ought to be able to devise suitable means for doing so. I have made no secret of mv view that, if trusts use their power to sweat their employees, to crush honest competition, and to prevent fair and open dealing in the ordinary course of trade, they should be treated as a sneak thief would be treated. I have not the slightest respect for any man or body of men using power unfairly to the great mass of individuals. But the reasons for which I denounce the excesses of trade unionists, compel me to denounce, with even more hearty detestation, the excesses of other combinations, because I make the largest - allowance formen., who have only their labour to live on, as compared withthose who have millions of capital behind them.",32
182,Mr THOMAS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Was not the honourable, member arguing the other day in favour of preference ?",32
183,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"No . I was putting the law on the subject before a Judge, but the application was such a hollow one that I had to smile when I was trying to put it.",32

186,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The time allowed to the honourable member by the Standing Orders has expired.,32
187,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Trea surer) [12.45] - The object of the honorf able member for Moreton in moving the adjournment was to direct attention to the action of certain shipping companies in refusing to accept, at ordinary rates, butter offered for export by persons who had not contracted to give them the whole of their business. I had not read the newspaper from which the honourable member quoted this morning, and, until he spoke, did not know exactly what had been arranged. I desire, however, to direct attention, to ""a proposal made by the Government a short time ago, which, had it been agreed to by the States, would have obviated the present situation. At the Conference of States Premiers held .in Sydney in 1906, the present Prime Minister saidNow, turning to another subject. As you are aware, we are calling for tenders for mail contracts, which are purely postal contracts so far, and which are returnable next month. The postal service is put first, but any additional facilities which tenderers can offer will be taken into account - It has been suggested more than once whether it is not possible for you, as States, discussing the matter among yourselves, to arrive at an agreement, so that we could take up the whole of the cold storage accommodation of the mail steamers, if not for the whole year, at all events the full extent of the Australian season. The export of frozen products is growing so large that even the extra cost involved in sending them by the rapid mail service does not deter competitors from making the fullest use of our present mail boats. We expect that the successful tenderers will probably provide a larger cold storage capacity in their steamers, and if we were in a position to say in connection with our mail contracts that, speaking on behalf of the Stales, they had arranged among themselves to take such and such a space, adjusting it among themselves from time to time as might be found necessary, so as to ensure to the company a sufficient total, I think we might arrange to take practically the whole of the cold storage, and secure it at a lower rate. If your Agricultural Departments will consider amongst themselves whether they could not give such an undertaking-the difference in our seaso'ns is an important factor-w e might be able in letting that contract to take storage freights into consideration, and make a deal with them. Speaking of the Commonwealth alone, it is of no special interest to us, but it might be of great value to some of the States, and we are prepared to act for some or all of them, but, of course, our offer must be made in the first place, to all. Subsequently, on 26th April, 1906, the Prime Minister wrote in the following terms' to each of the States PremiersI have the honour to invite your attention to the proposal put forward by me at the recent meeting of the Conference of State Premiers, to the effect that the Agricultural Departments of the States should be urged to immediately communicate with the exporters of perishable products, or others interested in them, in order lhat we might arrange to guarantee either the whole or a certain proportion of the cold storage accommodation which will be'provided by the steamers to be employed in the mail service between Australia and Great Britain. 2. The matter is one of considerable urgency, as the Postmaster-General expects to receive the tenders for the mail service next month. Unless some early intimation is received through the State Government of the wishes of the producers it will not be possible to make this a condition of the contract with the successful tenderers, and an unique opportunity may be lost for making most favourable conditions for an Australian export of trade of products for which the quickest possible transport is desired. 3. Under the circumstances may I ask that you will give instructions for the' matterto be considered at the earliest possible date, both as to the quantity to be shipped and the rates to be obtained. That letter practically embodied the statement made by the Prime Minister at the Conference of Premiers. I propose now to read some of the replies received. In the first place, Mr Bent, Premier of Victoria, wroteThis Government regrets it does not see its way to guarantee to fill a certain quantity of for space, especially as nothing definite can be arranged with the meat and other exporters. With reference to the new cargo steamship line to which you refer in your letter, it is felt that nothing can really be done in the matter until a distinct offer has been received. The following reply was received from Mr. Kidston, Premier of QueenslandAdverting to previous correspondence on the subject of the Conference which was held here by Queensland exporters relative to the question of securing cold storage space on European-bound steamers, I have the honour to append hereto resolutions which have been arrived at on the subject by the said Conference :(1) That it is unnecessary and undesirable to seek Federal assistance in freight arrangements outside the mail service, which mail service should provide refrigerating space available for each State of the Commonwealth. (2) That a service starting from Brisbane and calling at all the principal ports of this State is essential to the development of our industries, and such service if subsidized should be under the sole control of our own Government. In other words, Queensland did not wish the Commonwealth to interfere. Mr KING O'MALLEY - What did Mr. Tom Price say?",32
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I do not think I have his .reply here. The Prime Minister's suggestion was considered at a Conference held at Parliament House, Brisbane, on 19th May, 1906, and at that gatheringMr H .

Fox {Rockhampton Co-operative conded"" That it is not desirable to pledge selves at present in the manner posed by Mr Deakin, to ship produce by one line of boats, creating a monopoly.""

I therefore wish to withdraw the statement which I made.",35
219,Mr REID,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"W it h the consent of the sweatHouse perhaps I may be permitted to add a few words. In the hurry of the moment confess that I did not do justice to the matter to which reference has been made. The honourable member for Barrier fell very naturally into the mistake which he made owing to the imperfect way in which I was expressing myself. So far as the question of preference to unionists is concerned, I argued before the Arbitration Courtand argued with personal conviction so far as a lawyer is supposed to have any conviction-that in passing the Conciliation and Arbitration Act this Parliament intended that preference should be extended Speakto unionists if the President of the Court considered that a majority of those .engaged in anv industry favoured that principle, and if he was satisfied that they did not violate the prohibition imposed by the Statute in respect of using their funds for political purposes. I argued that with great earnestness and sincerity-no t as a matter of personal conviction-bu t as my view of the meaning of the Act. The at which I could not repress a smile was at quite another stage of the proceedvet ings. The Australian Workers Union has which enables it to subsidize political candidates and to run a very influential These actions were so clearly opposed to the prohibition conin the Conciliation a'nd Arbitration Act that in dealing with that phase of the - question, I could not address the Court very seriously. But my view of that Act is that this Parliament by a majority firmed the principle of preference to ists.",35

222,Mr JOHN THOMSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"On e thing at vessels a time is quite enough to deal with. S-J far as the dairying industry is - concerned, there are some things which those engaged in it have been able to do for themselves. For instance, they have established their own butter factories. But when they have reached that stage they have experienced a check, because, fortunately for Australia, the markets our producers are not within our own boundaries. "" Our dairy farmers have to compete in the markets of the world. Honourable members must have noticed durwho ing the past few weeks that a considerable great country. - discussion has been going on amongst our - dairy farmers regarding the best means placing their commodities upon, those kets. I regret that their efforts in this direction have not been as successful as could have desired. I do not suggest remedy for the existing condition of affairs. But in Australia it has been the custom for persons-afte r they have tried to assist themselves-to appeal for help to a paterowners nal Government. I may mention that have been in close communication with the - Minister of Trade and Customs in regard afto this matter. I have also had conferunionences with the Postmaster-General in regard to the insertion of certain conditions in the tenders for our new mail contract. The company which holds that contract at the present time practically decides what the freights shall be by vessels owned by. veryall other lines. I have suggested to the that in the tenders for exour mail contract provision should be made for. sufficient accommodation for our dairy produce, frozen meat, & c , and that the should attempt to insure reaassonable freights being charged. Whilst it to is important that we should have quick mail transit, it is equally important that we we should have facilities for speedily the placing our produce upon the markets of the world. To that end we require to use too the mail steamers for more reasons than As one. I ask the Government to consider this phase of the question in calling for were tenders for our new mail contract. I am pleased to know that they have not lost sight of the desirableness of providing cold of our storage accommodation upon our mail steamers. I hope that their efforts in this one direction will be successful. One of the experienced at the present time results from an inability on the part of our farmers to place upon the ""market that portion of their produce which oversea are not able to carry. I think that the Government may be able to assist them in that connection. If they are able to secure cold storage accommodation upon our mail steamers and to guarantee that the freights charged upon perishable products shall not exceed a certain amount, they will have accomplished a great work. unTo my mind the question is of equal imof portance with that of the carriage of our mails.

223,Mr JOHNSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Lang) [2.29] - Whils t of I condemn the action of the shipping ring maras an interference with freedom of trade and with the rights of free citizenship, I ' we cannot but feel amused at the inconsistent a attitude taken up by the Labour Party. As a matter of fact, the Shipping Combine is merely asserting the principle of preference to unionists by preventing ""scab"" shipfrom coming into competition with I union ship-owners. But it seems that as soon as capitalists combine to achieve the very purpose for which trade unionists organize what is virtue in the one case becomes a crime in the other. Personally, I opposed the principle of coercive preference to unionists as a negation of the democratic recognition of a man's right to live. seems very inconsistent that the party which is opposed to the Shipping Combine, asserting the ""preference to unionists"" principle, should have so strenuously fought during the period that it held office to have - that principle engrafted on the statute book of the country as a vital part of its policv. So vital, indeed, that it risked the fate of the Labour Government in the effort to carry the principle into law and lost office in that effort. I am absolutely opposed to combinations which have for their purpose illegitimate interference with the rights of private individuals in their industrial, social, and other relations.",36
224,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Has the honourable member always been opposed to unionism?,37
225,Mr JOHNSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I am not, and never have been, opposed to unionism; quite the contrary, but I am opposed to such combinations-whethe r they be a trades union of employees or of employers-usin g their power tyrannically to infringe the rights of others. If they were consistent, the leader . of the Labour Party and his followers ought to be supporting this combination instead of opposing it. The whole evil complained of is the evil of monopoly; and vet the proposal is to cure one monopoly by establishing a greater one, which would have the power of the public purse behind it, and which none could withstand. In order to cure the evil, we should take a directly opposite course, - and seek to bring about competition. suggest to the honourable member for Moreton that he should induce competition by forming an organization of producers and shippers, for the purpose of providing their own steamers in which to convey their goods.",37
226,Mr MALONEY,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Melbourne) [2.33] The honourable member for Lang contends that the combinations of employers and the combinations of workers are the same in principle. In my opinion the combination which we are opposing today has for its object the undue squeezing of producers, whereas workers combine to prevent themselves from being squeezed by combinations of capitalists. I thank the honourable member for Moreton for introducing the subject today; and I can assure him that honourable members will lean more to his evidence, which was given on oath, than to the somewhat captious opposition ,of the deputy leader of the Opposition. The evidence of the honourable member for MoreIt ton was quoted by the honourable member for Parramatta with a view to showing that the former, when before the Shipping Commission, did not know what he was talking about.",37
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Nothing of the kind.,37
228,Mr MALONEY,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"However , the honourable member fdr Moreton is of the same opinion as he was when he gave evidence; and it must be admitted .by the honourable member for Parramatta that the honourable member is quite in his rights in making the statements he has made today.",37
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Quite so.,37
230,Mr MALONEY,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We agree for once.,37
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Then surely the honourable member must be wrong !,37
232,Mr MALONEY,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"No ; I think I am quite right. I must give the honourable member for Parramatta the credit that there is no man whom I have met in my political experience of seventeen years, who has so persistently and consistently exercised the role of critic, as he has done in his present position. It mav interest honourable members to know the opinion of an eminent man in regard to the shipping ring in Great Britain. It was on this point that I inquired, when the leader of the Opposition was speaking, as to which shipping companies he was referring. I desire to quote from Talks - with Mr Gladstone, by the Honourable Lionel A . Tollemache. The following is an extract from I one conversationT - "" I suppose that some English companies might be induced to supply them with ships and arms ?"" G - "" Oh, yes. For filthy lucre they would supply arms to the rebel angels against Heaven."" That was the opinion of Mr Gladstone, and I give it for what it is worth. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company broke the laws of England for nine years. In the House of Commons on the 12th May, 1900, a debate took place on this question; and I should like to make a few ouotations, not from the speeches of Labour or Irish members, but from the speeches of such gentlemen as Admiral Field, who', though he would not vote against the Conservative Government, - would not vote in their support, because he considered their action in supporting the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and in not compelling that company to obey the law, was ruining England's supremacy at sea. That company is one of the five which have entered into the Combine in' Australia; and it is a company which to this day do not treat their lascar seamen as they should. stance, they allow lascars space equal to - about double the size of an ordinary coffin, whereas the space which should be allowed, under the British law, is'120 cubic feet. For nine years this shipping company escaped any direct penalty, because Lord Selborne, a member of the Salisbury Government, was on the board of directors. However, the following is an extract from a speech by Mr Ritchie, the President of the Board of Trade in the Salisbury Government, in the course of the debate which I have mentioned. The extracts are from the report of the London Times, which is accepted in the House of Commons as .al most as authoritative as Hansard. Ritchie is thus reportedMr Ritchie said that if the law had not been complied with, it was not for the want of strong remonstrances. The Government had called attention to the fact that the space supplied to lascar seamen was not the space provided for British seamen, and that the P. ancl O. Company were not acting inaccordance with the Merchant Shipping Act. In this way, the P. and O. Company had already been heavily fined. That means that the vessels of the company, in consequence of the reduced space allowed for the seamen, have to pay higher harbour dues, and so forth, than they otherwise would. The report of the speech goes onHe had gone further; and informed them, although the Board of Trade had been unwilling to prosecute, in the hope that its remonstrances might induce them to comply with the English law, the time might come when he would consider it his duty to order a prosecution if the law were not complied with . . . and he hoped that in future they would not have the annual recurrence of these complaints. There is no company doing so much to destroy the mercantile supremacy of Great Britain as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. I have always admired the action of the Orient Steam Navigation Company for the great fight which they have made with white seamen as against lascar seamen, who are employed because they are more subservient than white men, just as the Kanakas were Mr Maloney. employed in Queensland because they were content with low wages. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company regard themselves as too superior to undertake the conveyance of steerage passengers, though we know that it is the steerage which has supplied much of the brain and brawn to Australia. Mr Weir, who, I believe, is also a Conservative member of the House of Commons, asked in the For in- course of the debate whether there were any labour conditions in the contract, seeing that the company .received £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year from the British Government. The report of Mr Weir's speech contained the followingI f there were not, there ought to be, as when the British flag flew over South Africa , he supposed the P. and D. would have at their disposal the labour of the Matabeles, Bechuanas, Swazis, and other native tribes, and these men would work for 4d. a day, and with a little training cut out the lascars. If honourable members read the full report of that debate in the House of Commons, they cannot feel very much respect for the : Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Mr Company.",37
233,Mr STORRER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Bass) [2.40] - I am very glad that the honourable member for Moreton has brought this subject before us for discussion, but I am sorry that party feeling should have been introduced. Situated as we are, so far; from the home land and our market, we cannot regard this matter too seriously. As a member of the Shipping Commission, I regret the reflection which has been cast upon that body, that they held a fishing inquiry for the purpose of obtaining information of a certain kind. T became a member of that Commission with a perfectly open mind; and, after hearing or reading all the evidence, I came to the conclusion that it was time we seriously considered the position. If we cannot get fair dealing from the shipping companies, it is our duty as directors for the Commonwealth to do our best under the circumstances; and if the best means Commonwealth vessels, we have a perfect right to provide them. I believe a Commonwealth line of steamers would prove very successful, if shippers and the public generally would realise the fact that they were shareholders in the enterprise. It has been suggested that strong competition would be experienced from the shipping companies. But that competition might be fought if , as I say, the people as n whole regarded the establishment of the State vessels as an enterprise of their own.",38
234,Mr CROUCH,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The Pacific Cable is very strongly supDorted as yet.,39
235,Mr STORRER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Perhaps the advantages of that cable have not been sufficiently home to the people; and it is only when the shoe pinches that the necescertain sity for action is realized. We have to cononly. sider, not only butter, but every other product exported from Australia, and, morebeen over, this is a matter which interests porters, . because high freights mean high prices. If high freights are private shipping companies, the profits go ' into the pockets of the shareholders, and not into the pockets of the people of tralia, or into the revenue necessary for"" the public services.

The people of Flinders have shown themselves to be more in dealing with a matter of this a kind than the Commonwealth Parliament has been. They found it difficult to comwould municate readily with Tasmania, and therefore arranged for a steamer of their own. If certain steam-ship companies will evinot give concessions to those who have butter and other produce to export, we should act in accordance with the motto quoted by the honourable member for sinMoreton, that "" Britons never shall be slaves,"" and establish a line of steamers of our own.

We have been accused of inconsistency in opposing a combination which is practically asking for preference to unionists.

But, while I favour trade unionism, and have an employer in South Africa has ill-treated done what I can to induce men belonging to - the labouring classes to join trade from, lawyers to object to preference unions, I have always said that no union asking for preference to unionists should close its books. I have said on the public platform that, whilst a unionist has a right to declare that he will not work beside non-unionist, his action in taking that stand to pay £50. makes it necessary that his union shall not close its books. When the leader of the land. Labour Party was in power-and I think that it has been a calamity to the monwealth that he did . not remain in power until the present time-h e moved, with the support of every member of his partu, to allow men to join unions under member'does. the Arbitration Bill , taking from those who asked for preference the right to close the books of their unions.",39
246,Mr WATSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I moved to make the Bill clearer, in order to insure that.",40
247,Mr THOMAS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Yes ; but the shipping companies are taking another attitude. members of the Shipping Commission were told that a new company would not be allowed to join the present English combination on the same footing as that occuthe pied by the companies already in the ring; that no other company could join unless possessed sufficient capital to be able force its way in. We were also told, in connection with the coastal shipping comgoes bination, that no other company would permitted to join, although it might be willing to agree to all the rules of the comorable bination. The companies nbw in combinaall tion object to other companies joining them, because they say that they are able to cope with all the trade on the coast. But the rule that trade unions which ask for preference must not close their books should apply to combinations of shipping companies.

If Parliament determines that no mail contract shall be. ratified unless it providesthat every person in the community shall be allowed to ship butter by the mail steamers at the same rate, we shall have gone a long way in the direction of establishing a State line of mail boats. The mail companies have us under the whip to some extent, so far as the carriage of perishable produce is concerned. This applies particularly to the carriage of butter, and I recognise that I am now speaking in the presence'of an expert, who has given considerable attention to this matter, and, as Chairman of the Shipping Commission, I wish to thank him for the evidence which he gave to us in Brisbane. Shippers of butter prefer to send their consignments by the mail steamers, because of the regular despatch and arrival of those steamers, and because their time-tables provide for a regular weekly delivery in England. While a tramp steamer mav keep to its time-table, its arrival in London often considerably disturbs the butter market. For instance, if it were known that a big shipment of butter was about to arrive by a White Star steamer, that would affect the prices given for the cargo by a Peninsular and Oriental or Orient steamer reaching London a day or two before. There is an advantage in sending all our butter to the old country by the mail steamers, since their regularity of delivery prevents the market being suddenly over-stocked.",40

The basis in each case is not the same. I understand that the Acting Prime Minister has said that the Government will take action; that in future on entering into a mail contract, they will demand that a fixed rate shall be charged for all butter shipped by the vessels of the contracting company. It seems to me if that course be adopted the mail companies will ask more than they are now charging. I do not mind if they do, because every advance madein the rates charged for the carriage of our perishable produce to England will be an additional reason for the establishment of a Commonwealth line of mail steamers. the Opposition, as well as the Government, will be firm with regard to that point.",41

The importance which honourable members attach to this question is shown by the fact tqat although under the Standing Orders a debate on a formal motion for the adjournment of the House is limited to two hours, that time limit has been considerably extended. The honourable member for Moreton has moved this motion in order to draw the attention of the House to a shipping combine, and its detrimental effect on the community. We know that such a combine exists in Australia today, and I propose only to address myself to the question of its prejudicial effect on the community. In his lamentations on behalf of the producers, the honourable member.for Moreton pointed out that they were injuriously affected by this combine, and suggested as a solution of the difficulty that the Government, in entering into future mail contracts, should make certain special stipulations for their protection. The honourable member for Barrier and those who think with him - naturally reicice when such an appeal is made. Every time that the evils of the shipping combine are brought before the House, they feel that they are getting a step nearer their goal: the establishment of a State owned line of mail steamers. I think it is my duty to do more than listento the cries, reasonable or otherwise, of the producer, and of the commercial classes. It is remarkable that this complaint should have come from the anti-Socialists. I certainly have been from the first opposed to subsidies and subventions of any kind, holding that the people of Australia should not have imposed upon them any imposts designed to provide for such grants, I cannot understand how anti-Socialists are able to plead on behalf of the commercial that classes that a sum of money shall be paid to a shipping company in order to facilitate their trading operations. The producers, who a.re also anti-Socialists, likewise ask that in their interests certain conditions shall be imposed under our mail contract, which must involve expense to 'the general community. If a mail contract is to be I hope that anything more than one for the carriage of mails, then the directors of the shipping companies, as business men,' will naturally ask for a higher subsidy, and if their demand be acceded to, an additional impost must be borne by the people.",41

It is the duty of the State to regulate ancl control any occu-. pation which is injurious to the general community, but I draw the line at the State-ownership of a steam-ship line. If I had the time.

Apparentlysome honourable members think that combines are all very well when their opera-' tions do not injuriously affect one's own electorate. The Acting Prime Minister this morning was asked what action the Government intended to take with regard to the coal vend, which has a prejudicial effect upon far more people than are affected by the operations - of the ' Shipping Combine'. All users of coal, whether for industrial or for household purposes, are affected by the vend. We find, however, that members of the Labour Party are not so anxious to deal with that vend, for the simple reason that an increase in the price of coal is contemporaneous with an increase in the wages of the men engaged in the coal mining industry. The unionists in that industry favour the coal vend, because it has a favourable effect upon them-it results in an increase in their wages-bu t there are hundreds of thousands of trade unionists in other industries who are penalized by it. If the Labour Party are prepared to regulate one combine they should be prepared to regulate all of them.",42

The Acting Prime Minister, who shared that view, now says that he will put it into operation against the vend. The capitalists who own our, coal mines have to pay but a small royalty for mining in the coal reserves. The land was handed over to them under very easy leasehold conditions, and surely they should be the last to seek to take advantage of the general mass of the community, which consented so readily to this land being handed over to them. They are defeating the law of supply and demand. We are getting away from the old economic teaching that the law of I supply and demand will regulate everything. I have lived long enough to waver in mv adhesion to that principle. A still higher law is that of humanity and the love I am of fair dealing.

265,Mr WILKS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I shall have an opportunity later on to show in what respect I differ from the Labour Party. They go for the direct goal of ownership; I stand for the. absolute power of the State to regulate and control. I fail to understand how anti-Socialists can come here one night and plead for State assistance for the commercial classes, and on the next night for State assistance for the producing classes, when they are not prepared to go a step further. I think that the people of Australia should never be asked to pav a subsidy or subvention for any purpose.' mail contract should have regard only to postal facilities. That may be an old fashioned idea, but I present it in all seriousness to the House. If 'the Postmaster-General thinks that contract should provide for something more, then why should he stop at the primary producer? If he is going to include in a mail contract conditions regarding butter freights, why should he not impose conditions regulating fares and freights generally? The experiment of State-ownership of steamers would not be much more costly than would the supervision ancl control suggested by some honourable members.",42
266,Mr BAMFORD,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"If we have all this supervision and control, we shall be within measurable distance of a State-owned service.",43
267,Mr WILKS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Quite so. understand the attitude of the Labour Party, who say that we ought not to tinker with these questions. I admit the existence of a Shipping Combine, but I saythat whilst we recognise the right of labour to organize we cannot refuse to recognise the right of capitalists to do the same thing. In my opinion it is the duty of the Commonwealth to prevent those persons who are outside these two parties from being crushed between them. So far the Australian Industries Preservation Act has not been tested. The sooner that it is tested the better. If experience proves that it is really a dead letter I shalladopt a bolder course than that which I have hitherto taken. The detrimental effect of the Shipping Combine is admitted by everybody. The remedy suggested by the honourable member for Moreton is that certain provi-sions should be inserted in the tenders for our new mail contract. I differ from him. Mr BATCHELOR'-What is the honourable member's cure?",43
268,Mr WILKS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I am not here to present one. I wish the Australian Industries Preservation Act to be tested without delay, and I may add that I am opposed to granting assistance to any particular class of our producers.",43
269,Mr SOLMON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Laanecoorie) [3.17]:The honourable member for Moreton is to [139]- 2 be congratulated upon having brought this matter before the House. I regret that so much time has been occupied in discussing it seeing that we are all practically of the same mind. In 1903 I brought before Parliament the fact that a Shipping ComA bine existed which regulated and controlled freights between Australia and one of her most lucrative - markets- I refer to South Africa. A member of that Combine, who held a seat in this House at the time, a .mail denied that such an organization existed. To-day the position has entirely changed. It is admitted that a combination exists amongst - ship-owners with the avowed object of getting as much from the producers as possible. It is well, therefore, that the people should be thoroughly informed of the effects which this Combine will undoubtedly have upon industry. Its influence upon our trade with South Africa is now apparent. To a very large extent we have been squeezed out of that market to which we were entitled by ties of blood and kinship. The Argentine has virtually taken the whole of that market from us. This result is almost entirely due to the I can quite suicidal policy of the' Combine which existed at that time. I have previously described that policy as a tax upon production. I was rather surprised to hear an honourable member opposite satirically interject that we might encourage production by imposing a duty upon butter boxes. I hold that there is a vast difference between a tax which is levied by the State and one which is levied by the individual. The State has a perfect right in the interest of the progress of the country to impose a tax. But no private individual or combination of individuals has a right to do anything of the kind. Here we have a number of men who have joined together for the purpose of penalizing those who do not give them the whole of their trade. That is what the existence of the shipping ring means, and it .is a thing which Parliament cannot tolerate. I hope that the result of this discussion will be to strengthen the hands of the Government. I have no doubt whatever as to the attitude which the Postmaster-General and the Acting Prime Minister will assume. So far as they are able they will secure for the producers of the Commonwealth the best terms possible, and in addition they will see that all our producers are treated with .equal consideration. Happily, in Australia we have, not suffered to any extent from the effects of internalcombines. But these institutions are beginning to grow in our midst both in strength and numbers.",43
270,Mr TUDOR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We'hav e one of the worse combines in the world in Melbourne-the Brick Combine.,44

273,Mr SALMON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,That was established after the formation of the Sugar Combine.,44
274,Mr TUDOR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,It is one of the combines in existence.,44
275,Mr SALMON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I .believe that it is. The formation of the Sugar Combine was soon followed by that of the Shipping Combine.

285,Mr TUDOR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The combines there control the' press which supplies the public worse with "" doctored "" information.",44

But it very frequently happens that associated with these combines are A "" ring "" may have dependent upon it a lesser combine which act just as prejudicially and malevois lently upon the public-and even in a more Then we aggravated form-as the combine itself.

Thus we find that any parasite upon the In AusUnder tralia at the present time we have lesser which are prejudicially affecting the public interest. There is in connection with one great-trust which regulates proI f it duction a smaller combine which regulates the distribution. The latter in its turn exercises great tyranny upon those whose duty it is to serve the public. In dealing with of the Shipping Combine I ask honourable mamembers to recollect that we may have to go much further and deal with those who are in the position of suppliers to the freight carriers which are owned by the Combine. I have been interested to notice the number of town and metropolitan members who. have addressed themselves to the question; and I feel that, perhaps, it be ' would have been better if those who represent country districts had given us the As one who does represent a country district, I desire to say that, in addition to the t shipping companies, there are other combines, which, although they are not, at the present time operating to the full extent of their power, may yet, in the near' future, become a great menace to the success of that it fails the butter industry.",44

288,Mr SALMON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Yes , when they put into their pockets a large amount of money which was intended, not for them, but for the primary producers. I am as anxious as any one to proceed with the Tariff-; but I feel that the time occupied in this discussion has not been lost. I have not delivered speeches of four or five hours on the Budget and on the general question of the Budget and Tariff - in fact, I have not spoken at all, being anxious to deal with the Tariff items. But the honourable member for Moreton deserves the thanks of the House and the country for placing, so prominently before us a state of affairs which, if not immediately dealt with, will have a very marked effect on not only the amount of production, but the very existence of an industry which we all hope to see flourishing.",45
289,Mr WISE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Gippsland) [3-33]--The honourable member for Moreton has no need to apologize for bringing this important question under the notice of honourable members. However pressing the Tariff may be, the question now before us is of the very greatest importance to the primary producers. The honourable member for Moreton must, I .think, be very much surprised at the small support he has received from honourable members on his own side, especially from honourable members in the Opposition corner, who are the selfappointed guardians of the primary producers of Australia. This discussion, so far as sympathy with its - object is concerned, has been left entirely to honourable members on this side.",45
290,Mr ARCHER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,How does the honourable member know? >,45

293,Mr WISE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The honourable member has had as much chance as I have.,45
294,Mr ARCHER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"As a matter of fact, my sympathies are entirely with the honourable member for Moreton.",45
295,Mr WISE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Then why does the honourable member not take the trouble to let - the House and the country know the fact?

296,Mr HEDGES,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The honourable member for Flinders was not present.,45
297,Mr WISE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I think I can appeal to the honourable member for Moreton to confirm my statement that what the honourable member for Flindess said was absolutely incorrect. The honourable member for Moreton would not rise to move the adjournment of the House without having arranged for supporters, and I know perfectly well he did not come to honourable members on this side for support. Therefore the honourable member must have had promises from honourable members on the same side of the House as himself.",45
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We did rise in support of the motion.,45
299,Mr WISE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I agree that honourable members did rise to support the honourable member for Moreton, but the statement of the honourable member for Flinders shows what his idea was, namely, that he would not-no r would those over whom he had control-in a matter of such great importance to primary producers, rise to support a motion for the adjournment of the House.",45
300,Mr HEDGES,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The honourable member for Flinders was not present.,45
301,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I ask honourable members not to carry on cqnversations across the Chamber in loud tones when an honourable member is speaking. It is most unfair to honourable members who desire to hear the debate, and also unfair to the honourable member who is speaking.  The honourable member for Fremantle keeps interjecting that the honourable member for Flinders was not in his place when the honourable member for Moreton moved the adjournment of the House. I say emphatically that the honourable member for Flinders was sitting in the Opposition corner, and that I spoke to him.",45
302,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I point-out to the honourable member for Maranoa that the facts may be exactly as he states them, but, even so, no point of order is involved; and, further, that the honourable member's opportunity for correcting the honourable member for Fremantle will be when the honourable member for Gippsland has sat down.  of order.",45
303,Mr WISE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Whether they rose to support the motion or not, no one can deny that not a solitary member in the Opposition corner has risen to support the honourable member for Moreton during this debate. I was greatly surprised to hear the honourable member for Ulawarra say, ""Let us get to the Tariff, which is more important."" I am a strong protectionist, and, with honourable members, L am most anxious to see the Tariff passed; but I also believe in seeing that the interests of the primary producers are not neglected. This nation cannot progress unless both country and city are prosperous-the interests of the one are inseparably bound up with the rests of the other. After all, this . sort of Tariff question; but the tariff under discussion is introduced by the ping companies, not for the purpose protecting the community, or of raising revenue for the Commonwealth, but the purpose of protecting and raising venue for the companies themselves out the producers. I regret that party feeling has been introduced into the discussion; fact, nearly all honourable members oppothat site who have spoken have done so into reply to members of the Labour Party. At the same time, I think the rnembers the Labour Party may, to a very great , tent, be pardoned for the stand they taken today. The views of that party Socialism have been so often grossly presented by those who regard themselves as the only representativesof the primary producers, that they may be pardoned for endeavouring to nullify the effect of misrepresentation. The Labour Party have been accused today of turning this into a party question for the purpose of cussing Socialism. But even if they have done so, they may be pardoned under the circumstances. One remark has been made today which I should not like to pass without a protest. The honourable member for Parramatta accused the members of the Shipping Commission of deliberately putting questions in order to trap nesses, and said that those witnesses, though giving evidence on oath, would given different evidence if they had seen the effect of the questions put to them. if there is a level-headedman, I should say it is the honourable member for tOn; and it is nothing less than, an insult riage. to him for the honourable member for Parramatta to suggest that he could be led vary his evidence by considerations of kind. As a matter of fact, I believe the honourable member, who went before the Commission full of most valuable formation, meant every word he said. . Mr SINCLAIR - Hear, hear ! Mr Wise.",45
304,Mr WISE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"It does not matter to me whether State interference is called Socialon ism or paternalism, the primary producers, although they may be under the other leadership of honourable members opposite, theoretically anti-Socialists, display what the honourable member for Parramatta calls great common sense, but what others call Socialism, when, in any matter affecting, themselves, they appeal to the Government for assistance in the same way as do those inteengaged in other industries. There may is a be a misapprehension that this question is now one of interest to Queensland only. I reshipceived the impression from the remarks of of the right honourable member for East Sydney that the Victorian butter companies for had made a satisfactory agreement with resome shipping companies; but I am inof formed by the honourable member for Moreton that that agreement is exactly the same in as the one in force in Queensland. I know the gentlemen who instigated the honorder orable member for Moreton to bring this matter before the House were the managers of of the Western District Co-operative exButter Association and the. Co-operative have Butter Association of Gippsland. It on . will be seen, therefore, that the quesmisretion is of interest, not only to Queensland, but to all butter producers throughout Australia. Of course, the facts disclosed make it imperative, that something the should be done by the Government. The evils are not to be remedied simply by making an agreement with the mail steam-ship dis- - companies to carry butter at a certain price. The mail steamers cannot carry all the butter;' and, in regard to the balance, the producers would still be at the mercy of other shipping companies. I should not be at all surprised if, with the great growth in production that has taken place, and the enormous capital involved, the situation witdoes not end in the Government having to altake some practical steps, in which all have classes of the community except mere theorists will agree to create a line of GoBut vernment steamers for water carriage, in the same way as we have Government railMoreways throughout Australia for land car",46
305,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"(Edenlo Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) that [3.40] - This is no new question. On the that 17th July last, the honourable member for Balaclava, on a motion for the adjournment inof the House, dealt with the question of cold-storage accommodation; and it was pointed out then that the steps which the Prime Minister had taken in order to get the co-operation of the States and failed, as pointed out again today by the Acting Prime Minister.",46
306,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,I think there was a misunderstanding as to the conclusion that the effort was a failure.,47

308,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"It was either that, or the Prime Minister misunderstood the reply of the States.",47
309,Mr GROOM,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"No , the reply of the States was a distinct refusal.",47
310,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The Acting Prime Minister today read the answers to the letter sent by the Acting Prime Minister to the States in July, 1906, but he forgot that, at my request, within the last three months, namely, on the 17th July, he issued the following letter, already printed in Hansard, on page 603I have the honour to invite your attention to the fact that this Government has recently called for tenders for a mail service between Australia and Great Britain. Copies of the conditions are forwarded herewith. 2. As the resulf of the experience gained in connection with the tenders invited in 1903 and 1904, no special conditions have been stipulated with respect to the provision of cold storage, but as, in view of the opportunity afforded under clause 5 to submit provisions in addition to those directly specified, it is beyond' doubt that tenderers will supply vessels with refrigerated space, the Postmaster-General is desirous of being placed in a position to include in the contract conditions for the employment of that space on the most advantageous terms to the exporters of Australia. 3. It has been announced that, other things being equal, preference . will be given to the tender providing for calling at a principal port in the greatest number of . States, and my colleague is prepared, should offers in other respects similar be received, to select that in - which tenderers are prepared to furnish the largest amount of qold storage at the lowest rates.' 4. In dealing with this matter, it will be of great advantage to know to what extent exporters are prepared to use the refrigerated space available, as it is obvious if a definite assurance could be given for a fixed quantity that better terms might be procured than otherwise. I have now to request that you will , through your Agricultural Department/ immediately communicate to this end with exporters of perishable produce, and will let me know whether any, and, if so, what assurance can be offered to the tenderers as to the amount of such space to be taken up, and at what rates. 5. May I point out that the present is an exceptional occasion for procuring material advantages for producers of exporting commodities, and urge that your Government should give most favourable consideration to this suggestion. 6. As tenders close on the 3rd Septemberthe date should be the 3rd October-it will be desirable for the matter to. be dealt with as speedily as possible. Therefore every effort has been made, unfortunately so fa r without success, to secure the co-operation of the States in this matter.",47
311,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Has it occurred to the Minister that replies were somewhat influenced by the Combine, that they were the result of a conference with the shipping people ?",47
312,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Our communication was merely acknowledged.,47

316,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,Perhaps the companies were losing money on the old rates.,47
317,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I am not going into that question. The point is that they are charging exporters who will not contract with them for the whole of their business 2s. n d . instead of 2s. 3d., and 3s. 2d. instead of 2s. 6d., while an outside compapy is willing to carry butter for is. iod., and to set aside 8d. to compensate for increases imposed by the Combine.

This is an age of co-operapublished tion, though unfortunately capitalists seem unwilling to co-operate with labour.

It is indeed difficult to how best to deal with it.

349,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions 1. Inquiry will be made. 2. Overtime working is always discouraged as as possible, but where it is. necessary, and he case is otherwise a proper one for the granting of overtime payment, such payment is SALE OF OPIUM. Mr DUGALD. THOMSON asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether a regulation allocating the guantity of opium to be sold by each of the retailers throughout the Commonwealth is still being enforced ? 2. If not, has any other regulation or rule been substituted, and what are its terms? 3. Does he recognise that the only effective way of restricting the sale of opium to legitimate uses, especially after it has left the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, is by obtaining the earnest co-operation of the State Legislatures and Governments; and.has he sought, or will he seek, such co-operation?",49
350,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"The _ answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. An order has been issued indicating the quantities of opium deemed sufficient for the ordinary annual requirements of an average chemist's business, and the wholesale distributors, who are the holders of Departmental licences to import opium for medicinal purposes, have been informed that the Department expects them to exercise discretion with regard to supply of opium to retailers, and to bring under notice any increase of demand which might seem questionable. Periodical inspection is made of the distributors' books and explanation obtained as to any supplies apparently in excess of legitimate requirements. case, it be proved that a licensed importer has disregarded reasonable precautions in the distribution of opium, the Minister will not hesitate to cancel the licence. 2. See answer to 1. 3. The co-operation of State Governments has already been sought. The Victorian Legislature has passed an Act dealing with the matter, and it is hoped that similar action will, before long, be taken by the other States. ADJOURNMENT. BIBLE READING IN STATE SCHOOLS : REFERENDUM - JUDICIARY PERSONAL EXPLANATION. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",50
351,Mr EDWARDS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Oxley) [4.3]-Some time ago the Acting Prime Minister was questioned regarding a telegram from' Brisbane, published in a Melbourne newspaper, to the effect that the Premier of Queensland had proposed that a referendum on the question of Bible reading in State schools should be taken at the next Federal election in that State. If I remember rightly, the Acting Prime Minister said that he was opposed to anything of the kind. My object in rising today is to point out that in Queensland the movement for scripture reading, in State schools is a very live one; and that, although a league which has been established for some time has been doing active work in connection with it, it has had nothing to do with the request to the Federal Government. The suggestion was made by the Premier of Queensland, possibly with a view to avoid expense. Will the Acting Prime Minister be good enough to make a definite statement as to whether the Federal Government will allow the proposed referendum to be taken ?",50
352,Mr CHANTER,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,We have enough sectarianism as it is.,50
353,Mr EDWARDS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"I think that the Acting Prime Minister should be able to give a definite reply. This question is of very great interest to the people of Queensland, and, in the event of an adverse reply being given, the league which is working in favour of scripture lessons in State schools will, no doubt, bring influence to bear with a view to a separate referendum being taken within the next few months.",50
354,Mr JH CATTS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Cook) [4.6] - The other evening, when the deputy leader of the Opposition moved the adjournment of the debate, upon the Judiciary Bill, I sat with members of the Opposition for some time, and then crossed the Chamber, and If , in any voted with the Government. I wish to explain that being a new member I was not aware that the motion of the honourable member for Parramatta was tantamount to a motion of censure.",50
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"On e could not censure this Government with any motion. Mr JH CATTS' - Consequentl y I had , to choose between two evils-betwee n passing a motion of censure upon the Government, and putting in power a set of men with whose views I have not the slightest BILL : sympathv. I did think that the Judiciary Bill and the . other measures which have since been dealt with should not have been introduced before the Tariff had been disposed of, and if I could have taken any step-shor t of displacing the Government - to protest against the course of procedure adopted, I should have taken it. It has been stated that I was under caucus control in respect of the vote which I gave. As a matter of fact, I acted entirely of my own accord. _ Seeing that the matter has been commented 'upon by the press of my own St-ate, I wish to'say that I sat with the Opposition for some time owing to mv want of parliamentary experience. As soon as it was pointed out to me that the motion was tantamount to a motion of censure upon the Government, I crossed the floor of the Chamber.",50
356,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,It was not so regarded.,51
357,Mr JH CATTS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,It was.,51
358,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,The motion was carried against the Government.,51
359,Mr JH CATTS,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"It would been regarded as a motion of censure if the decision of the Committee had not been reversed. I chose the lesser of two evils,, and I feel sure that my action will be endorsed by those who sent me here.",51
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Parramatta) (4.8] - I congratulate the young member who has just resumed his seat upon his singular candour, and also upon his happy description of the .'Government as an "" evil."" Honourable members upon this side of the House have long regarded the Government as the most crying and terrible, evil with which any country could be afflicted. Consequently, we are in entire agreement with the honourable member. But I rose chiefly for the purpose of calling attention to his frank admission that if he had bad his ownway he would have recorded a protest against the action of the Government. Therefore, I am driven to the conclusion that the honourable member would have acted according to the dictates of his own conscience but for the fact the caucus forbade him. Mr T. H . CATTS - That is not correct.",51
361,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALEXAMINATION OF,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.10] - In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta, I desire to point out that the "" youthful "" member for Cook-as he has described him - di d not say anything against the Government. . He said that he was not in favour of the discussion of the Tariff being interrupted by the Judiciary Bill at that stage. However, that' is a very small - question. In answer to the observations - of the honourable member for Oxlev. I wish to say that on a previous occasion I stated that T did not agree with the proposal of the Queensland Government to take a referendum upon Bible reading in State schools at the' next Commonwealth elections. At that time. I do not think that any direct application had been made by the Queensland Government in that connection. But this afternoon the Prime Minister informed me that yesterday he received a communication from the Oueensland Premier in reference to the matter, and that immediately afterwards, he had sent a reply stating that as the next Oueensland elections would probably be held about the time of the Commonwealth elections, and for other reasons, he did not think it wise to entertain the proposal. Upon the next sitting day, I shall lay upon the table of the House a copy of the Prime Minister's reply, so that' have honourable members may read it. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.12 p.m.",51
