4,Mr HARTSUYKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to again speak on this important bill, the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010. I will add to my earlier remarks. I tendered that many of the presentations to Kempsey hospital were complex and involved mental health issues and violence. I know this is not unique in emergency department terms, but this puts extra pressure on the doctors and nurses in Kempsey. Kempsey hospital services a large area that stretches from Millbank in the upper Macleay across to South West Rocks and down to Crescent Head. It is a huge area, and it is important that the services are maintained and not eroded. I have supported public rallies which the Kempsey nurses have hosted and have shared the frustration and anger they feel towards the bureaucrats and ministers who continue to reject their case for more resources. The recent acknowledgment by the North Coast Area Health Service that the nurses may have a case is welcome. A review-one of the endless reviews-is taking place and that is indeed long overdue. But there is no excuse for the way Kempsey nurses have been treated in this matter. I, like the leay community, will remain vigilant on this matter until Kempsey hospital secures the additional resources required for the emergency department. There is not a hospital on the North Coast that has stronger community support than the Maclean District Hospital. Whether it be the hospital auxiliary or the local community, lower Clarence residents understand the importance of supporting their local hospital. But there is little doubt that the lower Clarence residents have, over time, been treated as second-class citizens by health bureaucrats. In 2007 the North Coast Area Health Service sold some land next to the Maclean hospital. Local residents thought the funds raised would be invested in upgrading infrastructure in Maclean-but, no, the North Coast Area Health Service decided instead to upgrade the emergency department in Grafton. In 2008 the NCAHS tried to sell more land adjacent to the Maclean hospital, but community outcry eventually ensured there was little interest in the land and the area health service took it off the market. Slowly but surely the North Coast Area Health Service has been withdrawing resources from Maclean hospital. The hospital no longer has its own executive officer in charge, and a security guard's position has been axed. Once again, the smaller hospitals are being screwed of every last dollar as services are centralised to larger regional hospitals. Many of the concerns which I have detailed with regard to the above hospital also apply to Macksville Hospital. Macksville Hospital now has to share a director of nursing and an executive officer with Bellingen Hospital. Staff at Macksville Hospital do a great job in providing services to the Nambucca Shire but they have no choice now but to refer many cases to Coffs Harbour, which is 50 minutes drive away. I would like to bring the parliament's atMac- tention some comments that the federal member for Page has recently made. In the Northern Star newspaper the member for Page made the following comments in relation to provision of dental care: These waiting lists grew to more than 600,000 after the Howard Government scrapped the Commonwealth dental scheme in 1992 … Rather than pass legislation to provide dental health care to those most in need the Opposition senators would rather keep a flawed Howard Government Scheme where the poorest people get nothing. These comments were made in a letter to the editor, so I do not think they were made in the heat of the moment but I do believe that she was not telling the gospel truth. Firstly, the Howard government did not scrap the dental health scheme in 1992-Paul Keating was our Prime Minister in 1992. But, more importantly, the Rudd government has been intent on scrapping the Howard government's dental program. This scheme allowed the people with chronic and complex health problems, where dental health was a contributing factor, to receive up to $4,250 over two years for dental therapies. The federal Minister for Health and Ageing claimed in parliament that the program had only helped 15,000 people in four years. However, Ms Gay Santiago, acting assistant secretary of the primary care financing branch of the Department of Health and Ageing has told a Senate estimates hearing that the scheme provided 311,943 services between November 2007 and 30 April 2008. These services are vital for those who have the most genuine need for major dental work yet the Rudd government, including the federal member for Page, are willing to turn their backs on their people and it seems they are most willing to bend the truth when presenting their case. Whether we speak about this legislation today or whether we debate the broader implications of the Rudd government's approach to health, the real concern here is that the Prime Minister's focus is not so much on people but on politics. This is why quite often the government falls short when we look at the detail. We should never forget that health is not about headlines, it is about man beings. Politicians like the Prime Minister who dress up new health agreements as a major reform but fail to provide meaningful detail are treating Australians with contempt. The details of health policy are the difference between health and illness, between help and despair, between dignity and embarrassment and, in extreme cases, between life and death. The opposition cautiously welcomes the government's changes to the CAAS program but we will continue to scrutinise the government's every move in the health portfolio. They have a track record of failure rather than success on everything they touch.",19
5,Ms HALL,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Shortland) (12.10 pm)Before I get to the substance of my contribution to the debate on the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010 the member for Cowper may like to hear what I have to say about the enhanced Medicare scheme and how it relates to the provision of service for people with chronic and complex dental health problems. I will set the record straight. It was in 1997 that the Howard government ended the Commonwealth dental program that helped many thousands of Australians throughout the country. In relation to the program the member for Cowper spoke about I would like to give a real live example from the Cowper electorate. My mother lived in the Cowper electorate and I told her about the program. She had very complex health needs-in fact, she died because of the health problems she had. I gave her a handout on the program, and she went to talk to her doctor about it. The doctor said: ‘You wouldn't qualify for this and, besides, there is no dentist within the vicinity that actually will utilise this program.' I sent her back again and said, ‘Go and see your doctor, go and talk to your doctor. You would definitely qualify for this program. Surely hu- there must be one dentist in the area. Try Coffs Harbour.' She lived at Nambucca Heads. Her doctor eventually gave her the referral. Then she had to find a dentist that would provide the service for her under the Howard government's wonderful scheme. There was no-one in Nambucca Heads, there was no-one in Macksville, there was no-one any closer than Sawtell. She finally found a dentist that would provide the service for her, and she got the dental treatment that she needed. She had quite a significant dental problem. She managed to have it done before she died, but only just. If that scheme is held up as one that benefits Australians, and if that is something that the member for Cowper is proud of, then he needs to look a little more carefully at the number of people who need dental health treatment and cannot afford it. The Labor Party's program is about providing dental health care to all those people that need it. I am very familiar with the health services in the Cowper electorate. I would encourage the member for Cowper to be quite honest with this House in relation to the services that are available there and in particular to that dental care program that he spoke at great length about and which his constituents have been unable to utilise. Having had my say on that particular program, I would like to turn to the legislation that we have before us today, which the member for Cowper only briefly mentioned as he concluded his contributions to this debate. This legislation will allow for the introduction of the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. I will refer to it as the CAP Scheme as opposed to the continence aid assistance scheme, which I will refer to as CAAS in my contribution to this debate. This amendment allows for an instrument for the minister to change the way continence aids are paid for. It allows for the Commonwealth to make payments to people who are eligible under the CAP Scheme and ensures that there is an adequate process in place to facilitate the transfer of clients under the CAA Scheme, which has basically been provided by one provider, to the CAP Scheme, where people who use the scheme can choose their own provider of the continence aid. Obviously, this service will be provided by Medicare, which is a change to the way the first scheme operates. Mr Speaker, you would be aware, I am sure, that an enormous amount of information has gone out to clients of the CAP Scheme. There are about 75,000 clients throughout Australia who are aware that the CAP Scheme will come into place. This will allow them to access continence aids at a time and in a way which is much more convenient for them. The current scheme provides $470 per person per annum for continence aids, which is what it costs the government, and I think that is indexed and due to go up to $489.95. I thought it would be worthwhile having a look at the need for continence aids. Quite a few Australians have incontinence problems. I am referring here to the Australian incontinence data analysis and development report of March 2006. So, yes, the information is a little dated, but, if you look at the population today and make a correlation between the figures I am about to give to the House, you will find that it is pretty accurate, with 2.8 per cent of the Australian adult population experiencing severe incontinence. For 128,000 people living in cared accommodation who also need assistance with bladder and bowel control, this is handled differently. This scheme relates to people living within the community. To give you the combination of how the 545,000 is made up, 240,800 people living in households experience very severe urinary incontinence and 202,100 people living in households experience frequent or very frequent faecal incontinence. Those figures show that there is a significant need for this program in the community. It is also important to know that there are 723,100 Australians who experience moderate urinary incontinence and another 2,877,500 Australians who have slight urinary incontinence problems. This really brings home the fact that this scheme needs to be in place. People need to link in easily to the CAP Scheme. It is a flexible scheme which people who need continence aids can access locally. I am sure I am not the only member in this House who has a constituent with this problem-in my case it was a parent with an intellectually handicapped daughter who needed continence aids. There were problems accessing the aids and a delay receiving them because they were not provided in the area in which she lived-even within the Hunter area-and those aids were available from different sources. I think this is such positive move. Talking about the prevalence, it is worthwhile looking at the age factors associated with incontinence. Of the 284,000 Australians who always or sometimes need assistance with bladder or bowel management, 79 per cent are over 50 and 65 per cent are over 70. I bring those figures to the House because it is important for us to note that in situation where we have an ageing population this is obviously going to become more prevalent. Since the 2006 report, there would have been an increase in the number of people needing continence aids simply because in those four years our population has aged further. It is important to note that females represent two-thirds of the people who are likely to experience severe incontinence and 45 per cent of the people live in cared accommodation. That means that 55 per cent of the people live in the community and these are the people who will benefit enormously from the scheme we are discussing, which will be covered by the legislation. Females represent 55 per cent of people living in households who need assistance with bladder or bowel control and 73 per cent of people living in cared accommodation. It is also interesting to note that 89 per cent of people living in care who are 70 to 84 years of age need assistance. There is a correlation between those people living in the community and an increase in their need for continence aids. So, by looking at these figures and at the fact that we are an ageing population, it is indisputable that a program like this is needed and it is also indisputable that people needing continence aids should be able to receive them close to where they live. Disorders such as arthritis and related conditions often accompany people that have severe incontinence. Dementia is the most common health problem in relation to people that need continence aids. Based on the a demographics and on the condition of incontinence, there can be strong support for having a scheme in place that is flexible and meets the needs of people who require continence aids. It is interesting to note that the definition of incontinence that accompanies the scheme says that a person must suffer from a moderate to severe level of incontinence. For a males, one of the diseases that have in the past led to incontinence has been prostate cancer. I know there have been enormous developments in treatment in that area, and operations and treatments that are now conducted are no longer leading to the problems they did in the past. The CAP Scheme is designed to help people with permanent-and I think that is important-and severe incontinence to meet some of their costs. Under the current scheme the government contribution-as it has always been-does not cover all the costs. It is similar with the CAP Scheme. Clients who are currently receiving assistance under the CAA Scheme will receive a letter from the department about the changes to the scheme. I know from talking to people in my electorate that a number of clients have already received that information, and I know that there has been correspondence sent out to a number of constituents in Shortland electorate giving them advice about the new scheme. Cash payments made to people that need the continence aids can be made on either a yearly or six-monthly basis. Throughout the transition period the current provider will be in touch with clients of the CAA Scheme to provide information about the new CAP Scheme, and those clients will continue to access their subsidy until 30 June 2010, which is right about now. It is important that this legislation gets through the parliament before the parliament rises, because it is legislation that will advaning tage so many Australians who need the continence aids that will become available through the CAP Scheme. The flexible provisions of the scheme will be enormously useful and beneficial to each and every person who needs to utilise continence aids. There is one important change that is worth mentioning. Currently CAAS clients may be required to complete a CAPS transfer form. The important difference is that Medicare Australia will be the body funding this scheme. Completion of the CAPS transfer form will allow the payment to be made to the nominated bank account of the client. This is, as I said, a vitally important scheme because it creates flexibility and gives some control to older Australians. As I have mentioned, we have an ageing population, so we need to make things happen easily. We need to be mindful of the quality of life that people enjoy. Through this CAPS program, we will be delivering a service to older Australians that will be extremely beneficial to them. I commend the legislation to the House.",21
6,The SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Order! Before I call the member for MCPherson I indicate to members that the House has agreed that there should be no points of order during her contribution. The member for MCPherson. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",24
7,Mrs MAY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: since announcing my intention not to stand at the next federal election, I have spent some time reflecting on my years of service as the federal member for MCPherson, on what this role has meant to me, on what the people of MCPherson have meant to me and on the many people who have supported me and made my time in this place and in the electorate so memorable. They are memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. I have also spent time reflecton this great country of ours and on what governments of both persuasions have done, and I hope will continue to do, for the people of this country in the name of democracy. It is the strength of our democracy that means so much to me personally. As someone who lived under a military dictatorship for many years and witnessed poverty and deprivation of human liberties, I look at the history of this country and what we have achieved through the democratic processes that have evolved since Federation and I am proud of what our forefathers and indeed the modern leaders of our democracy have given us as citizens. However, the world is still facing challenges, with hunger, disease and suffering still at levels that are totally unacceptable in the modern world. With natural disasters and tragedies like floods and fires often imposing a heavy toll on communities and individuals, and with the world still on alert against terrorism which threatens our freedom, I once again say that this country has much to be proud of. We often hear politicians talk about the honour and privilege of representing people in the federal parliament. It is both and I am no different from others who have gone before me in saying just that. It has been an honour and a privilege. More than that, it has been an unforgettable journey, a journey filled with wonderful people, extraordinary events and unbelievable experiences that will stay with me for a lifetime. But above all it has been the people-the people who have supported me through four elections; the people who did not support me but whom I nevertheless grew to respect for their different views; the people who challenged me with ideas and issues; the people who questioned the policy and policy directions of my government; the people who did not have a voice and looked to me as their voice; the talented young people in my schools and universities whose ideas often shocked me and certainly challenged me; the senior Australians who shared their wisdom, experiences and knowledge; and the new Australians on whom I bestowed Australian citizenship, with their wonderful stories of hope in a new land of opportunity. There have been so many people who have enriched my life and who make up the rich tapestry of people that is the federal seat of MCPherson. To all those people: thank you. Thank you for the wonderful and rewarding position you entrusted me with for 12 years. You will not be forgotten. To my party members, those people who share the same ideals and beliefs as me: thank you. Thank you for supporting our great party, the Liberal Party of Australia, and thank you for supporting me for the past 12 years. I have just one message to you all: stay involved and stay committed to our cause during this election year. Remember why you joined our great party and continue the fight and the dream for tomorrow's children. We can win in 2010. Opposition members-Hear! Hear!",24
8,Mrs MAY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"As individuals in this place, we are not able to carry the burden of office without the commitment, help and assistance of our staff. As a former staffer myself, I know just how much we rely on these very important people. They are often the first contact with constituents. They are our eyes and ears. They work long hours and often put the office before their own families. I have been extremely blessed over the years to have the most loyal staff, who have worked hard in the electorate office and here in Canberra. They have supported me above and beyond what I could ever have expected. We have faced many challenges together over the years. We have shared some wonderful highs and lows. We have laughed and even cried on occasions. We have celebrated birthdays and milestones, but above all we have respected each other and supported each other, particularly during the long periods away from home. To my current staff, Karen Embrey, Krystyna Homik, Sandra Tomlinson and Amanda Belton, who are all in the gallery today, ‘thanks' does not seem enough or indeed appropriate for the years of service, support and loyalty you have given me. You made the job so much easier and I hope our paths will cross as we embark on our different journeys in the future. To each of you, most sincerely and from the bottom of my heart: thank you. I would also like to mention a couple of other staff members who worked with me when I was shadow minister for ageing. To Amelia Walsh and Damian Marwood, who have now moved on to new lives-Amelia in Chicago and Damian in Sydney-thank you both for your individual contributions over a number of years. To Ann Phillips, our wonderful volunteer who comes in every week and has done so for many years: the girls and I will be forever grateful for your contribution to our office. Thank you. And to a number of my past employees, Carol Johnson, who is in the gallery today, Gwen Olsen, Johllene Elson, Sandra MCCulloch and Annette Poppett: you all set the bar very high during your time with me and I thank each of you for your contribution to the office and your continuing friendship. There have been so many wonderful people and such a mixture of personalities and age, from baby boomers to gen Ys. I have learned so much from each of them. During my time as the federal member, I believe my achievements were many and varied. There were some large projects that made front-page stories and there were some great outcomes for my communities, but just as rewarding was delivering, for constituents, outcomes that went under the radar but which made such an impact on individuals and their lives. As someone who believes very strongly in serving my community and that delivering on projects was my job, I am, however, going to put on the record today one of the great outcomes that came about in the electorate because of people power. I was the voice in Canberra, but my voice was heard because of the voices of manythe people of Tugun. We needed a road-a bypass in fact-that would alleviate the noise, the long traffic delays, the pollution and the thundering of trucks day and night through the streets of Tugun. The fight for this bypass had gone on for many years. The project involved two local government authorities, two state governments and, of course, the federal government. The planning had to be designed around an international airport, people's homes and the environment. We had a fight on our hands about the route. The Queensland state government wanted the eastern route, which was going to mean the resumption of people's homes. It was a very sad day when this route was announced, but the people of Adina Avenue and Tugun were not going to have a bar of it. The fight was on, not just a fight for the funding to build the bypass but a fight to save people's homes and move the route west of the airport. We had rally after rally-good old fashioned politicking-at the local community hall and out in the streets. We picketed the state government member's office in Tweed, complete with megaphone. I think Larry Anthony and I were nearly hoarse, but I loved it. I got to know those people in Adina Avenue so well. They loved their homes. They loved living next to the airport. We could have made our own movie. The Castle had nothing on us. We had real people-people with hopes and dreams that were being dashed by a government and a government bureaucracy who thought they knew better. Well, they did not and the people won. The route was moved and the homes were saved. The Tugun bypass was built-a magnificent stretch of road just 7.5 kms long-and it has made such a difference to the local Tugun community. But I guess the moral of the story is that people can have a say and make a difference. As the local member, I became the people's voice in Canberra. Even in the dark days when we did not think we would win the fight, no-one gave up. This shows, I believe, the power of people who are living in a democracy to turn the tide, to make the bureaucrats listen and to make governments listen to people's needs. As I said before, most of the work we do as members of parliament falls under the radar, but I think some of the most rewarding work we do is helping an individual or a group of people in our electorates to find a positive outcome to a difficult issue. Sometimes we are challenged as individuals to stand up and speak out on a principle or for a belief that is yet to be adopted by one's party as policy. Unwittingly, I did just that on Friday, 16 May 2008 when I endeavoured to launch a petition in support of the age pensioners of Australia. It was the end of budget week. The pensioners did not get a pension rise. They were hurting. Rising living costs meant that older Australians were finding it difficult to make ends meet. I was angryangry that we were turning our backs on the most vulnerable in our community. I did the worse radio interview of my political life and I had no shortage of shadow ministers and advisers who let me know just that, but the issue made news and it continued to make news. Our pensioners started to mobilise. They took their clothes off on a street in Melbourne-not a pretty sight, Mr Speaker, but a very powerful message. I collected thousands of signatures on a petition. Seniors groups around the country kept up the pressure. My own party introduced legislation in the Senate in September 2008 for an increase in the pension but the bill was defeated in House of Representatives. However, the debate over a pension increase continued through to budget 2009 and the pensioners finally received their increase in the 2009 budget. I like to think that my press release, my terrible radio interview and my continued outspokenness made an impact and kept the issue alive for nearly 12 months. Life for me was not easy during this time, but I survived and my pensioners were the winners. Some of the most valuable work we do in this House is through our committee system. In my view, it is often undervalued. It is not given the recognition it deserves but there would not be a person in this place who has not benefited from the committee system. During my time in this House, I have been a member of a number of committees, which has enabled me to make a difference through policy and, indeed, in the administration of the House. In my first term, I was appointed chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. During this period, I remember visiting the Kosovar people to whom we had given safe haven while civil war raged in their own country. That was a wonderful humanitarian program that we can be proud of. At a later date, I was appointed chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure-a challenging position but one that brought about some real changes to this place. We changed the sitting hours. I remember when I first came to this place that parliament sat till 11 pm and it often sat through the night-horrendous hours that made a huge impact on people's lives and their health. The change of sitting hours was made without sacrificing any time for debate. The latest we finish now is 10 pm and we do not often sit through the night. What a relief that is to all of us. We rewrote the standing orders-the rules that govern this place. It was a mammoth the task. Our brief was to modernise and recategorise the standing orders to make them user-friendly. Each and every standing order was assessed, debated and, in many cases, rewritten. This job took the best part of 12 months but finally we finished the rewrite and our work was adopted by the 2004 parliament. Those standing orders are relevant today. The committee also recommended a petitions committee be introduced into this place to allow Australians a voice and a more accountable pathway to bring to the House's attention the issues of the day through their local member. I am delighted that the current government adopted that recommendation after the last election and a good friend, the member for Fowler, is the first chairman of that committee. We had a recommendation adopted to protect members' time for threeminute speeches in the Main Committee if a division were called. These are small changes but they have made an impact and improved the workings of this place. My committee tabled 20 reports over the six years I was chairman, including a history of the committee to celebrate the committee's 20th anniversary. The reports, recommendations and subsequent changes to the practices in this place would not have happened during my period as chairman without the support of my two deputies-the member for Chifley, Mr Roger Price, who I am delighted is in the House today and who is now Chief Government Whip; and the member for Banks, Mr Daryl Melham. who is also in this place. To you both I say thankyou for your support and friendship during my period as chairman. We can be proud of what we achieved on a bipartisan level through that committee for the benefit of all in this place. I would also like to say a special thankyou to Judy Middlebrook, Bernard Wright, David Elder, Robyn MCClelland, Joanne Towner and Ian Harris for all their valuable advice to the committee. Without their knowledge and support, our work on the committee would not have progressed to where it is today. Of course, there is more to be done. My own disappointment is that we do not really debate in this House. We do have an intervention rule in the Main Committee but it is not used very often. The public see the very rowdy question time each day and more televised committee hearings but, sadly, I do not think we give the public the opportunity to see real debate. Maybe that will come at a later date. Another committee that I really enjoyed was the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, of which I was a member while I was shadow minister for ageing. One inquiry and subsequent report that made some very important recommendations was on obesity. We all know in this House how much obesity is impacting on our society. There is the desperate need for education and even the teaching of the basic life skill of cooking. As a devotee of MasterChef and someone who loves to cook, I am very supportive of the kitchen garden idea that Stephanie Alexander developed and implemented first in a Melbourne primary school-a school that we visited and where we shared a meal that was grown, cooked and served by the kids. It was a wonderful experience for the committee and a powerful initiative that I would personally like to see adopted right around the country. I believe practical ideas like this one will go a long way to ensuring a new generation of great cooks but also a new generation of Australians who will understand the benefits of eating properly. I think we in this House could also set a better example to all Australians about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Our former Prime Minister certainly had us all hooked on walking. But we do need to do more in this place, even down to the meals that are served, particularly at lunchtime. There is nothing wrong with a great sandwich or a salad instead of half a beast on a plate, swimming in sauce and nothing green in sight! I joined the Liberal Party 20 years ago, a move I have never regretted as I strongly believe in the values and beliefs of the modern Liberal Party that Sir Robert Menzies formed in 1944. I have always believed very strongly in the individual. I have always believed in reward for effort. And I firmly believe that education and the pursuit of one's goals and dreams will unlock a wonderful world of adventure, success and fulfilment. However, there are those in the world who do not have access to education and who just struggle to survive-and without access to education they are trapped in a world of poverty. The key to unlocking that world of poverty is education. I would like to encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the House to support the Millennium Development Goals, to ensure that successive governments in this country continue to increase our foreign aid budget so that men, women and children across the globe have access to the basic necessities of life-food, shelter and clean water-and access to education. In concluding my remarks today I want to express my love and thanks to the special people in my life, the people who have supported me with unconditional love during my years here in the parliament. To my sisters, Heather and Anne: you are simply the best. I couldn't want two more wonderful people as sisters who have shared my life's journey. Both are in the gallery today, along with my brother-in-law, John Stephens. To each of you: thank you for being there during the highs and lows, with wise words of advice to boost my confidence when I was facing challenges. I love you all so much. To my children and their partners: my daughter Dimity and her husband, Raymond; my son, Dayne, and his wife, Nadine; and my youngest daughter, Kristin, who is also in the gallery today, and her partner, Pete. I you all and am so proud of what each of you have achieved in your chosen careers, the wonderful individuals you have become and the joy and happiness you bring to my life. And, of course, the beautiful grandchildren you have given your father and me: Jaiden, Emily, Angus, Abby and Sam, and No. 6another boy-due in August to Dimity and Raymond. These little people just light up my life. To my mum, Rae Kerr. Mum was there for my first campaign and she has continued to support and encourage me during my parliamentary career. Her wisdom, her belief in me, her advice and her unconditional love certainly gave me the strength and confidence to follow my dream and sit in this place. Simply, Mum, I say thank you for being my mum. And, lastly, to my husband, David-the person who has been at home with the welcome mat after long days on the road, weeks in Canberra and commitments in my electorate. David has never faltered in his support for me. He is my best friend and the love of my life. Thank you for just being there and keeping me sane, the family together and our marriage strong and happy with lots of love and laughter. Mr Speaker, I do feel a tinge of sadness in leaving this place, leaving friends from both sides of the political divide. I have given the job 100 per cent. I leave with my integrity intact, my beliefs in the Liberal Party still strong, and I look forward to a new life with my family and long-suffering friends at home on the Gold Coast. Thank you.",25
9,Mr ZAPPIA,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Can I begin by acknowledging the valedictory speech we have just heard from the member for MCPherson and paying my respects to her for her contribution to the workings of this parliament, for the work she has personally love performed in the course of her membership of this place and also for her work in representing the people of her electorate and the people of Australia. I certainly concur with her remarks towards the end of her speech about the importance of education. I also wish her well in the years ahead. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010, and I say that because this is a matter that I raised some time ago with the Minister for Health and Ageing on behalf of one of my constituents in the electorate of Makin. I am pleased to see that the minister has responded with this bill because what I raised with the minister is exactly what this bill now provides, and that is the opportunity for someone who is provided with financial assistance for purchasing continence aids products to do so at their choice with the supplier they wish to deal with. The intent of this legislation is consistent with other health initiatives of the Rudd government which also provide financial support to enable people to manage their own health conditions. For example, for a child with autism, the government provides up to $12,000 for a child up to the age of seven years, with up to $6,000 of those funds accessible in any one financial year to assist with autism intervention and support. Similarly, payments of around $1,200 a year to cover the costs of day-today GP care and additional services are made available for people who suffer from diabetes. In fact, the Rudd government has committed $436 million to provide personalised care for diabetics, with payments of around $10,800 a year also being made available to GPs who become responsible for managing their care, including by developing a personalised care plan; by helping to organise access to the additional services they need, such as care from a dietitian or physiotherapist, as set out in their personal care plan; and by being paid in part on the basis of their performance in keeping their patients healthy and out of hospital. Again, the payment of continence aids funds directly to the patient is consistent with that theme. In summary, this bill will allow for the in- country. troduction of the Continence Aids Payment Scheme and the replacement of the existing Continence Aids Assistance Scheme, which provides financial assistance with the cost of continence aids. This bill will allow a Continence Aids Payment Scheme-or CAPS as it is often referred to-to be formulated by the Minister for Health and Ageing through a legislative instrument. It will allow payments to be made directly to eligible persons under the CAPS, it will ensure an adequate process is in place for the transfer of clients from Continence Aids Assistance Scheme to the new CAPS and it will confer power on the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and on the CEO of Medicare Australia to request information in relation to the provision of payments under the scheme. The existing scheme provides a subsidy for eligible recipients of up to $489.95 per year on continence products purchased through a sole provider. This sole provider is in turn paid directly by the Commonwealth. Expenses above $489.95 are then borne by the user. Under the new scheme, clients will now have a choice between receiving the full payments in July or, alternatively, receiving two payments of half the amount, one in July and the other in January each year. Medicare Australia will make the payments directly into the client's bank account. The CAPS is not a reimbursement scheme but a funding support scheme. It is intended that these new measures will come into effect from 1 July 2010. The payment will remain at $489.95 for the 2011-12 financial year and then it will be adjusted annually in accordance with CPI increases. The scheme currently assists more than 50,000 people. I am very much aware that, in addition to those 50,000 people, there are others in nursing homes or under other aged-care packages that will also access continence aids in this The definition of what constitutes incontinence and how eligibility for the support package is determined will remain the same as that for the current scheme. The new scheme will mean suppliers will compete in an open and competitive market, and that will only be good for consumers because it will ensure that prices are competitive. I was approached by a constituent in my own electorate on this issue because the products were being made available by other suppliers the in the broader community at a better price than they could be purchased under the previous arrangement and, therefore, consumers were not necessarily getting the best value for the amount of dollars allocated by the government to assist them with these products. This week-that is, between 21 and 27 June-is World Continence Week, so it is timely that this bill is being discussed in this place today. Incontinence is a universal issue but not one that attracts much public attention and yet it affects so many families. Around four million Australians of all ages are affected by incontinence. They and their families are severely affected. I am sure that all of us in this place know of someone who is affected by incontinence and many of us may have family members whom we have to assist with this problem. It is not a problem that is talked about widely throughout the community and yet it is a very real problem. In many cases, with the right treatment, the condition can be remedied. In other cases it simply cannot. For those who need the use of continence aids, those aids enable them to get on with their life and those aids certainly make life for their family members and carers much easier. I also note that between 1 and 7 August this year will be national Continence Awareness Week in Australia. I hope that, as a result of the educational and promotional activities of that week, incontinence may become one of those topics that the community is better prepared to speak about, because it is only by the community at large talking about it more openly that we as a community can in turn respond with the best possible support available for both the people suffering from incontinence and their family members. Many of the people who suffer from incontinence will clearly be entitled to financial assistance provided under this bill. The changes encompassed in this bill will be welcomed by all of those people eligible for financial assistance under this scheme because, as I said earlier, it will ensure more value, more choice and less expense if they were to normally exceed the $489.95 allowance. The fact that they have choice, I am sure, not only will mean that they will be able to shop around and get the best value for their dollars but also, as I also said earlier, will mean that, because there is a competitive market for the products, the price of the very products themselves can be expected to start to come down. People who need continence aids frequently have other medical conditions as well. If they are able to make any savings at all through the purchase of these aids, I am sure that those savings will be put to very good use to assist them with the purchase of other things in life that they will need as a result of the medical conditions that they inevitably suffer from in addition to incontinence. This is a common sense measure that has been implemented by the government. It is again consistent with the Rudd government's message that health is of paramount importance. Health has become a priority for this government and, to date, the government has reflected that priority by the commitments that have already been made to the nation in health funding. I note that the government has already increased health funding by 50 per cent to $64 billion over the forthcoming agreement with the states. That is a 50 per cent increase to the health and hospital funding agreement with the states. In contrast to that, the previous government cut $1 billion from the agreement. In addition to that increase, what this government has done is clearly identify where the priorities lie with respect to ensuring that the nation has a much improved health system and has, step-by-step, methodically worked through supporting all of those areas, beginning with committing additional funding to reduce elective surgy waiting lists around the country, providing additional funds for training of our nurses and doctors around the country, providing funding for GP superclinics around the country, providing funding to close the life expectancy gap for Indigenous people in Australia and providing funding to help with what we call low real interest rate loans for those people who are providing residential aged care. These are simply some of the steps that the government has already taken. I note that in the last budget, announced only weeks ago, there was an additional $2.2 billion committed to providing health services for Australian people. I particularly note that, of that $2.2 billion, $355 million was provided for additional GP superclinics around the country, $417 million was provided to enhance after hours services for people in Australia, $523 million was provided to train our nurses and $467 million was provided for individual electronic health record systems to be established. I particularly note that $2.2 billion because the opposition leader has made it absolutely clear that, if they are elected, they will not proceed with the funding for the GP superclinics and not proceed with the funding for an electronic health record system for Australia, which I think is shameful because the electronic health system in particular is something that will enhance the ability of this country to provide better health services for people wherever they are. I am surprised that they would oppose electronic health funding because they suggested that it ought to be paid for by the federal government and implemented by the federal government when they were in government. I say to them: it is certainly something that surprises me. They should think again because, if they are serious about improving health services to the people of Australia, that is certainly one improvement that is not only long overdue but also needed if we are to provide good health services to people around Australia. As I said in my opening comments about this bill, this is a matter I support. I have sonally taken it up with the minister on a previous occasion and I commend the minister for looking at the issue and coming back with this legislation, which gives choice to the recipients of the funding. I believe, in providing that choice, it will be a very welcome measure. I commend the bill to the House.",29
10,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"If the intention of the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010 is achieved, it will be a further recognition of the great disadvantages faced by people who have lost certain personal bodily functions and who suffer incontinence. It is extremely expensive because they must equip themselves, at all times, with the appropriate aids. I have no evidence that there is any opposition to this scheme from within the ranks of the opposition. It is worth referring to the explanatory memorandum and making some comparison between the present and the future as proposed by this legislation, but without the detail of the assistance to be given. This is what the explanatory memorandum tells us: under the CAA Scheme-in other words, the current scheme implemented by the Howard government-eligible people with severe and permanent incontinence are provided with up to $489.95 worth of products each year, indexed annually, to help manage continence. The CAA Scheme is managed by a sole provider on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing. One can only assume the costs involved in that virtually $500 assistance package are being properly overseen by the health department to ensure that entitlement is stretched as far as possible. That is something that these unfortunate people know about and are receiving at present. So what happens next? Under the CAP Scheme, which is what the legislation is proposing, eligible people will instead perreceive a payment as a contribution towards the cost of the products. The new arrangement will provide greater choice to the consumer and promote competition and is expected to reduce the administrative costs associated with the continence aids program. Why will it reduce administrative costs? A person presently has the entitlement to purchase directly from a provider, overseen by the health department. They are able to obtain that on the basis that they are eligible. The new process clearly involves all of the practices of Medicare-that is, each time you incur a cost, as you might in attending a nonbulk-billing doctor, you will have to apply for a refund. The minister, in addressing the House at the end of this debate, might tell me, ‘That is not so.' Well the parliament does not know. All we are told further on in this explanatory memorandum is that Medicare Australia will deliver the program. The amount of the contribution payment will be specified in the legislative instrument-in other words, delegated legislation-and the parliament is passing this legislation with no knowledge how much that might be. As is typical in so many matters proposed by the Rudd government, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors around. The people have a program. It is administratively simple. Whilst it could be argued that competitive forces might lower the price of continence aids, with other suppliers involvedpresuming that there is competition in the tender to be the sole supplier-if the price is reduced through competition, is the refund going to be a percentage of that or a fixed amount? We do not know. When will these people, with their serious disability, be able to find out? Clients of the CAA Scheme will be taken to participate in the CAP Scheme-well, that is pretty good-and will be eligible to participate in the CAP Scheme from 1 July, provided they give certain information to Medicare Australia's CEO to facilitate contribution payments being made to their nominated bank account. In other words, they will pay full tote on purchase and then wait for a refund-back to the bad old days of bulkbilling or not bulk-billing. After 30 June 2011 they must meet the eligibility criteria specified in the scheme. We do not know exactly what they are. Mr Zappia-Look it up.",32
11,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"How do we look it up? We have not got the delegated legislation. It raises a rather interesting point as far concerned. Frequently this House transfers huge amounts of power to the Public Service in terms of delegated legislation-which I presume the member for Makin understands is tabled in these two houses; I wonder when he last looked at any of it-and it becomes law, with all the meanings of the law, notwithstanding that it can only be stopped by a disallowance motion in either this House or the Senate. The financial impact statement is very brief. It says: The Bill delivers on the 2009-10 Budget commitment to introduce the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. Funds for the CAPS payments from 1 July 2010 are included in the Department's Forward Estimates. As I recollect, the purpose of bringing in a financial impact statement was to tell the House how much something is going to cost, not to send us off on some wild goose chase hunting through the budget for amounts of this denomination. I smell a trick. I will not be voting against the legislation; I just hope that this is not another Ruddism, where promises are invariably broken. It is all in black and white there. I have only read from the description given to this legislation by the clerks, and I draw the House's attention to the fact of its brevity. None of the details which people would like to know for overcoming the financial aspects of their difficulty in the future are provided to the House. That is all left for another day and, if history repeats itself, maybe never, because this legislation quite obviously overrides the present scheme. A lot of people took this government on trust three years ago. The evidence is arising that they are very disillusioned by the outcomes. As this is a health measure, it allows me to address some other health matters, as the as I am member for Makin did a moment ago when he started talking about superclinics. There are serious matters arising in my electorate of O'Connor and, I am sure, in many country regions throughout Australia relating to the availability of general practitioners. There are constant allegations as to who created shortage and who reduced the number of undergraduate courses. There may be blame laid on both sides of the House, but I can assure the House that the first attempt followed the bulk-billing initiatives of the Hawke government. Why was the number of undergraduates cut back by, as I recollect, about 4,000? We had the appearance of Dr Edelsten. Remember the bloke who bought the Sydney Swans because he was making so much money out of bulk-billing? There was panic within the Hawke government that all these graduates were coming out, going to highly populated parts of the major capital cities, hanging their shingles and then freeloaders, if you like, or less needy people were turning up to get prescriptions, in some cases for a packet of aspirin. The money was flowing out of the federal coffers as a consequence. The response of the Hawke government was to cut back on the number of undergraduate places, for the purpose of reducing the number of people who could get on the bulk-billing bandwagon. As I warned the shadow minister for health in that period, when the government becomes the sole customer of the medical profession, the profession will eventually get squeezed, as of course materialised on a number of occasions. Many more doctors today are abandoning bulk-billing, more so in country areas, where it is virtually possible to run a practice on the rebate. Let me draw to the attention of the House the fact that last week local government representatives around Australia turned up here for their annual conference. Numerous members arrived from my electorate and each and every one of them had been contacting me regarding their problems in ensuring their community had an adequate GP service. They have been doing it in Western Australian rural areas for years, gradually consuming up to half their rate base on subthe sidising a GP to stay in their town-up to $500,000. That was even a shock to me, as someone who has been watching this process get worse and worse over the 30 years I have been representing O'Connor; getting worse, getting worse, getting worse. If I had been asked what the typical contribution was from a local authority, outside of the capital commitments they have made in housing, doctors' surgeries and things of that nature, I would have thought something under $100,000. These are small communities desperate to get a doctor. The response to that payment, we are told, is: ‘It's a federal responsibility.' We know it out is a state responsibility and state governments around Australia are refusing to put salaried doctors into the hospitals that exist on the grounds that they are not allowed to claim Medicare rebates if they are a salaried doctor. Too bad for the community. That is the way they deal with it. I know of nothing in this new, you-beaut deal, which seems to be falling apart every day in recent times, that would compensate those councils for this cost, would guarantee that the states provide salaried medical practitioners under the state-Commonwealth agreements. I bet that was not discussed during all the bullying that went on to achieve the loss in every state bar Western Australia of their GST share, attributable, if you like, to health. That was imto be brought back here to government, which, under Keating, sold the six repatriation hospitals at a saving to our revenue of $1 billion. Fortunately, in Western Australia, it was taken over by Ramsay Health Care, who, according to the RSL and others over there, has given them a vastly improved service. But the reality is that, amongst others, a company called Meridian commenced assisting these local government authorities by arranging the importation of doctors and allocating them in various areas on a sort of package with an obligation to provide locum services and at least give these one item GPs the opportunity for leave and have some family time or whatever else. That in itself has become a problem. A retired GP living in the town of Albany was in my office last Friday explaining how, since he retired, he has never worked so hard in his life, trying fill as many locum positions as he can when his preference would be to be holidaying in Europe or something like that-a responsible man who is seriously concerned about the circumstances that exist in the electorates and in particular the electorate of O'Connor. Meridian was supplying a doctor in Southern Cross, a town in the district of about 1,500 people, and Lake Grace, I guess of similar size-not huge but it is a long way between stops-and of course others. They have just advised that they are discontinuing this service, not because they have not been remunerated, not because they think they might do something else but because they can no longer get accreditation for the doctors available to come from various parts of the world to service these particular communities. Why is that? Because over the life of the Rudd government there has been an evertightening of the accreditation requirements, so much so that this doctor, who continues to work in his retirement to aid the community, openly admitted that he could not pass these exams either. Examinations of that nature are for the young and they are necessary to prove they have learned their lessons. As time goes by, they accumulate huge amounts of experience but, as those of us who have been around a while know, answering the sorts of questions that arise in these accredithis tation examinations is very, very difficult. Others have said to me that doctors previously admitted and accepted as giving good and reliable service in many communities also could not have succeeded in passing this examination. But it goes one step further: if you are willing to give it a go, you cannot get a slot to undertake the examination. It is a bit like the old French non-tariff barriers: if you did not want a certain product to come into your country, you never put a ban on it; you had one officer throughout the nation sitting in some obscure locality to whom you must to apply for an import licence. That is what has happened, and who has lost out? Rural areas. The member for Makin says we are going to have these wonders called superclinics. The minister wrote to me and said I could have one in my electorate. I said, ‘Thanks, but no thanks.' The last thing I want is some nationalised facility with extensive government funding that sucks the last of my individual GPs out of their towns for the easy life of having a nice regulated nine-to-five job or whatever-fixed hours and the weekends off or two days off during the week. I endorse entirely the opposition's view that these are an unnecessary proposal when the real problem is the availability of doctors. Yes, you might be able to fill up the superclinics with doctors, whatever they will be paid, but somewhere else people will lose them. It is another one of those promises to which I have just referred. There were 36 to be built in their first term of office, along with millions of computers for school kids, and now we have got ministers pointing fingers at us saying, ‘If you cut back on the funding, people will not get these things.' They are supposed to be there-not three but 36. If we add another 28, goodness knows when they are going to turn up. But there are opportunities and it was suggested to me by GP who visited that we should just bring these doctors in, particularly from the UK and other places, and have a mentor here to look after them. (Time expired)",33
12,Ms MARINO,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010, which will amend the National Health Act 1953. The amendments contained in this legislation will provide the minister with the legislative authority to formulate the Continence Aids Payment Scheme, providing for payments to eligible persons as a contribution towards the cost of purchasing products that help them manage incontinence. The CAPS will replace the Continence Aids Assistance Scheme, or CAAS. To give some background, the National Continence Management Strategy was established in 1998 by the coalition government to provide funding to research and service development initiatives aimed at prevention and treatment of incontinence, which of course is a very serious issue. During 2007, the CAAS was expanded to reach further age groups and those with certain conditions. Through this legislation, CAPS will make direct cash payments to eligible people with permanent and severe incontinence to assist with the cost of their products. This differs from previous arrangements where there was a government agreement with a sole supplier-Intouch. It is envisaged that this change will give greater choice to consumers and facilitate the purchase of products that best suit their needs. The subsidy arrangement will remain in line with the CAAS and continue to be indexed annually. Incontinence affects nearly four million Australians of all ages and for a broad variety of reasons. According to the Continence Foundation of Australia, 65 per cent of women and 30 per cent of men sitting in a GP clinic waiting room report some type of urinary incontinence. I note that the member for O'Connor referred to regional GPs. My area is one of those that suffers from a shortlia age of GPs. In fact, in my particular electorate the South West Medical Attraction Taskforce has been formed to try to address this issue. I note that one of their very important recommendations is that we encourage young people from the electorate into medicine in the hope that they will return to practice in the future. I also note that the definition of ‘inner regional' in the youth allowance criteria is now inhibiting the opportunities and ambition of many young people in my electorate. I have a family where more than one sibling wants to study medicine, but because they will not be able to access independent youth allowance this opportunity is now compromised. The South West Medical Attraction Taskforce is going to continue its efforts to attract and retain general practitioners in regional areas in the south-west of Western Australia, something that will continue to be an issue because the population continues to grow. It is an ongoing issue for my electorate. I am aware that the risk factors for urinary incontinence include pregnancy and preand post-natality. That is why so many women make sure they conduct their exercises while they are actually in hospital and when they get home. It is very important to be involved in those types of exercises, particularly post pregnancy. Younger women who have had children and some women who are overweight also have the same problem. Menopause can cause the same problem, as does obesity. Urinary tract infections are quite common, particularly in mature aged people, and are also a major cause of incontinence. Sometimes surgery can also increase the incidence of incontinence and also reduce mobility. These issues are really important, particularly in the management of nursing homes and aged-care facilities. Approximately 77 per cent of nursing home residents in Austraare affected by incontinence, which is why these measures are so important. Forty to sixty per cent of people in nursing homes are seriously in need of this type of support. In my electorate of Forrest, there are currently around 19,000 people over the age of 65 and this figure will increase rapidly over the next decade. My electorate currently has 30 aged-care facilities and this number and capacity will need to increase as the demographic within the electorate also increases. Two of these aged-care facilities in my electorate raised concerns that high-care patients are excluded from this scheme, essentially leaving the aged-care facilities to meet the cost of those patients. I am equally concerned to ensure that people in such care receive frequent attention and the care they need for frequent changes in regard to this issue of incontinence. Limiting access of continence products to residents is a very serious concern. It poses a health risk for residents and raises quality-of-care issues. I urge the government to seriously consider the impact the high-care residents subsidy and its effect on aged-care facilities and their capacity to provide the appropriate level of care. I know that the disability sector has expressed concern to Senator Fifield that the new scheme may incur delivery costs; however, it is hoped that increased competition will ensure free delivery will be offered as an incentive to purchasers. This is a view that has been reinforced by the Continence Foundation of Australia, but I am yet to be convinced that this will actually occur and we need to seriously monitor this during the rollout of the program and beyond to ensure that it is actually the result. In conclusion, am supportive of a bill that will see payments go to eligible people living with the permanent and serious issue of incontinence.",36
13,Mrs ELLIOT,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"in reply-I am very pleased today to have the opportunity to sum up debate on the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010. The debate highlighted the importance of achieving a balance between empowering consumers with flexibility and choice and providing appropriate support and educational safeguards. The bill delivers on the 2009-10 budget commitment to introduce the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. The Continence Aids Payment Scheme replaces the current Continence Aids Assistance Scheme, which provides continence products through a sole supplier. The bill will enable the formulation of a legislative scheme under which the Commonwealth will make direct cash payments as a contribution towards the cost of buying products that manage incontinence. Medicare Australia will transact the payments, with the Department of Health and Ageing to retain policy authority. The bill also provides for transition arrangements for clients of the current Continence Aids Assistance Scheme to the Continence Aids Payment Scheme from 1 July 2010. Accountability and transparency of the new scheme are supported by the conferral of powers on the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and the Medicare Australia CEO to request information about eligibility or payments. Prompt investigation into any claims of ineligibility or improper use of funds will be undertaken, and failure to comply with a request for information will be an offence under the National Health Act 1953. Participants in the scheme will also have recourse via the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Consistent with the government's 2009-10 budget announcements, the program I will be funded by a special standing appropriation enabled under section 137(1) of the National Health Act 1953. This is particularly important in the context of an eligibility based, demand driven program. Subject to the passage of the bill through parliament, the new scheme's arrangements will take effect from 1 July 2010. The Continence Aids Payment Scheme promotes consumer choice, consistent with the government's consumer rights and responsibilities charter for community care, released in 2009 and promoted in the Commonwealth aged care programs throughout the Aged Care Act. As a result of the successful passage of the bill, recipients under the scheme will have greater flexibility and choice in where they purchase their continence products. Product suppliers and service providers will have equitable access to the client base in an open and competitive market. Those who wish to continue to have their products provided by the current provider, Intouch, can continue to do so from 1 July. Consumer feedback supports the provision of a cash payment to allow increased flexibility and choice. I am very pleased to deliver on an important budget measure that provides choice and flexibility to people with severe and permanent incontinence. I would like to thank the members of the House who have made contributions to this debate and those who were involved in developing the new payment scheme and this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",37
14,Mrs ELLIOT,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (CORPORATE REPORTING REFORM) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.",38
15,Mr HARTSUYKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Reporting Reform) Bill 2010. The intent of the bill is to improve Australia's corporate reporting framework by reducing red tape and regulatory burdens on companies, altering disclosure requirements and implementing a number of other refinements to the framework. Reducing the regulatory burden on companies and businesses is a goal that should be supported by both sides of parliament. Reducing government imposed costs on businesses allows them to produce at a more efficient level and offer products or services at a more competitive price. These amendments to the Corporations Act and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act make a number of changes to corporate reporting that will reduce the regulatory compliance costs for companies. The coalition supports this legislation and these aims of reducing government burdens on business and corporate structures generally. The bill contains four measures that I will detail. It also contains a number of minor amendments that I will discuss briefly. Firstly, there are a number of measures designed to improve the reporting requirements imposed on companies limited by guarantee. Currently, companies limited by guarantee are required to prepare a full audited financial report using accounting standards and including a director's report. The amendments streamline this process by introducing a three-tiered reporting framework that will exempt small companies limited by guarantee from reporting and auditing requirements and will provide other companies limited by guarantee with simplified disclosure requirements in the director's report. Companies limited by guarantee will no longer be required to distribute an annual report. Instead, they will be required to write to members informing them that an annual general report has been prepared and of how they can obtain a copy. Companies limited by guarantee will also be prohibited from paying dividends. This is because these companies almost exclusively consist of non-profit organisations, and the government wishes to make it clear in the legislation that this type of company structure is not suitable for dividends to be paid. There are around 11,000 companies operating in Australia that are limited by guarantee. These measures will allow them to spend less time on preparing annual reports and to use their resources more effectively and efficiently. However, it has emerged that there are a small group of companies that will be adversely affected by this bill. For instance, these might include companies currently set up as a company limited by guarantee for purposes including perhaps charitable work and with the intent that dividends will be paid in future years to beneficiaries. This legislation could force a restructure of those firms. Following concerns expressed by the coalition, the government will be moving an amendment to insert a grandfathering clause which will exempt these types of companies limited by guarantee that are currently operating from being forced to restructure. In particular, the amendment will ensure that the new measures apply only to a company limited by guarantee incorporated after the commencement of this legislation. The coalition thanks the government and minister for responding to the concerns raised and for their willingness to amend the legislation. We will be supporting this amendment. The second group of measures I will detail relate to parent entity financial statements. The current law requires an entity to prepare a financial statement in relation to itself. However, if the entity is a parent entity, also required to prepare financial statements in relation to the consolidated entity. This legislation streamlines how parent entities are treated for the purpose of reporting. An entity will have the option of preparing financial statements either in relation to itself if the accounting standards did not require the preparation of consolidated financial statements or in relation to the consolidated entity if the preparation is required by the accounting standards. By effectively halving the double reporting imposed on parent entities, these measures will assist the management of consolidated holdings and will reduce the compliance burdens of preparing multiple reports. The third group of measures involves the rules allowing companies to pay dividends. Currently, the law requires that a company may only pay a dividend from profit whilst each director has a duty to prevent insolvent trading. These measures clarify the treatment of dividends by allowing a company to pay a dividend where the company's assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is declared and where net assets are sufficient for the payment of the dividend. Payments of dividends must also be fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole and they must not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors. Importantly, these amendments retain the duty of directors to avoid insolvent trading. This group of measures allows a company more flexibility when determining the level of dividends paid in a particular year. It also allows companies to look at their net asset position for the purposes of determining dividend payments rather than restricting the approach to profits earned during the year of operation. The coalition notes the concerns from company groups such as the Australian Instiit is tute of Company Directors, which thinks a profit based test and these amendments today are still too restrictive on the ability of companies to pay dividends. The AICD suggests that an insolvency test would be a more appropriate measure for companies to use when intending to pay a dividend rather than an assets test or a profit test. Whilst this legislafunding tion does allow more flexibility for determining dividend payments, it would be useful for the government to review how the measures operate in effect and the merits of different tests for determining the amount of dividends available. Finally, the legislation will change the annual reporting requirements for all companies with regard to the annual period in which companies are required to report. The financial year will remain 12 months long. However, an entity will be permitted to vary the length of a financial year subsequent to restarting a 12-month reporting requirement. This will only be permitted in a situation where the financial year is no longer than 12 months, where the previous five financial years have all been of 12 months duration and where the change in the length of the subsequent financial year is made in good faith. This amendment is important for companies wishing to change from an end-ofyear reporting period to a 12-month period based on the financial year instead. The ability of companies to do so will be protected by the limits I have just outlined. The legislation also makes some minor changes to five further areas. Firstly, section 299A of the Corporations Act will be extended to allow all listed registered schemes to report all information reasonably required, allowing an informed assessment of operations, financial conditions and business strategies. Previously, only public companies were required to report. Secondly, companies will be required to make a statement of compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards in the director's declaration of the annual report. This statement must be explicit and unreserved. Thirdly, the legislation will allow a company to reduce its share capital by cancelling any paid-up capital that is lost or not represented by available assets. Fourthly, the legislation repeals the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, which are no longer statutory bodies and whose Commonwealth funding requirements are obsolete. Finally, the amendments will change how the composition of the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board is selected. Previously, three members were selected by the minister from a panel of seven nominated by the board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and another three from a panel of seven nominated by the board of CPA Australia. The new legislation allows the minister to select six members without involvement from the two accounting bodies. This allows appointment of members to be chosen from alternative bodies such as the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia and the National Institute of Accountants. Importantly, a person admitted to the board will be required to hold relevant qualifications in accounting or auditing, including membership of a professional body. This is important to protect the integrity of each board and ensure that the oversight is undertaken in a professional and responsible manner. The entire package of amendments contained in this legislation will reduce compliance burdens on companies, while clarifying and streamlining other areas of the law impacting upon the operations of corporate Australia. Whilst the intent of this legislation from the government is admirable, the Rudd Labor government does not have a great record in regulation and in imposing restraints upon the market which increases the operation costs of companies and business in general. This government was elected on the promise that it would not introduce regulations where it had not also repealed a piece of regulation. Lindsay Tanner repeated this pledge in 2008, where he suggested that Rudd Labor had a ‘one-in, one-out policy' when it came to drafting regulations. It was revealed in May of this year by the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing that the Rudd Labor ministers and agencies had introduced 3,335 regulations in 2009 and removed only 1,845. So, whilst this legislation helps companies dealing with the amount of regulation facing Australian individuals and businesses, the Rudd government is increasing regulations to the tune of around 1,500 new regulations a year. This is just another promise broken by this government. How can businesses trust Rudd Labor to reduce compliance costs with its record of misleading and backflipping on issues of government regulation and control? The coalition agrees that it is important to continually form corporate law to reduce compliance costs and red tape but, unlike the government, the coalition is also committed to reducing market transaction costs faced by businesses. The government is constantly increasing transaction costs for Australian businesses by interfering with market operation, sometimes without understanding the effects that policy announcements will have on the market. It has become standard practice of the Labor government to announce broad marketchanging policies with no detail and no indication to the market as to how those policies might work. This approach distorts the market and it distorts costs for businesses and companies. We saw this with Labor's emission trading scheme, which would have pushed the production and transaction costs up for practically every business in every market in Australia. Red tape would have increased significantly, with every carbonproducing business in Australia being forced to comply with the carbon-trading regime. In comparison, these amendments today will be minor in impact. Labor's ETS was called a market based approach, but it was an approach that would have prevented the market from working efficiently by increasing transaction and production costs. And now we have the resource super profits tax, Labor's great big new tax on mining, which will also lift the costs for business in Australia. This is all because this Labor government have plunged Australia into record levels of debt and deficit and need to create new taxes in order to fund their policies. This great big new tax has no regard to the costs of business in markets. The purpose of the tax is simply to deliver revenue to the Rudd Labor government. We know that the statistics used in the modelling for the tax were based on the assumption that it will have no effect on the costs for busireness and the amount of future investment in mining production in Australia. Chris Richardson of Access Economics had this to say: The KPMG Econtech modellingwhich the government used for its statisticsassumes that the RSPT is the perfect tax, causing no harm. Its result - that the abolition of royalties and introduction of the RSPT will increase investment and output in mining in Australia-will therefore presumably hold regardless of the RSPT rate. This means that no matter what rate of profits tax is placed on mining production will remain constant. The government could have put a tax rate of 99 per cent on the resources sector and it would allegedly have made no difference to production, investment and the impact of the RSPT on share prices. But we now know that this modelling is flawed and the RSPT will increase the costs for businesses. Modelling released today by Ernst & Young concludes that the modelling uses ‘an unrealistic key assumption about complete immobility of mining activity'. Mining companies who can relocate offshore will simply relocate offshore and production in Australia will suffer. According to Ernst and Young, the effects of this tax will result in: … fewer jobs, reduced investment, and lower personal income tax revenue from workers in mining and associated industries … and will raise the costs of capital required for all investments Australia (mining and non mining related) due to increased political and sovereign risk, thereby reducing investment spending in Australia. The modelling also shows that the tax will reduce the valuation of existing mining companies, impacting on superannuation funds and on Australia's sovereign wealth fund, resulting in lower personal income tax collections from capital gains and other taxes. So despite the positive intent of this legislation today to reduce compliance burdens and red tape, Labor's approach in general is to completely increase the costs of doing business in Australia through its agenda of tax and spend policies. The coalition does not take this approach. We have a proven history of paying off Labor's debt and using a positive budgetary position to pursue reforms that improve the operation of markets and reduce both compliance and transaction costs for business. The coalition supports this legislation because it will reduce compliance costs and red tape. The bill contains a number of small measures, which I have outlined, to create an easier and clarified reporting for companies. I commend the bill to the House.",38
16,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"It is a pleasure for me also to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Reporting Reform) Bill 2010 because it is an important further step in the reform agenda of the Rudd government in making sure that we help small business and we ease their regulatory burden and their compliance costs and basically make life easier for them to do their business. It is always interesting to follow a speech from a member of the opposition who, on the one hand, supports our reform and the changes we are putting forward in this area, complains about them as you might expect, and then talks about how this is something we are somehow not getting right-yet they had 12 years in government in themselves to do something of similar ilk but did not. We have come to this place with a view that you need to take action to make things happen. That is what we have done by introducing this bill. Even though the opposition complain about this bill, I understand they will be supporting it because it is good legislation. That is important to note. This amendment bill has a number of very important and key parts, particularly reducing red tape and the regulatory burden on companies, improving disclosure requirements and implementing a whole range of important refinements to our regulatory frame work, to make sure that small business, in particular companies limited by guarantee, have the right sorts opportunities in front of them. There are no extra compliance burdens, regulatory burdens or other costs placed in front of them to do their job. It was back in December 2009 that the government announced the reforms aiming to cut red tape. This was part of our wider agenda, part of our agenda coming to government about what we would do in this area. It was also about improving Australia's corporate reporting framework. It is well understood in this country and overseas that Australia has well-regulated, strong, robust corporate governance systems and networks through our Corporations Act and our regulatory system. We are further cutting red tape to strengthen and add to those areas, rather than to weaken them. The reforms in this bill will ensure that Australia's financial reporting framework remains strong and not just in accordance with world's best practice but ahead of world's best practice. This bill will establish a tailored financial reporting regime for companies limited by guarantee and it will predominantly serve those in the not-for-profit area to reduce their burden and their costs, to let them get on with the business of what they are doingthey serve mostly sport and recreation and charitable organisations. The bill will also continue to ensure that we have the appropriate levels of transparency and disclosure and that we maintain a very strong standing in that area. The proposed amendments introduce a three-tier differential reporting framework, exempting small companies limited by guarantee from reporting and auditing certain requirements and providing other companies limited by guarantee with streamlined assurance requirements and simplified disclosure in the director's report. It also means that, example, the distribution of annual reports to members will be streamlined and can be provided only when members actually ask for those reports, rather than being sent out to everybody. The bill also changes the way dividends can be paid: rather than being based on just profit they can also be based on the capacity to pay-that is, based on more flexible solvency requirements, which is also important. The bill will also relieve companies that are parent entities of the requirement to prepare financial statements for both, which really means that it can be done in one place. The bill goes through a range of other transparency and utility of disclosures contained in the director's report and an extension of requirements. There is a lot that I have to say in this area, but I am conscious of the time and I want to give the minister an opportunity to sum up debate on this bill. I am very supportive of this. It is part of our wider agenda in terms of reducing red tape, compliance costs and burdens, and to make sure that small business gets a company tax cut-from 30 per cent down to 28 per cent. In the end, while some people may speak of being the friends of small business, it is the ones who actually take action who are their real friends. I have no doubt that, in the amendments that we are putting forward, that is exactly what we are doing. I fully support this bill and I congratulate the minister for his good work.",42
17,Mr BOWEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (1.53 pm)-I thank the members for Oxley and Cowper for their contributions to this debate on the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Reporting Reform) Bill 2010. A robust financial reporting framework is an essential component of an efficient market. for Appropriate financial reporting and audit requirements enhance the accuracy of financial information, ensure transparency and comparability, and promote confidence. While Australia has a well-regarded financial reporting framework, opportunities do exist to cut red tape in several areas, and this bill does that. We are very mindful of the regulatory burden facing Australian businesses. The amendments contained in this bill will ensure Australia's financial reporting framework remains strong and in line with world best practice. The bill establishes a tailored, three-tiered financial reporting regime, as the member for Oxley outlined. We will be moving a minor amendment to the prohibition on companies limited by guarantee paying dividends to members to ensure the prohibition will apply only to companies incorporated on or after the commencement of the bill. This avoids prejudicing any existing arrangements such companies may have. The bill also streamlines parent entity reporting, relieving parent entities of the requirement to prepare financial statements for both the parent entity and the consolidated group. Additionally, the bill relaxes the statuof tory requirement that companies may only pay dividends from profits, replacing the profits test with a more flexible solvency based requirement. In doing so, the government has been careful to ensure that the wording of the new provision continues to protect shareholders and creditors. I do acknowledge the contribution of the member for Cowper and the concerns he raised in this regard. He raised concerns that have been raised by the Australian Institute of Company Directors. I should note that the Institute of Company Directors support this bill and call for it to be passed, but they do have concerns about this particular element. I should also note that that is not a unanimous view amongst the accounting bodies in Australia and, as I understand, the position National Institute of Accountants is that they support the framing of this bill and do not share the concerns that have been expressed by the Australian Institute of Company Directors. It is also the case that we have taken the advice of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, ASIC, who are very strongly of the view that the framing of the bill is appropriate. It is not surprising that there is a divergence of views on this matter, but it is important this bill be passed. The government, of course, will continue to monitor the situation and is more than happy to talk to the Australian Institute of Company Directors, but it is important that I note for the House that their concerns are not unanimously held amongst accounting groups. The bill also facilitates an easier change of a company's balance date, reducing the burden on companies and their auditors particularly during peak reporting periods. Finally, the bill implements a number of important refinements to the corporate regulatory framework that will improve the usefulness financial information provided to users. The bill underwent a two-month public consultation period and stakeholders were very supportive of the reforms that it delivers. In summary, this bill improves Australia's corporate reporting framework by reducing unnecessary red tape, a regulatory burden on companies, improving disclosure requirements and implementing a number of other important refinements to the corporate regulatory framework. I welcome the support of the opposition and the comments from the member for Cowper. I thought the first half of his speech was well constructed. The second half left something to be desired when he misrepresented the position of superannuation funds and the resource super profits tax, but that is a debate for another day. I of the commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",43
18,Mr BOWEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (1.57 pm)-by leave-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Reporting Reform) Bill 2010 and move government amendments (1) to (4): (1) Schedule 1, item 52, page 21 (after line 23), after subsection 1510B(1), insert: (1A) The amendment made by item 6 of Schedule 1 to the amending Act applies in relation to a company limited by guarantee incorporated on or after the commencement of that item. (2) Schedule 1, item 52, page 21 (line 24), omit “6,”. (3) Schedule 1, item 54, page 23 (after line 23), after subsection 1515(1), insert: (1A) The amendment made by item 6 of Schedule 1 to the amending Act applies in relation to a company limited by guarantee incorporated on or after the commencement of that item. (4) Schedule 1, item 54, page 23 (line 24), omit “6,”. Among its red-tape-reducing changes this bill contains measures to significantly reduce the regulatory burden on companies limited by guarantee. Consistent with this objective and in order to avoid disrupting existing and, in some cases, long standing corporate arrangements, I am moving amendments to grandfather the prohibition on companies limited by guarantee paying dividends to their members. The corporate structure of companies limited by guarantee means that they are not well suited to conducting activities involving the payment of dividends to members. This is because members are not shareholders, generally invest only nominal amounts of capital into the company and do not expect financial returns from the company. For example, in the case of a small sporting club, members receive returns in the form of access to facilities and discounted goods and services. Almost all companies limited by guarantee have a not-for-profit focus and will not pay dividends to their members in any case. While the structure of such companies is not suited to the distribution of dividends it is still technically possible for a company limited by guarantee to pay dividends. Recently some stakeholders have raised concerns with the proposed prohibition as the constitutions of a very small number of companies enable them to pay a dividend and the prohibition had the potential to inconvenience the long standing arrangements. For example, these companies would be required to change their corporate structure should they need to pay dividends. This in turn would increase their regulatory burden. This issue was not identified during the public consultation process but was raised more recently. After giving these issues due consideration, the government recognises the merits of making amendments at this stage. Consequently I am moving minor amendments to ensure that prohibition will only apply to companies limited by guarantee incorporated on or after the commencement of the bill. This grandfathering avoids adversely affecting the existing arrangements that a small number of companies limited by guarantee may have in place for the payment of dividends. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",44

20,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,CONGO AIR CRASH,"On indulgence, I would like to make some brief remarks about the plane missing between Cameroon and the Congo on which are aboard six Australian citizens and one permanent Australian resident. I know the House will be both concerned and distressed at the news over the weekend of a plane chartered by Sundance Resources-a well known Western Australian mineral resources industry player. The plane took off from Cameroon for what was a flight of an hour's duration and after three or four hours was reported missing. We are, of course, very seriously concerned about the welfare, well-being and safety of the six Australian citizens and the one Australian permanent resident on board. Consular officials have been providing every assistance to Sundance Resources and have been providing consular assistance to the families. That is being effected out of Canberra and out of Perth. Our High Commissioner to Nigeria is currently on the ground in Cameroon liaising directly with the Cameroon authorities and company representatives. The search is being coordinated and directed by Cameroon authorities in close consultation with the company itself. The company has had an interest in the iron ore prospective region near the border area of Cameroon, the Congo and Gabon since about 2006. It is still the early hours of the morning in Cameroon in West Africa. At first light this morning the search will resume. It will resume with the assistance of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Yesterday's search provided no conclusive evidence, but the general search area is in the border area between Cameroon and the Congo. The plane made usual procedural contact after 30 minutes of a one-hour flight. A number of the board members of Sundance Resources would be well known to members of this House. This will be a very, very difficult time and a time of great distress for the families, for other management of Sundance Resources and also for employees of the company. I am sure that all of the thoughts, wishes and prayers of the House will be with the family members, the company managers and the employees at this very difficult time. I will keep the House informed, as appropriate, of any developments when the search resumes. I thank the House.",45
21,Ms JULIE BISHOP,CONGO AIR CRASH,"On indulgence, on behalf of the coalition, I confirm that we join with the government in expressing our deep concerns about the safety of the passengers aboard the charter flight from Cameroon which failed to reach its destination in the Congo yesterday. The Australian miners on board would be well known to a number of members of this House. Indeed, Sundance Resources is a Western Australian based mining company that is emerging as a global iron ore company. The miners on board epitomise the pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit that has made the Australian mining sector so great in this country. I know, as my West Australian colleagues will know, that the West Australians on board are indeed very active members in our local community. At this stage we can only hope, and we join with the government in hoping, that tomorrow will bring better news. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those missing. NA",46

I said that consultations were going well with very significant sections of the industry, that we were talking to many companies-both large and small-and that we were doing that in a genuine and productive way, and I said that their behaviour had been honourable. I also said that there were a small number of companies that were not behaving in an honourable way. I went on to say that this is information that has been given to me confidentially. I also went on to say that it is well known to many opposite and to many in the gallery that strong-arm tactics have been used in the industry. I would note that one senior journalist yesterday confirmed this on television. I stand by everything that I said yesterday. I also said that I had admiration for the mining industry as wealth creators. We should get the record right here. I said that we were having a vigorous debate. We will continue to have a vigorous debate of ideas. We will continue to have a vigorous debate about Australians receiving a fair share of their mineral resources. That is a debate that will go on, as it should. I stand by everything I said yesterday. Broadband",47
25,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's progress in increasing productivity by building a stronger Australian economy through the delivery of a superfast broadband network?,47
26,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for his question, because each time. I have been to his part of Tasmania local small businesses and local government have asked me, ‘When is the National Broadband Network going to be connected?' We already have that connection work underway. In fact, in the honourable member's electorate we will be connecting up the first homes to the network in July of this year. Yesterday was a good news day for the future of the Australian economy, because what we need for the future is the infrastructure of the future. The government has committed to building a stronger economy and also to delivering for families across the nation. A national broadband network is a key part of the infrastructure of the future. In the 19th century we had the state governments of Australia then laying out the infrastructure of that century and the one that followed-laying out the railway system and laying out the telegraph system. For the needs of the 21st century we need the infrastructure of the 21st century, and that is a national broadband network. That is why we are delighted with the agreement reached yesterday between the National Broadband Network and Telstra. This is a good agreement. In 2007, Australia had the third most expensive internet services in the world. Also, in 2007, our broadband was 35 times slower than that of the fastest nation. So we were the third most expensive and we had a system 35 times slower than that of the fastest nation in the OECD. That is why in March 2007, we, then in opposition, committed to building a national broadband network. Since then, we have had sustained negotiations with Telstra. As a consequence of those negotiations, we have reached an important agreement with them on the future of the network. This agreement paves the way for faster, cheaper broadband services right across the nation. It paves the way for a more efficient rollout of the National Broadband Network across the nation. It paves the way for families having access to broadband across the nation, for small businesses having access to broadband across the nation and for schools and hospitals having access to broadband across the nation. The government is committed to delivering optical fibre with speeds of 100 megabits per second. That is around 50 times faster than is received today. Furthermore, with a mix of next-generation wireless and satellite technologies, we will be delivering broadband to all Australian families. That is because we make no distinction between Australians who live in the bush, who live in the regions and who live in the big cities. We want to make sure that they are all wired to the economy of the 21st century. In practical terms, what will this mean for families and businesses out there? It will mean that we will have slashed telephone bills for small business. I would think that would be good for small business. We are going to have enhanced business services such as teleconferencing. We are going to have videoconferencing. We are going to have virtual private networks. So the need for small businesses in one part of the country to fly or drive to another part of the try just to do a deal gets removed as a result of this brand new technology. It helps businesses right across regional Australia to sell their products or their services to the markets of the world, to sell to them online. It enhances the capacities of our hospitals to deliver e-health in regional and rural Australia. It produces e-education as well, and highdefinition, multichannel and interactive TV services. It will also help farmers to electronically track their livestock, monitor their crops and have instant access to market and weather conditions.",47
27,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They can do it on their mobile phones.,48
28,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice that the voice for the future over there interjects-the member for O'Connor. Wilson, this is welcome even in your electorate. They want it in your electorate, because it helps them in their businesses, it helps them in their primary industries and it helps the schools in your electorate, as it does in the electorate of every other member represented here. There is just one difference: you are not prepared to admit it. For students across Australia, it will open up new opportunities: 3-D interactive learning experiences and specialist training. When mixed with the computers in schools program brought about by the Minister for Education, it will ensure that our students have full access to this technology for the 21st century. Then we come to the question of jobs. This project alone is capable of generating 25,000 jobs across the country, including in areas such as north-west Tasmania, where jobs have been lost as a result of closures in other industries. The Australian government is proud of this achievement. It is proud of the agreement which the minister has reached with Telstra. This is a good agreement for Telstra, a good agreement for the National Broadcounband Network, a good agreement for the nation, a good agreement for small business and a good agreement for families who need access to the technology and the infrastructure of the 21st century. That is the practical stuff we are engaged in in building a stronger economy for the future and making sure that all Australian families have a share of that future as well. Budget",48
29,Mr FLETCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the plight of Clark Equipment, a supplier of forklifts and bobcats based in my electorate and employing nearly 500 people. Since the great big new tax on mining was announced, the business has experienced a sharp drop in orders from the mining sector and other regional customers, including half a million dollars of lost business in Western Australia. When will the Prime Minister stop pretending that his new tax is somehow good for the mining industry and listen to the concerns of real people like those at Clark Equipment and dump his jobdestroying tax?",48
30,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank very much the member for Bradfield for his question. In response to his question I would draw attention to the fact that the modelling produced as part of the Treasury's report underlines not only the growth in the economy and employment overall as a consequence of the government's tax reform package but, on top of that, the growth in employment activity within the mining industry as well. That is underlined in the Treasury's analysis and reflected in the Econtech report. Secondly about tax reform, I would say to the honourable member that he should also pay attention to the fact that in his electorate he would have some thousands of small businesses who are currently, frankly, in line to obtain a new tax advantage from what the government has put forward. We are also, in terms of those incorporated companies within his electorate, promising them a two per cent tax cut; he is promising them a two per cent tax increase. That is the difference between us and them. The overall impact of these tax reforms on the business community therefore generates a more competitive business sector. They draw its costs down and therefore boost its profitability and the ity and employment it generates in the whole economy. I would also like to know how many working people in the honourable member's electorate would benefit from increasing super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Let me say to the honourable member: there will be many people in his electorate of Bradfield whose current anticipated retirement income will not be adequate to service them effectively in their retirement years. What we are on about is better super for something like 7½ million working families. What we are on about is a tax cut and tax breaks for about 2.4 million Australian businesses, as well as a reduction in the company rate, affecting about three-quarters of a million Australian businesses. The honourable member goes to the impact specifically of our proposed tax reform on the mining industry. I simply alert the House to one fact-that is, let us look at how the old stock market is performing today. The Rio share price just prior to the time that the government announced its tax reform proposals was $72.10. As of today, Rio has passed that level and is now trading at $72.25. I say to the honourable member opposite that we should look at the market's assessment of the real impact of the proposed tax reform on the bottom line performance of the mining industry overall. There is a difference between fact and fear, and what the honourable member has done in his question is to have sought further to perpetrate fear. I would suggest that we have a debate based on fact.

31,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital activEconomy. Why is universal high-speed broadband vital nation-building infrastructure, and what progress is being made to implement this? Are there any threats to the rollout?",49
32,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Franklin for her question. I am surprised that the member for Bradfield is not asking questions about broadband and communications, because I know the member for Bradfield actually understands the need for structural separation. But it seems when they go across there and sit on those benches the intellectual integrity gets drained away. Every Tasmanian knows about the importance of broadband. They know that this government's plan for a national broadband network is the largest nation-building infrastructure project in our history. The announcement of a financial heads of agreement between Telstra and NBN Co. is indeed historic. The agreement clears a path to move Australia from the copper age to the fibre future. The agreement ensures structural separation-reform promoted by the member for Bradfield in his book and reform that will boost services, competition and innovation in Australia. For the first time we will have a national wholesale only network that is not controlled by any retail company. In total, this agreement guarantees a faster, cheaper rollout of the National Broadband Network, with higher take-up rates. This is a win for Australian businesses and a win for all Australian households. This is recognised particularly in regional Australia. That is why it has got such strong support from Tasmanians, who understand the threat that those opposite present to the future of the Tasmanian economy. But it is not just in Tasmania; it is not just in the south. Up the in the Far North, the Far North Queensland chairman of the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: I think this will be good for the regionalisation Australia, particularly e-commerce … We need people to come to regional Australia, with good broadband it will create opportunities. Indeed it will. But those opposite are determined to oppose this forward thinking. The opposition spokesperson, Tony Smith, has said: This hugely expensive and risky venture is something that no responsible government would contemplate in the first place … He is half right, because no coalition government would have the vision to contemplate such a proposition. The shadow finance minister has gone out there and opposed it as well. Indeed, their alternative is that they are going to create a $1 billion fund to: … invest in 21st century education and communication tools to improve learning opportunities in the regions … It is like trading in your iPhone for a walkietalkie. The opposition are stuck in the past. The problem is not just that they are stuck in the past but that they want the rest of Australia to stay back and keep them company. That is the problem with this Leader of the Opposition. No matter what area of policy you look at they are stuck in the past, too afraid to make the leap into this century that is so necessary for our economic future. Budget",49

I refer the Prime Minister to the plight of Wallis Drilling, a company that operates 40 drill rigs and employs about 225 people. Since the announcement of the Prime Minister's great big new tax on mining, Wallis Drilling has cancelled orders for two new drilling rigs worth about $5 million in business to other firms and has also suspended plans for a $1.5 million extension to its workshop. This means less work for engineers, boilermakers, paintof ers, mechanics, builders, carpenters and plumbers. When will he stop pretending that his new tax is somehow good for the mining industry and listen to the concerns of real people like those at Wallis Drilling and dump his job-destroying tax?",50
34,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. In response to his question I refer him in part to the answer I gave to an earlier question from the member for Bradfield, and that goes to the aggregate impact of the overall tax reform package which the government has put forward and its impact on growth, employment and investment in the mining industry. In fact, it is projected that investment in the mining industry will increase by between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent as a result of the reform, and that employment within the mining industry will increase by seven per cent as a result of the reform being brought in by the government. And that is because we are bringing in a profits based tax as opposed to one which is based on production. The Leader of the National Party talks about the impact of this tax reform proposal on the industry more broadly. I also note in passing, as in fact did the Treasurer in answering a question, that if you look at the National Party's constituency-and they had their conference over the weekend-it is pretty interesting to know where they actually stand on the question of the National Broadband Network. What is the Leader of the National Party, claiming to represent the interests of all those regions out there, ally saying about their desire to have decent, reliable, cheap, broadband services?  order going to relevance. The question was about a great big new tax on mining. It had nothing to do with the National Broadband Network. How could this answer now possibly be relevant to the question?",50
35,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I will listen carefully to the Prime Minister. He understands that he has to be relevant. The Prime Minister has the call.,51
36,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As those opposite would be aware, we in the House are pleased today to be welcoming the Vice-President of the People's Republic of China. Earlier today with him I witnessed the signing of a number of agreements. The nature and content of some of these agreements are quite interesting. One is a facility agreement",51
37,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,51
38,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I know this might be difficult for those opposite to listen to but it does go directly to the question which has been asked by the Leader of the National Party, which is: what is the impact of tax reform on overall perceptions of confidence in the mining industry? Today, together with the Vice-President of the People's Republic of China, we witnessed the signing of a facility agreement for $US1.2 billion between Karara Mining Ltd and the China Development Bank Corporation. Furthermore, we also saw a cooperation agreement between Resourcehouse Ltd, ExportImport Bank of China, the Metallurgical Corporation of China and China Power Holdings to establish a $US8 billion China First Coal Development project involving the construction of a mine and a 476-kilometre railway to the port of Abbot Point near Bowen. That is what was signed in our presence actuearlier today. Perhaps there is a third one which I should draw our attention to as well, and that is an engineering and procurement contract cooperation agreement for China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd to provide procurement engineering and design services to Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. At current estimates the expansion, I am advised, would add up to $A5 billion of annual export revenue to Australia. Here are three sets of agreements which have been signed in my presence and the presence of the Chinese Vice-President about one-and-a-half hours ago. I know that those opposite have difficulty in confronting the facts in this debate; they would much rather run a fear campaign. This government is interested in tax reform because it delivers better super for working families-7.5 million of them; better tax arrangements for our 2.4 million small businesses right across the country; tax cuts for some three-quarters of a million incorporated Australian businesses; and a dedicated infrastructure fund for our resource states, Queensland, WA and elsewhere, to build the road, rail and ports that they desperately cry out for for the future. So I say to the Leader of the National Partyapart from the fact he is not interested in representing in this chamber his constituency's interest in the National Broadband Network-that on the question of the impact of our tax reform proposal he should look very carefully at the facts and the content of what is occurring out there in the community, and if his overall argument is that there is no fidence on the part of international investors in the impact of the government's tax reform proposal, I would ask him to look very carefully at the three sets of agreements which were signed in my presence and the presence of the Chinese Vice-President today. Broadband",51
39,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To keep the Tasmanian theme going, my question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is the agreement between Telstra and the National Broadband Network Company an important step in telecommunications sector reform with major benefits for the Australian economy and, of course, Tasmania?",52
40,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyons for his question and I acknowledge his long standing commitment to improve broadband access for his constituents. In fact, I recall meeting with his constituents on the very issue on a number of occasions. The agreement that was announced yesterday is a very important step for the telecommunications sector in Australia for microeconomic reform and for the Australian economy, and indeed the Tasmanian economy where the Broadband Network is being rolled out first. I understand that it is supported by none other than the Tasmanian Liberal Party. It is good to see that progress is occurring in Tasmania and in Australia on this vital area of microeconomic reform that is crucial for kick starting productivity growth in the economy and also for reform in our health and education sectors. It is a crucial reform. In particular, this agreement is critical because of the need to transition from copper to fibre and to ensure that we have a genuinely structurally separated industry where no one telecommunications retailer controls the infrastructure. I first raised the issue of structural separation conas shadow minister for communications back in 2002, with the active support of the then Leader of the Opposition, now Minister for Trade. Since that time the Labor Party has been committed to solving what was one of the great public policy disasters imposed on this nation by the Howard government, and that was privatising Telstra without reforming the structure of the telecommunications industry, which therefore left Australia with a totally dominant player, a privately owned monopoly player, in a sector that is rapidly becoming as important to the economy as the financial services sector. Since that time Labor has been committed to ensuring that we have a genuinely productive, efficient, competitive telecommunications industry sector that delivers world class broadband to all Australians and ensures that we have a truly productive, competitive infrastructure and do not have an industry structure that impedes that. The problem with the stalemate that emerged from the former government is that we had massively complex regulatory arrangements that delivered incentives to Telstra to gain the regulation and to delay innovation and to delay competition and, as a result, Australia progressively fell further and further behind comparable countries in the quality, the speed and the access of broadband that was being made available to our citizens and our businesses. In that scenario, in that stalemate, there was no legitimate prospect of anybody-private or public player-building a universal national broadband network. We had over that period 17 different Howard government broadband plans",52
41,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,53
42,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am now told it is 18, so maybe I missed one, but we had dozens of different plans, all window-dressing and all designed to cover up the stalemate that was put in place by the Howard government on broadband. The Rudd government is in the process of breaking that stalemate and yesterday's agreement was a landmark step in breaking that stalemate. It means that the government is now working in partnership with the entire telecommunications sector to deliver world-class broadband throughout Australia, to kick-start productivity in our economy and to kick-start reform of sectors like health and education. Not only is this agreement good for our economy, not only is it good for Tasmania and for the rest of Australia but also, in my view, it will be good for Telstra shareholders. As broadband unfolds, more and more of our business activity will shift into the digital world and, as the single biggest player by far in the telecommunications sector in Australia, Telstra is superbly positioned to benefit from the improved opportunities that that will provide to all telecommunications providers. We as a government are also providing a range of compensation to Telstra, for the customers being transitioned by Telstra to the new network, for the infrastructure that Telstra owns that the NBN will now be able to use and, of course, for the government taking on board the heavy lifting of the universal service obligation that has previously been dealt with by Telstra. All of these things are opening up new opportunities for our economy, for Telstra, for our education sector, for our health sector and for other parts of the Australian economy. But this does raise one big question: where now, in the wake of this agreement, does this leave the opposition? With the entire telecommunications sector now working cooperatively and constructively with the government to deliver world-class broadband across Australia to kick-start our productivity for the future, where does this leave the opposition? At this point, it is still blocking in the Senate, still opposing and still proposing to put forward John Howard's program No. 18 or No. 19-yet another rinky-dink, youbeaut, acme broadband proposal that is all about window-dressing, all about pretending to tackle the problem but is in fact doing nothing. It is time the opposition reconsidered its position, got with the strength and understood that the entire sector now is working hand in hand with the government to improve broadband for the future of Australia and for the future of Tasmania and for delivering the productivity gains that we need to improve our economy and for delivering long-term sustainable growth for all Australians.

43,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to the comments of Indigenous leader and Western Australian magistrate Sue Gordon, who said that the job prospects of thousands of Aborigines were at risk unless the new tax on mining was scrapped and that: We are now beginning to be part of wealth creation in this country … but not if projects don't go ahead. Will the Prime Minister listen to Indigenous leaders like Sue Gordon and scrap his tax or will he guarantee that no Indigenous community will be worse off as a result of developments suspended or mining projects not proceeded with because of his tax grab?",53
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. She asked specifically about the impact of our proposed tax reform on employment and Indigenous Australians. I would say in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the government's advice is that we will see an overall increase in employment in the mining industry to the tune of some seven per cent. Activity in the mining industry would increase by 4.5 to 5.5 per cent. Furthermore, I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for this particular question, because it goes to what I would describe as previous campaigns concerning the impact of reforms by previous Labor governments on employment and in this sector in particular. I recall in particular the virulent position of those opposite to the introduction of native title legislation. I recall in particular the position of those opposite, which was that if we were to introduce native title legislation in the 1990s that would be the end of the mining industry, it would be the end of certainty in the mining industry, there would be no growth in the mining industry and there would be no further jobs in the mining industry. That proved to be false, false, false and false. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister is dismissing the concerns of an Indigenous leader and I ask him to answer the question: will he scrap the tax or will he give a guarantee that no Indigenous",54
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The deputy leader knows that she should approach the dispatch box with her point of order first. On relevance, the Prime Minister is responding to the question.",54
46,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, the deputy leader's question goes to the impact of our proposed tax reform on employment in the mining industry and, as a consequence therefore, for Indigenous Australians. I would simply again say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: when it comes to consistency of standards, she should reflect fully and honestly on the campaign waged by those opposite against the introduction of native title legislation and its impact on employment in the 1990s. Mr Abbott interjecting",54
47,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition interjects, ‘Why is this faintly relevant?' I seem to remember he had something to do with Work Choices and the campaign which was run order. The Prime Minister was not asked about either Work Choices or native title; he was asked about the job-destroying impact of his great big new tax on mining. I would ask you to bring him back to the question.",54
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. As indicated by the Manager of Opposition Business'sMr Randall interjecting,54
49,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for his addenda that those words were not actually used in the question, but, as the Manager of Opposition Business's point of order goes, amongst the matters raised by the question are job prospects for Indigenous Australians. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.",54
50,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, when it goes to the impact on employment as a result of government policy change and government policy reform, we have already seen two very large fear campaigns in the past, one on native title and the other on Work Choices, which those opposite projected would result in the collapse of the mining industry, a lapse of investment and a collapse in confidence-and, frankly, all of those claims have been proven to be untrue. The second point I would make is this, in terms of the role of the mining industry in generating employment. I was talking to the Minister for Resources and Energy about this just the other day-in the recession last the global recession, can I say to site there are some claims around that in fact the mining industry, on the employment impact, helped see Australia through. Well, of course, the mining industry played a role. I would also draw attention to the fact that they were the first sector in the economy to shed jobs during the global financial crisisMr Albanese-Fifteen per cent in six weeks.",54
51,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Fifteen thousand jobs, I am advised, in the middle of 2009 had gone from the major companies across the various sectors of Australia. I would simply ask people to reflect on that fact. I am advised by various ministers behind me that that the fall in employment in the sector could have been by as much as 15 per cent. The rest of the economy, backed by a government stimulus strategy, continued to generate employment, including in retail, including in small business and including in the rest of the economy, because we got in there and we worked together to generate further activity, further profits and, therefore, further employment. Therefore, the overall argument that employment was somehow held up as a consequence of a 15 per cent shedding of jobs by the mining industry during the GFC is palpably untrue. Again, let us simply confront a few facts here, because what we have dealt with is the hypocrisy of the opposition's claims concerning previous campaigns. But, on this theme, let us also reflect on how the share colprice is going for the member for Dickson. The member for Dickson's share prices have been doing very wellMs Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. So far you have indicated that, whenever the Prime Minister talks about employment, in even a general sense, it is relevant to the question. This is about the year, stock market, and under no circumstances those oppocould this be deemed relevant.",55

54,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his place. The Prime Minister will respond to the question. The member for Dickson was not involved in the question. The Prime Minister will relate his material to the question.,55
55,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In my discussions with the mining companies over time, both Rio and BHP-and other mining companies, including FMG-in fact have been providing significant employment programs for Indigenous Australians, and we have welcomed that. In fact, the work that we are doing in terms of GenerationTwo with ‘Twiggy' Forrest for added employment for Aboriginal Australians, both in the mining sector and beyond the mining sector, has been important. BHP has been one of those companies, which brings me to their share price-on 4 May it was $38.59 order. Apart from being deeply un-primeministerial, it is also irrelevant and I would ask you to sit the Prime Minister down.",55

57,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"BHP, like other companies, have actually performed well over the course of the last month. Their share price is up. Therefore, that reflects that in fact the sector overall, despite the fear campaign being mounted by some, is actually progressing well relative to other resource companies around the world. So, on the question of employment and activity in the mining sector, can I say to those opposite, who continue to interject on this matter in their new-found concern for Indigenous employment in Australia, that once again this flies in the facts and reality.",56
58,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why is it so important that this mining boom be managed better than the last one?",56
59,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Page for this very important question because it is very important that mining boom mark II is managed much better than mining boom mark I.,56
60,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,56
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer has the call. He will be heard in silence.,56
62,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure everybody in the House is aware how those opposite ignored something like 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank about the emergence of capacity constraints in our economy that put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates, and how they used to come into this House, day after day, and say that infrastructure was nothing to do with the Commonwealth government; it was all the responsibility of state governments. They simply washed their hands of important responsibilities during mining boom mark I, and, of course, the consequence of that was rising inflation and rising interest rates. One of the key challenges this government faces is that there is a resurgence in global commodity prices, and that brings great opportunity for Australia because even in the middle of all of the uncertainties that we see in the global economy, particularly caused by uncertainty in Europe, what we do know is that this region is growing strongly. I want everyone to think about this at the moment. Take the first three months of this year, the first quarter of this year: on an annualised basis, the Asian economies have grown by 10 per cent. Think about that and think about face of where we have come from in such a short period of time, and compare that with the gloomy outlook elsewhere in the global Mining economy. This demonstrates that we have a two-speed global economy. And, when that translates to this country, it can also translate into a two-speed domestic economy. We certainly welcome the fact that global commodity prices are up. We have the price of iron ore doubling since last year and very large increases in coal prices. This is great news for Australia providing we handle it properly, plan for the future and invest in infrastructure. And, as the Prime Minister pointed out before, the agreements that were signed here today with the Chinese officials point to very strong inward investment into the sector. Seven out of the 10 agreements that were signed today were in resources and energy. And, of course, our terms of trade are expected to rise to their highest level in 60 years. The terms of trade are going to hit their highest level in 60 years. That exceeds the peak of the previous boom. Consider that in this context. There was a report from the IMF last week. This is what the IMF had to say: … within five years Asia's economy … will be about 50 per cent larger than it is todaythink about that… account for more than a third of global output, and be comparable in size to the economies United States and Europe. Why is all this important? This is important because what it does bring is great opportunities and great challenges for our domestic economy. Last week we had the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Battellino, talk about the stresses and strains that are put on an economy when you have a terms of trade boom and implications for inflation, particularly if we do not deal with the capacity constraints and particularly if we are not concerned with those sectors of the economy that are not the immediate beneficiary of a terms of trade boom. Many small businesses and many medium-sized businesses have to compete for labour and have to deal with the higher dollar. All of these things become a reality in the middle of this great opportunity that Australia has that comes from the Asian Century. And we can only maximise our opportunities from that if we are forwardlooking and we put in place tax reforms which deliver the benefit to everybody in the economy and tax reforms that recognise that we are having a terms of trade boom and that the price for our mineral resources-the mineral resources we own 100 per cent; the mineral resources that can only be dug up once-should be reflected fairly in the return to the Australian people. If those prices are going to be permanently higher, then we, as the owners of those resources, are entitled to a share of it. What do those opposite say? They want to see this boom, this windfall, walk right out the door and do nothing about these essential challenges facing our economy. They want to do nothing about investment in infrastructure, do nothing about making our companies more competitive by giving our small businesses a tax break, do nothing about making of the the corporate rate lower and do nothing about any of those things because their approach to this is to do nothing-except to say the miners are paying too much tax, and not even the miners are game to say that. So we do need to talk about this as a nation because what we need to do is to leave to our children a lasting legacy from this boom that comes from the bounty and the opportunity of the Asian Century, and that is why we on this side of the House are so determined to build up our national savings so that we can fund some of that investment. We know how important national superannuation was, and that pool of savings was used last year to recapitalise our companies coming out of the global recession. We are going to need our savings increased to fund further investment in this country as we go forward. But what is the view of those opposite? Do nothing, ignore it. We know that there is a two-speed domestic economy. We know that even now, despite the fact that we are one of the strongest growing advanced economies, many in small business are still struggling, and they will continue to struggle in a two-speed domestic economy. That is why it is the responsibility of government to face up to the hard-nosed reforms that are required to make our economy more prosperous. But, of course, those opposite only have one solution: to bring back Work Choices, cut wages and oppose any future reforms. We on this side of the House understand the challenge of reform, how to maximise the opportunities flowing from the Asian century and how to support our businesses and their employees, and we will continue to do it.

77,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. Will the minister advise the House of the strength and importance of the relationship between China and Australia with regard to the resources sector?,59
78,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The visit to Australia by a high-level delegation led His Excellency the Vice-President of China is a very strong statement about the strength of the trading relationship between Australia and China. Nowhere is that more important than for my own portfolio responsibilities of Resources, Energy and Tourism. In 2010 alone China was Australia's largest two-way goods and services trading partner with over $85 billion in total trade. I therefore welcome, on behalf of the House today, the signing of 10 agreements between Australia and China worth over $10 billion, seven of which relate specifically to my Resources and Energy portfolio. These agreements will see major upgrades to infrastructure and in doing so deliver jobs and economic prosperity not only to Australia but especially to our major regional communities. For example, I go to the Bowen Basin and I refer to a US$8 billion agreement relating to China First Coal Development, Resourcehouse, the Export-Import Bank of China, Metallurgical Corporation of China and China Power Holdings. That agreement alone will lead to the construction of a mine, a 476-kilometre railway to the port of Abbott Point, near Bowen, and a coal-loading terminal. It could result in approximately $4 billion in export earnings a year for 25 years alone. Other agreements refer, for example, to an undertaking reached between Fortescue Metals Group and China for procurement, engineering and design services to fast-track the expansion of Fortescue's iron-ore project in the Pilbara. On current estimates the expansion will add more than $5 billion to the annual export revenue of Australia. I then go to the agreement between Karara Mining, the China Development Bank and the Bank of China, which goes to the potential development of the Oakajee iron ore project in Western Australia, a project supported by an investment by the current government by of $343 million to facilitate the port development for that key project, a project neglected by the previous government. In terms of South Australia, I refer to the Arckaringa Energy project, which could see high-value, clean-energy products including liquid fuels, chemical feedstocks and power as a result of that particular opportunity. I am also pleased to report that my department has entered into a memorandum of understanding with China's National Energy Administration for further close cooperation on energy, notably in oil and gas, coal, coal seam methane, lowemissions technologies, renewable energy and uranium. Also, I do not forget the importance of tourism in a $30 million marketing package announced by the Prime Minister, going to boost tourism from China. That market alone is currently worth $2.8 billion to Australia's burgeoning tourism sector and is expected to grow by over 10 per cent on average to $5.5 billion by 2017. I am pleased to say that a high-level engagement will be held with the Chinese administration in tropical North Queensland for the purposes of trying to extend some of that growth out of the Chinese market to Cairns and related regions. These announcements are a very strong statement about the strength of the trade relationship between Australia and China. They are also a very strong statement about the fact that Australia is a very attractive place for investment. I simply say that from the Australian government's point of view we will continue to work to deliver agreements such as this. I also indicate that we will tinue to engage with the resources sector to put in place major taxation reform which delivers a profits based tax system whilst also ensuring as a result of those consultations, as evidenced by the announcements today between Australia and China, that Australia is a very attractive place for investment and that there will be jobs growth and ongoing investment in Australia.",59
79,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. In light of the Deputy Prime Minister's statement that foreign corporations are paying only 13 per cent tax, is the minister aware that a good example of the counterproductive nature of foreign takeovers and the appallingly failed ‘marketism' policies of this place is that the one million people living in North Queensland are now to get their milk from southern Queensland, 2,000 kilometres away, while North Queensland's Malanda Milk, locked out of Woolworths and Coles, must travel 2,000 kilometres south? Is the minister further aware that Woolworths and Coles, with 83 per cent of the food market, are paying dutch auction prices to the dairy corporations? This oppressive pricing from the chains has seen 240 North Queensland farmers tortured down to just 60. Five dairy companies, all once Australian owned, are now, bar one, foreign owned. Finally, our six giant mining companies were all Australian owned pre-marketism but now all are foreign owned. Why should the super-destructive Henry mining tax be applied when a small increase in tax on all foreign corporations would ease the very real threat to the only vibrant industry Australia has left-mining?",60

82,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I assume it is to me because in the broad it raises matters associated with employment. I think that was the connection that the member for Kennedy was thinking of. I can understand that the member for Kennedy is concerned about a Budget reaction in the community of Malanda relating to local milk supplies no longer being available for sale, with one of the big supermarket chains coming into town and consequently creating a circumstance where local milk will be transported thousands of kilometres and processed and transported back. I can understand his concern about that. I can also understand his concern about the implications of the resources super profits tax for employment. Whilst I understand the member for Kennedy's concerns are genuinely and personally deeply felt, and we have had the opportunity to discuss his concerns directly, the modelling for the resources super profits tax, and the modelling particularly of the impact on employment, shows that it will expand the resources sector and its output by 5.5 per cent and expand jobs in mining by seven per cent. So, whilst I do appreciate that the member is representing some concerns about marketing changes in his electorate that could be causing community concern, and I do understand he is raising some matters that are on his mind about the resources super profits tax, the modelling does show a growth in employment.

As she knows, last Thursday legislation was passed through this parliament to deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Australian families have been waiting decades for paid parental leave, and the wait is now finally over. It is this government that will deliver paid parental leave to Australian families on 1 January next year. Our scheme is going to be fair to families and fair to business, and will be low-income women in particular who will be the biggest winners. These are the women who are working as cashiers, working as hairdressers or working as food attendants, all of them most unlikely to have had paid parental leave in the past. Many of these women also work in regional areas of Australia, and they will now get paid parental leave for the first time. Our scheme is fair to those working mums in regional areas who are going to get the same level of paid parental leave as the highincome earners in the city. Of course, we know that for 12 years those opposite refused to deliver paid parental leave, and this Leader of the Opposition said that paid parental leave would happen over his dead body. I just have to let the Leader of the Opposition know that it is finally happening, and someone had better call the undertaker! The Leader of the Opposition is now saying that he is in favour of paid parental leave, and he has dreamt up a new scheme. But this scheme that he has recently dreamt up is going to deliver a triple whammy, especially in regional Australia. He is going to deliver a new tax that is going to hurt business in regional Australia, there are going to be higher grocery prices for families in regional Australia and he is also going to deliver an unfair scheme that will see higher income earners in the city get up to $75,000 as a part of his scheme. We have recently discovered that the Nationals were not consulted when the opposition leader decided on this new scheme. This is what the Leader of the National Party, Mr Truss, had to say just last week: We've expressed some reservations about elements of the scheme. We have expressed some concerns about the size of some of the payments. Others, like Nationals senator Fiona Nash, have been even more forthcoming. She has it been out there, sighted in a Win News package that was played all around regional Australia on Friday, welcoming the government's scheme and its benefits for regional Australians and regional families. So we see more and more cracks emerging in this so called coalition. On paid parental leave we see the Nationals walking away from the Leader of the Opposition. They know, just like families know, that this Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted on paid parental leave. It is only this government that can deliver paid parental leave to the families in Australia. Home Insulation Program",61
85,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and goes to the fact that his disastrous Home Insulation Program is now running at around one house fire every day. Prime Minister, now that the toll from this Home Insulation Program has reached no fewer than 174 house fires, when are you finally going to concede that random safety checks simply do not cut it when it comes to safety and agree to inspecting every one of the one million or so Australian homes that have been affected by this program-if so, when; if not, why not?",61
86,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. On the question of the impact of the government's insulation safety program-that is, the inspection program-as the honourable member would be aware, we currently have that program underway for a foil insulation safety program, and that is designed to cover some 50,000 homes. In relation to non-foil insulation we also have a program of inspection, which covers a considerably larger number of homes. The minister responsible for the area continues to keep our inspection regime under review. Should there be any changes to it in the future, the House will be informed. I say to those opposite that, as a consequence of problems which have arisen in the implementation of this program, we are seeking to ensure that safety is maximised in the community, and the minister is attending to this task with full diligence and full application. thank the House. Building the Education Revolution Program",61
87,Mr DEBUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the minister inform the House of progress with the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, threats to its future rollout and threats to other government programs, especially in western New South Wales?",62
88,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. He is someone who stands up for his electorate in this parliament. Particularly, he has stood up for his electorate when it comes to investment in local schools. I am asked about our Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, and I am very pleased to report to the House that already the Rudd government has approved funding for 230 trade training centres, benefiting 732 schools. This is a program that is being rolled out exactly as was promised. Over 10 years, each school is entitled to a grant of between half a million dollars and $1½ million, and schools have chosen to work together to make multimillion dollar facilities. Every time the opposition criticises that, it is criticising the choices made by school principals to get bigger facilities. By the end of this year, approximately 68 trade training centre projects will be complete, benefiting 173 schools. Trade training centres are going to enable kids to get the real skills they need for real jobs. Of course, the opposition is completely opposed to giving kids that kind of chance of getting real skills for real jobs. If the opposition is elected, it will stop approximately 900 schools benefiting from the trade training centre program over the next four years, and 1,800 schools will be prevented from beneI fiting in total. Even worse than that, it will rip money directly out of the hands of around 200 schools which have been promised that money-the Leader of the Opposition is going to come along and rip that money out of the schools' hands. Today I can report to the House that round 3 of the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program closed on 4 June and, when the closing date arrived and the applications came in, there were 73 applications from 214 schools. The funding requested was $242 million; the funding available in this round is $103 million, meaning that it is oversubscribed by $139 million. Under the Rudd government an independent panel will assess these applications, pick the schools to benefit in this round and then schools that have not benefited in this round or earlier rounds will be able to apply over the 10-year program so that every school benefits. But, if the Leader of the Opposition is elected, none of the schools that have put applications forward in this round will ever see one cent-not one of those schools that have laboured hard on their applications will ever see one cent. Of course, the hunt continues for someone in the opposition who will stand up for their electorate and stand up to the Leader of the Opposition about these cutbacks. I ask today: will the member for Calare be someone who stands up for his electorate? He represents 27 schools participating in six trades training centre projects. He wrote to me in December last year asking for more money for training apprentices in schools and he said in relation to some of the successful trades training centre schools: ‘I congratulate those schools for their foresight in applying for and receiving this funding.' Well, I trust the member for Calare will now go back to his constituents and suggest that they have the foresight to select a member of parliament that will stand up for their interests and deliver trades training centres to their local schools.

100,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the most recent budget, the government made a $175 million investment in the important reforms needed in mental health.

Already, funding for is a mental health specific programs will double over the next four years, to $1.1 billion between 2010-11 and 2013-14 from $516.5 million allocated between 2004-05 and 200708. This is on top of the funding for mental health through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, including psychology services subsidised through Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Many in the mental health sector would prefer that patients with mental lems be treated in community settings where that is appropriate. The government's $1.6 billion investment in subacute care beds will help provide more step-up and stepMr Dutton-What about John Mendoza?",63
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dickson has asked his question.,64
102,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's $1.6 billion investment in subacute care beds will help provide more step-up and step-down subacute services for people with mental health needs, easing their transition from acute care to the community. Furthermore, this means that patients can be given more appropriate and timely care out of a hospital, helping them to get the treatment that they need more quickly. As part of the establishment of the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Australian government will also undertake structural reforms so we can improve mental health services in the future. The government will take full funding and policy responsibility for primary health care, including mental health services for common disorders such as anxiety and depression, including those currently provided by the states and territories. The government will also establish Medicare locals in communities across the country who will be a platform for providing better coordination of primary healthcare services and help address gaps in services, including for Australians suffering from mental illnesses. Furthermore, the government also agreed with the states and territories that it will consider changes to roles and responsibilities for specialist community mental health services which the Council of Australian Governments is considering in 2011. These are important first steps, and the government is acting to put the foundations in place so that it can improve mental health health prob- services into the future. On the question of the overall investments that we have undertaken within mental health in the most recent budget, let me further inform the House that $78.8 million will be spent over four years to deliver up to, as I said before, 30 new headspace sites around Australia, providing extra funding for these sites and expanding telephone and web based support services for young people.

This is actually quite a large investment. Furthermore, I say to those opposite who are interjecting that the service provided by Headspace did not exist prior to the election of this government.

I am now indicating to people that my tolerance level is at absolute zero. The Prime Minister has the call. He will bring the answer to this question to a conclusion so that we can move on.",65
119,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I was asked about mental health services and I am outlining in detail the additional investment made in the most recent budget-an investment of $175 million. Secondly, I was indicating the additional investment we provided to the Headspace services, which provide additional support for 20,000 young Australians each year. I would have thought, given the nature of the question, that that may have been of interest to the House. Furthermore, we are providing $58.5 million over four years to be directed to deliver care packages to better support up to 25,000 people with severe mental illnesses through the access to allied psychological services arrangements. Thirdly, we are investing $25.5 million over four years to expand the Early Psychosis Prevention Intervention addiCentre-otherwise called EPPIC-model, building on its successful implementation in the state of Victoria. Fourthly, there is $13 million over two years to employ an additional 136 mental health nurses to provide an estimated 11,700 additional services. As I said, that reflects the government's additional investments in this area so far. I also draw the House's attention to the additional investments we are making overall in the training of medical students in the ture and to their training places within the hospitals. The government's plan is to increase the overall number of GP training places by 5½ thousand over the decade ahead and to increase the overall number of training places in a given year-doubling it, I think, to about 1,300 a year, starting a year or two into the future. Additional medical staff around the country will assist in the wider provision of general health services, including necessary referrals for specialist mental health services as well. We regard this as an important area of priority in the overall health reform agenda. We have, with the states and territories, engaged in a substantive negotiation on the reform of the health and hospital system. We have produced a reform for the National Health and Hospitals Network. In that system, for the first time, the Australian government will become the dominant funder of the public hospital system of Australia and the dominant funder of the recurrent costs of that sysplan tem as well. That system also provides a range of services for those suffering from a range of mental health conditions. On top of that we have fully recognisedand I have said this in previous debates-that when it comes to further priorities for reform we have to place more emphasis on outstanding areas of demand in mental health on the one hand, and aged care on the other. Those constitute the collective priorities of the government. We have made a good start with the National Health and Hospitals Network. We have made some start in relation to the priorities for mental health. We intend to address these priorities together with those aged care in the rolling implementation of our reform program. Better health and better hospitals for the entire Australian community are fundamental priorities for this government. We intend to get on with the business fu- and I simply make this point to the House: our additional investments in this sector account for some $7½ billion over the three years to come in contrast to the $1 billion which was ripped out of the system by the Leader of the Opposition when he was minister for health prior to the last election. Water",65
120,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. What action is the government taking to help rural and regional communities make the transition to a future with less water? Are there any impediments to this transition?",66
121,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin for the question. As a South Australian, he would have been alarmed to read in the Advertiser on the weekend the comments of the coalition spokesperson on water, suggesting that the solution for South Australians with what has happened with water was for them to move north. The government's is to help people with the difficult transition. We have the Water for the Future plan within the Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure program and the water purchases under the Restoring the Balance program-which have all been water purchases from willing sellers. Let us not pass over the threat that we have in the Basin. Water going into the Murray over the last 10 years was at half the long-term average and over the last three years it was at one-fifth of the long term average. I am asked about impediments. I have to say-and this will probably not help me get another question here-that the Leader of the in House has been saying something which I believe is untrue. He has been saying that those opposite say one thing here and another thing when they are away. Going through the transcripts on water, I have discovered that they say at least two things here and make hundreds of contradictory statements when they are away from here. In what was a carefully scripted, ‘gospel truth' statement from the Leader of the Opposition on 14 January-all written out for the Sydney Institute-he said that, if not given federal control by 2012, a coalition government ‘will put the appropriate constitutional change to the people at a referendum'. That was put forward as coalition policy. The other part of that coalition policy is meant to be a group of nine people in this room, those known as the National Party. The Leader of the Nationals on 18 June on Sky News said ‘The Nationals have never been keen on the idea of a referendum.' For the Nationals these issues came to a head in National Party heartland on the weekend when they held their conference in Canberra. Here in Canberra, in the lead-up to the conference, the member for Mayo-not usually an object of sympathy but for whom, on this one, I have some sympathy-held the line and committed to the importance of a referendum, just as his Liberal colleague Senator Birmingham started to describe the referendum as ‘only being a last resort'. But, as the National Party rolled the coalition's view here in Canberra on the weekend, Senator Joyce-who is meant to be the coalition spokesperson on water, presenting the position of the coalition on water-said: My view on a referendum is that it is the proposition before the coming of Christ. Keeping with the ‘gospel truth' theme, Senator Joyce really said: My view on a referendum is that it is the last proposition before the coming of Christ. On water, those opposite have held every possible position, but let us not forget where this began. It began in a carefully scripted statement-the one we are told we are meant to be able to able to believe-which was presented not as a Liberal Party position but as a coalition position. For some reason, those opposite are willing to let nine people in this room dictate to the rest of their party everything when it comes to what happens outside the states have the major cities.

122,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Professor John Mendoza's resignation, citing the Prime Minister's tendency to take credit for the previous government's work in mental health. I also refer the Prime Minister to his previous answer where he again tried to take credit-this time for the operation and establishment of headspace, the National Youth Mental Health Foundation. Can the Prime Minister now explain why in his opinion Professor Mendoza has resigned from the National Advisory Council on Mental Health?",67
123,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question on mental health. I say in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question on mental health that, when it comes to the Headspace program, as I indicated in my earlier remarks, this government has expanded services in this sectorand I made that quite clear in my additional remarks in my earlier answer. The reason that we have expanded those services is that, together with the Minister for Health and Ageing, I visited one of those services which last was operating in Sunshine in Melbourne",67
124,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,67
125,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question is, I think, highly relevant to the usefulness of these services and why we as a government took the decision to expand them by some 20 or 30 sites across the country.

It is designed specifically be done in a non-threatening environment. It is specifically designed to be a welcoming environmentMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, my point of order is on relevance.

He should explain why Professor Mendoza has resigned.",67
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question. He was referred to comments that he had made in the previous answer about the program and he was asked for an opinion in the last part. The Prime Minister has the call.,68
127,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would say in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question again that on this specific program, the Headspace program, one of the things which he himself might reflect upon is why when health minister he did not, I am advised, provide continuing future funding for the program which was previously established. That is one question which we are interested to hear the answer to. This government in fact chose to continue that funding and, furthermore, we chose to expand those services. We chose to expand those services because of the key value which they provide to young people in the community. When I visited the one at Sunshine, I saw the number of young people accessing it because it was friendly, open and nonthreatening, enabling young people to go there, outside of a school environment, where they may be concerned about presenting particular mental health problems to school counsellors et cetera. That was why it was judged by many professionals in the field to be so successful-which was why we have backed its expansion. The Leader of the Opposition asked more to broadly a question about the government's priorities when it comes to health and the debate which surrounds that. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, on the question of mental health, we as a government intend to continue our investments in this area because it is an area of continuing and outstanding concern for the whole community. It does not matter where you go in Australia, mental health concerns are real. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The Prime Minister has now been talking for nearly three minutes. Why has he airbrushed Professor Mendoza out of his answer?",68

We welcome debate from those who agree with the government's reforms and those who disagree with the government's reforms. We do that more broadly in the health and hospitals debate of the nation. On the health and hospitals debate of the nation, it is passing strange that the gentleman asking the question-the Leader of the Opposition, who engages in this debate-was the person who gouged a billion dollars out of the public hospital system of Australia when he was the health minister.

We know that we have a lot more still to do when it comes to reform in mental health and a lot more to do when it comes to the whole need for reform in aged care as well, as I have said repeatedly in recent debates. But do you know something? We are getting on with the job of this, and that is what the National Health and Hospitals Network is all about-$7½ billion worth of additional funding flowing from 1 July, compared with $1 billion gouged out of the system when the Leader of the Opposition was last responsible for the health portfolio.

133,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister update the House on the implementation of the government's election commitment to deliver more elective surgery to patients? Are there any impediments to this performance, particularly in North Queensland?",69
134,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question, because I know that as a Queenslander he is particularly interested in the outcomes of our early investments in elective surgery and what they have delivered across the country. It is not surprising to me that those opposite, particularly the member for Dickson, have not asked this question, because the previous government's record on investing in elective surgery was the grand total of zero dollars. Never in their entire time in government did they invest a single dollar in elective surgery, despite the large numbers of people waiting for surgery. I have released today the latest report of the Elective Surgery Waiting List Reduction Plan. It shows that since our election an extra 76,774 elective surgery procedures have been performed across this country. That is over 70,000 working families, mums and dads, grandparents and others who are having their hip replacements done, who are not waiting as long for their ear, nose and throat surgery and who are having cataract surgery done, all because this government was prepared to invest in elective surgerysomething that the previous government never did. If we compare, in fact, the first nine months of 2009 with the same period in 2007, when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, 35,000 extra patients received elective surgery because of the blitz money that came online immediately when we were elected to government. What we see now is that the percentage of patients being treated within clinically recommended times has risen from 79 per cent under the Liberal Party to 86.3 per cent now. Of course, we know that there is much more to be done. That is why we have introduced, as part of our national health and hospitals reform plan, a commitment to lifting that over time to a 95 per cent target and making sure that if people are not seen within the clinically recommended time then they are able, under an elective surgery guarantee, to have that procedure undertaken somewhere else. I was asked specifically about the issues in Queensland and whether there are any impediments to this good news. Of course, the largest impediment to the ongoing benefits flowing from the national health and hospitals reform investments is the Leader of the Opposition. His record is one of pulling a billion dollars out of hospitals, and now the investments in Queensland will be at risk if the Leader of the Opposition is elected as Prime Minister. I am sure that the member for Capricornia would be concerned about the $76 million being invested in Rockhampton Hospital. I am sure that the member for Brisbane would be concerned about the more than $100 million being invested in a new oral health centre in Brisbane.

139,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, it is a major mistake to confuse the member for Herbert with the member for Leichhardt. One who has not been protecting the interests of his community-the member for Herbert-and one who has been arguing for investments in health which have been committed and are starting to deliver in Cairns. In fact, the port that was released today makes clear that the additional surgeries undertaken in Queensland were only possible because our investments allowed seven major hospitals, including Cairns hospital in the member for Leichhardt's seat, to expand capacity. Ipswich, Mackay, Nambour, Princess Alexandra, Royal Brisbane, Women's, Toowoomba and Townsville-all of these hospitals are expanding. We have not heard a single thing from those opposite, even from the Queensland members who stand to benefit from these investments, on how they will make sure that they are protected from the knife that Mr Abbott always wields when he gets to be in charge of health expenditure. One billion dollars ripped out of our hospitals and now we have these investments at risk. He has already promised in the budget reply that more than $800 million will be ripped out. The member is in such intense discussion now, because he does not like looking at me when I talk from the dispatch box for some reason, and will not even commit to extra investments in primary care. The member for Dickson has promised to rip nearly half a billion dollars out of diabetes initiatives. We just ask, simply: what is next? What expenditure in health is free from the razor gang that are in cahoots over there because they do not like listening to these success stories when 76,000 extra people have been assisted by our investments and many, many thousands stand to benefit in the future, so long as Tony Abbott does not wield the knife that he wielded when he was the health minister.

147,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Bruce-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel) (3.48 pm)-I acknowledge the presence in the House today of many of the family, friends and loved ones of those lost on the Montevideo Maru, some of whom have travelled great distances to be here today. I also acknowledge that this tragedy has touched so many Australians, including members of parliament both past and present. Former patron of the Rabaul and Montevideo Maru Society, the honourable Kim Beazley AO, lost his uncle on board that ship. My colleague the honourable Peter Garrett's grandfather was also lost when the ship sank. Minister Garrett is the current patron of the Rabaul and Montevideo Maru Society. I am sorry Minister Garrett is unable to be here today as he is attending the International Whaling Commission in Morocco. I address this statement to the families and to the House. On behalf of the Australian government and the Australian parliament, I would like to express our sincere regret and sorrow for the tragedy that occurred with the of the Montevideo Maru on 1 July 1942. The opening months of 1942 were a dark time in Australia's wartime history. Singapore and Java had fallen, our defensive outposts in Rabaul, Timor and Ambon had been lost, and the Japanese had already begun a series of bombing attacks on Australia beginning with Darwin on 19 February 1942. Success in the battle of the Coral Sea provided a check to Japanese plans but even so, to in May 1942, the war was brought home to Australians on the east coast when the Japanese attacked Sydney Harbour from the sea. And we were not to know that in a matter of weeks our nation was to suffer its most terrible maritime disaster-when, in a matter of moments, more Australians would be killed than would be lost in all the nation's wars and conflicts since the end of the Second World War. But let me step back in history a little bit first. The fall of New Britain in January 1942 was one of many disastrous battles involving Australians in the first months of the Pacific war. Lark Force, as the Australian defenders of the island were known, was hopelessly outnumbered, poorly equipped and had no plan of withdrawal. The chiefs of staff recognised that the force had no chance of repelling an invasion but felt, nonetheless, that the Japanese should be made to fight for the island and the deepwater harbour at Rabaul. The defenders put up a brave fight but the outcome was never in doubt. Of some 1,500 troops, 30 were killed in the fighting and about 400 escaped the island. Another 160 were killed in the Tol plantation-one of a series of massacres of prisoners committed by the Japanese in the opening months of the war. The survivors became prisoners of war. Several hundred civilians who had been living and working on the island were also interned. Little was heard of, or from, either group again. There was one occasion, however, in April 1942, when prisoners were given a chance to write to their families. The letters were dropped in mailbags over Port Moresby and about 400 were delivered. For many who received these letters it was their last contact. On 22 June 1942 just over 1,000 men, military prisoners and civilians, were marched from their camps to Rabaul's harbour. On other days they had walked the same route to work on the docks, but this time they carried whatever kit they possessed and were flanked by guards with machine guns. Chinese and New Guinean dockside labourers saw them board a ship, the 10,000ton Montevideo Maru. They were among the last to see her human cargo alive. Lieutenant Commander Wright, captain of the American submarine, US Sturgeon, wrote in his log that early on the morning of 1 July 1942 his submarine chased a large ship as it sped from the Philippines westwards into the South China Sea. He guessed that it was heading for Hainan and for some time doubted whether he could catch it. But by 2.30 in the morning the submarine had drawn close enough to fire its torpedoes. Four were fired from 4,000 yards, two hit, and the tragic fate of the Montevideo Maru was sealed-the ship sank within 10 minutes. Only three lifeboats were lowered, all capsized and one was badly damaged. After the sinking there were few survivors in the water and the Japanese crewmen and naval guards who had made it onto the lifeboats headed for the Philippines coast. According to Japanese accounts, the captain and more than 10 of his crew reached land where most of them, including the captain, were killed by Filipino guerrillas. Five survivors set out on foot for Manila, two died en route, the rest took 10 days to reach the city. They reported the sinking and a search was immediately ordered, but too much time had elapsed and no trace of either the Montevideo Maru or survivors was found. For the families of the men who had been on the ship, there was never any news during the war but Japanese authorities had known of the loss since shortly after the sinking. The ship's owners were informed three weeks after it happened, and in January the following year the Japanese Navy Department forwarded details of the sinking to the Japanese Prisoner of War Information Bureau, together with a nominal roll of the prisoners and civilians on board. During the war, the International Committee of the Red Cross made several inquiries concerning the men who had been captured on Rabaul but received no answer. In 1944 the Japanese Foreign Office sought information on the missing civilians from Rabaul, but no response was forthcoming and the Swiss legation made at least seven unsuccessful attempts to get the same information. Like many who waited in Australia for news of the men who had been lost as the Japanese advanced through Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific in 1942, the families and friends of the soldiers and civilians who had been captured on New Britain, had spent three-and-a-half years wondering and hoping. Mrs Rhoda Coote was one of those wondering and hoping and writing letters to try and find out what was happening to her husband. Evacuated to Australian with her daughter just before Christmas 1941, Mrs Coote only expected to be separated from her husband for a few months. In 1942 G. F. Haughan, from the Red Cross in Port Moresby, wrote a letter in response to Mrs Coote: I am unable to give you any news of any great importance but would like to point out that the news you mention regarding your husband is not, I'm sure, correct. Please do not I have made a careful check on all the records held here and the only news I can give you is that just after the Japanese invasion your husband was seen at Gillalum Plantation in the company of Ernest Banks, Bill Yarrington, Tom Walker, Ted Allan, Tom Herkut, C. Clunn, P. Ryan, H. Fulton and Dick Moore. I shall keep a close check for you; as a resident New Guinea for some years I know a number of those persons who are missing and I will forward any news that comes my way. I can only ask you to look on the bright side and hope all will turn out for a happy reunion for your husband. This letter was dated 18 November 1942five months after Philip Coote had perished on the Montevideo Maru. It was three more years before Mrs Coote would find out that there would never be a reunion with her husband, Philip. It was a difficult time for the families waiting and hoping, especially for those like the Cootes who had been evacuated to Australia. They left behind their husbands, sons, brothers; they left behind their homes and their community-they faced some very long, lonely years. I know some of you are here today, including Philip Coote's son, daughter and three of his granddaughters; along with some of the families of those men mentioned in the letter-Walker, Ryan and Fulton-and I acknowledge your strength and fortitude. By the end of September 1945, lists of men recovered from Japanese prison camps were being published every day, but more than 5,000 Australians remained unaccounted for, including those from Rabaul. I think it is important to note here that over the years there have been suggestions that the Montevideo Maru either never existed, or that the Japanese actually massacred the prisoners and used the Montevideo Maru's sinking as the explanation for their let that worry you. disappearance. Such speculation is understandable when the loss of a ship and almost all on board is at question and the evidence lies mostly at the bottom of the sea. But the existence of the ship is beyond doubt as the Australian War Memorial holds photographs of it in its collection and the material that is available of indicates that the Montevideo Maru was indeed sunk and that more than one thousand prisoners died when this happened. Stories suggesting the loss of a Japanese prison ship carrying many of the missing men from Rabaul first appeared in Australian newspapers on 26 and 27 September 1945, and on 28 September an Australian officer fluent in Japanese, Major HS Williams of the 1st Australian POW Enquiry Unit, was searching through records in Tokyo's Prisoner of War Information Bureau when he found a list of 1,056 names. Many were of servicemen identified by name and serial number; the rest were civilians. Their place of capture was given as Rabaul and many appeared to be Australians-but the names having been translated from English into Japanese script and then back again created considerable difficulties. The Director of the Japanese Prisoner of War Information Bureau admitted that full details of what had happened to the men from Rabaul had been in Japanese possession since the beginning of 1943 and he expressed regret that no details had been transmitted to Australia. The translated roll reached Canberra in late October 1945telegrams were sent to families across the country confirming what they had feared: few of the men taken prisoner or interned on Rabaul in 1942 had survived the year. From these records-although not all the names were on them-it was clear that they were made up of members of the 2/22nd Battalion, 1st Independent Company, Fortress Artillery, Signals units, 17 Anti-tank Anti Aircraft Artillery, 19 Special Dental Unit, detachments from New Guinea Volunteer Rifles, 2/10 Field Ambulance, Ordnance Corps units, 8th Division Supply Column, Canteen Services Headquarters New Guinea Area, Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Australian Navy and Australian civilians. To date the original Japanese nominal roll has not been recovered, but the Department of Defence is still undertaking a search. In common with all those who died in our name in the world wars, each of those lost on the Montevideo Maru is officially commemorated by name on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The service personnel are commemorated on the memorial to the missing at the Rabaul (Bita Paka) War Cemetery, and the civilian dead are commemorated on the roll of honour located in Westminster Abbey. Collectively, the service and sacrifice of those who were lost is commemorated on the Montevideo Maru memorial that is colocated with the official memorial to those lost at Rabaul on the waterfront of Simpson Harbour, at the national POW memorial at Ballarat, and more recently plaques have been placed at the Hellships memorial at Subic Bay in the Philippines. These commemorations provide a physical base of remembrance that complements the tireless efforts of the loved ones left behind to keep this terrible tragedy at the forefront of our minds, and in doing so to keep the promise that ‘we will remember them'. Quite rightly, the story of the Montevideo Maru will not end here. I expect historians in Australia and across the world will continue in their search for the missing pieces of the puzzle including the lost records. And I know fundraising efforts are also underway to erect a memorial here in Canberra at the Battery, Australian War Memorial. As we stand here today, I would like to formally mark the great loss of the Montevideo Maru and honour those who died. Australia is forever grateful for their service in defence of our nation during the Second World War. I would especially like to acknowledge the great emotional suffering of the families and friends they left behind. These people endured many long and painful years waiting for news of their loved ones and they deserve to be remembered. The fortitude needed to survive the three years it took for the tragic news of the death of their loved ones to reach them is exemplary. And I extend to them my wholehearted condolences. Their experience is an integral part of our wartime history. I acknowledge their grief has extended beyond the years of uncertainty. Not having a marked grave to signify their loved one's life has weighed on many families-even to the present day. The Australian government will continue to work with them, the Rabaul and Montevideo Maru Society and others interested in this tragedy to ensure the Montevideo Maru remains a part of our living history. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Greenway to speak for 17 minutes. Leave granted.",71

149,Mrs MARKUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Greenway) (4.05 pm)Wives, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, those who survived the events of 1942, loved ones and friends of the Montevideo Maru: in this place on Monday, 21 June 2010, the Australian parliament is formally recognising remembering and commemorating the loss of lives during the fall of Rabaul, the Battle of Kavieng, the Tol Massacre and the sinking of the Montevideo Maru by torpedo in the early hours of 1 July 1942. It is a time for us to honour the service of those who were lost, killed or are missing from the Montevideo Maru and from activities on and around the mandated islands of New Guinea-from New Britain, New Ireland, New Hanover and the surrounding islands. It is my privilege and honour to speak on behalf of the federal coalition in response to the ministerial statement of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence Personnel on the Montevideo Maru. Today is an important day, tinged with sadness for survivors and families of the lost. Equally, it is a day for Australia to remember and commemorate those who gave their lives and who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Sixtyeight years is a long time to wait for such a moment. I would like to acknowledge the attendance today of the Rabaul and Montevideo Maru Society and the representatives and members of the Montevideo Maru Foundation. Specifically, I would like to acknowledge the presence of veterans of the campaign in the mandated territories and survivors of Japanese prisoner of war camps. I also wish to welcome the wives, sons, daughters and other family members of those who we honour today. Many have travelled long distances to be in Canberra today for this historic moment. Many people have played a role in bringing this to pass. They for a are too numerous to name. However, to the Rabaul and Montevideo Maru Society and the Montevideo Maru Foundation, led by Keith Jackson AM and Cynthia Schmidt respectively: I place on record the appreciation of all those involved with bringing about this occasion today. The events which led to the death of 1,053 men on the Montevideo Maru on 1 July 1942 are important moments in Australia's military and national history. The 1919 League of Nations mandate over the New Guinea territories permitted Australia to administer the former German territories but not to militarise them. Australia strictly abided by the terms of the mandate. The island of New Britain was never significantly fortified by the Australians. In 1939, with the threat of war in the Pacific looming, the Australian government established a token militia. The voluntary New Guinea Volunteer Rifles were the core of military defence in the territory. They consisted of fewer than 300 men. Responding to the growing threat to Rabaul and Australia's broader strategic interests in the 1930s and 1940s, in February 1941 the Australian government assembled the Lark Force and dispatched it to Rabaul. The Lark Force consisted of a group based on the 2/22nd Battalion, raised in Victoria part of the 23rd Brigade, 8th Division, 2nd Australian Imperial Force. These 1,400 troops were never in a position to properly defend Rabaul or even repel an attack. Days after the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the Australian war cabinet authorised the compulsory evacuation of women and children from Papua and New Guinea to Australia. Males over 16 were to remain in Rabaul with their fathers. Six brave government nurses were offered evacuation but volunteered to stay. The Australian Army Nursing Service nurses stayed, as it was deemed their duty to stay with the men. In total, almost 1,800 women and children were evacuated by 29 December 1941. Christmas 1941 was, for many, the last time they would see husbands, brothers and sons alive. By 19 January 1942, a few weeks before the fall of Singapore, the Australian war cabinet decided to evacuate non-civilian personnel. Sadly, this came too late. Four days later, the Japanese landed at Rabaul. Rabaul fell on 23 January 1942. Hundreds of Australian servicemen and locals were interned in local POW camps. Four hundred and fifty men were reported to have escaped through the New Britain jungle, although few of them survived. No provision had been made by Lark Force commanders for guerilla warfare or for escape through the jungle. No supply depots in the thick jungle of New Britain had been constructed. During the course of World War II, my father-in-law, Masa Markus, a national of Papua New Guinea-and, if you do not mind, I would like to mention him todayserved in what came to be known as the Pacific Islands Regiment. As a New Guinean, he was interned by the Japanese in a prisoner of war camp at Malaguna, only three miles from Rabaul. He escaped and, fortunately, as was picked up by a US ship while swimming in the ocean. On 4 February 1942, a massacre at plantations at Tol and Waitavalo saw 160 men shot or bayoneted. On 22 June 1942, an estimated 845 prisoners of war from Lark Force and 208 interned civilian men were marched from their camp in Rabaul to be sent via ship to another camp in Hainan, in China. Ordered into the Montevideo Maru, these men were marching to their deaths. Japan's occupation of Rabaul provided them with a key base to launch attacks against Australia and the United States. Bombing raids over Townsville and Cairns were made easier by Japan's Rabaul base. At the end of the war, 100,000 Japanese soldiers and auxiliary staff were stationed at Rabaul. The stories of those who were lost on the Montevideo Maru are truly moving. There is indeed an overwhelming sense of loss for those who remain who are searching for the truth, endeavouring to understand what happened on 1 July 1942. Just who was aboard the Montevideo Maru when she sank? Who escaped the Japanese advance, only to perish in the jungle of New Britain? There are still questions left unanswered. I am aware of five survivors of that terrible time in early 1941 who are here today with us: Stan Cooper, Lionel Veale, Norm Furness, David Harper and Fred Kollmorgen. Your stories are ones of sheer bravery, courage under fire and mateship. They are values that we honour as those of the ANZACs. Your spirit and endurance place you also in their league. While every story is significant, in the time available it is not possible to cover every one of the recollections of those who were there. One story about Fred Kollmorgen particularly caught my attention. The story given to me goes like this: Fred was the sole survivor of the Salvation Army Band. He escaped down the south coast of New Britain. Fred is a survivor of the 2/22nd Band. This was a military band largely composed of bandsmen from the Brunswick Salvation Army but also included members from Springvale, Moreland and Hawthorn. They were led by Bandmaster Arthur Gullidge, who was the Bandmaster at Brunswick and to this day is recognised internationally for his brilliance as composer and musician. Some of the bandsmen were on the Montevideo Maru and some were murdered in the Tol Massacre. Fred escaped by walking 700 miles, canoeing 60 miles, wading 25 miles and boating 80 miles along the south coast of New Britain. That in itself is no easy feat. Together with my husband, who grew up in Rabaul, and our children, I have walked through the jungle of New Britain. It is tough going. It goes on: It was an epic journey, punctuated by aggressive aerial surveillance by the Japanese, severe malaria, malnutrition, crocodiles, little clothing, the crossing of fierce streams and a treacherous jungle. There are wives and children here today. The impact of these tragedies on families is important to acknowledge. Barbara Selby is the wife of survivor the late David Selby, who, I am told, was one of the first troops to be in action on Australian territory in the Second World War. David's brother, Benn, is also here today, as are David and Barbara's three children, Alison, Elizabeth and Bill. I am told that, after the ‘every man for himself' order went out as Rabaul fell, David ensured that his guns were destroyed so that they would not fall into enemy hands. He and his mates then fled through the jungle of New Britain. Sadly, some did not make it through. After six weeks they were found and repatriated to Australia. After the war, David Selby QC had a distinguished legal career, including time in Papua New Guinea as an acting judge of the Supreme Court. He served as Deputy Chancellor of the University of Sydney for 15 years. David's story is another one of great endurance. Mary May and her daughter Dr Marian May are also here with us. Mary's husband, Reverend John May OBE, was chaplain to Lark Force in Rabaul. John was a POW sent to Japan on the Naruto Maru before he was released in August 1945. Returning to Australia after working in Japan after the war, John May became the chaplain at the Royal Military College at Duntroon here in Canberra. Sadly, John died earlier this year. Marian has recorded: Before his stroke in January, John was making a big extra effort to walk every day so that, should such an event take place, he would be in a fit state to attend! He'd even bought a new pair of shoes in readiness! Marian, on behalf of the House today, we extend our condolences and sorrow that John is not here. Nancy Ward is here today from Ocean Grove in Victoria. Nancy's father is presumed to have been lost on the Montevideo Maru. She, like many other sons and daughters of those lost, has waited a long time for some form of recognition of the circumstances which led to the loss of their parents. A person who hoped to be here today is George Hill from Western Australia. Sadly, he is too unwell to come to Canberra. His father was lost on the Montevideo Maru. George was just nine when he lost his dad. His mother was left to raise six children in Mildura in northern Victoria. George's brother, Frank, wrote a book about the Montevideo Maru which was donated to the RSL in Mildura. George says the book was never finished; Frank did not know how to write the final chapter. In South Gippsland in the member for MCMillan's electorate is the small town of Leongatha. In 1941, 16 young men left Leongatha to fight in the Lark Force, and only three came home. Their story has been documented by local historian Lyn Skillern, who writes: One of the saddest stories I have uncovered is that of the 16 local men from the Leongatha and District who went to Rabaul with Lark Force. Of the sixteen, six were on the Montevideo Maru, six were massacred at Gasmata, three returned home to South Gippsland and Bill Owen was killed in action later in the war after escaping from Rabaul. Lyn recalls the names of the soldiers presumed lost on the Montevideo Maru: Jack Howard, Fred Broadbent, Fred Ketels, Jimmy Kavanagh, Arthur Oliver and Tom Sangster. About Fred Ketels, Lyn writes: Fred was born in Foster [in South Gippsland] in 1913, grew up in Leongatha and attended Leongatha State School. His mother waited for him for the rest of her life. His brother Cliff was killed New Guinea with the 2/5th Battalion. She used to travel to Melbourne often with Mrs Howard and Mrs Broadbent to visit the Battalion Headquarters. They found support there with the mothers and wives of the 2/22nd Battalion men. There are stories of other families: The Bellington brothers, Bill and Tom, who were executed at Gasmata. They were from Nerrena East, near Leongatha. Bill was born in Nerrena in 1907 and Tom there in 1908. They lived on the family farm. The boys had spent much of their time since leaving school unemployed. Joining the army probably seemed a good idea. Their father Harry wanted someone to tell him what happened to his boys and no one ever did. It was too much for him and he took his own life. I have had the privilege and honour of visiting Bita Paka War Cemetery, observing the tropical jungle. Today it hides the secrets of that time, that dark hour in Australia's and Papua New Guinea's history. The remnants of Japanese occupation remain in Rabaul today. Jungle tunnels contain submarines fitted on rails, ready for deployment into the ocean. Maintenance facilities and concrete bunkers are still in place, now covered by overgrown jungle. Unexploded ordnance remains. Later this year, the 70th anniversary of the formation of Lark Force will be commemorated in Benalla in regional Victoria. I understand the state member for Benalla, Bill Sykes MLA, has coordinated an event in response to community support for such a commemoration. It is a shame that more Lark Force veterans are not alive today to receive their due recognition for service rendered to Australia. I want to close today with another quote, this time from Wing Commander Lerew. At the time of the Japanese landing, 24 Squadron had a small number of Wirraways on New Britain. As the Japanese arrived, Lerew signalled RAAF HQ in Melbourne with the in Latin phrase ‘nos morituri te salutamus'-or the English translation: ‘We who are about to die salute you'. Today it is we who are living today in freedom who salute the men and women of that time in New Guinea in 1942. Lest we forget.",75

151,Mr KATTER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I wish to acknowledge, on behalf of my colleague the member for New England, Helen Seizan and Ian Adams, representing the Armidale families who lost their grandfathers on the Montevideo Maru. Lex Fraser, in my electorate, was one of the commandos that were fighting in and around Rabaul and his entire command perished on the Montevideo Maru. Lex has carried almost to the point of obsession the loss of all of his men. He was not there; he was on another ship, being taken as a prisoner to Japan. He has fought hard for their widows. All of his life he has fought hard for recognition of the men that died. So I would like to comment on that today. In concluding my few words, I note half a dozen members of my immediate family were fighting in the islands during the Second World War. One of them ended up in Changi prison. He came home but died soon afterwards-and I acknowledge all the mothers, particularly those from that period. His uncle was at Gallipoli. Seven years after his death at Gallipoli there was a letterthere is a number of letters on the file, in- occasion? cluding this one-from what was obviously his girlfriend. She was still writing in the hope that he was still alive. She said she had heard rumours that he was still alive. How many hearts were broken as such people died. Mark Dale is here today. I think his family should get special respect: three brothers were killed on the Montevideo Maru and their poor mother also lost a husband later in the war. The entire male side of the family was wiped out. I think this incident is the worse incident in warfare, including battles, that Australia ever suffered. It is very good, Minister, that we acknowledge today each of these men that died for us. Although we lost most of the battles up there, they were lost in such a way that we were able to defeat the Japanese and throw them back and defend our country from invasion. That was the very real contribution made by these people in the great losses that they suffered. (Time expired) NA National Capital and External Territories Committee Report",78

TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 GST ADMINISTRATION MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.",79
157,Ms LEY,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 3) Bill 2010. This bill was introduced into this place on 26 May 2010 and it implements some of the 46 recommendations made by the Board of Taxation from its review of the legal framework for the administration of the goods and services tax. Legislation implementing some other recommendations from the Board of Taxation's review included the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 GST Administration Measures No.1) Bill 2010 and the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 GST Administration Measures No.2) Bill 2010, which passed through the House earlier this year. As I did with those earlier I would like to say at the outset that the coalition will be supporting the passage of this bill through the House and the other place. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to ensure the supply of goods transport services in Australia GST free if that supply is made as part of the international transport of goods to a nonresident that is not in Australia. Schedule 1 also changes the liability for paying GST on the transport of goods within Australia, where that transport is part of the international transport of imported goods from the transport service provider to the importer of the goods. The amendment will mean that importers will add the cost of domestic transport into the ‘value of taxable importation' used to calculate GST liability on importation and remove the GST liability on the supply of domestic transport services made to a nonresident. This will ease compliance costs for domestic transporters and nonresidents. The amendments in schedule 1 were announced by the then Assistant Treasurer in the 2009-10 budget on 12 May 2009. Schedule 1 has a revenue cost of $2 million a year. Schedule 2 of this bill amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to ensure that global roaming telecommunication services remain GST free. Schedule 2 was initially announced by the former coalition government. The then Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Dutton MP, announced, on 21 December 2006, that the government would clarify the law to maintain the intention that supplies of global roaming telecommunication services would remain GST free. There was a requirement for clarification in this area of GST law because a tax ruling by the Australian Taxation Office cast doubt on the treatment of such supplies. These supplies were always inbills, tended to be GST free in accordance with Australia's obligations under the Melbourne agreement on international telecommunication regulations. The former coalition government began consultation with the telecommunications industry to ensure that the amendments were properly targeted. As the amendments reflect the original intention and operation of the law in this area, the amendments will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2000. Schedule 3 of this bill amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to allow entities to make appropriate adjustments where the entities are members of the same GST group, GST religious group or GST joint venture. These amendments are in addition to the amendments made in a previous bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 1) Bill 2010, which was passed with the support of the coalition earlier this year. As I said at the outset, the coalition supports the measures in this bill. I commend the bill to the House.",80

Amendments to tax laws are made by schedule, and the first schedule deals with GST and cross-border transport supplies. It has been suggested by the industry that this change is necessary and it is important reform to allow certainty and clarification with respect to the transportation of goods from export as well as import. The second schedule deals with GST relief for telecommunications supplied for global roaming in Australia. That has been on the cards for some time, as the member for Farrer said. It deals with the Melbourne agreement, which was an important reform. The third schedule deals with GST amendments to the third-party payments adjustment provisions. Again, that is an amendment as a result of consequences which were unintended by previous legislation. The first schedule, as I said, deals with GST and cross-border transport supplies. It is important that nonresidents are not drawn into the Australian GST system, and it is important that jurisdiction with respect to the collection of tax is clarified and made certain. You do not want companies or individuals caught up in our system when they should not be. Parts of the transport industry have expressed concern in relation to this. They have expressed concern about compliance costs, and they have expressed concern about difficulties in complying with the GST law. The first schedule amends the GST act to ensure that the transportation of goods by subcontractors within Australia that forms part of the international transport of those goods by another entity from or to Australia is taxable unless the transport supply is made to a nonresident that is not in Australia. Those amendments operate from 1 July this year. The changes, as I have said, have been sought by the industry. It is consistent with what the government has said previously, and it is about reducing tax compliance and ensuring a regulatory system in which small businesses and medium businesses have the best opportunity and climate to operate free of regulation. At the same time, it improves the integrity of our GST system. The second schedule deals with GST relief for telecommunications supplied for global roaming in Australia. The Melbourne agreement, particularly the provision known as article 6.1.3, provides that the tax levied in accordance with the national law of a country on collection charges for international telecommunications services can only be collected in respect of international services billed to customers in that country. It was always thought, as the member for Farrer said, that international telecommunications supplies were not considered to be taxable under our GST law. I always take the view that inherently rulings by the Commissioner the of Taxation are a good thing-they prevent litigation, reduce administrative costs and provide certainty with respect to the businesses and practitioners who deal with taxation law, with compliance costs and also with business generally. However, sometimes the Commissioner of Taxation can get it wrong, and sometimes decisions made by the Commissioner of Taxation can confuse and cause difficulties. What we are doing here is restoring the situation to what the business community and the accountancy field always thought it was and what the government policy always intended to ensure. Global roaming by Australian residents when travelling overseas is not subject to GST as it is not connected with Australia for the purpose of GST, and we intend to ensure that we fulfil our obligations under the Melbourne agreement. We want to make sure that nonresidents are not subject for GST purposes. The previous government made the announcement, as the member for Farrer said, in December 2006 that it would take steps in relation to this matter but, as is so often the case when the Rudd government brings in legislation, we hear that the previous government thought it might deal with this in its 13th or 14th year but never got around to actually doing anything. This is important reform. The business community will think it is sensible, the accountancy industry will think it is sensible, and anyone who deals with this area will also think it prudent measure by the government. The third schedule relates to adjustments for third parties. This is a confusing area, but what it actually means is that the inappropriate interaction of the GST will not create third-party payment adjustments which are unintended. It means that the correct amount of GST outcome will be achieved in circumstances where there are third parties involved in the supply chain. We want to make sure that there are no consequences adverse to consumers or to groups such as religious groups or joint ventures or in fact GST groups. Entities that deal with one another also need to be aware of the consequences of that. This has been relevant especially to the automotive industry, who have expressed some concerns particularly in respect of the public consultation process. They will welcome this change. The member for Farrer spoke about this and I do not intend to outline exactly what the consequences of the schedule 3 amendments will be. I think this is important reform. All three schedules add to the certainty and clarification of tax law in this country. They add to business certainty. They promote a climate in which business can operate with less regulation and a lighter burden. They create a climate in which we can ensure that businesses-particularly small and medium-sized businesses as well as those in the transportation sector and the automotive industry-can operate profitably, employ more people and create the jobs which we hope will get us through the difficult days we face now and in the future.",80
159,Mrs HULL,COMMITTEES,"I rise today to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 3) Bill 2010 and take the opportunity to concentrate on one component of this bill. I begin by referring to my media release of 29 September 2006 when I was a member of the is a Howard government. I was ecstatic at being able to release this information, because a plan that I had worked on for so very long had started to unfold. It was not a panacea, it was not going to rebuild the lives of people caring for disabled children in a flash and it was not going to be the answer to everything; but it was the beginning of an understanding that we had to provide some mechanisms to enable parents to prepare to look after their disabled children. These children may have been born with intellectual disabilities or physical disabilities. They may have acquired disabilities through brain tumours, accidents or simple things such as a cricket ball or cricket bat hitting them in the head and rendering them brain damaged. They may have had illnesses that had afflicted them with a disability from then on. But in each case the lives of the parents of these children are in turmoil as they try to determine how to prepare to care for their disabled child through their adult lives when the parents themselves become aged persons. I concentrate today specifically on schedule 4 of this bill, which centres around changes to the taxation of the unexpended income of special disability trusts. I recall that I put out my press release of December 2006 after I had lobbied the former Minister for Family and Community Services, Kay Patterson, over an extensive period, had talked to many parents of disabled children and had listened to the advocacy of Judy Brewer-who was the wife of the Hon. Tim Fischer, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia-on the needs of parents with disabled children. We wanted to ensure that they could be cared for in the future by ringfencing property and allowing people to save into a trust while not being penalised for doing so. The idea was that they could put money, property et cetera into a trust and not be penalised by losing their disability support through having an income tax penalty applied to them. I lobbied very hard on both this and a system that could be applied either at birth or at any time afterwards to insure families in their management of the care of disabled children over many years. I was not successful at the time in getting a national insurance scheme up and running, though not for want of trying. However, we were successful in putting in place special disability trusts. I recall welcoming the fact that families were able to start to prepare the future care of their disabled sons or daughters through the special disability trusts created at that time by the Australian government. I talked about the measure that would enable families to make preparations financially to provide current and future care and accommodation for a son or daughter with a severe disability without being affected by social security means-testing. I talked about the fact that they could place up to $500,000 in a special disability trust and not have it impact on the beneficiary's income support, such as disability support pension or the gifter's pension if they were of pension age. I talked about needing to support both people with a disability and the people who care for them. I concentrate today on a submission that was sent into the discussion paper on this issue. I will not identify the author of this submission, but it puts everything into context and determines the real issues confronted by parents who are facing the lifelong care of a child. This submission talks about the problems associated with one particular family, and it was so well put together that I could not do better than to come into this House and quote extensively from it. I think it clearly picks up many of the issues. I welcome the changes in this bill. I think they are good changes. They are the beginning of a recognition of the issues that confront our families, but they do not go far enough, and I am acutely aware of the fact that there should have been changes made by the last government. I am not saying that this government is responsible for making all the changes. I am acutely aware of that, because I lobbied hard for changes while we were in government, and I am just adding that the change needs to continue to happen. In this submission, the author-who, as I said, shall remain nameless because I do not believe it would be correct to put their name for in, although the submission is public-says: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Exposure Draft. At the outset I would like to make the following commentsand I have been in touch with this person on numerous occasions. - The change from taxing the unexpended income within a SDTa special disability trust or SDTfrom 46.5% to the beneficiary's marginal tax rate is a very significant and positive stepwhich I absolutely agree withthat will be appreciated by those who have established or those who are contemplating setting up a SDT. - However, the above is only one step forward. This is clearly stated in the Exposure Draft at 1.9 page 2 ie. 1.9 These amendments remove one of the tax issues identified by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and are designed to ensure that taxation is not a disincentive for the establishment of a SDT. There are many other disincentives relating to tax issues that have not been stated in this document or whether they will be considered or addressed in the future. The author goes on to say: One example is the CGT impost of placing a residence, however meagre, into a SDT. This is particularly the case for elderly couples who have been extremely frugal during their lives to save sufficient to house their severely disabled son or daughter. Many have been caring for a disabled offspring in excess of 40 years, as in our case. … … … Data provided by FaHCSIA in September 2005 gave an initial estimate of 5,000 trusts to be lished by 2010 however, very few trusts have been established and these are by carers with an average age of 78 years, which is indicative that the SDT was an option of last resort before they themselves lost legal capacity or met their demise. Currently the only means for elderly parents to avoid the substantial financial impost of CGT on placing a residence in a SDT is through their death, whether that is brought about by natural causes, tragic accident or suicide. In the press release to herald the Exposure Draft, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Nick Sherry and Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities, Bill Shorten MP stated: ‘This Bill will rectify an inappropriate taxation outcome and further assist immediate family members and carers to make private financial provision for the care and accommodation needs of people with severe disability.' The author goes on to say: The question arises then, what other inappropriate taxation outcomes are a disincentive hindering parents from establishing a SDT? It is worth noting that the only change to the administration of SDTs prior to the 2009/2010 budget was to permit agencies/institutions to combine aids and accommodation expenditures. This was possibly sanctioned specifically for accounting/auditing purposes. It appears that very little thought has been given to the concept of social inclusion within the community in the legislative framework of SDTs. Many severely disabled people with complex health problems and needs may not survive within the confines of an agency's institutional care and accommodation. In the case of our 43 year old severely disabled daughter, she would not be alive today if she had been subjected to such ‘care'. Currently, after at least two years we are still waiting for approval to be granted conditions for inclusion in a SDT that are outlined in Guidelines 2006, subsection 2.8 (1 ). In raising this issue and quoting extensively from the submission outlining this family's plight, I wanted to thank the government for making some changes to this legislation that will ease one very small part of the burden for carers who are trying to make arrangeestabments for the future care of their children. But I also ask the government to continue to make these changes-to continue to understand that these changes are sometimes the most important thing that a carer who is an ageing parent can hope for when they care for a disabled ageing son or daughter. The pure fact of special disability trusts being established, I thought, could be the beginning of monumental change in the future. As I said, when they were established, I saw their limitations; I was not advocating that they were the best thing that had ever happened to families struggling through such a crisis in their lives, but I did feel proud that we had made movement on it and that people were being recognised for the pain they have suffered and for their endurance. They have been asked to accept these things without receiving true and proper recognition. When I speak on the carers bill, hopefully later this week, I will quote extensively from a book that has been released, which I have been fortunate to receive a copy of, detailing the feelings and experiences, the fun and the pain of dealing with someone with a severe disability. I am looking forward to making that speech. But in this speech I want to appeal to the minister: please, this is a good movement, but let us look at capital gains tax; it should not apply. You should be able to place a family home into a disability trust. You should be able to secure and ring-fence that home. That is what I thought was the intention of the special disability trusts. I do not know how I missed the fact that it would attract capital gains tax and that this would be a major impediment for people wanting to take this up. If you could ring-fence and put your home or a future home for your child in the trust and earn income from it and leave that in the trust and not have tax implications or capital gains implications for it, imagine how much relief you would have in actually being able to provide for the future care of your child should something happen to you and should you not be the one who is able to provide that care. One of the carers in my region is 93 years old, and he has been caring for 70 years full time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There seems to be no real answer to how we could structure an appropriate vehicle to enable families to adequately provide for the future of their child. In speaking to this bill, I want to say government: thank you for making a small change. We appreciate it. The people of Australia who have disabled children and who want to enter into a special disability trust thank you as well. But I do ask you not to say: ‘Well, we've done something there and that is all we need to do.' It is not all we need to do. Regardless of who is in government and who runs this country, we have so much to do-and it begins with removing things like capital gains tax and implementing things like a national insurance scheme that people can pay into in order to care for their children. I will continue to raise this before I leave this parliament. It has been one of the things that I have advocated most for and railed against in this parliament. I feel that the recognition of carers with disabled children is still far from top of mind in any government that I have witnessed since being in this place. I would like to see it far more top of mind and I would like to see more effort put into trying to resolve the issues of carers of disabled children and particularly those carers with ageing disabled children. I thank you for the opportunity to speak.",82
160,Mr ZAPPIA,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak briefly on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 3) Bill 2010 and I begin by providing a brief outline of this bill. The bill provides three schedules which amend the GST legislation. Schedule 1 amends the GST law to provide that the transport of goods by subcontractors within Australia that forms part of the international transport of those goods by another entity from or to Australia is taxable unless the supply of transport is made to a nonresident that is not in Australia. Schedule 2 amends the GST law to ensure telecommunications supplies under global roaming arrangements provided to subscribto the ers of nonresident telecommunications suppliers while roaming in Australia remain not subject to GST. The global roaming telecommunications supplies covered by the amendment are mobile telephone global roaming and mobile internet roaming. The amendment makes GST-free the following supplies of global roaming services: the supply made by an Australian resident telecommunications supplier to a nonresident telecommunications supplier of use of its network in Australia and provided to subscribers of the nonresident telecommunications supplier when visiting Australia and the supply by the nonresident telecommunications supplier of global roaming facilities made to its subscribers visiting Australia. Schedule 3 amends the GST law to ensure that the appropriate amount of goods and services tax is collected and the appropriate amount of input tax credits claimed in situations where there are payments-often referred to as third-party payments-between parties in a supply chain which indirectly alter the price paid or received by the parties for the things supplied but where certain ties in the supply chain are members of the same GST group, GST religious group or GST joint venture. The amendments correct an unintended consequence of recent changes to the GST legislation which created an adjustment to apply in situations where third-party payments are made. Let me briefly explain each of the schedules. Schedule 1 will reduce GST compliance costs and provide greater certainty for the domestic transport industry by streamlining the application of the GST law to this industry. The changes to the GST treatment of cross-border transport suppliers have been sought by industry and I am sure will be welcome. The changes will reduce nonresident involvement in the Australian GST system, make the GST law consistent for postal and nonpostal goods, and assist subcontracted transport suppliers with tax compliance. This measure is consistent with government initiatives to reduce tax compliance costs particularly for small and medium businesses. Schedule 2 talks about relief for telecommunication suppliers for global roaming in Australia. Australia is a party to the Melbourne agreement. Article 6.1.3 of the Melbourne agreement provides that tax levied in accordance with the national law of a country on ‘collection charges for international telecommunication services' can only be collected ‘in respect of international services billed to customers in that country'. This means that international telecommunication supplies made under arrangements for global roaming in Australia provided to subscribers of nonresident telecommunications suppliers' customers while those subscribers are ‘roaming' in Australia should not be subject to GST. I understand that up until 14 December 2005 these international telecommunication supplies were not considered to be taxable under the Australian GST law. However the par- Commissioner of Taxation then determined that these supplies were taxable. Therefore it is necessary to amend the GST law to ensure that the treatment of these supplies remains consistent with the Melbourne agreement. The type of telecommunication supply provided to the user of a portable device under a global roaming arrangement is not limited by this amendment. Those supplies include transmission of voice, pictures and text messages, email and internet access. A charge that is for the content delivered to a portable device, as distinct from the transmission service to deliver that content, is not covered by this amendment. Due to the convergence of telecommunication device capabilities in recent years, there are many portable devices which subscribers of non-resident telecommunication suppliers may use to access global roaming in Australia. These include mobile phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants, laptop computers and universal serial bus modems. Global roaming by Australian residents when travelling overseas is not subject to GST as it is not connected with Australia for the purposes of the GST. Schedule 3 refers to adjustments for thirdparty payments. The amount of GST paid or input tax credits claimed in a previous tax period may need to be adjusted to ensure that the correct GST outcome is obtained when circumstances change. Adjustments may arise due to, among other things, changes in consideration such as a change in price due to a discount. The law was recently amended to allow a third-party payment adjustment to arise where there is a payment between parties in a supply chain which effectively alters the consideration paid for a thing but which would not have given rise to an adjustment because it would not, ordinarily, alter the consideration for the supply by the payer to its customer, or the consideration paid for acquisition by the payee from its supplier. This amendment ensures that an entitlement to a decreasing adjustment will still arise in situations where an entity supplying things to another entity for resale makes a monetary payment to a third party in the supply chain in connection with the third party's acquisition of something and this payment effectively reduces the price the payer receives for the thing but where the payer and the other entity are members of the same GST group, GST religious group or GST joint venture. The amendment also ensures that an increasing adjustment arises for the recipient of a third-party payment where the payee is registered for GST and has acquired the thing for a creditable purpose but where the payee and the entity from which it acquires the thing are members of the same GST group, GST religious group or GST joint venture. The government has foreshadowed further amendments to the GST legislation to ensure that the appropriate GST outcome is also achieved in situations where the taxable status of a supply which is the subject of a third-party payment changes as it moves through the supply chain. I make the observation that GST laws and tax laws generally often have unintended consequences as new services become available and as the way services are provided change. There are also unintended consequences as a result of globalisation and international service delivery as both schedules 1 and 2 highlight. As we all know, people are today travelling more often and in greater numbers. With travel comes the need for services, the purchase of goods and the use of communication services and equipmentand we see that on a daily basis around the world today. It does not matter where you are, you will inevitably see people with their iPhones, their normal phones or even laptops carrying on their work, even if they are on the the other side of the world. Those services have to be provided by someone from the country from which they are departing originally and then perhaps through the use of other contractors along the way. The use of those services has clearly complicated the GST arrangements in respect of this matter. Not surprisingly, the intent is to try to make the whole process and the transaction much simpler with respect to the application of the GST. This legislation will simplify Australia's tax system with respect to the GST, particularly in those areas that I have just spoken about. But the measures are also consistent with other measures that the Rudd government has taken to simplify Australia's tax systems for all Australians, and particularly for Australian businesses. In the recent budget handed down by the Treasurer, we have seen that there will be a reduction in the company tax rate-from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. That will support some three-quarters of a million businesses here in Australia. By way of making taxation laws much simpler in this country, there will be an asset write-off provision that will be made available to all small businesses in this country, whereby they will be able to write off up to $5,000 of their assets rather than the current $1,000-again, making life for them easier than it was in the past. In the year 2012-13 we will see standard deductions of $500 for household taxpayers. Again, that will make their life much easier and save them money. I understand that some six million plus household taxpayers would normally use the services of an accountant in order to lodge their tax returns. That figure of $500 will go up to $1,000 in 2013-14. I understand that that will mean that some 8.9 million Australians will find lodging their tax returns much easier and it will save them money because they will not have to, in many cases, engage the use of a tax accountant. For those who do not normally engage the use of a tax accountant, it will simply make their life easier because, if they have a standard deduction of up to $1,000, they will not have to keep a record and track every expenditure they have along the way, as many of them are possibly doing right now. But I guess the biggest beneficiary of streamlining our tax laws would be small business in this country. The GST measures that I alluded to in this bill would effectively be measures that would be imposed on small businesses-because, along the way, all of the beneficiaries of these measures are small business. I am pleased to see that this is another step in all of the changes made by the Rudd government since coming to office which have assisted small business. We saw last year, as part of the government's economic stimulus measures, the 50 per cent tax rebate for capital purchases that applied to small business. I know of many small businesses that took advantage of that. It helped them during a difficult time. We know that the majority of funds in the government's stimulus packages firstly went to small business in one form or another and then clearly flowed through to the rest of the economy. Again, whether it was the Building the Education Revolution funding, the infrastructure funding or even the direct payments we made to families, who in turn spent those moneys, most of the money went into small businesses in one form or another and enabled them, through those very difficult times, to maintain the staff they had, maintain employment in this country and maintain the viability of their operations. lier times, we also put an incredible amount of funding into establishing business enterprise centres around the country, again clearly with an intent of supporting small businesses and providing advice to them. I certainly welcome the money that was put into my own region, both at the Tea Tree Gully Business Enterprise Centre and the Salisbury Business and Export Centre, to assist those two centres with the business advice that they provide to the local community. As I said at the outset, these measures are about simplifying the tax system for Australians, and I have absolutely no doubt that they will be welcomed by individuals and by businesses alike. For those reasons, I commend this bill to the House.",85
161,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,COMMITTEES,"I thank those members who participated in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 3) Bill 2010. The amendments in schedule 1, dealing with the GST and cross-border transport provisions, will ensure that the transport of goods by transport subcontractors within Australia that forms part of the international transport of those goods by another entity to or from Australia is GST free in specific circumstances. The amendments will also provide GST-free treatment for loading, handling and other services in certain circumstances that facilitate the international transport of goods. This measure will improve certainty and clarify the application of the GST law for businesses involved in the domestic transport of exported and imported goods. The amendments contained in schedule 2 of the bill will ensure that global roaming by visitors to Australia remains GST free, consistent with Australia's treaty obligations under the International Telecommunications Regulations-the so-called Melbourne In ear- agreement. The amendments exempt from GST supplies of global-roaming services provided to subscribers of non-resident telecommunications suppliers while the subscribers are visiting Australia. This includes both the use of an Australian telecommunications supplier's network by a non-resident telecommunications supplier and the supply of global-roaming facilities by the nonresident telecommunications supplier to its subscribers. The amendments contained in schedule 3 of the bill will ensure that the underlying policy objective of the recently enacted measure provided for GST adjustments for third-party payments is met in situations in which the relevant parties in the supply chain are members of the same GST group, GST religious group or GST joint venture. The underlying policy objective is that the appropriate amount of GST is collected and that the appropriate amount of input tax credits are claimed in situations where there are payments between parties in a supply chain which indirectly alter the price received or paid by the parties for the things supplied. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",88

163,Mr HARTSUYKER,REFINEMENTS AND OTHER,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Prudential Refinements and Other Measures) Bill 2010. This legislation is supported by the opposition. The exposure draft consultation process allowed Treasury to address small technical concerns, and the legislation is now broadly supported by stakeholders in the financial services sector. The bill amends a number of acts to improve Australia's prudential framework by introducing a number of small measures that will improve the ability of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to manage Australia's financial institutions during a crisis. As the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law mentioned in his second reading speech, the bill contains five main areas of amendments. Firstly, the legislation will strengthen APRA's powers to prevent prudential concerns from arising. This will be undertaken by an expansion of APRA's preventative and correctional powers. For instance, APRA will be able to set criteria for granting authorisation to carry on business as an authorised deposit-taking institution, insurer or authorised non-operating holding company of an ADI or insurer. APRA will revoke an authorisation if the institution fails to meet these criteria. APRA may also set prudential standards in respect of corporate groups or parts of corporate groups under the Insurance Act and may set standards excluding assets from being ‘assets in Australia' for the purposes of the Insurance Act. Importantly, APRA's ability to give directions are expanded, clarifying that APRA is able to issue directions relating to foreign ADIs and making it an offence for an insurance company to fail to comply with a direction. These measures will allow APRA to react quicker to changes in the market by setting criteria under which prudentially regulated institutions operate and enhancing the ability of APRA to give directions to those institutions. Secondly, the bill will amend the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001 to allow more flexibility of the financial data collection and publishing regime of APRA. The data collection powers of APRA are important to the financial services sector because they allow standardised comparisons of prudentially regulated institutions, and published data encourages competition by furthering information availability in the market. APRA will be able to collect data to assist the minister formulate financial policy or to assist another financial sector agency perform its functions or exercise its powers. The bill clarifies that APRA will be able to collect data relating to the Financial Claims Scheme and will ensure that confidential information in reporting standards is prevented from being published where publication is likely to detrimentally affect the bility of the financial system or financial institutions. Thirdly, the legislation amends the financial sector levies framework, which will improve the methodologies governing the determination of levies. The levy paid by a new entity will be based on that entity's asset value on the day it became a superannuation entity and not on historic values. The bill also allows APRA the flexibility to impose a levy using an alternative valuation basis where the asset value is an inappropriate determination. Fourthly, the bill repeals five redundant acts, which relate to the validation of past financial sector levy determinations, which are made redundant by this bill. Finally, the bill amends the Financial Claims Scheme to improve the scheme's operation and to expand APRA's administration of the scheme. APRA will be able to determine the rate of interest that applies tected accounts for the purposes of determining entitlements under the Financial Claims Scheme, which is when APRA considers that the rate of interest is not certain. The bill also clarifies the operation of the Financial Claims Scheme in relation to pooled trust accounts and states that APRA is able to require a liquidator to assist in paying account holders their entitlements under the Financial Claims Scheme. The measures improve the operation of the Financial Claim Scheme, which was established by the government in October 2008, for the purposes of protecting depositors in ADIs from loss on their deposit and to give them prompt access to their deposits if their ADI becomes insolvent. These measures have taken some time to be legislated. As I have already mentioned, Treasury went through a consultation process with its exposure draft. The amendments to financial sector levies also followed a review by Treasury in 2009, which the government stacherry-picked to implement the amendments contained in this bill with regard to reforms in the financial sector levies. It is a shame that the Labor government did not take this level of consultation into its implementation of the Financial Services Scheme in the first place. The scheme implemented the government's bank deposit guarantee in October 2008 when the financial crisis was starting to hit. A guarantee on deposits had bipartisan support but the government chose not to consult with the coalition on the details and implemented an initially bungled scheme, which hurt Australia's financial services market. The bill being considered today allows APRA to deliver a more direct response to turmoil in global and Australian financial markets. It is appropriate that intervention powers be taken out of the hands of the Rudd Labor government and given to market exto pro- perts at APRA because the government caused chaos in the market through its bungled bank guarantee scheme. We even see the government continue to destroy financial markets through its great big tax on mining, which is reducing the value of resources stock as we speak. The Treasurer even admitted that the great big new tax would hit financial markets as a means of justifying Labor's $38 million misinformation campaign about the tax. The Financial Services Scheme as originally designed by the government did not have a cap on balances that could be guaranteed under that deposit scheme. Labor ignored the advice of the RBA and of the coalition to limit that amount. The unlimited guarantee caused a rush on mortgage trust funds because investors started moving their money away from what they perceived to be risky trust based investments and placed them into guaranteed risk-free deposit accounts. Trust funds were forced to freeze redemptions on account balances as the rush rapidly depreciated the value of funds, much of which was tied up in property investment. At the recent round of estimates hearings, ASIC detailed that 63 schemes were frozen and were holding around $70 billion of investments. In February, $25 billion of these investments were still frozen. This is part of the Rudd Labor government's impact on the markets-$25 billion still remaining frozen in mortgage trusts and a great big new tax on mining that is hurting financial markets by the government's own admission. Scott Murdoch commented in the Australian in December 2008 that: … instead of being a stabilising force for the mestic financial system, the Government's banking guarantee is proving more damaging than beneficial. The consequences of the policy's hazard formation are now emerging, fracturing financial markets more than most experts and economists thought possible. This minister knows all about misjudging the market through the government's bungled Fuelwatch and GROCERYchoice debacles, which displayed no understanding of the market and were simply a waste of money. In contrast the Financial Claims Scheme was a good measure in theory. It was broadly supported by the coalition. But the government should have listened to the coalition and to the Reserve Bank on the actual design of its scheme, just like the government should be listening to industry with regard to the resources super profits tax. Instead we are seeing the government attack the mining sector, which is raising legitimate concerns about this tax. When this government thinks it is right, it simply refuses to listen to anyone. The government's other regulator, ASIC, highlighted last week the double standard in this debate with regard to its impact upon financial markets. Last Wednesday, ASIC's acting chairman Belinda Gibson warned that mining companies: … have to work out whether they have enough information to form a view on the impact of this tax, which is not yet written, to say to the market categorically that that is the impact. What a rather interesting statement to have to form a view on the impact of the tax, which is not yet written! Absolutely astounding, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer! So, on this debate we have the situation where the government regulators can hold mining companies to account over statements made regarding the tax but the Rudd government escapes similar responsibilities. We have the Rudd government out in the market claiming that mining companies only dopay between 13 and 17 per cent tax when the actual tax rate is 41.1 per cent for coal companies. They were arguing time and time hap- again that the headline figure was going to be a 40 per cent tax on profits under this great big new tax on mining yet the Treasurer now admits that the tax could be up to 57 per cent. The Prime Minister even said that any suggestion that the tax was hurting Australian financial markets was, ‘wrong, wrong, wrong'. Well, two days later we had the Treasurer justify the government's great big waste of money on advertising on the basis that the tax was having an impact on financial markets. You cannot have it both ways. If the manager of a company had made such reckless remarks to the market as this government has done recently, it would be guilty of breaching continuous disclosure obligations. Leading investment managers are starting to express their concerns about the tax. John Teale of the Australian Foundation Investment Company, the oldest investment company in Australia, commented recently that he has been in the market for over 50 years and has never seen people from overseas turn off Australia so quickly. ‘It's very sad,' he said. The government simply does not know what it is doing in the market. It introduces legislation such as this, which provides market integrity and regulation through APRA, and then ignores these principals in its reform agenda-if you could call it ‘reform'; perhaps we should call it a ‘change' agenda rather than a ‘reform' agenda. This is one of the reasons why the coalition supports this bill. It allows APRA more flexibility to address market concerns in the financial services market and prevents the likelihood that a Labor government will step in and distort market functions. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says: In performing and exercising its functions and powers, APRA is required to balance the objectives of financial safety and efficiency, competiticular tion, contestability and competitive neutrality and, in balancing those objectives, is to promote financial system stability in Australia. This is a reasonable principle to take forwards in financial services policy. Unfortunately, this government does not hold this principle in its own actions, and we are all paying the price. The coalition supports this bill. We support light-touch amendments to Australia's financial regulation. This bill improves Australia's prudential framework by providing some light-touch measures allowing APRA to be more responsive to market fluctuations in financial services. I commend the bill to the House.",89
164,Mr RIPOLL,REFINEMENTS AND OTHER,"It is a pleasure to speak on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Prudential Refinements and Other Measures) Bill 2010, and it is always a pleasure to follow the member for Cowper and to listen to his contributions and to hear what he has to say, in representing the opposition in this place, about the very good reform agenda program that we have-hearing him admit that we do have a reform agenda and that we are getting on with the business and the job of reforming many parts of the financial services sector which the former government failed to do for 12 very long years. These are matters and issues which the opposition could have dealt with. These are pressing matters and they are being supported by the opposition-and they should be supported by the opposition-but they should be supported in the light of the fact that they could not bring themselves in those 12 very long years to make these changes and reforms themselves. Some of these issues are more complex than others; they involve some extensive consultation with the sector and an extensive review of a number of bills. This bill in paris quite involved and deals specifically with prudential regulation and making certain that there are some refinements and some other measures in the legislation which assist industry. This particular bill continues the legislative amendments that were made by the government to improve the efficiency and operation of a range of financial sector legislation. The bill itself contains amendments to 17 different acts and repeals five redundant acts. In a previous contribution a member of the opposition was talking about more regulation and more burden when in fact this government is removing or repealing, wherever it can, redundant acts and getting rid of regulation where it is not necessary. More important than having a debate over ‘more' or ‘less', the debate in this ought to be about ‘appropriate'. That is what this place ought to be about-appropriate regulation, not more or less regulation. That is what this particular amendment bill is about. The bill covers five particular key areas reform. The first is the amendment of the prudential regime by strengthening APRA's powers to prevent potential concerns arising and to address them as they do arise. Secondly, it amends the financial claims scheme to facilitate APRA's administration of the scheme and improve the scheme's operation. It also amends the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001 to promote the harmonisation and flexibility of the data tion and publishing regime and APRA's role as a central repository for the collection of financial data. It also amends the financial sector levies framework to improve the methodologies governing the determination of levies. Finally, the amendment bill repeals-very importantly-five redundant acts as part of the government's commitment to continuously cleaning up red tape. We spoke in this place a little earlier today and had an amendment about cutting red tape for companies limited by guarantee. That is more good work in the financial services sector in terms of reform and ensuring any unnecessary compliance, red tape and other cost barriers to business are removed. These amendments are largely the result of a review of the prudential regulatory framework by APRA and also by the Treasury. Both of these organisations have been working very closely to bring about an extensive consistent reform agenda in line with the government's policies, and they ought to be applauded for their work. These amendments are consistent with developments happening overseas in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. We place have sought to review and strengthen our financial regulatory frameworks and make reference to those in other countries with economies similar to our own economy. At this point it is important to note that both the UK and the US and others are turning to of Australia to look at our regulatory framework, particularly looking at our twin peaks model between ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, as a regulator and APRA as the prudential regulator. That speaks volumes about the sound regulatory framework that we have in this country. The amendments and the changes and the strengthening that we are putting in place are consistent with what is happening in other collec- jurisdictions around the world. Schedule 1 of the amendment is in relation to the Banking Act 1959 and deals specifically with a range of changes. Schedules 1 to 3 of the bill are aimed at ensuring the quality of the financial institution system for identifying, measuring and managing the various risks to reduce the risk of failure, and that where failure does occur the public still has confidence in the financial system that we have in this country-making sure that confidence is maintained while any failure is properly and appropriately managed. This bill amends the Banking Act 1959 and a number of other acts to ensure there is consistency in the prudential laws and the approach that we take across the board. There are also significant changes to the Insurance Act 1973. Again these amendments are largely a result of an extensive review of the prudential regulatory framework by APRA and Treasury. The review identified that amendments were necessary to strengthen APRA's ability to effectively fulfil its mandate. This is consistent with what is happening in other similar jurisdictions, notably in the United Kingdom and the United States. These amendments are in schedules 1 to 3 of the bill. The bill also amends the Life Insurance Act 1995. These amendments are also a result of the review of the prudential regulatory framework by APRA and Treasury. That review identified that amendments were necessary to strengthen APRA's ability to effectively fulfil its mandate. As a result of that, we have these amendments before us today. This is consistent with the developments in the other jurisdictions that I mentioned before. We are also amending a range of other acts so that there is consistency. We are ensuring that the prudential laws are appropriate and consistent across a range of areas. The amendments in schedule 4 of the bill are aimed at promoting the harmonisation and flexibility of the data collection and publish- minations. ing regime and APRA's role as the central repository for the collection of financial data, including enabling APRA to collect data to assist the minister in formulating financial policy. The amendments in schedule 4 also ensure that APRA has powers to address prudential concerns at a general or a life insurer via compulsory transfer of business. Lastly, the amendments in schedule 4 enhance the regime for the provision and protection of information under the prudential laws. There are a range of other amendments. This is quite a significant amendment bill in that it does alter quite a number of acts. As I said at the outset, it amends 17 separate acts and repeals five redundant acts. Further to that, on 1 July 2008 the then Assistant Treasurer announced an examination of the methodologies governing the determination of financial sector levies. This was in response to industry views on the methodologies and the fact that the methodologies had not been considered for quite some time. That was part of the consultation process that took place between industry, parts of the sector, Treasury and APRA as the review was being carried out. The review of the levies methodologies was undertaken by Treasury and APRA together. As a result of that work the team recommended legislative changes to the Assistant Treasurer. Out of that review the drafting error in the Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act will be corrected. Also the levy date for new starters under the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Act 1998 will be amended so as to bring it into line with the other imposition acts. The bill will also amend the imposition acts to provide more flexibility by enabling a valuation basis other than assets to be used on a case-by-case basis in the annual deterIt is necessary that these amendments be passed by 1 July 2010 so that the collection of levies based on the recommendations can commence properly in the 2010-11 financial year. These are sound amendments. They are supported by both sides of the House. While I have other comments to make on this, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

165,Mr RUDD,AFGHANISTAN,"On indulgence: it is with profound sadness that I inform the House that a helicopter carrying coalition forces went down in Kandahar province in Afghanistan today. There were 10 Australian servicemen on board. It is my sad responsibility to inform the House that three Australian commandos from the Special Operations Task Group have been killed and seven other Australian servicemen are wounded, two of them very seriously. This is a tragic day for Australia and for the Australian Defence Force. It is a day of the deepest sorrow for the friends and families of those who have lost their loved ones in this tragedy. I express to all of them the deepest condolences of the Australian government and the Australian people. Our thoughts are also with those who have been wounded. I want them and their families to know that they will receive the best possible medical care. This tragedy brings to 16 those Australians who have lost their lives serving our country in Afghanistan. This is a very heavy price to pay, particularly for the families of those brave Australians who have lost their lives. We know our mission in Afghanistan is hard, but this mission is critical for our common security. We work alongside our allies from the United States and from other NATO countries to avoid Afghanistan once again becoming a breeding ground for terrorists, who can then strike at innocent Australians both at home and abroad. It is our nation's highest calling to wear the uniform of Australia. Those who wear it do outstanding work for Australia, and they do that outstanding work in the most difficult, demanding and dangerous of environments. Today, we recall their service as we mourn the loss of some of Australia's finest. The commitment, the dedication and the sacrifice of those soldiers will not be forgotten. It will never be forgotten. All Australians owe them a debt of gratitude for their service and for their sacrifice. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families and friends of those who have fallen. We mourn them, and we pay tribute to them for having paid the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.",94
166,Mr ABBOTT,AFGHANISTAN,"On indulgence, I rise at this very solemn time to support the words of the Prime Minister. A fortnight ago, two sappers were killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan and there has now been another incident, this time even more serious, with three dead and others with very serious injuries. These are exceedingly grim reminders of the dangers our armed forces face and of the high price that members of our armed forces can be called upon to pay in the service of our country. Our soldiers are men of great character. There is no evidence that any of them are flinching from their duty, despite the terrible losses that have been experienced in Afghanistan. Knowing that their lives are on the line is a test of character that our troops regularly face and having troops in harm's way in the field is a test of character for our country too. It is a test of character that our troops invariably pass. It is a test of character that I hope the rest of us will pass too. Obviously, the families, the fellow soldiers and the friends of those killed, and injured and wounded, in action will be devastated. All Australians will share their grief and the hearts of all Australians will go out to them. There is no greater sacrifice that a soldier can make than to give his or her life in the service of our country. I commend the work that the Australian Defence Force is doing in Afghanistan. It is vital to ensuring that that country does not again become a safe haven for terrorists. It is a task vital for the security of all Australians. I hope that the knowledge that these soldiers have died serving their country and upholding its values will be of some comfort and consolation to their families and loved ones in this very sad time.",95

169,Mr RIPOLL,REFINEMENTS AND OTHER,"I will not hold up the House too much longer. Suffice to say that the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Prudential Refinements and Other Measures) Bill 2010 is a good bill. It is an amendment bill that deals with a whole range of other bills and amendments. It is part of the government's broader reform agenda in financial services and part of a whole series of reforms that we have made to ensure the long-term sustainability of our financial system in this country, that it is world-class, that it is best practice and that it is the envy of the rest of the world. In the same way that the financial services system in this country guided us-and certainly supported us-through the global financial crisis, the improvements that needed to be made to ensure good fiscal policy and monetary policy in the future are made by these amendments. On that basis, I congratulate the minister for his good work in this area and also the Treasury and the prudential regulator, APRA, for their work and the process they undertook. I also commend the bills to the House.",96
170,Mr CLARE,REFINEMENTS AND OTHER,"I would like to thank all members who participated in this debate. The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Prudential Refinements and Other Measures) Bill 2010 continues the legislative amendments made by the government to improve the efficiency and operation of a range of financial sector legislation. The bill is largely the result of a review of the prudential regulatory framework by APRA and Treasury. This review identified amendments necessary to strengthen APRA's ability to effectively fulfil its mandate. This is consistent with developments overseas, where countries such as the UK and the US have sought to review and strengthen their financial regulatory arrangements. The bill enhances the prudential regime by strengthening APRA's powers to prevent prudential concerns arising and to deal with such concerns should they arise. Such powers are essential to maintaining confidence and stability in the financial sector. The powers are enhanced by addressing potential gaps and uncertainty in the present legislation which may affect APRA's ability to fulfil its mandate. The bill also clarifies the operation of the Financial Claims Scheme provided for in the banking and insurance acts. It is important that the scheme's operation is clear and consistent and that it is able to be effectively administered by APRA. In addition, the bill amends the financial sector data collection regime. The amendments promote the flexibility of the regime and APRA's role as a national statistical agency for the financial sector. In particular, the amendments ensure that the government and financial sector agencies can access the data they require to perform their functions. Finally, the bill improves the financial sector levies regime in two respects: first, it improves the methodologies governing the determination of financial sector levies in response to the recommendations of the 2009 report of the review of financial sector levies and, second, it repeals five redundant levies' related acts as part of the government's ongoing commitment to reducing red tape. An exposure draft of the bill was released for public consultation on 19 January this year. In response, a number of submissions relating to the bill were received. The majority of these submissions either supported or had no major concerns with the bill. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those who made a submission in relation to the bill. Submissions were made by a variety of industry bodies and other interested parties, and the government values all of these contributions. As required by the Corporations Agreement 2002, the Ministerial Council for Corporations was also consulted and has approved the amendments in the bill to the national corporate regulation regime. The bill implements important reforms to Australia's financial sector legislative framework. In particular it ensures that APRA has the powers it needs to fulfil its mandate. This mandate includes being the prudential regulator administrator of the Financial Claims Scheme and the national statistical agency for the financial sector. It is important mandate which promotes the financial well-being of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",96

172,Mr KEENAN,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"I rise to speak on the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that there was an election on Norfolk Island a few months ago, and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the newly elected members of the 13th Legislative Assembly, particularly the newly elected Chief Minister, Mr David Buffett, whom I met with recently in Canberra. It is no exaggeration to say that Norfolk Island is a unique and integral part of Australia. In addition to being one of Australia's most geographically isolated communities, it is also one of Australia's oldest territories, having been settled in conjunction with Australia's founding settlement at Sydney in New South Wales. At various times in its history the island formed part of the colonies of Van Diemen's Land, which is now Tasmania, and New South Wales. Norfolk Island's convict history and heritage and the traditions of its residents remain an important part an of Australia's national heritage and culture. Mr Christian-Bailey, a former member of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, described the island culture in an article published in 2006, when he said: The Norfolk Island Community has an incredibly proud history. We were arguably the first people in the Commonwealth to have a free and compulsory vote for everyone over 18, including women. This was enshrined in our own laws as early as 1838. We have always been proud of ourselfreliance, our resourcefulness and of our strong community spirit. We have our own language, which we still love to use with one another, and our cultural traditions are strong and distinct from those of Australia. Going back further, in 1839 Joseph Campbell wrote an account entitled Norfolk Island and its inhabitants. Campbell describes the small and exceptionally beautiful place, inhabited by 400 people-‘about 250 who reside in the town, the rest in the small farms in various parts of the island'. There were excellent roads built by convicts, first-rate soils, thousands of lemon and guava trees, native flowers and, of course, the Norfolk Island pines. In those days there were a chief magistrate and jury running the island. Islanders had no taxes to pay but gave one week's labour out of every seven months to any public work that needed to be done. Before a person could settle on Norfolk, they needed to obtain the votes of two-thirds of everyone over 20 who could read and write, and the inhabitants were described as ‘very jealous of admitting people as members of their community'. Times have changed, and I now understand that six months residency is required before you can move to Norfolk Island permanently, although the island comes more broadly under the Australian Citizenship Act. Visitors to Norfolk, and indeed the islanders themselves, often describe the island as one of the most beautiful and unspoilt places on earth. Sadly, I have not had the opportunity to visit the island, although I would like to do so in the near future. And when I am there I will certainly be keen to undertake discussions and consultations with the Norfolk Island legislators, its leadership and as many of the community groups as possible. It is fair to say that the members of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, the committee secretariat and, most importantly, the people on the island who have given their time to the consultation process deserve a timely response, and we will endeavour to see an appropriate outcome from this legislation for the people of Norfolk Island. Successive Australian governments have acknowledged the importance of Norfolk Island to Australia's national heritage, and the value of the traditions and culture of the Pitcairn descendants is a part of multicultural Australia. However, while the Norfolk Island community is unique in many ways, regardless of where you live in Australia many of the issues that confront Norfolk Island are similar to what occurs in regional towns of a similar size. You have a community that is physically removed from Australia and from the centre of power in Australia. As a Western Australian, I certainly understand and have some empathy for how people might feel about being governed from distant Canberra and I am sympathetic to some of the concerns that the people of Norfolk Island have had in relation to this bill. As a former Western Australian senator, Ian Campbell, said when he was the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads: … it is very important that people in a place like Norfolk Island who do not necessarily agree with that sort of received wisdom feel that they have got the right to pursue a different way of doing things. In considering the need for electoral reform, it is important to bear in mind that the Australian parliament has the overarching responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens, wherever they may live in the federation. Indeed, we have an obligation to ensure that the laws in all Australian jurisdictions also are consistent with national obligations and also our obligations under international law. As noted about Norfolk Island in a previous Bills Digest, the constitutional status and history of the island is complex and unusual. After the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, Norfolk Island was placed under the authority of the new Commonwealth government to be administered as an external territory. During the Second World War, the island became a key airbase and refuelling depot between Australia and New Zealand, and New Zealand and the Solomon Islands. Since Norfolk Island fell within New Zealand's area of responsibility, it was garrisoned by a New Zealand Army unit, known as N Force, at a large army camp which had the capacity to house up to 1,500 men. N Force relieved a company of the Second Australian Imperial Force. The island proved too remote to come under attack during the war and N Force left the island in February 1944. In the late 1960s a mini-invasion by British expats followed after the island was featured on a BBC television documentary presented by Alan Whicker. Fifty families decided to emigrate from the United Kingdom to Norfolk Island as a result of that program. In 1979 Norfolk was granted limited self-government by Australia, under which the island elects a government that runs most of the island's affairs. As such, residents of Norfolk Island are not represented in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia, making them the only group of residents of an Australian state or territory not directly represented here. The main purpose of the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 is to amend the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to implement major changes to the governance, electoral and financial mechanisms for Norfolk Island. The bill, in schedules 2 and 3, also revises a vesting section of the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. The bill makes very significant changes to the governance, electoral and financial mechanisms for Norfolk Island. Specifically these changes would: - allow the Governor General and the responsible Commonwealth minister to take a more active role in the introduction and passage of Norfolk Island legislation including provision for the Commonwealth minister to give directions in schedule 2 matters and to reserve schedule 2 matters for the Governor General's consideration. - provide for the selection of, and prescribe the roles of Chief Minister and other ministers including by: limiting the number of ministers that might be appointed; further, allowing the removal of the Chief Minister by the Administrator in ‘exceptional circumstances'; limiting the power to allocate ministerial portfolios to the Chief Minister. - enable regulations to be made for a code of conduct for members of the Norfolk Island public service. - provide that regulations can be made for changes to the process for the election of the Legislative Assembly. - provide for minimum and maximum fixed terms of the Legislative Assembly. - implement a contemporary financial management framework including provision for contemporary guidelines for financial reporting and budgeting and auditing of the administration's financial statements by the Commonwealth Auditor-General. - allow the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to operate on Norfolk Island and provide for merits review of decisions made by the Norfolk Island administration. - apply the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988 to information held by the Norfolk Island government and its administration. Schedules 2 and 3 amend the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. These amendments provide a vesting mechanism for powers and functions under Western Australian laws as they apply to those territories-powers and functions under Western Australian officers and authorities where an agreement with the Australian government exists for those officers and authorities to act in the territories. Although the coalition support this bill in principle, as, I might say, does the administration of Norfolk Island in the main, we have some reservations regarding some aspects of it. In particular, we are concerned about the FOI and privacy provisions within the bill. We are concerned about the increased bureaucratic processes that might place an unreasonable burden on Norfolk Island's public service. We therefore reserve the right to move amendments in the Senate as they may be necessary to maintain flexibility in determining what is an appropriate level of added bureaucracy for the island. I would like to acknowledge some of the concerns of the Norfolk Island government that have been put to me directly and that were also expressed to the joint standing committee when it inquired into this bill. The administration has six main concerns which I will detail briefly. These concerns are legitiagrees mate and it is important that this parliament acknowledges them with due respect and takes them into account within its decision making process. The first of these concerns is what it has expressed to me as an ‘erosion of the ability to self-govern'. Anyone familiar with Norfolk Island will understand that island self government is jealously-and rightlyguarded by its residents and of course by the Norfolk Island government. That government argues that the ability to manage schedule 2 matters is fundamental to self government. According to the Norfolk Island government, schedule 2 matters affect the internal machinery of its government. Matters under schedule 2 include, but are not limited to, roads, street lighting, electricity supply, quarrying, tourism, firearms, housing, community and cultural affairs as well as matters incidental to or consequential on the examination of executive authority. A letter from the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, Mr Buffett, noted that the ‘addition of a veto power for matters pertaining to schedule 2 undermines the very principle that underlines the democratic rights of Norfolk Islander voters to govern themselves in relation to matters that are specific to Norfolk Island'. The second concern that the Norfolk Island government has raised is the ‘ability to remove the Legislative Assembly'. The Norfolk Island government argues that to provide fair and equitable government the ability to dissolve the Legislative Assembly should only be available to the Governor General, who would be able, on advice from the Administrator, to appoint a caretaker government, as is the convention in Australia. The third concern raised was the issue of elections. The Norfolk Island government with the recommendation of the joint standing committee that this part of the bill be removed and further discussion and consultation be entered into. Their fourth concern pertains to financial arrangements. The Norfolk Island government largely does not agree with the financial proposals in the bill. It has expressed the view that the proposals will result in direct interference with the operation of the Norfolk government, and it is particularly concerned with the obligations on employees of the Norfolk Island government to provide directly information not necessarily agreed to or vetted by the Norfolk government. It has indicated that this provides for the Commonwealth government to bypass the elected representatives and treat employees of the Norfolk government as if they were employees of the Commonwealth government. The fifth issue is the accountability process. The Norfolk Island government has reservations about the method of implementation proposed by the bill for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and for privacy and freedom of information provisions. The Norfolk government has expressed its desire to implement what it has termed the ombudsman model for these provisions, which would allow it to enshrine matters in their own legislation in consultation with the Commonwealth. The sixth and final concern relates to deputies. The Norfolk Island government has some concerns with the ability under the proposed bill for the responsible minister to appoint numerous deputies to the Administrator. The Chief Minister has said: It has been identified that these deputies would only be utilised in times of emergency, i.e. when the Administrator and the Official Secretary (who normally holds a dormant Deputy commission) were not available. If this is in fact the case Norfolk Island Government would like this reflected in the Bill to provide clarification deputies' role. The opposition acknowledge Norfolk Island's traditions and culture as well as the concern felt by some islanders that these reforms may threaten the current governance situation on Norfolk Island, but we also acknowledge that both the Norfolk government and the Islanders recognise, at least in principle, that there is a need for reform. I have no doubt that the people of the island and the people in their Legislative Assembly are raising these concerns in good faith. In summary, the opposition would like to see a pragmatic approach taken to this billhowever, this approach must always be in the best interests of the Norfolk Islanders themselves. We support the bill in principle, but we do reserve the right in the Senate to move amendments that address some of the unique and special culture and history of Norfolk Island. We cannot necessarily subject what is an island of 1,500 people to the full gamut of Australian democracy if they can find mechanisms that might be more suitable for a government of their size and for a government that administers what is a relatively small population. With those reservations, the opposition supports the bill and will look at it in a more detailed way during the Senate process.",97
173,Mr DEBUS,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"The first recommendation of the landmark 2003 inquiry report by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on the governance of Norfolk Island-entitled Quis custodiet ipsos custodies?-is: The continuation of the self government of Norfolk Island, as provided for under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 (Cth) … be conditional on the timely implementation of the specific external mechanisms of accountability and reforms to the the political system recommended in this Report. I make the point that the joint standing of the committee included just about the widest spectrum of political party allegiances possible in the Australian parliament at that time. It is precisely and carefully written, consistent itself with a variety of earlier and later reports. Moreover, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government at the time, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, contributed a lengthy statement about the nature of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the Norfolk Island government, which is included in the report itself. The report was prepared under the chairmanship of Senator Ross Lightfoot, supported in essence by the then minister, Wilson Tuckey, and it asked for urgent action to improve the governance of Norfolk Island. If my friend the present Minister for Home Affairs and I as the minister immediately preceding him have been concerned during the course of the Rudd government to bring forward amendments to the Norfolk Island Act, which were seen to be well overdue in 2003, it will be passing difficult to plausibly accuse us of either radical or precipitate behaviour. should mention that the contemporary joint standing committee-some of its long standing and most committed members were there in 2003, including the Chair, Senator Kate Lundy; the honourable member for Canberra; and the honourable member for Hinkler, who is here in the chamber-has recommended support for the present bill, the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010, in another report brought down a month or so ago. The history of Norfolk Island is singular. Polynesians lived there for a few years in the 14th and 15th centuries. Captain James Cook discovered the island uninhabited on his second voyage. It was seen by the British government as an auxiliary colony. Indeed, it was established as a convict settlement within six weeks of the settlement of Sydney Cove in January 1788. Abandoned between 1814 and 1825, it then entered another period as a notorious penal settlement, until that was in turn run down after 1847. At the time, it lay within the jurisdiction of the ony of Van Diemen's Land, but in 1856 the British government relocated the descendants of the mutineers from HMS Bounty and their Tahitian companions from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk and placed it under the administration of the Governor of New South Wales. Thus it remained until it was accepted as a territory of the Commonwealth by an order in council in March 1914 pursuant to section 122 of the Constitution of Australia. It needs to be borne in mind that Norfolk Island has a population of fewer than 2,000-less than a single ward in most local government councils in Australia. Nevertheless, the status of Norfolk Island is still sometimes contested by those who see it as a separate, culturally distinct dependency with a right to independence. That independence proposition has been argued in courts and asserted to the United Nations, but I cannot I find any suggestion that that view has ever been entertained by the Australian government or the Australian legal system. Indeed, I have found instead a consistent and general level of consensus in the many reports of the joint standing committee on territories over the last 30 years and in the comments of a long succession of territories ministers, both Labor and coalition. All agree that Norfolk Island is part of the Australian federation. All agree that its unique history and culture, together with its geographical position, require that it should be given a special status. Therefore, all agree that it is desirable to have some form of self government and that it is better to modify the existing system than to withdraw self government. However, all agree as well that the way of actually doing government has to be improved a lot. It was my direct experience during discussions in 2008 and 2009 that the idea of Norfolk Island as a separate dependency is still colalive, so I repeat the decisive commentary of the joint standing committee in 2003: The status of the Island was considered in Newbery v The Queen. In that case, Justice Eggleston found the Norfolk Island Act 1957 (Cth) to be constitutionally valid, and that the history of, and historical documents relating to, Norfolk Island, showed that it became, in 1914, a Territory placed by the Crown under the authority of the Commonwealth within the meaning of the Section 122 of the Constitution. Any remaining doubts about the status of the Island were removed by the High Court of Australia in 1976 in Berwick's Case in which Justice Mason-with whom the other judges agreedstated that the history of the Island made it “abundantly clear that Norfolk Island forms part of the Commonwealth of Australia”. The Hon Robert Ellicott, QC, widely respected on-Island as the architect of self government for Norfolk Island, concurred with this position in evidence the Committee on 25 July 2003. The Hon. Robert Ellicott is also respected by me personally. During my childhood and youth we lived in the same district, and he moved my admission as a solicitor to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. He is a man of enormous gift and integrity, and I know that he still maintains an interest in welfare of Norfolk. He introduced the Norfolk Island Act 1979 following the detailed work conducted by the Royal Commission into Matters Relating to Norfolk Island by Justice Sir John Nimmo. Some of Nimmo's recommendations were not followed, including those concerned with taxation, grant assistance arrangements and social security. Those matters are difficult. They have been discussed by ministers and the joint standing committee over the subsequent years. They are, I believe, of fundamental importance. They need to be addressed, and I think that some issues on the island will never be resolved until they are. However, there is no intention to address taxation or grant arrangements in this bill. The 1979 act was introduced under the plenary power of section 122 of the Australian Constitution. The act replaced an advisory council with a nine-member local legislature with the power to make laws over a very wide range of responsibilities exercised in other parts of Australia by local, state Commonwealth governments. The nominal head of government is an administrator who relies on the advice of Norfolk Island ministers when exercising powers and functions set out at length under schedule 2 of the act. On the other hand, powers set out in schedule 3 of the act are subject to Commonwealth veto. Schedule 3 includes matters of obvious national concern such as immigration, customs, fishing and social security. The bill before the House today proposes detailed changes and additions to machinerybefore of-government provisions. Some seek to bring the government of Norfolk Island more into line with the idea of ministerial responsibility under the Westminster system-for instance, by prescribing a process for selecting and dismissing the chief minister and ministers, who are limited in number to three, and providing for a no-confidence mothe tion process for a chief minister. The Administrator will be able to dismiss members of the Norfolk Legislative Assembly for serious or unlawful conduct, and the Governor General will be able to dissolve the legislative assembly under a measure identical to that which exists in the Australian Capital Territory. The Norfolk Island Act was drafted to enable the Commonwealth minister responsible to carry out the checks and balances necessary to ensure that Norfolk Island legislative proposals comply with Australian government policy objectives and Australia's national obligations under international law. The right of the Australian government to intervene is therefore an existing part of the island's system of governance. The assent processes established under the act are designed to protect the Australian government's national interest in Norfolk Island. This is particularly important precisely because the Norfolk Island government has executive responsibility for a range of Commonwealth and type powers such as immigration, customs, quarantine and so on. The act clearly intends that schedule 3 and non-schedule bills be subject to Commonwealth scrutiny. However, as presently drafted, the act does not allow for Commonwealth scrutiny of schedule 2 matters. The present strict designation of matters in schedules 2 and 3 does not recognise the difficulty of making an absolute determination about which particular matters may affect the national interest or of attempting to foresee what issues will be of interest to the Commonwealth in the future. The inability of the Commonwealth to intervene on schedule 2 matters limits its ability to respond to a new and emerging national policy interest or objective. For example, a number of matters presently listed in schedule 2 could easily intersect with national policy objectives, including item 25, firearms control; item 87, national censorship objectives; item 48, telecommunications; item 93, bankruptcy and insolvency; and item 88, child, family and social welfare. Since 1979, additional powers have been transferred to the Norfolk Island government's authority under schedule 2 with the expectation that Norfolk Island would enact and administer appropriate legislation and that the legislation would be consistent with the national interest and Australia's international legal obligations. Many of the powers transferred in 1989 and 1992 are either not supported by legislation or subject to inadequate legislation. For example, the Legal Profession Act 1993 is yet to be fully implemented, the Companies Act 1985 has not maintained parallel provisions with Australian corporate law, there is neither navigation legislation nor censorship legislation and so on. As presently drafted, the Commonwealth is also not able to introduce bills directly into the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly for consideration. Therefore, the Commonwealth's ability to intervene on matters within schedule 2 of the act is at present limited to the passage of Commonwealth legislation under the overarching constitutional territories power. This bill proposes to amend the Norfolk Island Act to extend the Commonwealth's legislative oversight of Norfolk Island legislation by providing the responsible Commonwealth minister with the power to issue instructions on schedule 2 matters; expanding the options available to the Norfolk Island Administrator when he or she is presented with a proposed law by allowing him or her to refer bills on schedule 2 matters to the Governor General where previously this option only existed for schedule 3 matters; extending the Governor General's existing legislative power to allow him or her to introduce a proposed law on any topic into the Norfolk Island legislative assembly; and providing the responsible Commonwealth minister with authority to introduce laws into the legislative assembly for the peace, order and good governance of the territory. It is especially important to point out that the increased Commonwealth legislative oversight of Norfolk Island is advanced through provisions that are, in this case, permissive and not mandatory. These provisions will assist the Australian government to fulfil its obligations to the community of Norfolk from a national perspective. But these provisions do not restrict the Norfolk Island legislative assembly's almost unlimited power to ‘make laws for the peace, order and good government of the territory'. Schedule 1, part 2 of the bill proposes amendments to the Norfolk Island Act to provide for a minimum three-year term for the legislative assembly, with a maximum of four years. That will provide certainty about the legislative assembly's term. The bill also proposes amendments to allow the Australian government to make regulations on the voting system to be used in elections. There are other matters. It is an obvious fact that, since 1979, there have been quite massive changes in the way that government is held to account for its performance in every Australian jurisdiction and at every level, with the singular exception of Norfolk Island. A series of measures is therefore proposed in the bill before the House to increase public accountability and transparency. Not a few of them have been recommended by various inquiries for up to 20 years. You would have to say that the Commonwealth really bears far more responsibility than the Norfolk Island government for the failure to implement them. One understands that a government as small as the Norfolk Island government cannot have the resources to easily meet the rigorous requirements of modern administration in all respects; after all, much larger local governments on the mainland routinely rely on state governments to legislate much of the provision for the machinery of accountability. Nevertheless, it is unacceptable for any Australian jurisdiction to fail to meet even the most basic stansolidated dards in this respect. Credibility depends on it. Therefore, this bill proposes amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act which will confer a merits review jurisdiction on the AAT for decisions made under Norfolk Island legislation. These changes will be introduced in stages, in consultation with the Norfolk Island government. The bill proposes amendments to the Freedom of Information Act to apply the act to Norfolk Island in the same way that it applies to Commonwealth agencies. It provides for the assumption by the Commonwealth Ombudsman of the function of Norfolk Island Ombudsman under Norfolk Island legislation and it establishes the requirement that Norfolk Island public sector agencies adhere to information privacy principles in the same manner as Australian government agencies. Reform of Norfolk Island financial management and reporting was specifically recommended in the 2008 report by the Senate Select Committee on State Government Financial Management. The Norfolk Island government and administration commenced financial reporting according to international financial reporting standards for the first time only in 2008-09. Prior to that, it had used only local accounting principles. The bill before the House establishes a legislative financial framework in the Norfolk Island Act 1979 and provides for the details of this framework to be included in subordinate legislation. The details of the financial framework are being developed in consultation with a joint working group comprised of officers from the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the Attorney General's Department and the Norfolk Island administration and government. The proposed financial framework will bring territory authorities into Norfolk Island's confinancial statements, budgets and annual reports, providing a more complete picture of Norfolk Island's financial position. The framework will also introduce a statutory requirement for all financial statements, annual reports, audit reports and budgets to be tabled in the Norfolk Island legislative assembly. The framework will set minimum budget requirements, including the production of qualitative and quantitative statements. It may include comprehensive budget financial statements based on external reporting standards, including forward projections. Subject to consultation with Norfolk Island through the working group, requirements are also likely to include compliance with Australian accounting standards, which would mean that Norfolk Island was preparing financial reports on a basis consistent with Australian local governments, state governments and the Commonwealth government. In other words, these are extremely important provisions. Finally, there are some important acknowledgements. The staff at the Territories Division of the Attorney-General's Department of Australia have worked persistently and sometimes under considerable difficulty over a long while to bring resolution to the issues that we are dealing with today. I personally wish to acknowledge the Norfolk Island government but especially former Chief Minister Andre Nobbs, with whom I was in very frequent contact as Minister for Home Affairs before June last year. Andre always sought constructive solutions. I wish to express my particular admiration for the steadfast work of the Administrator of Norfolk Island, Mr Owen Walsh, who is so well supported by his wife, Bianca, a Pitcairner. I believe the island has been most fortunate to have a person of his competence and dedication to help it through the difficult negotiations of recent years. There is no doubt that those negotiations have sometimes been difficult. On the other hand, there is no doubt that there has remained a great deal of goodwill within the Australian parliament, on both sides of this House, to bring about a resolution of long-outstanding matters so far as the governance of Norfolk is concerned. I have great pleasure in commending the bill to the House.",101
174,Mr NEVILLE,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"It is no secret that I am a great admirer of, and have a great deal of respect for, the people of Norfolk Island. By playing to some extent the role of devil's advocate, I also take the view that a lot of the problems that have occurred on Norfolk Island with regard to governance have not all been the fault of the Norfolk Islanders and I think that we in Australia take a heavy share of that responsibility. I think that consultation could have been closer and perhaps we could have been more amenable to their views at earlier stages than now to have to come on with a bill of this magnitude and purpose. It certainly is an area with a great and culture, a culture that by its association, I suppose in the first instance, with Captain Bligh and the mutiny on the Bounty is interwoven with Australian history-though the development of Pitcairn Island, where the mutineers went to live, had nothing to do with Australia at that time. The island was granted to the Pitcairners by Queen Victoria in the 1850s when Pitcairn Island became overcrowded, and a new and vibrant culture based on their earlier culture and their Tahitian culture developed on Norfolk Island. As the shadow minister pointed out, they are people with their own language which they like to use at times. They have a way of doing things. They have cultural objectives and expectations and they guard those jealously. Some of those come to the edge of decision making and at times they will not always mesh exactly with Commonwealth expectations. You really have to ask yourself in those instances whether you want to approach this with a stick in one hand and a carrot in the other, or whether you will put both away and talk to these people as equals. My personal view is that Australia has over the years been too harsh in some matters, and I will outline that a little bit further in my address. The Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 before us has many good features about it. Noone is denying that. No-one should ever deny, as the member for Macquarie just pointed out, that throughout all the Australian jurisdictions over the last 20 or 30 years there have needed to be shake-ups. This is not unique to Norfolk Island; this is something that has occurred in all the states where various levels of maladministration, or indeed corruption, have taken place-though I am not suggesting corruption on Norfolk Island. I think that we have all recognised the need for more accountability. Also, there has been greater social develrich opment throughout the Commonwealth and, might I say, the Commonwealth of Nations, the OECD and the UN have adopted matters of respect. For example, we have looked to things like freedom of information, rights for women and all those sorts of things, and they have become enshrined in legislation throughout those groups of countries, and no less so in Australia. I am not comfortable with schedule 2 concerning matters being subject to veto. If an island has self-government, I think you need to recognise that and give some genuine control over matters, for example, gun laws. If the Commonwealth feels so strongly about gun laws, well, why wouldn't it ask the Norfolk Island people to remove that issue into a separate bill that parallels the Commonwealth law rather than using the blunt instrument of a veto? It is said that we want to get uniform laws on pornography. I do not think that you would have any trouble on Norfolk Island getting uniform laws on pornography. I think that probably if you were to ask for this to be implemented in legislation, the Norfolk Islanders would be perhaps less accommodating than some Australians are to some of the filth we see in the newsagencies and sex shops of Australia. To suggest in schedule 2 that by omission the Norfolk Islanders are potentially more prone to that, I think, is a insulting. So my first criticism would be that schedule 2 should not be subject to veto and there should be a willingness on both sides to consult and where things are necessary to meld with Commonwealth initiatives, let us have complementary legislation rather than the blunt instrument of veto. The removal from the Assembly is another matter that seems to occupy the minds of the current administration-and I might add at this point that with the election of the new government of Norfolk Island, I congratulate David Buffett. He is a long standing member. I think he was the first Chief Minister, as I recall, in the early days when limited self government was granted. I think he has an intention to have a closer relationship with Australia, but one based on respect, not on just being told all the time. I think the Governor General should have the right, as she does in the ACT, to dismiss the government. I agree that elections should be beyond reproach. I think the three years with a limit of four years is a sensible measure and that a vote of no confidence in the Chief Minister should be subject of an automatic action should it occur. However, when it gets down to financial arrangements, one in particular-the Commonwealth financial officer-is referred to in the bill but the exact functions of that officer are not clearly outlined. If the purpose of that is to give the administration of Norfolk Island a greater gravitas in the compiling of its accounts and budgets, and you have to recognise that when you only have 2,000 or so people on the island there is not going to be a lot of scope for getting various forensic accountants and the like-that is, for plucking them out of the community-that is perhaps not a bad measure. That should be subject, however, to a definition of the role of this person and this person being a consultabit tive and integral part of the administration rather than, if you like, a watchdog for the Commonwealth government. Were it the latter role, that would not be in the best spirit of cooperation. Certainly Norfolk Island should provide budgets and reports. But what I do not agree with is that, without reference to the Norfolk Island minister, the head of a department can be required to report to the Commonwealth minister. Surely that is not in the best spirit of federal government or of the Westminster system. The channel should always be the appropriate Norfolk Island minister. I can understand the pain this might cause the Norfolk Islanders and the administration in particular. It could be seen in doing this that the assembly is being circumvented in making its officers report first and foremost to Commonwealth instrumentalities rather than to their own elected and appointed ministers and then through them to the Commonwealth ministers. I think that needs to be clarified. As you are aware, the Norfolk Islanders have accepted the concept of the ombudsman. I think that is wise and commendable. That also goes for the role of the Auditor General on the island. When it comes to things like the Freedom of Information Act and privacy principles, I think you should allow the Norfolk Islanders to adapt what they need for a community of 2,000. Would you go out to a place like Gunnedah in western New South Wales or Roma in western Queensland and say, ‘We're going to apply all the principles of the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act as they are applied by the Commonwealth'? I think you have to give the Norfolk Island assembly the ability to texture those particular laws to the requirements of 2,000 people. Sure, on the mainland we have 22 million people. That is a totally different thing and you can understand why there should be some rigidity in the Commonwealth law. But, when you are applying it to 2,000 people, you do not want to make it so onerous and so heavy with paperwork that the people of the island lose faith or interest in the system. Another matter I have some concern with is the appointment of deputies. We have an Administrator who virtually exercises under the Governor General the powers of the state governor. Those powers are perhaps somewhat less, but essentially they are the powers of the governor. We have an official secretary on the island. I can understand why that official secretary should be the Deputy Administrator. But this bill allows for many more deputy administrators, and I think again that will start to water down the control of the island by the islanders. If you Commonwealth appointed deputies it becomes a little bit like Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers. You know: when everybody is somebody, nobody is anybody. You might have a system of succession where you could have the Administrator, the secretary as the first Deputy Administrator and perhaps another person. But to go beyond that I think could be quite ridiculous. Again, we are talking about 2,000 people. We need to treat them with respect, not with a lot of bureaucracy, paperwork and patronising control by the Commonwealth. The Norfolk Island act of 1979 allowed the Governor General through the Administrator to introduce into the assembly laws for peace, order and good government. I have no worry about that; that is for times of emergency. But this bill goes further, to allow nominated Commonwealth ministers to do that. Why would you want Commonwealth ministers introducing legislation into the Norfolk Island assembly? Sure, in an emergency situation the Governor General's authority through the Administrator can be exercised for peace, order and good government. But I would have thought that would have been sufficient. It should not be necessary that every Commonwealth minister that has a responsibility to Norfolk Island has the right to introduce bills into the assembly. Once you do that, again you are starting to water down the concept of self-government. I said I would speak briefly on another matter. Yes, we are the Commonwealth; yes, this is the parliament and we are responsible to a large extent for all Commonwealth matters that have come under the 1901 act and constitutional amendments to that act by way of referendum and international treaties that this country enters into through the United Nations. That sovereignty is not questioned in any way. It is exercised differently in the states because the 1901 Constitution defines have certain powers for those states. Subsequent bills for the Northern Territory and the ACT, perhaps not allowing for the same degree of flexibility, have allowed many of those laws. I think we should treat Norfolk Island, to the extent that we can, as the third territory of the Commonwealth. In doing that, there are not just rules and regulations but the Commonwealth authority, which we have seen exercised in bucketloads over recent months, of pouring Commonwealth moneys into all sorts of enterprises that were once the prerogative and responsibility of the states, not least of which is health. We have seen it also in roads. But when it comes to being applied to Norfolk Island we get this self-righteous standing on our digs and saying, ‘Oh no, it can't be done on Norfolk, they don't pay tax.' Sure, they do not pay income tax. That is probably why they survive as well as they do. They do have a form of goods and services tax and one might argue that perhaps a levy could be imposed on that for entry into Medicare. I certainly would support that, although I am not sure all the islanders would. Having said all that, the Norfolk Island Hospital, for example, while it is well run in the sense of the personnel who are involved in it and the loyalty it receives from its community, by construction standards would not be tolerated in a town in western Queensland or western New South Wales. The outer structure is not much removed from the fibro and chamferboard huts of the Second World War. As long as I have been on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories-and that must be getting on for 15 years now-we have never seriously attempted to do something about the Norfolk Island Hospital on the spurious ground that somehow because they do not pay tax they are not entitled to good health. We do not apply that principle anywhere else in the Commonwealth and we should not apply it on Norfolk Island. Every once in a while the airstrip has to upgraded-hot mixers being brought from Sydney or Auckland. Contractors bring barges and all the material over. I remember on one occasion one of the contractors offered for $1 million to do a lot of the roads on the island while he was still there, which made eminent sense. It is the sort of thing we would do if there was a major wash-out in floodtime somewhere on one of the highways in western Queensland, the Northern Territory or western New South Wales. We would go in and fix it. I think on occasions like this, when you have those sorts of facilities that are not normally available on the island, such as road construction abilities, we should be in there giving a hand. It is not just all thought on the part of the Norfolk Islanders and this great need for a lot of bureaucracy and paperwork. It is a matter of respect, and that respect should be reflected in the time we give to the detail, the schedules and the subordinate legislation. (Time expired)",106
175,Mr GRAY,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (6.41 pm)-I rise to speak in favour of the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010. This legislation will change the way Norfolk Island is governed. It will reform the Norfolk Island electoral system and put in place a financial management framework to make sure the government of Norfolk Island can plan for the future. Norfolk Island has a unique culture and an interesting history. It is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Most of them are Australian citizens. Norfolk Island is geographically 35 square kilometres. There are only three federal electorates-those of Wentworth, Grayndler and Gorton-that are smaller than Norfolk Island in geographical size. The island has spectacular beaches and a pristine environment. It is no surprise that tourism is the mainstay of the local economy. Norfolk Island has had self-government since the introduction of the Norfolk Island be Act by the Fraser government in 1979. It is the only self-governing Australian external territory. The island does not rely on Commonwealth funding; however, funding from the Commonwealth government does provide crucial assistance and support. It has to be said that in the recent past the island has been suffering financially. The global financial crisis has been particularly unkind to those places where tourism is the main source of economic activity. The Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 will make much needed changes to the Norfolk Island system of self-government. The amendments will provide major changes to the governance, electoral and financial systems of Norfolk Island. It is the duty of this House to strengthen the Norfolk Island system of government to benefit the residents. We must make sure that the Norfolk Island government is accountable to the community and residents have access to fundamental rights. Natural justice would require that this extend to the right of administrative appeal. So there are significant benefits for the people of Norfolk Island in this legislation. We will make sure the Norfolk Island government is accountable by extending the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Ombudsman Act 1967 and the Privacy Act 1988. The Norfolk Island reforms were first announced by the Australian government a year ago in May 2009. The House would be aware that the future of Norfolk Island has been the subject of many Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories reports, discussions and topic of widespread media reports. It is now time to act on those reports and recommendations. A joint standing committee suggests that the Norfolk Island system of governance be changed. The Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 will action some of the recommendations from the report of the 2003 inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories into governance on Norfolk Island. That report recommended Norfolk Island enacts the following democratic principles: greater public accountability through access to the Commonwealth Ombudsman; better regulatory framework of privacy arrangements; and a common-law approach to rights and entitlements. As it stands today, the Norfolk Island government has an informal means for good governance and, quite frankly, it is not enough when it comes to the fundamental rights and responsibilities of the Norfolk Island community. The report stated: … the absence of formal and effective mechanisms of accountability and transparency, seriously undermine the quality of governance on the Island. The report goes on to recommend reforms to the Norfolk Island electoral system; a better financial management framework, including audits; the introduction of administrative law such as in Australia; and the incorporation of designations of Chief Minister and ministers. I have been informed that the Norfolk Island government agrees that local residents should enjoy the same rights to personal privacy, access to the Ombudsman, appeal rights and freedom of information as mainland Australians. However the Norfolk Island government would argue that some of the processes that are connected to these basic rights are resource intensive and can be time consuming. It has been raised with me the that the government of Norfolk Island is concerned that it does not have the resources to implement these Australian models in their entirety. However, these reforms are essential and I am confident that any issues can be worked through appropriately by the Norfolk Island government and the Commonwealth government. I will now outline the reforms in more detail. Schedule 1 of the Territories Law Reform Bill will make significant changes to the Norfolk Island Act. Through changes to the general governance and electoral amendments, the bill will establish a no confidence motion process for the Chief Minister; put in place a proper process for selecting and dismissing ministers and chief ministers; permit the Administrator of Norfolk Island to access advice when presented with bills for assent under schedule 2; and, allow the Governor General and the minister responsible for the territories to take a more active role in the Norfolk Island legislation. The bill will also reform the voting system. By simplifying and modernising the electoral process, the bill will allow more Norfolk Island residents to participate in the democratic process. This will mean fewer people will drop out of the system. The Norfolk Island Chief Minister will enter into arrangements with the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct general elections. This will mean Norfolk Island residents will have an independent third party conduct their elections to ensure greater certainty and transparency. The integrity of the electoral process is at the heart of our political system and it is only right that Norfolk Island dents have access to the same safeguards as mainland Australians. That is democracy. It makes sense. Electors trust us to create a process which is as easy as possible. Complexity creates confusion. I am informed that the Norfolk Island government has some concerns over schedule 2 of the Territories Reform Bill 2010. I will outline some of their concerns. Today, the Norfolk Island system of governance means the Commonwealth appointed Administrator is bound to take the advice of the Executive Council to ensure local laws are passed quickly. The reforms will see the responsible Commonwealth minister seek and provide advice, and if any conflict arises the minister's advice will prevail. The Norfolk Island government is concerned the Commonwealth will be able to veto local solutions to local problems. It should be acknowledged that the Norfolk Island government are concerned about the implications of the bill on their ability to self-govern. The Commonwealth government's rationale is to put in place proper processes for responsible government. I encourage the Minister for Home Affairs to continue the conversation with the Norfolk Island government to allay their concerns. I will now move to the implementation of a financial management framework. Schedule 1 of the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 will establish a financial framework which is responsible and accountable. By ensuring there is proper process for financial management, the bill will help Norfolk Island to be financially sustainable into the future. The reform will include a process for annual reports, budgets and framework in line with the unique requirements of Norfolk Island. In line with my earlier comments, we will support Norfolk Island to achieve a responsible fiscal framework in line with Australian regulations. The reforms will provide resi- the Norfolk Island government with the mechanisms to conduct their general business with transparency. The bill will provide the Auditor-General with the power to conduct audits on the island's financial statements to maintain integrity within the island's financial system. Finally, the Territories Law Reform Bill will bring Norfolk Island in line with Australia's administrative law procedure. Essentially, Australian residents living on Norfolk Island will have the same rights and services available to them as if they were living in Australia. Part 4 of the bill will mean decisions made by the Norfolk Island government can be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Part 5 of the bill will amend the Freedom of Information Act. It will provide residents with the fundamental right to access documents held by the public sector and to ask for personal information if the information is incorrect or misleading. In addition, part 6 of the bill will mean the Commonwealth Ombudsman can act as the Norfolk Island Ombudsman and provide independent dispute resolution. As already mentioned, I understand that there has been a great deal of consultation with the Norfolk Island government to make sure the Ombudsman procedures will suit the island. It is absolutely essential that we get this right, and consultation with the Norfolk Island government will ensure this. Part 7 of the bill will amend the Privacy Act so that it applies to Norfolk Island in the same way that it applies to Australian government agencies in Australia. We will ensure that Australian government agencies play an ongoing role to educate and support the Norfolk Island community and public sector. The Territories Law Reform Bill will reform the way Norfolk Island is governed. I understand concern has been raised about the reforms hindering the island's ability to selfgovern. It is the opinion of the government that this bill will strengthen Norfolk Island's legislative ability to act as a sovereign island, by formalising its self-government practices. The bill will focus on transparency and accountability in Norfolk Island governance, establish financial frameworks and an administrative decision-making process. It is absolutely essential that the same rights to information and appeal apply to Australian residents living on Norfolk Island. The reforms will provide Norfolk Island with the tools to ensure ongoing stability and effective self-government under the Norfolk Island Act. These reforms are, quite simply, the right thing to do. These reforms will provide a legislative framework for the future growth and sustainability of Australian territories. I commend the bill to the House.",109
176,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to rise in the House this evening to speak about the issue of the relationship between the Commonwealth, the administration of the Territory of Norfolk Island and the Norfolk Island government. I have been in this place for just under 15 years and have been a constant member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories since election in 1996. Members in this place are probably aware that, through the unique electoral processes on that island, a number of Australian citizens on Norfolk Island are also constituents of mine as, through that mechanism, they are attached to the Canberra electorate. That has given me a long standing and reasonable understanding of the issues on Norfolk Island, the people who live there, the history of the place, the uniqueness of the place and the need for us all to work together to ensure that self government on Norfolk Island not only remains but is enhanced into the future. The Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 makes amendments to a range of Commonwealth legislation to improve Norfolk Island's governance arrangements, including through the reform of the electoral system. A new financial management framework is also proposed. The new governance arrangements are really quite important. We are applying on the island the electoral and administrative law practices that are generally applied in the mainland jurisdictions, albeit with some variations. The process for selecting a Chief Minister, providing for no-confidence motions and allowing a Commonwealth minister to provide advice to the Administrator are useful additions to the democratic processes on the island. The bill also clarifies certain aspects of the relationship between the Commonwealth and this external territory, the island, includthat ing the power of a Commonwealth minister to introduce a new bill into the legislative assembly, dismiss assembly members for unlawful or improper conduct and allow the Governor General to dissolve the assembly. A minimum three-year term is specified under the bill, with a maximum of four years. These are important safeguards to the process of democratic governance on Norfolk Island. The new financial framework provisions will apply the broad approaches of the Commonwealth and territories in terms of financial reporting. The role of the Commonwealth Auditor-General to investigate financial matters relating to the actions of the government is essential for transparency in government. On the whole, the transparency and fiscal affairs for which this bill and ciated regulations will provide bring the island into closer alignment with practice in other Australian jurisdictions and support democratic processes and accountability to the people of Norfolk Island and the Australian taxpayer, where federal funds are deployed. The application of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and freedom of information and privacy provisions to the island and the new role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman as the ombudsman of the island are also major improvements to the practice of governance on Norfolk Island. In fact, they are essential changes, giving Norfolk Island people the same basic rights under administrative law that all other Australians generally enjoy. As other speakers have said already, there is a certain level of apprehension in not all but some sectors of the community on Norfolk Island about some of these changes. I understand that and I respect that cautiousness. To talk about the question of privacy provisions for a moment, my understanding is under current legislation the Commonwealth Ombudsman can and does use those powers within the ACT, for example. Under the same legislation, Norfolk Island could have already passed legislation itself to bring that provision into action on Norfolk itself but has not done so. That has been available but it has not been done. I regret that reluctance on the part of Norfolk Island governments in the past, but the point is that we do not need to look back; we need to look forward. There is now every opportunity for the beginning of reform of governance on the island. Many people on Norfolk Island share our view and look forward to the reform as outlined. Over the years I have had many opportunities, both as a member of the committee and as a backbencher with responsibility for assothose on the island who are attached to my electoral roll, to visit Norfolk Island. I have said it in this place before, and it is always a pleasure to have the opportunity to say it again: it is the most remarkable place. It is so unique and special, and it carries so much history of its own, as well as history connected to the mainland. To anybody listening to this debate: if you have not had the opportunity to travel to Norfolk Island, I implore you to do so. You could not go to a more beautiful place. In saying that and in saying that I have had the opportunity and privilege to make many friends within that community over those years, there is also no doubt in my mind-with all of the reports that the joint committee has done over the years-that now really is the time to begin governance reform on Norfolk Island. That is not in any way to be seen as a challenge to its self governing role. As long as the conversation continues between those on Norfolk Island and people here within the government and within the parliament generally to work towards an outcome with which we can both be very content, nothing but improvement and better governance can occur. This bill will also improve keys aspects of public finances on the island. It brings the island closer to Australia on governance and accountability issues. In my view, this is probably not the beginning and end of reform of governance arrangements on Norfolk Island. There are many other things that we could consider as well. By saying that, I do not want to scare people on Norfolk Island or make them more apprehensive. I fully understand the level of apprehension in the minds of some-but not in the minds of all. I really want to see these reforms pass successfully. I really want to see the conversation between the Norfolk Island government and this government and parliament continue in an open and honest fashion. I would like to think that both sides of the eral parliament could agree to implement a properly formulated reform program for Norfolk Island, one that would effectively establish the island as a jurisdiction within which Australian citizens have the same access to law, to freedom of information and to a raft of governance arrangements that we here take for granted. Those things need to be brought into line on the island. A reform gram could involve various considerations for the future, but here and now we are looking at the bill before us and the proposals within that bill to begin that reform process. I thank the current Minister for Home Affairs for bringing this bill forward. I complikler. ment him, his officers and his officials on the discussions that have been held to date. I very sincerely thank those on the island with whom I have had discussions in the past and who are, I know, very keen and anxious to support this proposal and see it through. To those on the island with apprehensions: please remember this is not an assault on self-government. It is not intended to in any way erode self-government. It is, in fact, intended to enhance it, preserve it and guarantee it for the future. If that is the approach taken by everyone here and, I hope and trust, by everyone on Norfolk Island, then I know we are going to have a successful reform process. I commend the bill to the House.",112
177,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"in reply-I am very pleased to sum up the debate on the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010. I thank all the members for their contribution, in particular the member for Canberra, who has a special interest-as do many in her electorate-in many of the citizens who reside on Norfolk Island; the member for Brand; and the member for Macquarie. The member for Macquarie is fedalso my predecessor as Minister for Home Affairs and did a lot of the work to bring this bill to this place for realisation. I thank him for his good work in assisting the government with these very important reforms. I also thank the members for Stirling and Hinkler for their contributions to this debate. I will address some of the issues raised by members. I am aware that the Norfolk Island pro- government has concerns with this bill. I know so because I spoke with the Chief Minister when he was last in Canberra. I am also aware that these concerns, or some of these concerns, have been shared with members, including the members for Stirling and HinThe member for Stirling and the member for Hinkler have voiced the concern of the Norfolk Island government that this bill will erode Norfolk Island's ability to self-govern. This is not the case. The proposed amendments to the Norfolk Island Act 1979 do not restrict the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly's almost unlimited power to ‘make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory'. The right of the Australian government to intervene in Norfolk Island legislation is an existing part of the island's governance system. The amendments will extend this oversight to schedule 2 matters, as well as enabling the Commonwealth minister and the Governor General to introduce legislation into the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. The need for this amendment can be linked to the number of additional matters transferred to the Norfolk Island government's authority under schedule 2 since 1979. Many of the powers transferred are either not supported by legislation or are subject to inadequate legislation. The bill will enable the Australian government to carry out the checks and balances necessary to ensure that Norfolk Island legislation complies with Australian government policy objectives and Australia's obligations under international law. The member for Stirling and the member for Hinkler made remarks about the appointment of deputy administrators. On this matter, amendments allowing the minister to appoint the deputies of the Administrator of Norfolk Island are consistent with the power already provided to me as the responsible Commonwealth minister to appoint deputy administrators of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The amendments allow for flexible and timely appointments to be made in the event that the Administrator is unable to perform one or all of the functions of the office. This is particularly important due to the remoteness of Norfolk Island. The amendments will enable essential functions of government to be performed quickly and efficiently. I further note that the position of Deputy Administrator is not intended to be a position involving remuneration. The member for Stirling also expressed the concern of the Norfolk Island government about amendments authorising the appointment of a Commonwealth financial officer. The Commonwealth Financial Officer does not have any specific powers under the amendments proposed in the bill. The Commonwealth Financial Officer's functions are required to be flexible and adaptable, to enable the best possible assistance to be provided to the Norfolk Island government and administration in implementing the bill. On the issue of the Auditor-General's appointment, the Australian government has agreed to fund the Commonwealth Auditor General to provide financial statement audits for three years. Any further funding after this period will be subject to budget considerations. I note that the ACT and the Northern Territory have established their own auditors-general and do not receive funding for these positions. The member for Stirling and the member for Hinkler also raised the issue of Norfolk Island public servants reporting directly to Commonwealth ministers. None of the amendments proposed in the bill will affect the relationship between the Norfolk Island government and employees of the administration. In terms of the issue raised about the Administrator's role following the dissolution of the legislative assembly, amendments in the bill that provide for the Administrator to exercise certain powers in the event of the dissolution of the legislative assembly provide a practical and effective arrangement to ensure the continuity of business of government, including the provision of services to the Norfolk Island community. I note that the Administrator would be required to exercise these powers in accordance with any direction given by the Governor General. The member for Stirling and the member for Hinkler have argued that the approach taken in the administrative law reforms to extend Commonwealth administrative law to Norfolk Island is too complex and that Norfolk Island lacks the capacity to implement such reforms. Much has been made of the different approach which has been taken in relation to the ombudsman reforms. I agree that these reforms are a positive example of what can be achieved through cooperation between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island. However, the approach taken in the ombudsman reforms should be distinguished from the remaining administrative reforms for a number of key reasons: firstly, there was an existtake ing precedent for this approach as the Commonwealth Ombudsman already undertakes the role of ACT Ombudsman under ACT legislation; and, secondly, the Norfolk Island government introduced ombudsman legislation into the legislative assembly in 2009. The need for administrative law reform on Norfolk Island has been the subject of numerous parliamentary reports and recommendations since 1991. However, to date, the Norfolk Island government has failed to initiate any Norfolk Island legislation in the area of freedom of information or privacy. The approach taken in the bill is specifically designed to take into account the ongoing concerns raised by the Norfolk Island government about resourcing and capacity constraints on the island. The existing Commonwealth legislation is adaptable to Norfolk Island and is currently applied across Commonwealth agencies of varying sizes, including those equivalent to the size of the Norfolk Island administration. The extension of Commonwealth administrative law mechanisms will enable the Norfolk Island government and community to access the Commonwealth's expert knowledge, experience and resources. Funding has already been allocated to Commonwealth agencies to assist with the implementation of these reforms on Norfolk Island. The bill will ensure that the standards of administrative law enjoyed by Australians on the mainland are extended to Norfolk Islanders. I would like to reiterate that the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 implements important reforms to improve the governance of Norfolk Island and strengthen the accountability of the Norfolk Island government. The bill is not an attempt by the Commonwealth to remove the Norfolk Island government's ability to govern the territory, nor is it an opportunistic attempt by the Commonwealth to control of the territory. The bill is a first step towards ensuring high levels of transparency and accountability in Norfolk Island governance and financial management and administrative decision making. This is an important part of providing Norfolk Island with the tools necessary to ensure ongoing stability and to sustain strong and effective self-government pursuant to the Norfolk Island Act 1979. The Australian government recognises Norfolk Island self-government as sought and granted to the Norfolk Island community in 1979. The Norfolk Island Act provides mechanisms to allow a degree of Commonwealth oversight of the Norfolk Island legislative process. This bill will further extend this oversight by introducing provisions that reaffirm the Commonwealth's legislative authority. The Commonwealth authority is intended to be used as a last resort if the Norfolk Island government does not undertake action to ensure its legislation is consistent with the national interest and Australia's international obligations. Parts 1 and 2 of schedule 1 of the Territories Law Reform Bill make general governance and electoral amendments to the Norfolk Island Act. The bill proposes key governance reforms, including: prescribing a process for selecting and dismissing a Chief Minister and ministers, including a no confidence motion process; allowing the Norfolk Island Administrator to access a greater range of advice when presented with bills for assent under schedule 2 of the folk Island Act; and allowing the Governor General and the minister responsible for territories to take a more active role in the troduction and passage of Norfolk Island legislation. The bill also establishes the framework the reform of the voting system for the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. The amendments will provide Norfolk Island residents with greater transparency in electoral processes and certainty about when elections are held. The bill establishes the foundations for such a process, which will be supplemented by regulations to be developed in consultation with Norfolk Island. The bill will implement a new financial framework to ensure that the Norfolk Island administration and government are subject to a comparable level of scrutiny as the Commonwealth. The framework will assist the Norfolk Island government to meet the expectations of its community and to plan for the future. It will also enable the Commonwealth to track Norfolk Island's financial progress to facilitate the provision of approsultation priate assistance and oversight. The bill also amends administrative law legislation to strengthen the transparency and accountability of the Norfolk Island government and public sector. The amendments will extend the application of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988 to Norfolk Island. In addition, amendments to the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Norfolk Island Act will make the Commonwealth Ombudsman the ombudsman for Norfolk Island. These administrative law changes will ensure that Norfolk Island residents have access to the same rights enjoyed by other Australians. Finally, the bill will amend the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Nor- Islands Act 1955 to provide a vesting mechanism for powers and functions under Western Australian laws applied in the terriintories. This will ensure that powers under Western Australian laws applied in each territory are automatically vested in Western for Australian officers where an agreement with the Commonwealth exists for them to act in the territories. The automatic vesting mechanism will lead to increased efficiency under service delivery agreements by enabling WA officials to have faster access to newly created powers. It will also reduce the administrative burden of maintaining the delegations for Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, allowing resources to be applied to other valuable tasks. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has completed an inquiry into this bill and tabled its report on 11 May. The committee supports the general provisions of the bill and recommends that it be passed by the Senate. The committee made four other recommendations. The first is the continuation of conwith Norfolk Island in the development of regulations to support the bill. This process is already being undertaken through working groups established for that purpose. The second other recommendation is that the Commonwealth minimise delays in the scrutiny of Norfolk Island legislation as part of the assent process. The third other recommendation is that a review be undertaken of items in schedules 2 and 3 of the Norfolk Island Act. The government accepts these recommendations. The final recommendation of the committee is that the amendments relating to elections be removed from the bill and reintroduced in 2011 following consultation with the Norfolk Island government and community. Changes to Norfolk Island's electoral system have been recommended in a number of previous reports on Norfolk Island, including by the joint standing committee for the territories. While Norfolk Island has a degree of self-government, it is also part of Australia, and the Australian parliament retains ultimate responsibility for territory electoral matters. The proposed amendments recognise this Commonwealth responsibility. Under the commencement provisions of the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010, any electoral regulations will only take effect from the first meeting of the legislative assembly following the first general election after the bill receives royal assent, which is anticipated to be some time in 2013. Accordingly, the first election to be conducted under any new electoral voting system is expected to not occur until 2016. The other legislative amendments relating to elections in part 2 of the bill provide for a minimum term of three years and a maximum of four years for the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and enable the Norfolk Island government to make arrangements with the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct general elections or fill casual vacancies. Consultations undertaken by the Attorney-General's Department, in addition to submissions received by the committee inquiry, indicate a level of support from both the Norfolk Island government and community to these legislative changes. The Australian government acknowledges the concerns raised by the committee in formulating the recommendations. I believe that these concerns can be addressed through retaining the provisions in the bill. To address the committee's concerns, I will undertake not to introduce electoral regulations until after July 2011. The proposed timing will enable consultation with the Norfolk Island government and community and consideration of appropriate voting systems for Norfolk Island. I further propose committee the draft electoral regulations for their review and comment. This will introduce an additional measure of scrutiny to the regulations. Following my visit to Norfolk Island in December last year I stated: The Australian Government wants to ensure Norfolk Island's long-term sustainability and the effective delivery of government services to the Territory's residents. This bill allows the Australian government to assist the Norfolk Island government and community to create an equitable and sustainable future. These reforms represent the government's ongoing commitment to fulfilling its obligations to provide the legislative frameworks for the future growth and sustainability of Australia's territories. I thank the House for its support. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",114

182,Mr BILSON,BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"It is pleasing that we are in a position to discuss the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill 2010, and I am sure government members will talk to the bill and the more recent amendments to it that the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, Senator Wong, and the government have agreed to in response to constructive engagement by the opposition. On the strength of those amendments, we will be supporting this bill. Our reservations have largely been addressed, and I will touch on those in my remarks. The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill 2010 will require energy information to be provided to prospective purchasers, lessees and sublessees of commercial office space of 2,000 square metres or more. The bill will create a legal requirement for owners of large commercial buildings to obtain energy efficiency information for their building and provide this information to any prospective lessees and purchasers in the form of a building energy efficient certificate, BEEC. The BEEC will include energy efficiency star rating, information about lighting energy efficiency and generic guidance about how the building's energy efficiency may be improved. The government asserts that this information will assist parties to make a more informed decision and take ‘full account' of the economic costs and the environmental impacts associated with operating the buildings should they be purchased or leased. Essentially, this is an idea that is shared across the chamber. The coalition when in government, in December 2004, announced its commitment to mandatory disclosure of commercial building energy efficiency. That was contained in stage 1 of the implementation plan of the National Framework for Energy Efficiency. This was a joint initiative involving the Commonwealth, state and territory governments under the Ministerial Council on Energy. Subsequent to that coalition commitment, the Labor Party, in the guise of its pre-election policy ‘Clean energy plan to help tackle climate change', embraced the idea and also pledged funding towards the implementation of it. The commitment that the Labor Party made when in opposition, and now being carried forward by the Rudd Labor government, was to work with states and territories, the building industry and other stakeholders to: … require disclosure of energy or environmental ratings for appropriate types of large commercial buildings at point of sale and point of lease. Mandatory disclosure will be phased in gradually, beginning with office buildings above a threshold of 5,000 square metres. Since that time, the Rudd government has embraced the building energy efficiency disclosure idea and included it in its National Strategy on Energy Efficiency, which was agreed in July 2009, citing it as a ‘key plank' in its strategy to combat climate change, to reduce the costs of emissions abatement and to improve the productivity of the economy. There have been quite a number of announcements about the mandatory reporting scheme. Some stakeholder and industry groups noted a greater number of announcements than progress on the implementation of the scheme. But, thankfully, we are here today to discuss some meaningful progress on this idea that is shared across the chamber and which the opposition has been engaged with for some years. The consultation that has brought us to this point has been patchy-pleasingly, more engaging of lateand has taken advantage of the industry's collaborative posture and the collaborative attitude and willingness to engage of the coalition. Some things have changed in this bill-in fact, some things have changed since the original commitment. The idea that there would be a commencement with commercial office buildings over 5,000 square metres has been replaced by a commitment for mandatory reporting, starting with commercial office buildings over 2,000 square metresquite a significant change but one that I am advised was inspired by the threat of some state and territory governments that, if the Commonwealth was not going to embrace a 2,000 square metre threshold, they might go off on their own. As a consequence, the government embraced that through the COAG process. It is quite an important opportunity. The built environment in Australia accounts for 23 per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions. In the area of commercial buildings there are quite a significant number of opportunities, many of them at very low cost or in some cases a positive economic cost over the life of the investment that need to be embraced if we are to have a cleaner growth economy in Australia. There has been a substantial growth in energy use over the last 15 or so years and about 87 per cent growth between 1990-91 and 2005-06 in the commercial building sector. With increasing working hours and the greater use of energyconsuming technology in the office place, you tend to think that this increase will continue. Cost efficient energy improvements and emission reductions are available. It is pleasing that leading companies in the property industry have really taken to those opportunities wholeheartedly and have made them quite a cause for their investments, recognising that, whether it be for market positioning-being able to present their commercial buildings in an appealing way to potential tenants and investors-whether it be in operational cost savings, whether it be in corporate reporting and a need to find demonstrable sustainability and environmental outcomes or whether it be in a drive to have building quality recognised, all of these have combined to see quite an amount of voluntary effort, particularly by leading players in the property industry. Mandatory reporting is recognised as a way of seeing that commitment that is already there amongst industry leaders cascade its way right throughout the commercial building sector, and that is why there is a sense of shared purpose across the chamber for that initiative. It is also important in suring that reliable, actionable information is available to the market about building performance. This would not only make better decisions in acquisition and leasing but also drive further improvements across existing stock in the commercial building sector. It is important, though, that we do look at the commercial building sector. Many have talked about the opportunities for new buildings, but I am advised that only about two per cent of the commercial building stock is turned over in any year. That is likely to slow somewhat with access to finance being a challenge. All of those factors combine to say that just improving our game as a nation on new commercial buildings is not enough; there is a need to do significant work for the existing building stock if we are to secure the gains of emissions abatement and energy efficiency that are there for the taking-and mandatory reporting should inform and inspire that effort. Industry groups, including the Property Council, the Green Building Council, the Energy Efficiency Council and others that are practitioners in the engineering, air and temperature management section of the economy, have been keen to highlight what they have already achieved and are of one voice in pursuing the objectives of the bill. There is a broad acceptance within the property industry of this bill's objectives and of the benefits of mandatory reporting. That has not been the issue. That has certainly not been the focus of the coalition's work, because we have agreement across the chamber and broadly in the Australian economy there. What was requiring work in recent weeks was to make sure that those objectives and that goal were successfully pursued by the design of this bill and the operationalising of the idea through the tools that this bill provides for. That has been the focus, and that is enwhere it is pleasing that the government has taken on board constructive comments and, in some cases, concerns about specific aspects of the bill. Those specific concerns had been the focus of not only the coalition's consultations but also submissions to the Senate inquiry-and I again congratulate Minister Wong on constructively responding to those concerns. I touched earlier on the expanded scope of the bill-the net lettable area being greater than 2,000 square metres, compared to the 5,000 square metres that was originally committed to in Labor's election policyand indicated that, in the spirit of moving forward across the Commonwealth, states and territories, as a single COAG inspired effort, that change was made. There is also a need to recognise that that will drive this reporting requirement down further into the property industry, imposing a mandatory reporting burden on second-tier and smaller property owners and that that should not be just brushed aside as not significant. This will represent some new challenges for those second-tier and smaller property owners, and that has also been a focus of the coalition's constructive engagement with the government. The Property Council estimates that, of the more than 21 million square metres of floor space in the 3,980 commercial office properties in the major Australian population centres, 19 million square metres is accounted for by the 2,170 buildings with the net lettable area over 2,000 square metres. This represents an 84 per cent increase in the number of buildings that will be captured by this mandatory reporting scheme via the reduction in the floor area that triggers responfor sibilities and obligations under the scheme. There are 1,074 buildings of a net lettable area greater than 5,000-and I touched on the fact that, by reducing the trigger point 2,000 square metres, that 1,074 buildings captured balloons out to 3,980. There is also an issue around where responsibility lies in relation to the reporting that is being required under this bill. A number of the issues, particularly internal energy use and even behaviour of tenants, may have an impact on the reporting obligations in a way that are outside the control of the property owner. This needs to be recognised as these tools are further developed to make sure that responsibilities, obligations and penalties for non-compliance actually land with the people best placed to accommodate those responsibilities, and not have building owners, for instance, responsible and fearing penalties for non-compliance on actions, behaviours and information not within their control. This has been another area that we have engaged with the government on-the risk being a lack of cooperation about access to tenant data may expose property owners to the risk of severe penalties for non-compliance. I would hate to think that property owners would need to muscle up against their tenants simply to avoid a risk of alty under this bill. I am hopeful that, as the detailed regulations develop, those kinds of concerns are addressed further. There is also some issue around the technical and evaluation tools. Whilst the bill does not prescribe the tools that are to be used, the regulatory impact statement and the explanatory memorandum make it quite clear that the NABER system will be used as the build evaluation tool. The NABERS tool is a proprietary tool originally developed from the impetus of the Commonwealth and then licensed to the New South Wales government development in conjunction with industry, principally designed for New South Wales conditions. Adaptations have enabled its national use but the industry and the coato lition-and, I also believe, the governmentare aware that those adaptations for national use are in some areas contentious or contested. There are known deficiencies that result from the way in which the tool has been adapted to have its reach expanded beyond New South Wales that actually see the same building rated differently depending on where it is in the continent and that can give rise to some concern about the reliability of the tool. The government has undertaken to address these flaws. There is still a little bit of work to be done there. I have been encouraged and satisfied by the minister's advice to me active work is being done and that those technical deficiencies are well in hand and will be resolved before the October start date of the responsibilities under this tool. Another area that the coalition was focused on was that, if this tool and this bill are about providing reliable, actionable information to the marketplace, there are a range of market recognised tools that achieve that goal. The bill does not necessarily provide for those other tools. It does not expressly prohibit them, either, but the explanatory a pen- memorandum and the regulatory impact statement make it clear that there is a strong commitment to the further development of NABERS and that these other tools, whilst they are recognised as being available, are not at the moment embraced by the proposition before the parliament. I raise that for a number of reasons. The idea of our commercial buildings being energy efficient and making the contribution that they can to emissions abatement involves a number of stages and a number of different players. Our architects and the design professions can create and craft a building in its physical form that is efficient in use of solar energy and in the way in which it retains heat and manages the air and the working environment. They might design a fantastic building. In almost all cases the building will be constructed magnificently, with the professionals and the tradesmen in Australia, but that is another stage. It then may well be equipped with the most energy efficient, emissions-conscious technology for heating and cooling, for the circulation of air, and for powering plant and equipment in the building-lifts and the like. The buildings might well be designed magnificently, and that would be a tick, but if they are not deployed in keeping with their technical capability then you lose that opportunity of improved energy efficiency and emissions abatement. The way in which the buildings are commissioned is important. I am constantly reminded by professionals and companies in the air management-heating and coolingspace that some of the best technology not commissioned well and not operated well can see gains in energy efficiency and emissions abatement just disappear very quickly. So I am highlighting to the parliament all these various stages of the life of a building-its conception, its design, its construction, the way it is fitted out and then the way in which it is commissioned and managed. These all make a contribution, and we need to be looking to the future to make sure that the mandatory reporting tools and the instruments we bring to this task recognise that development. NABERS, I am told, will be more interested in that down the track. Other tools are already some way down the track, and there are international undertakings to try to make sure that these various tools, all committed to the same objective, can actually be compared with each other-a tool exchange rate, so that if you happen to know what ratings you have for a building with the one set of instruments, you know what that is equivalent to for others. These are all challenges for the future, and we were keen not to see that continuous improvement frozen out through being religiously attached to a single set of metrics that might not be developing as fast as other tools that are available and used both here in Australia and overseas. On this issue of equivalent tools, I am satisfied by the discussions and briefings with the minister's office that they are not frozen out. They are not expressly embraced either, at this stage, but that is something that more work will need to go into over time. The other contentious area relates to the lighting tool. We have talked briefly about reporting on the building form itself and what might be involved there. One of the tenancy issues and the use issues around the building is the lighting systems that are in place. This is a new development for NABERS. The tool for assessing building lighting has not been finalised to this day and is likely to require some further road testing. It is being trialled at present. There is some work still to be done on understanding the way the assessment process will operate. Assessors will need to be recruited, trained, accredited and available. This is an area of concern to industry and to key stakeholders in terms of how we will be able to operationalise this tool that is still under development. Again, I have taken the assurances that have been given to the coalition by the minister and by those involved in testing this new tool that it is developing well. I am also pleased that the minister has deferred the introduction of that tool by 12 months to recognise that it is still a work in progress. I think is sensible, and I think the minister is wise to go down that pathway-not to remove it entirely, but to make it clear to the building industry that while this is on its way it is not quite right yet. To have some of the obligations that would flow from this bill attached to a tool that is still in development was thought to be a little bit reckless and perhaps a sign that the government is red-hot keen to get something in place, no doubt so that it can refer to it in an electoral context as an achievement. Recognising that political motive of the government, if it is not quite right then it would be wrong to impose mandatory obligations and a risk of quite significant penalties for non-compliance. Among the other issues that we touched on was that there was some anxiety about whether everything would be ready to go by October. People are still keen to see the flaws in the NABERS tool resolved. The minister's advice gives me some reassurance, and I quote: NABERS energy certificates currently contain both the star rating of the building and informasame, tion about its greenhouse gas emissions. However, emissions are calculated using emissions factors which are now out of date. So the minister and the department recognise that. I am pleased to report that at the last meeting of the NABERS National Steering Committee it was agreed that up-to-date emissions factors should be used prior to the commencement of the commercial building disclosure scheme. Emissions are to be calculated using the same scope 1 and scope 2 emissions factors used under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Systemor NGERS, for people who are involved in this space-which will ensure consistency, noting that the scope of NGERS is broader than simply the base building emissions that will be reported on NABERS energy certificates. That is encouraging, and I am told by that all the technical experts that bringing those factors up to date is not an enormous task. Here is a clear commitment to do so. Another area around the NABERS energy benchmark is the unusual presence of a different average performance basis for Victoria compared with other states. NABERS energy benchmarks the performance of buildings on a scale of one to five stars, where 2½ stars represent the average performance of buildings within most states and territories. In Victoria, the average performance has been set at two stars, which means that generally buildings obtain lower NABERS energy ratings in that state. This particularly affects ratings at the lower end of the benchmarking scale. Setting the average at that level was a decision made by the Victorian government in 2000 after consultation with industry, although there is not necessarily a shared view within industry that it is appropriate; there is some mixture of opinion there. The discussions still continue. The simple point I make here is that whilst it might mean that like-forlike buildings in Victoria may be rated the if you have a portfolio of buildingsperhaps in different states and territoriesthe Victorian building will look less attractive under this arrangement than if that same building were in, say, Adelaide. This strikes me as an interesting message to send the market when this is all about reliable, dependable, actionable information. We have that anomaly, and that is something that I believe is still subject to discussions in which Victoria will need to take the lead after consultation with the local industry. That will not be resolved overnight, but it is an area that requires some attention. The other issues we touched on included the fact that there are a number of related programs that the Commonwealth has committed to, many of which were started under the previous government, using different data collection and reporting requirements. We were mindful of the red tape and compliance obligations and were keen to see how we could streamline and harmonise that data collection effort so there were not multiple efforts going on, ostensibly to achieve the same goal but through different government programs. That did not seem a smart way to go and that is an issue before the government. There are some encouraging signs that, where there is compatibility of process, it is being picked up by the government and I think that is a smart way to go as well. There were issues around the availability of credited assessors. This became very topical because, under the original transition rangements that the government had foreshadowed in the initial bill it brought to the parliament, you actually needed to have a certain kind of NABERS rating to begin with to qualify for the transition period. There been some recognition that that was going to put enormous pressure on the industry in a short period of time. The transition period has been altered to be more accommodating. I think that is a smart and practical response to a legitimate concern from the industry. The Property Council of Australia raised concerns through the Senate, as did the Green Building Council of Australia, Lend Lease and the Energy Efficiency Council. The coalition has combined those concerns with those from industry practitioners like Napier and Blakeley and brought them to the government's attention. Those organisations are clearly committed to this idea but recognised the government's bill was underdone in a number of areas and that further consultation was justified. The government has done that and the changes the minister foreshadowed in her speech to the Built Environment Meets Parliament Conference last week are welcomed by the opposition. We are pleased that the technical flaws in NABERS will be remedied and that the capacity building task in making sure appropriate assessors are accredited et cetera can be accommodated through an extended transition period. We think that is wise. The opportunities to link administrative effort reporting and data collection are, we think, good steps. Equivalents tools, as I said earlier, are not frozen out but are not mandated either. It is an area that still requires some work but the coalition is not going to stand in the way of this. The deferral of the lighting tool by 12 months is a smart move given that it is still work in progress. There is also the issue around making sure that the people adminisar- tering the schemes are appropriately qualified to do so. These amendments are welcome. The coalition supports the bill in its amended form. We note that a number of the issues we have has raised have been dealt with by assurances from the government. I found my discussions with Minister Wong's office to be completely honourable and we accept that those concerns will be dealt with. Change to the penalty regime is a smart way to go. We still have to make sure that penalties do not arise from actions of third parties, that is, that a bureaucratic delay does place a respondent at risk of being penalised. As I illustrated earlier, where a tenant might not or choose not to facilitate the access that is required to achieve the reporting requirements, it would be a great shame and very disappointing to see building owners penalised not from their own inaction but from actions of others. The transition period is good. There is a need to make sure that the lighting tool works and there is time for that. I would urge the government to be engaging in their consultation. Finally, I thank the Property Council, the Green Building Council, the Energy Efficiency Council and other energy efficiency organisations for their engagement with me and with the coalition. I am pleased that the government has recognised that we have aimed to be quite constructive throughout the process. The assurances are taken at face value. I have tried to read a number of them into the record tonight so that the industry and stakeholder concerns can at least see that they are also assurances that we have been given. I support the bill and urge the industry to embrace it in the spirit within which it has been developed. We need to keep working together to make sure emissions reductions and energy efficiencies in the built environment are achieved. The government has signalled a desire to extend the reporting requirement to shopping centres. Let us move forward in a thoughtful way as stakeholders have some views about that. We need to make sure that that next step builds on the solid progress of these current commitments and is a wise way to go. I urge the bill's early passage both in this chamber and also in the Senate.",119
183,Mr CHAMPION,BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"I rise to support the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill 2010. It is great to hear that this bill has bipartisan support and will get a speedy passage through this chamber and, hopefully, through the other place. This bill addresses two main problems that affect the commercial market. Firstly there is a market failure in this area because at the moment energy efficiency is not valued in a coherent way by the market. You only have to look at the building you work in, including this magnificent building, to know that often energy efficiency has not been valued in the past. That is one of the reasons this bill has come before the House. Secondly, because energy efficiency is not valued by the market, buildings are often designed to be grossly inefficient and this designing locks in high carbon emission for the operational life of a building, and forces tenants and the broader community to wear the long-term costs of those designs. It is all very well to tell people to switch off their lights and other things but unless a building is designed to be efficient, unless those things are built in at that very early stage, often the actions of individuals are made very small. If energy efficiency is implicit in the design then individual actions have a much greater effect. The commercial building sector currently accounts for 10 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions. It is a very significant proportion of our emissions. The strategic importance of targeting commercial buildings is highlighted by the fact that energy efficiency represents one of the fastest and cheapest ways to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Just think about it: there is residential energy use and emissions from driving a car to work, but a big factor is the building you work in-turning on the lights, using the conveniences, heating and cooling the building all have a very big effect on an individual's greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the National Framework for Energy Efficiency, the bill before the House will require large-scale commercial buildings covering 2,000 square meters or more to display information regarding the buildings energy efficiency. A building energy efficiency certificate, BEEC, will be required when a commercial office space is advertised for sale, lease or sublease. The disclosure will include three main components: a national Australian built environment rating system, NABER, star rating-and these are used at present; an assessment of the energy efficiency of the lighting; and generic advice on how energy efficiency may be improved. This disclosure is aimed at countering the current market inefficiencies that are preventing the implementation of economically feasible energy efficiency improvements by commercial building owners. Just the simple act of providing this knowledge will arm tenants and owners with some information about how they might improve things, and how they impact on Australia's emissions overall. These inefficiencies include an asymmetry of information between building owners and potential buyers. Potential buyers currently do not have access to adequate energy efficiency performance information. This is due to the fact that the energy efficiency of a commercial building is not immediately observable. Potential buyers or tenants generally use a comparison between design qualities to establish differences in the energy efficiency of particular buildings. However, there is often no substantial correlation between good design features and energy efficiency performance. This results in a building's energy efficiency having little, if any influence, upon a buyer's or a tenant's decision to invest. Referred to as ‘adverse selection', buyers and tenants are not able to differentiate between building of high energy efficiency and low energy efficiency. It basically results in ers of commercial buildings having no financial incentive to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings. This process produces, at the moment, sub-optimal market outcomes and an under-utilisation of valuable resources. So this measure will provide information to incentivise improvements. This bill aims to put an end to this vicious cycle, which currently promotes energy inefficiencies, by rectifying these market failures and making sure that in the future there is a real incentive to make all buildings efficient. one star. The BEECs will result in potential buyers or tenants directly benefiting through an ability to choose a premise with a higher energy efficiency rating over one with a lower efficiency rating. These benefits will be in the form of considerable savings to individuals who choose to occupy energy efficient premises. There are many businesses out there that seek to market themselves in this way; they have a social conscience or corporate responsibility. It is a very big thing now. Not only do they aim to save money but they aim to communicate to the community their values. The other day I saw a truck which had ‘carbon free transport' emblazoned right across the truck. Obviously that is designed to market their product to consumers who are concerned about our emissions. The indirect benefits of this bill will arise through voluntary energy efficiency improvements of commercial building owners and the subsequent greenhouse gas reduction that these improvements will produce. The brutal reality is that the more well informed the marketplace the better the performance of businesses. This bill will reward current market leaders and encourage more attention to energy efficient opportunities. This can be the aca tions of individuals switching off lights and heating systems when the building is unocowncupied. Some improvements have been made to this building: removing the permanent heating of hot water in members' offices and encouraging us all to use kettles. Things like that do have an effect. It will also involve more complicated and sophisticated methods of building management. The benefits of this scheme will outweigh the costs if just 3.9 per cent of sale and lease transactions result in the disclosed information of commercial buildings being used to purchase or lease office space that is more energy efficient by There is a substantial amount of work to be done if Australia is to reduce its greenhouse emissions, and this bill demonstrates our commitment to action on climate change. It also represents our ability to deliver on election promises. Energy efficiency is a big part of the overall task and this bill is an important step towards preparing the commercial building market for a low carbon future and a stronger and more environmentally friendly posture. I congratulate the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water for the introduction of this bill and I commend it to the House.",126
184,Mrs MOYLAN,BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill 2010. From time to time. I have engaged with people in the property industry, the peak organisations and, indeed, local government to encourage them to move towards sustainable developments. It makes good sense as it will make a real contribution to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in this country and it also makes good commercial sense to conserve energy. I was Chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for nine years. I think that committee made a very solid contribution by quizzing agencies with major projects on behalf of the government to ensure that they had engaged with the Greenhouse Office to develop energy efficient buildings. It is really important that the government always takes the lead in these matters. Luigi Di Serio is an urban planner who maintains a highly visited webpage on skylines of the world. In the introduction on his site he very eloquently describes the central role of cities. He says: The downtown core of big cities across the world, are the cultural pulse and economic engines of urban regions where millions of people live. The skyline is the fingerprint of that city. All urban life begins each day and ends each night under the watch of the city's tallest skyscrapers and most grand architectural structures. City skyscrapers are often only viewed though the prism of being marvellous feats of engineering and aesthetics. As beautiful as they are, each building's primary purpose is functional-that is, to provide the space where commerce and industry can thrive. The Property Council of Australia estimates that there are more than 21 million square metres of floor space in 3,980 commercial office properties in major population centres around Australia-that is, approximately one square metre of office space for each person in Australia. In Perth alone there are over 1.3 million square metres of commercial office space and more than 100,000 people travel Monday to Friday into the CBD to utilise that space. As the focus of economic life, it should not come as a surprise that energy used by commercial buildings accounts for approximately 10 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions and that emissions from the commercial building sector are growing by three to four per cent each year. From these figures, it is quite apparent that reducing the environmental footprint of commercial buildings is an important element in any strategy to lower Australia's emissions. Moreover, promoting energy efficiency is commercially sensible, with large cost savings to be recognised through simple measures such as having more energy efficient air-conditioning and lighting, installing insulation, recycling water and making greater use of renewable energy sources. The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill will require information about the energy efficiency, including lighting, of office areas greater than 2,000 square metres to be disclosed at the point of sale, lease and sublease. At present, there are 2,170 buildings in Australian major centres with lettable areas over 2,000 square metres. Disclosure will take the form of building energy efficiency certificates, which will show star ratings. The star rating must be disclosed in any advertisement for sale, lease or sublease and shall be accessible in an online database. The intention is to promote greater consideration of energy efficiency and empower the market with information to encourage more energy efficient improvements. The origins of the bill were initiatives by the former coalition government. In December 2004 the National Framework for Energy Efficiency was agreed to. A key element of stage 1 under the plan was a nationally consistent legislated regime for mandatory disclosure of energy performance of commercial buildings by the end of 2007. The change of government at the federal level appears to have delayed the bill coming before the House, but this very welcome measure is better late than never. There are, however, issues that the government must address to ensure that building energy efficiency certificates accurately represent a building's efficiency. Proposed section 21 of the legislation does not specifically prescribe the method of assessment; instead, it delegates that authority to the retary of the department. The explanatory memorandum to the bill assumes the National Australian Built Environment Rating System-otherwise known as NABERSwill be utilised; however, NABERS does not currently provide a nationally consistent star rating. To achieve the top five-star rating the building must well exceed the industry average for energy efficiency. A rating of one star is below that average, but to determine the industry average NABERS bases its algorithms on the now superseded Australian greenhouse rating system, which varied state to state. The methodology means that the industry average benchmark could be 2.5 stars in New South Wales but three stars in Victoria and two stars in Queensland. The result is confusion when you compare star ratings across the states. A three-star rated building in Queensland-signifying higher than average energy efficiency for that state-would equate to an average rating in Victoria. In submissions to the Senate inquiry on this bill, Peter Verwer, the CEO of the Property Council of Australia, raised the star disparity as potentially confusing to investors. He made the point: While this flaw might be overlooked if investors only compared homogenous markets, the reality is that multiple geographical markets are often considered before investment decisions are made. Investors seek out energy-efficient buildings as they are cost-effective to run and maximise potential returns. As environmental and investment considerations are in synergy, it is beneficial to those selling interests in buildings to maximise their star rating against both their domestic and interstate peers. Achieving clarity across borders will ensure no undeserved geographic advantage and will further promote energy-efficient secpractices in the battle to win investor funds. NABERS is currently under review because of the star disparity across state and territory borders and, as a consequence, concern has arisen that this House is being asked to endorse a bill that envisages using an as yet unrefined system. That being said, delaying this bill in search of the perfect system might in fact give us less impetus to quickly and correctly update the NABERS system. What is certain, however, is that the government yet again has not lived up to its promises. The government promised that the flaws would be addressed to prior to mandating the systems used, and clearly that has not occurred. Industry supports the NABERS methodology, though, and has been the driving force in promoting meaningful change. Since its first iteration, the measure has fundamentally transformed, adopting many industry suggestions. Tenancy and base building efficiency have been separated into different rating components, and waste, water and indoor environment are all individually measurable. From fierce industry opposition of the originally unworkable management system, NABERS is now accepted as the industry standard. I can only say that this shows the value of working closely with industry in order to get the legislation we passed on this place right, to make the necessary changes to make it workable. As I said, the industry has strongly supported the NABERS methodology and has worked constructively to try and promote meaningful change. Matthew Clark, the manager of NABERS in the New South Wales Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water, estimates that 50 per cent of all Australian CBDs have a NABERS rating. That equates to 10.5 million square meters of rated commercial space in more than 1,000 buildings. is now possible for anyone, including office managers, to easily rate their tenancy efficiency free of charge using the example application on the NABERS website. The method of measurement could also easily apply to hotels, shopping centres, schools and hospitals, and I think many of us hope to see the focus on energy efficiency extend across all building types. That certainly would be my wish-including for residential buildings. As I said, this not only makes sense in terms of reducing our carbon footprint but makes good economic sense both for householders and for commercial, industrial and public building owners and builders. The most important aspect of NABERS is that it sets an above-average stretch target, where building owners can aim to outperform their peers, playing on the competitive nature of the market. As commercial buildings across Australia spend approximately $4 billion on energy each year, the potential for economic and environmental benefits are vast. The stretch target is already proving successful, with most tenants who re-rate their buildings achieving an average of 13 per cent improvement. Across the industry, that has resulted in 200,000 tonnes of carbon savings a year, and a $520 million financial saving. For tenants, the greatest carbon and financial savings can be achieved through efficient lights and tenant lighting management. The building energy efficiency certificate proposed under this bill specifically singles out lighting for scrutiny, which is a welcome focus. But, worryingly, little headway appears to have been made on developing a cost-efficient lighting assessment process. In testimony to the Senate inquiry on this bill, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency commented: Finalisation of the tenancy lighting assessment, including on-site testing, is due to be completed In fact, it in May [2010]which date has passedTraining is scheduled to be provided from July [2010]. This allows sufficient time for tenancy lighting assessments to be carried out prior to the commencement date of disclosure obligations (anticipated to be around October 2010). But now, in June, the lighting assessment tool still remains to be finalised. The window for industry to be ready is quickly closing and it is unfair for the government, which is dragging its heels working out the assessment tool, to expect industry to work by the rigid time frame. The government must act quickly, in consultation with business and to their satisfaction, to remedy this situation or delay the commencement of the lighting tool. The NABERS assessment can currently assess tenancy energy consumption based on electricity bills, of which lighting is the predominant factor. Cumbersome floor-by-floor lighting audits can be undertaken as well, although such audits are costly exercises. This shows that the capacity to measure lighting efficiency does exist. It is now just a matter of the government transferring practice into an industry tailored software calculator. The benefits from simple lighting changes are exemplified by the WA government owned Dumas House in Western Australia. A full lighting upgrade was undertaken across the 14 floors, replacing outdated florescent lamps and adding timers to control lights. The project cost $130,000 but has reduced electricity use by 510,000 kilowatts, equating to $63,000 per year, in energy savings on lighting alone. After only two years, the initial capital outlay was fully regained-again, very impressive figures. Another example is Perth's tallest building, Central Park. In 2001, the building received a base rating of 4.5 stars, but the whole of building was rated at 3.5. Commenting on the disparity, Shaun Arseven from property manager Jones Lang LaSalle noted: This shows that the tenants' light and energy consumption in this building has potential for savings so we will now concentrate on achieving significant reductions in these areas … Central Park now boasts a five-star base rating, with 21 per cent of energy being drawn from renewable energy sources. Direct action to maximise building energy efficiency has proven to be, and will continue as, an effective method of reducing carbon emissions and costs to business. As previous chair, as I said, of the Public Works Committee, this policy was put into practice. For every government building and major infrastructure work scrutinised, the committee asked proposing agencies to develop the buildings in the most efficient way, including conserving and utilising water more wisely. One 14-storey building constructed as a departmental headquarters utilised the surface area of the roof as a water catchment facility and built in an underground storage tank, on top of incorporating the most up-to-date energy saving measures at the time. Such forward thinking should drive our approach to building design. Analysis conducted in 2004 as part of the National Framework for Energy Efficiency and reported in the previous coalition government's forward-thinking white paper Securing Australia's energy future identified substantial areas where commercial energy efficiency opportunities were not being taken up. It found that significant proposals with payback opportunities of four years or less existed across the commercial, residential and industrial sectors-not including the transport sector-but were not taken up. The analysis estimated that, if only half of the gains were implemented, it would increase GDP by approximately $975 million a year once fully implemented. With this analysis in mind, I reiterate to the House words I spoke last year. Promoting energy efficiency to the maximum makes good sense all around: it reduces costs, boosts the economy, conserves finite resources and reduces emissions. In closing, I shall refer again to the words of Luigi Di Serio, the creator of the ‘Skylines of the World' website. In ranking Perth at No. 39, he comments: Perth has been leading Australia in population growth for several decades now. Just a few decades ago this city was nothing more than a large town. With numerous nightlife spots, Perth is now a major business and tourism centre having more 5 star hotel rooms per capita than any other large city in the Oceanic continent. Perth is a tourism hot spot with a great nightlife. As the city so does its skyline. To indulge Luigi's thoughts, I would say that as the skyline grows so will the necessity of energy efficiency. This bill is a welcome move to support that aim, and I am very pleased that Minister Wong, the minister responsible in that other chamber, has addressed some of the concerns raised by the coalition and by the member for Dunkley, as the shadow minister, to ensure that this bill is made much more workable than it otherwise would have been. As I said before, it is important to stress in this place that we need to have close consultation with industry in order to get the settings right in our legislation and our regulation. We have seen the terrible mess that occurs when this does not take place. In the operation of any new laws, we have to make sure that they are workable and practicable and that they can be put into place in order to achieve the aims that are set out. Together the coalition and the government, and indeed the industry input, have made this legislation more workable than it otherwise would have been. I commend the bill to the House.",128
185,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill 2010 will create a legal requirement for owners of large commercial office buildings to obtain energy efficiency information for their building and to disclose it to prospective purchasers and lessees. It will also require head tenants who are subletting office space to disclose this information. The bill follows on from a landmark agreement to expand and accelerate energy efficiency efforts through a National Strategy on Energy Efficiency released by Australian, state and territory governments in July 2009 which outlined the following four key themes. The first was assisting households and businesses to transition to a low-carbon future, the second was to reduce impediments to the uptake grows, of energy efficiency, the third was making buildings more energy efficient and the fourth was government working in partnership and leading the way. The $88 million National Strategy on Energy Efficiency builds on the existing resources and financial support available to improve our homes and workplaces. Energy used by our buildings accounts for approximately 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, split fairly evenly between homes and commercial buildings. The business sector is by far the largest energy user in the Australian economy. The industrial sector alone accounts for almost half of Australia's energy end use, and around two-thirds of stationary energy use. Australia has one of the more energy intensive industrial sectors among developed countries. In terms of carbon pollution reduction measures, energy efficiency has been something of a Cinderella and has been somewhat overlooked. The fact is that this is an area which would benefit from a lot more attention. Energy consumed by residential appliances and industrial and commercial equipment is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. By addressing a large number of areas where low-cost energy efficiency opportunities exist and are yet to be fully exploited, this strategy enables Australians to access highly energy efficient appliances and equipment for residential, commercial and industrial applications, aligned with leading international standards. As the minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts has outlined: Greener offices are not only more comfortable to work in, they can also boost productivity, bring down sick leave, support green building industry jobs and have the potential to deliver savings of 20-40 percent on energy bills. Energy efficiency is a fast, cheap way of making inroads into Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. This scheme will provide a strong incentive in the market for building owners to improve their properties by investing in cost-effective energy efficient upgrades. The disclosure scheme will also apply to office buildings owned by the Australian government, in line with the government's commitments under the National Strategy on Energy Efficiency. Building owners will need to disclose a valid Building Energy Efficiency Certificate, which will include an energy base building star rating under the National Australian Built Environment Rating System, which is known in the trade as NABERS. It will also include an assessment of the lighting energy efficiency of tenancies and some suggestions on how to improve the building's energy efficiency. This scheme is part of an ambitious plan to make Australia's homes and businesses more energy efficient by improving base standards and star ratings-for appliances, equipment and buildings-and by phasing out inefficient technologies. This strategy sets the foundation for a transforma- tion of Australia's building stock through cost-effective voluntary action in response to better information about building energy use. Armed with this information, consumers and businesses will be able to make informed choices about the energy efficiency of the buildings they buy and lease-and builders and building owners will respond to those market signals by investing in energy efficiency. New buildings will be designed and constructed according to improved energy efficiency standards that will lead to a tion in energy consumption. These standards will account for climatic variation. Major renovations will be subject to the same standards. Another result of the agreed National Strategy on Energy Efficiency is a national buildings framework that aims to deliver consistency on how buildings are assessed and rated for energy efficiency and to set out a pathway for increasing minimum performance standards over time. As the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has observed, the framework will: - set increasingly strong minimum performance standards over time for new buildings and major renovations, with standards to be reviewed and increased periodicallyfor example, every three years- cover all classes of residential and commercial buildings; - apply to new and existing buildings; - cover the building envelope including roof, walls, doors and windows as well as the energy efficiency of key building services; - aim to bring together assessment and rating tools for existing and new buildings; - include common measurement and reporting to help in setting building standards and assessing building performance; - allow for the use of rating tools developed by the market, provided they are accurate, transparent and user friendly; encourage innovation in meeting defined performance standards; - continue to communicate energy efficiency improvements using star ratings; and - facilitate effective monitoring and compliance. I think these are all very worthwhile steps forward. In talking about the issue of energy efficiency, I want to suggest some measures which would enhance building energy efficiency and help lower our greenhouse emisreducsions. At the moment consumers can find what is the most efficient refrigerator or car from a government website. I think that kind of information about building performance should also be publicly accessible. In addition, building rating certificates should be displayed in building foyers, again for public accountability and transparency. I think the tenant's rating should also be disclosed. Given that tenants consume about half the energy in a standard building, they should be required to disclose details in a foyer and on a government website. Disclosure of ratings should be extended to other building types such as hotels, hospitals and retail and shopping centres. While there is a focus on energy efficiency, I think water conservation is equally important and disclosure of a water rating should also be considered. I mention to the House the submission by the Australian Conservation Foundation to the Prime Minister's Task Group on Energy Efficiency, which said: Forward-looking and energy efficiency focused building code revisions would require new buildings to meet a minimum of 5-star NABERS requirements now. Such measures are simple and generally well-understood and as such provide a robust means of directing greater investment into energy efficient measures and practices. This would significantly improve the energy efficiency of new building stock and eliminate the need to retrofit them in the shortto medium-term upon revisions of the building code to more environmentally stringent standards … A greater focus needs to be placed on the 98 per cent of commercial floor space that is existing building stock. A strategic approach to greening existing commercial buildings must involve retrofitting. However, barriers and impediments to the investment in ‘green' retrofitting persist. Getting policy leverage will require providing unambiguous market signals as well as providing incentives for investing in modern technology. Accelerated depreciation would help to shorten the payback period by enabling owners/investors to defer tax payments (in exchange for implementing energy efficiency measures earlier). I have also mentioned recently in parliament the benefits of smart grid technology and the consumer interface with this grid, the smart meter. These could communicate with smart thermostats, appliances and other devices, giving people a much clearer view of how much electricity they are consuming. As the Economist points out: Studies have found that when people are made aware of how much power they are using, they reduce their use by about 7%. With added incentives, people curtail their electricity use during peaks in demand by 15% or more. I have mentioned to the House previously that I have been to visit the CSIRO zeroemissions house in Doreen, which has this kind of smart metering whereby you can see exactly what kind of emissions are being generated in any one room at any one time. I believe that is an excellent incentive for house owners. Groundbreaking research by the Warren Centre for Advanced Engineering has demonstrated that better management practices deliver high-performance buildings and that large advances in energy efficiency can be achieved without major capital expenditure on technologies. Its Low energy high rise building research report, which involved a survey of 127 buildings in Australia's capital cities and extensive analysis covering the attitudes and energy management practices of tenants and building asset and portfolio managers, showed that most buildings could achieve a four-star NABERS energy base building rating solely through improved management practices. According to the centre: Project Director, Sue Salmon said that the findings were good news in the current financial climate. “This report is internationally ground-breaking. “It proves that despite the global financial crisis, major improvements in energy efficiency are possible without huge capital expenditure. “What it is telling us is that the greatest environmental gains can be achieved with little or no cost. Even better, the energy savings can put money back into the pockets of owners and tenants,” … Ms Salmon said key features of buildings that perform well related to human attitudes and practices. “For example buildings where management is at least partially in-sourced perform better by as much as 1.3 stars NABERS energy rating and buildings where the building, asset and portfolio manager all feel able to affect efficiency perform better by 0.9 stars. “Buildings that disclose their NABERS performance to tenants perform better by 0.5 stars NABERS Energy. “This corresponds to a performance improvement of approximately 30 per cent for an average building. “Extrapolated across the CBD office building sectorthis amounts toa 1.2 per cent reduction in Australia's total emistory sions.” This report: …was based on three years of development and research by the Warren Centre for Advanced Engineering, involving extensive and tigation of attitudes and practices among tenants, building managers, asset managers and portfolio managers. Participants involved the leading tenants and landlords in Australia. “With the NABERS Energy benchmark and now these new research results the Australian commercial property sector has the tools to be global stars in cutting greenhouse gas emissions,” … There is a global push towards the concept of carbon neutral buildings and precincts. I refer again to the submission from the ACF, which stated: The 2008 G8 Plan of Action on IEA Energy Efficiency Policy Recommendations, which was endorsed earlier last year by the Australian Government, recommends that governments should adopt a package of priority measures for promoting energy efficiency …",132
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member for Wills will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: National School Chaplaincy Program To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the National School Chaplaincy Program, built on the excellent hisof school chaplaincy in Australia, which was introduced by the former Coalition Government in 2007/08 with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It was endorsed by Prime Minister Rudd who said “they (Chaplains) actually are providing the glue which keeps school detailed inves- communities rolling”. The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains necessarily have religious beliefs which underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities the chaplains work in and they do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. It operates in 1915 schools and enjoys strong support among principals, schools and in the community generally. The Rudd Government has extended funding for the program, at a reduced level, until the end of 2011, after which time there may be no more funding despite the program's social benefits, sound administration and strong community support. Malcolm Turnbull has announced that if elected, the Coalition would continue funding the program in its current form, at its current level of $165 million over 3 years. We therefore ask that the Rudd Government continue funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program in its current form. by Mrs Irwin (from 241 citizens) Heritage Listing: Dampier Archipelago To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Dampier Archipelago - World Heritage This petition of citizens of Australia draws to the dren. attention of the House: The petitioners support for World Heritage Listing of the Dampier Archipelago as shown in the underlying map and oppose the development of any further industrial infrastructure on any of the islands that make up the Dampier Archipelago that may impact on the National and World Heritage values of the place. It is acknowledged that the Dampier Archipelago contains what is probably the largest assemblage of prehistoric rock engravings (petroglyphs) anywhere in the world and provides one of the few chronologies in the world of environmental and social change through the last ice age to the sent. We therefore ask the House to: Review all scientific data and expert advice on the scientific, cultural and heritage values of the rock art, standing stones and other components of the archaeology that exists on the islands of the Dampier Archipelago to test its value as a World Heritage nomination. Investigate what activities the Federal Government has made or may undertake to encourage the State of Western Australia to nominate the area for World Heritage listing and make ensuing recommendations to the Federal Government to pursue such nomination. by Mrs Irwin (from 245 citizens) To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives NA NA We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially chilWe, the undersigned citizens therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, he opposed. by Mrs Irwin (from 177 citizens) Fair Trade Chocolate To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the house that since the ‘Harkin - Engel' protocol signing in 2001 only slow progress has been made in ending the worse pre- forms of child labour in the cocoa industry We therefore ask the House to act to set a deadline for the importation of cocoa products involving the use of the worse forms of child labour. We ask for a deadline for two reasons. Firstly because in 2001 the Chocolate Manufacturers Association and the World Cocoa Foundation agreed in the Harkin - Engel protocol that by July 1, 2005 they could eliminate THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOUR”. Secondly because cocoa and chocolate companies such as Cadbury's (with their Dairy Milk chocolate) and Nestle (Kit Kat UK) have already shown that it is possible to comply with the protocol. We ask the House that this deadline includes developing and implementing industry-wide standards of public certification for imports of cocoa beans and their derivaMarriage tive products so that such items will not be allowed to be imported into Australia unless they are shown to have been grown and/or processed without any of the worse forms of child labour as listed in article three in ILO convention 182 which Australia ratified on 19th December 2006. by Mrs Irwin (from 110 citizens) Internet Filtering To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We, the undersigned citizens draws to the attention of the House the forthcoming legislation to “implement compulsory filtering of the internet by ISP's” in Australia and we hereby express our condemnation of this forthcoming legislation. We believe: - That having all internet users subjected to a secret and unaccountable blacklist is a completely unacceptable act and an infringement on our “Human Rights” - that Australia already has laws in place preventing the possession of and viewing of child pornography and other criminal material. - that the filter will not prevent those wishing to obtain such material and furthermore we believe that the millions of dollars that will be spent under this forthcoming legislation would be better spent in funding “The Australian Federal Police's” efforts child pornography rings and therefore prevent crimes against children from happening in the first place. - That having an opt out blacklist rather than an opt in blacklist will impact many innocent websites and will cause a loss of profit for many businesses. In addition we condemn all efforts by government, corporations and the media that attempt to implement any restrictions on our inalienable human right to the free exchange of speech. Your petitioners respectfully ask the house to repeal all legislative action concerning implementation of compulsory content filtering of the internet in Australia and strongly uphold our fundamental human right to the free expression of ideas and opinions. by Mrs Irwin (from 2,166 citizens) Mental Health To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition from concerned citizens: draws to the attention of the House the Federal Government's recent decision to remove access to mental health service providers by allied health professionals (social workers and occupational therapists). We therefore urge the House to immediately reverse the decision to remove the Medicare rebate for allied health professionals (social workers and occupational therapists), so that people with mental health issues are not disadvantaged, especially those in rural and regional Australia. by Mrs Irwin (from 12 citizens) Live Animal Exports To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Petition calling for an end to live animal export. This petition of undersigned citizens of Australia calls on the Australian government to end the export of live animals. We the undersigned therefore call on the Australian government to end this trade and, in so doing, restore Australia's reputation as a compassionate to investigate and ethical nation. by Mrs Irwin (from 12,971 citizens) Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Australian Citizens, who are friends, family or supporters of Australian sufferers of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) disease, a rare and potentially fatal disease of the blood draws to the attention of the House the need to publicly fund out of the Federal Government, the only currently available treatment for PNH sufferers, namely Soliris® (Eculizumab) as a matter of urgency. We therefore ask the House to introduce and pass any legislation or to take any administrative action available to the House that will enable sufferers of PNH disease to urgently receive breakthrough life saving treatment for this very rare and debilitating disease. by Mrs Irwin (from 41 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: Witnesses, including an investigative journalist and a veteran military doctor, have revealed that Falun Gong practitioners are being held in at least 36 concentration camps in China where they are routinely subjected to the forced removal of their organs, which are then sold for transplants. The bodies are quickly cremated to destroy all evidence. Your petitioners therefore request the House to initiate a resolution to: 1. Call for the Australian Government to fully support the International Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong (CIPFG) and demand that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) immediately open the doors of all concentration camps, forced labour camps, hospitals, prisons and detention centres throughout the People's Republic of China in order to allow independent teams to investigate the charges of illegal tention, torture and live organ removal for transplants. ‘Demand that the CCP regime release all detained Falun Gong practitioners immediately: by Mrs Irwin (from 6,361 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: David Kilgour, a former MP and Secretary. of State for Asia Pacific of Canada, and international human rights lawyer Mr David Matas initiated an independent investigation into the allegations of organ harvesting from live victims in China. .The report released on 6 July 2006 has come to the conclusion that Chinese officials have been committing crimes against humanity, that the authorities have been harvesting vital organs from thousands of unwilling Falun Gong practitioners and killing them in the process. “Their vital organs, including hearts, Kidneys, livers and corneas, were virtually simultaneously seized involuntarily for sale at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries. “ - Pg.44 of the report In August 2006 both the Australian Government and Opposition agreed to ask the Chinese communist party to allow an independent investigation into the forced organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China. Your petitioners therefore request the House to initiate a resolution to: I. Australian Government to urge the CCP to immediately release all Falun Gong practitioners; and to give full access without impediment to the Coalition to Investigate Persecution of Falun Gong in China (CIPFG) to conduct an independent investigation into all jails, 610 Offices, labour camps, detention centre, and related hospitals in China. II. Australian Government to initiate a Senate Committee Inquiry into the allegation of Organ Harvesting; deIII. Australian Government to inform and discourage Australian citizens from travelling to China for organ transplants; and prevent companies, institutions and individuals providing goods and services and training to China's organ transplant programmes; until such time as the CIPFG is satisfied that no organs used have been taken by force against the will of the donor; by Mrs Irwin (from 4,835 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Dafa To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives For Stopping the Persecution of FALUN DAFA in China The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House the persecution of Falun Dafa in China. Falun Dafa is a peaceful spiritual practice with over 100 million adherents in over 52 countries. In July 1999 the Chinese Central Government launched a propaganda campaign against Falun Dafa and declared the movement to be illegal. Tens of thousands of practitioners have been imprisoned without trial, while 354 have been tortured to death. This crackdown is clearly a breach of fundamental human rights. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge China's leadership to immediately: (1) Lift the ban on Falun Dafa and restore its legal status. (2) Withdraw the warrant of arrest for Mr Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Dafa. (3) Cease the torture of all detained Falun Dafa practitioners and release them forthwith. (4) Guarantee the full civil rights of released practitioners and their relatives. (5) Rectify all false propaganda used to defame Falun Dafa. We therefore request that the Australian Government issue a clear statement supporting the right of Falun Dafa practitioners to freely exercise their beliefs, and condemning the aforementioned abuses of human rights. by Mrs Irwin (from 640 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Dafa To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives For Stopping the Persecution of Falun Dafa in China The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention or the House the persecution of Falun Dafa in China. Falun Dafa is a peaceful spiritual practice with over 100 million adherents in over 40 countries. In July 1999, the Chinese Central Government launched a propaganda campaign against Falun Dafa and declared the movement to be illegal. Tens of thousands of practitioners have been imprisoned without trial, while hundreds have been tortured to death. This crackdown is clearly a breach of fundamental human rights. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge China's leadership to immediately: (1) Lift the ban on Falun Dafa and restore its legal status. (2) Withdraw the warrant of arrest for Mr Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Dafa. (3) Cease the torture of all detained Falun Dafa practitioners and release them forthwith. (4) Guarantee the full civil rights of released practitioners and their relatives. (5) Rectify all false propaganda used to defame Falun Dafa. We further request that the Australian Government issue a clear statement supporting the right of Falun Dafa practitioners to freely exercise their beliefs, and condemning the aforementioned abuses of human rights by Mrs Irwin (from 638 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: A Canadian report released on 6 July 2006 came to the conclusion that China has been committing crimes against humanity, that the authorities have been harvesting vital organs from thousands of unwilling Falun Gong practitioners and killing them in the process. Mr David Kilgour, a former Canadian MP and Secretary of State for Asia Pacific, and international human rights lawyer Mr David Matas initiated an independent investigation into the allegations of organ harvesting from live victims. “We have concluded that the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centres and ‘people's courts', since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. Their vital organs, including hearts, kidneys, livers and corneas, were virtually simultaneously seized involuntarily for sale at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries.” Pg.44 of the report Your petitioners therefore request the House to initiate a resolution to: I. Urge the CCP to unconditionally release all Falun Gong practitioners and give full access to jails, labour camps, detention centres and related hospitals for the Coalition to Investigate Persecution of Falun Gong in China (CIPFG) and/or the UN to conduct independent investigations; II. Establish a Senate Committee Inquiry into the allegation of Organ Harvesting; III. Discourage Australian citizens from travelling to China for organ transplants; and prevent companies, institutions and individuals providing goods and services and training to China's organ transplant programs until such time as it is beyond reasonable doubt that no organs used have been harvested against the will of the donor. by Mrs Irwin (from 409 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Global Effort to Bring International Human Rights Violator Jiang Zemin to Justice We believe that all persons have the right to be free from torture and genocide. The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: (a) Many human rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have indicated in their reports that people who embrace the spiritual practice of Falun Gong in China are being subjected to torture, illegal and prolonged incarceration, and other egregious violations of their human and civil rights, including death. (b) Several lawsuits have been filed worldwide against Jiang Zemin, the former leader of Communist China, for his role in initiating and implementing this genocidal persecution. This includes a lawsuit filed against Jiang Zemin in the District Court of the Northern District of Illinois for the crimes of torture, genocide, and rimes against humanity. (c) Through these positive efforts, the perpetrators of torture will be warned to stop their violations of human rights, and humanity will be better off when victims of such crimes are granted appropriate legal avenues to seek justice. Your Petitioners Therefore request the House to initiate a resolution to support all efforts to: I. Guarantee to Practitioners of Falun Gong in China Their Constitutional Rights to Freedom of Belief, Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Conscience; II. Address the Purported Genocide Perpetrated in China Against Falun Gong to Help End It; III. Peacefully Stop the Persecution of Falun Gong in China via all Legal and Extra-Legal Means. by Mrs Irwin (from 46 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: Sydney resident David Lang, father of two, was shot in both feet only hours after he and eight other Australians arrived in South Africa to file a lawsuit against Chinese officials who were visiting South Africa. This proposed lawsuit charged China's Vice President Zeng and Minister of Commerce Bo with torture, genocide and crimes against humanity, committed according to Jiang Zemin's personally stated policies regarding Falun Gong to “Ruin their reputations, bankrupt them financially and destroy them physically,” as well as, “Killing them won't matter because their deaths will be counted as suicides.” Zeng and Bo have been served with lawsuits during previous overseas visits for their pivotal role in prolonging the persecution of Falun Gong in China. South African Police are investigating the incident as attempted murder against an Australian. Australians Terrorised Falun Gong practitioners have long been the victims of discrimination, harassment and assault from Chinese officials on Australian soil and worldwide. A known ‘blacklist' has been circulated to prevent Falun Gong practitioners travelling overseas. This incident in South Africa is the most severe case to date and marks a new level of violence in the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners outside of China. Your petitioners therefore rquest the House to: 1. Pay close attention to the safety of Australians, including Falun Gong practitioners, who face terrorist attacks by Jiang Zemin's faction within the Chinese Government to help prevent such terrorist activities. 2. Co-operate with authorities in South Africa to thoroughly investigate this incident and bring to justice those responsible for this attempted murder. 3. Openly condemn the acts of terrorism by Jiang Zemin's faction against Falun Gong practitioners both inside and outside of China. by Mrs Irwin (from 41 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives The following details have been provided by a long-time reporter who worked for a Japanese nongovernmental television news agency and specialised in news on China. In Sujiatun District, Shenyang City, the CCP has established. a secret concentration camp, where over 6,000 Falun Gong practitioners are detained. The concentration Camp has a crematorium to dispose of bodies. There are also many doctors on site. No detainees have managed to leave the concentration camp alive. Before cremation, the internal organs are all removed from the bodies and sold. The camp is said to hold over 6,000 Falun Gong adherents at any given time, and “nobody has yet to come out” from it alive. According to the source, it contains a crematorium, and an unusually large number of doctors work therereflecting the camp's practice of killing prisoners for their organs. which are then sold for profit. Your petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives (o: (a) Request the Australian government to openly condemn the persecution of Falun Corn by the CCP regime, particularly the horrific practice of harvesting and selling organs of executed practitioners. (b) Note that the International Covenant on Civil and Right and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights apply to all Falun Gong practitioners worldwide, (c) Note that Australia is one the eight countries that drafted the Declaration of Human Rights and the Australian government should therefore honour the principles in the Declaration 2010. and openly condemn the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners by the CCP regime. by Mrs Irwin (from 2 citizens) Petitions received. Responses Mrs Irwin-Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Television Broadcasts Dear Ms Irwin Television reception in Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay, Queensland Thank you for your letter dated 18 March 2010 in your capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions. In your letter you referred a petition to me from the citizens of, and visitors to, Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay, Queensland, about the inadequate quality of television reception in those areas, and you sought my response to the petition by way of a written response to the Committee. The petition asked the House to ‘make an urgent request to the appropriate authority for erection of a black spot tower to allow residents of Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay to receive good quality television reception.' The Television Black Spots Program, which provided funding for analog retransmission solutions, closed on 30 June 2005. However, the Australian Government understands the importance of freeto-air television to regional and rural Australians and has introduced policy and legislative measures to maximise the access of viewers in these areas to digital television services. On 5 January 2010, I announced that the Government will implement a new digital television satellite service which will be available to people who are unable to receive adequate terrestrial television reception from the transmitters that serve the area in which they live. The new satellite service will, for the first time, allow people living in regional areas to receive the same number of television services as people living in metropolitan areas. Legislation to support the implementation of the new satellite service was introduced into Parliament on 18 March The new satellite service will feature channels carrying programs from the Seven, Nine and Ten networks and the national broadcasters' main channels, ABC1 and SBS ONE, along with digital channels ABC2, ABC3, ABCHD, SBS TWO, 7TWO, GO! and ONE HD. A new Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 24 hour news channel is expected to replace the current ABCHD service later this year. The satellite service will also provide viewers in regional Australia with access to the local news services currently broadcast by the commercial broadcasters in their relevant terrestrial licence areas. These services will be provided through a dedicated news channel. In addition, the news services of the national broadcasters, the ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), will also be provided. ABC news will be provided on a state basis. On 14 April 2010 I announced that the Government had finalised a funding agreement with broadcasters to provide the service in Eastern Australia. Further information about the operation of the satellite service, including the availability and cost of the new satellite set-top boxes is available at the broadcasters' website at www.mysattv.com.au. Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay are in the Capricornia switchover area which will switch to digital-only broadcasting in the second half of 2011. The actual date at which switchover will occur within the six-month switchover period will depend on factors such as local conditions and community feedback. To access the new satellite service, households will need to install satellite reception equipment, including a dish and a digital set-top box. The costs of installation will vary depending on the location, the size of the satellite receiving dish required and characteristics of the viewer's home. The new satellite service provides a viable alternative solution to community funded `self-help' retransmission facility for people in areas like Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay. Following a household's initial expenditure for satellite recepmobile tion equipment, there will be no ongoing financial and resource commitments required, unlike the ongoing maintenance and operational costs of the self-help facility. Furthermore, the satellite vice will be better able to serve people within the area as the population distribution changes over time. Thank you for bringing the concerns of the residents of Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay to my attention. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy Mobile Phone Services Dear Ms Irwin Petition regarding mobile phone coverage at Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay Thank you for your letter dated 18 March 2010 in relation to a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning mobile phone coverage at Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay. The Australian Government understands the importance of mobile telephony to Australians. The last few years have seen the three major mobile phone carriers extend the national coverage of their networks on a commercial basis. The Vodafone Hutchinson Australia networks cover more than 94 per cent of the Australian population. Optus provides 3G services to 96 per cent of the Australian population and Telstra claims its Next G network now provides mobile coverage to 99 per cent of Australians. The provision of mobile phone coverage in a particular area is primarily a commercial decision made by mobile phone carriers. In making the decision to extend coverage to a particular area, a mobile phone carrier will consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service. Residents of Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay may wish to contact Telstra, Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia to make their needs known. I have attached the contact details of the carriers for reference. It can be useful to involve local government in identifying potential demand for services in an area. Information such as projections of population growth and records of traffic volumes can be helpful in assisting carriers to make informed decisions about whether to ser- extend coverage to certain areas. Telstra, Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia coverage maps indicate there is patchy coverage in the Turkey Beach and Rodds Bay area. The Optus maps show that the area is to be provided with better coverage in the future. The coverage maps are available online at: www.telstra.com.au/mobile/networks/coverage/m as.cfm, www.optus.corn.au, www.vodafone.com.au and www.three.com.au. There are a number of factors that can interfere with mobile reception and, therefore, affect a user's ability to obtain or maintain a mobile phone signal at any given time or in any particular place. These factors include mountainous or hilly terrain, road cuttings, buildings and tunnels. While not all potential sources of interference can be overcome, local service providers should be able to advise of ways to minimise interference. One effective way to increase coverage is to use an in-car kit with an external antenna. The most appropriate antenna may vary between networks, and prices vary according to the quality. These accessories can be readily obtained from mobile phone shops and dealers. The particular handset used can also affect mobile reception. It is important for consumers to understand that different mobile phones have different capabilities and how each phone performs on the network is dependent on both the network coverage and the particular device. Telstra puts a ‘blue tick' label on the phones it recommends for use in poor coverage areas. These phones make the most of available reception. Other service providers can also provide advice on the best handsets for local conditions. In areas that are sparsely populated or have little passing traffic, the only commercially viable option for mobile phone services is via satellite. Satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and population and are available from a number of providers. Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme The Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme (the Scheme) improves the affordability of mobile communications for people living and working in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, by providing subsidies for the purchase of satellite phone handsets. The Scheme provides up to $1000 for eligible applicants who live in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, and up to $700 for eligible applicants who live in areas that have coverage, but spend significant periods in non-coverage areas. In 2009, I announced enhancements to the Scheme and its extension until June 2013. These improvements include: - an increase in the subsidy level for people who live in areas without access to terrestrial mobile phone coverage, from 60 per cent of the handset to 85 per cent-the cap on individual subsidies remains at $1000 per handset; and - the ability for health and emergency service organisations to access additional handsets if they can demonstrate a need. Previously these organisations could only access two subsidies. Information about the Scheme, including the application form, is available on the website of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy at www.dbcde.gov.au/satphone. An information kit can be obtained by contacting the Scheme administrator by phoning freecall 1800 674 058 or via email salphone@dbcde.gov.au.

The Australian Government remains committed to supporting Landcare and recognises that Landcare is at the frontline in dealing with many of future challenges, including food security, climate change and the protection of Australia's environment. The 2010-11 Budget allocates $36 million in funding to support Landcare community groups and volunteers across Australia. This is a $1 million increase on last year's funding. We have also increased overall funding for Caring for our Country in the 2010-11 Budget by $15 million, to $423 million. I recently attended the National Landcare Forum in Adelaide, where I had the opportunity to speak with many people from across the country who are involved with Landcare. Like the people of Gippsland, I understand the importance of having networks of facilitators, coordinators and project managers to support Landcare groups, particularly if they are to help meet our future agricultural and environmental challenges. This is why the government is providing $33.6 million for a national network of 56 Landcare facilitators. These facilitators support local Landcare groups in many ways, including helping them to apply for funding, and will effectively link community groups and natural resource management bodies. An open call for suitable organisations to host the Landcare facilitators was recently concluded, and I expect this network to be in place for the longer term by 1 July 2010. Further information about the Landcare facilitator initiative is available at www.nrm.gov.au. In the meantime, the government has offered each natural resource management region up to $150 000 in funding to maintain facilitator employment in their regions while these arrangements are being implemented. Contrary to Mr Chester's allegation in his speech presenting this petition, this offer has been taken Landcare up by the vast majority of regional bodies. Also contrary to Mr Chester's allegations, the Caring for our Country Business Plan explicitly recognises the importance of facilitators and provides funding opportunities for the purpose of employing a facilitator to help achieve project outcomes. Mr Chester is further incorrect regarding funding for the capacity, skills, knowledge and engagement target under Caring for our Country-most projects funded under Caring for our Country our meet this target and the latest Business Plan has merely clarified that projects need to address other targets, such as sustainable farming practices, when addressing the capacity building target. The Caring for our Country Community Action Grants program is also helping many grassroots Landcare groups undertake their important projects. In January 2010, the Hon. Peter Garrett AM MP, Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, and I announced almost $5 million for 299 Community Action Grants projects. I am pleased to say that on 31 March 2010 I announced a further $876 000 in funding for another 49 Landcare projects, to be undertaken by community Landcare groups. It is important to note that Landcare groups can apply for funding for facilitators through Community Action Grants. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke MRI Licence, Warrnambool Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 13 May 2010 forwarding a petition from the electorate of Wannon, regarding a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) ‘licence' for Warrnambool Hospital. The Australian Government is responsible for the provision of Medicare benefits for a wide range of medical services, including MRI scans. As MRI is a sophisticated and expensive technology, there are particular requirements which need to be met in order for an MRI scan to attract a Medicare benefit. In particular, the MRI scan needs to be provided on ‘eligible equipment' as defined in the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations. There are 125 eligible equipment MRI units operating across Australia, including 28 in Victoria. There is no ongoing application process for obtaining eligible equipment status for an MRI unit. Hospitals and diagnostic imaging providers may choose to install and operate MRI units which do not have eligible equipment status. Scans provided on these Medicare-ineligible MRI units do not attract Medicare benefits. Under the National Healthcare Agreement, scans provided to public inpatients of public hospitals do not attract Medicare benefits anyway. In referring to an MRI licence, the petition seeks eligible equipment status for an MRI unit at Warrnambool Hospital, which would then be treated as a Medicare-eligible MRI unit. The Government is aware of the calls for an MRI unit, preferably Medicare-eligible, in Warrnambool. The Government has received a number of representations on this matter from the Warrnambool community and from the Member for Wannon, the Hon David Hawker MP. My adviser has also met with Mr Hawker and others from Warrnambool. I appreciate that communities such as Warrnambool value access to convenient and affordable MRI services. In May 2009, the Government announced that it would be undertaking a detailed review of possible long-term funding arrangements in diagnostic imaging. As part of this detailed review, the arrangements for funding MRI under Medicare are being examined, particularly the restrictions around Medicareeligible/ineligible units. The outcomes of the detailed review are expected to be considered by the Government in the context of the 2011-12 Budget. The petition calls on the Government to reverse its decision to not grant Warrnambool Hospital an MRI licence. I note, however, that as there is no ongoing process for applying for Medicare eligibility for an MRI unit, and no capacity at this time to increase the number of Medicare-eligible MRI units, the Government has not actually made a specific decision in relation to any request concerning Warrnambool. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Medicare Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 13 May 2010 regarding a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions about the removal of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items 50124 and 50125, which provide for joint aspirations or injections. As part of the 2009-10 Budget, it was announced that the MBS fees for minor procedural items 50124 and 50125 would be removed from the MBS. However, there was no change to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listings of medicines associated with joint injections. The joint injection items have been removed from the MBS as they can be delivered as part of a standard consultation. There are many services carried out during a standard consultation with a doctor, such as performing a Pap smear, which do not attract a separately identified benefit. Following the change, any practitioner who was previously administering the service can continue to perform the service under the relevant attendance item for the relevant medical specialty. The new MBS Quality Framework, a measure announced in the 2009-10 Budget, has seen the Australian Government allocate $9.3 million over two years to develop and implement a new evidence-based framework for managing the MBS into the future. The Quality Framework introduced a new MBS listing process on 1 January 2010 that applies to all applications that do not undergo an assessment through the Medical Services Advisory Committee. Items that are deemed eligible for MBS listing will be listed for a time-limited period and will require a formal evaluation at the end of the period. My Department has met on a number of occasions with both Arthritis Australia and the Australian Rheumatology Association to discuss this issue. On 31 January 2010, my Department received a submission from the rheumatologists regarding complex joint injections and aspirations. My Department has indicated that it is willing to examine further the issues raised. These services are now being reviewed under the new MBS Quality Framework.

188,Mrs IRWIN,BETWEEN MAN ANDWOMAN,"In the report the committee reviews its role, as framed by the standing orders, and how it has operated since it first met in March 2008. The role of the committee is to process petitions and to inquire into matters relating to petitions and the petitioning system. Given that clear framework, the committee's primary activity has been to meet each sitting week to consider proposed petitions for compliance with the standing orders, and the written responses that ministers have made when we have referred petitions to them. Since it began its work, the committee has been concerned to follow up on the matters raised in petitions and we have done that, first, by referring them to relevant ministers. We have also held many round-table meetings at Parliament House and interstate where we have spoken to public servants and to a number of petitioners about petitions. The committee's webpage provides petitioners, and the public generally, with easy access to advice about preparing a petition, the terms of petitions that have been presented to this House, ministerial responses, and transcripts of public meetings we have held where we asked about petitions and responses. Beginning in September 2008, at this time on sitting Mondays I have announced petitions and ministerial responses that the committee has considered at its latest meeting. This regular timeslot has given the committee an opportunity to account to the House and to Australians about the work it has undertaken, and to outline the matters addressed in petitions. The committee hopes that this timeslot will become a permanent one. The committee has been under no illusion about its ability to resolve the concerns that are raised in petitions, but it has been concerned to air them-and the government's views on them-on behalf of those who sign them. In discussing the committee's role, it is worth repeating one of the principles that underpins our decisions. Petitions are inherently about issues that engage peoples' interest and sometimes their emotions. There will always be occasions when some or all members do not agree with the text of a petition, but, if it complies with the standing orders its form and content and language, then the committee believes it is required to approve it for presentation in the House-whether that presentation is by me or by a member who has been asked to present it. The report outlines our approach to our work and the activities we have undertaken as our role evolved. It also examines the relevant standing and sessional orders. We believe that, generally, the standing orders are effective in enabling us to strengthen the petitions process and the links between the House and the Australian people. One recommendation we have made is for the committee to be able to refer petitions to House committees for inquiry and report-should those committees wish. This is the second report of the committee. We reported in November 2009 on the issue of e-petitions and recommended that the House accept electronic petitions as well as paper. We hope that will happen in the near future. In what may be my last statement to the House on petitions, I would like to acknowledge my committee colleagues. In particular I thank the deputy chair, my colleague and friend the member for MCMillan, for his contribution to this report and for his generous and enthusiastic support for the committee from the beginning. I believe there would be few committees that are as enjoyable to work with as the Petitions Committee. That is due in no small part to the role played by our deputy chair. The harmony and productivity is also due to the sustained interest shown by other members of the committee, who have many obligations, including leadership roles in other committees. They have taken the time to participate in committee activities here and interstate. Like me, they have been reflecting on the committee's role as a bridge in for communications between the House and Australians and government. I believe it is their commitment that has made the committee so successful so quickly, and it is their commitment that will ensure the committee continues to evolve to meet the needs of the House and petitioners. I also thank the staff of the committee secretariat for their work on this inquiry. Over the course of the parliament we have had a few changes in our staff, but, fortunately, they have been seamless. I thank all secretariat staff, past and present, for that. It is with pleasure that I commend the report to the House. NA Intelligence and Security Committee Report",146
189,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I present the committee's report entitled Review of Administration and Expenditure: No. 8Australian Intelligence Agencies. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.,147
190,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"As always at the outset, I thank the secretariat for its support of both the committee's work on this report and all our other endeavours throughout the term of this parliament. I also thank the other members of the committee, who have contributed in a very constructive and beneficial way to the good governance of this nation in what is a very critical area of parliamentary oversight. This report is a little different to some of the others this committee has presented in that it addresses a number of recommended changes to the legislation, something the committee does not do lightly or often. In the very short time available to me, I will concentrate on three of the recommendations that go to some of those matters. Recommendation 1 of this report says: The Committee recommends that the Intelligence Services Act 2001 be amended to include AFPthat is, the Australian Federal Policecounterterrorism elements in the list of organisations that the Committee reviews. The report goes into some detail about the importance of that change, but I just refer to two of the concluding remarks contained in the report. At paragraph 1.40, the committee report says: It is untenable that the Committee cannot seek information from the AFP on its counterterrorism role and intelligence functions in the same way that it does with ASIO,ASIS, DIO, DIGO, DSD and ONA. My apologies for the acronyms! The committee has enjoyed very productive and positive cooperation from the Attorney-General, who has facilitated the opportunity for senior officers of the AFP to meet with the committee, but the committee strongly takes the view that there is a need for legislative change to place the AFP counterterrorism elements on the same footing as those members of the Australian intelligence community. Elsewhere in the report, at paragraph 1.43, the committee notes: Of all the AICthat is, the Australian intelligence communityagencies, and agencies that work closely with the AIC, the AFP is the most public and visible. The Committee sees no reason why the AFP alone, of all the agencies encompassing the AIC, should be immune from Committee review other than with the specific consent of the Attorney-General. These matters are too important to be left to the variations in views that the Attorney-General of the time may hold. These are important matters. The committee has a key role in ensuring a balance between the security requirements of laws that all of us in this place-as well, I think, as people throughout the country-understand and appreciate might otherwise be seen to transgress the civil liberties and basic human rights which we in a democracy hold dear. This parliamentary committee is a key aspect of the counterbalancing of those concerns and should not be subject to the differing views that various attorneys-general of the Commonwealth may hold from time to time. I turn now to recommendation 2. It says: The Committee recommends that the Government agree to amending the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to enable specific material which does not affect current operational activity to be provided to the Committee. A small working group drawn from the relevant Departments, Agencies and the Committee should be set up to prepare this amendment for consideration by the Government. The committee has enjoyed very productive relationships with all of the agencies over a long period of time, not just in this parliament but also well before. That has been an essential aspect of the committee's being able to do its work. As the report makes clear, many of those things which the committee deals with and have become custom and practice might be read by some not to be covered by the existing wording of the legislation. Again, to ensure the parliament's proper oversight of these sensitive and important laws, we think it is now time for the government to review the legislation and to put in place measures which more accurately reflect the status quo. Recommendation 7 proposes to amend the act to put in place a provision requiring that the ANAO report to the committee on its reviews of the Australian intelligence community. In fact, the ANAO quite willingly does that, and the committee relies significantly on those contributions, but it should not be open to either the vagaries of individuals or arrangements that exist from time to time. It needs to be in the legislation. This committee performs an enormously important role not just for the parliament but also for the public confidence in these most important laws. The enhancements proposed in the recommendations of this committee report will go a long way towards ensuring that that remains so, that it is seen to be so and that it is above party politics.

191,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"Berowra) (8.44 pm)First, I thank the member for Brisbane for his leadership of this committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I do so in the context of the report's recommendations I will shortly discuss. I commend his observations on the work of our secretariat. I primarily intend to discuss recommendation 1 of the report but I do note recommendations 6 and 8. Recommendation 6 deals with the effects of the efficiency dividend and a concern that I have that growing security engagement, particularly in relation to visa scrutiny, has put a number of organisations, ASIO in particular, under very considerable pressure. Efficiency dividends fit uncomfortably with the view that the role of an organisation should be expanded, because resources are ripped out. Recommendation 8 is about the increased activities of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. I draw those recommendations to the attention of the House. As I said, I want to speak specifically about recommendation 1, which is: The Committee recommends that the Intelligence Services Act 2001 be amended to include AFP counter-terrorism elements in the list of organisafice tions that the Committee reviews. I draw members' attention to the discussion in the report. It contains some matters that perhaps my colleague the member for Brisbane would not want to draw attention to but I think I safely can-that is, an obvious reconsideration of this matter by the government. As noted in the report: 1.15 The Attorney-General wrote to the Committee on three separate occasions on this matter. The first letter, dated 23 December 2008, advised of the Government's decision to enable the PJCIS to extend inquiries to include the AFP in appropriate cases with the Attorney-General's consent. 1.16 The second … outlined the Attorney General's reasons for requiring the Attorney General's consent, those being that such an arrangement provided the most flexible and appropriate means of identifying whether a matter involving the AFP has a relevant link with security and intelligence issues. 1.17 The third … advised that the Government was not pursuing the proposal to extend the mandate of the PJCIS … It is obvious that there was some reconsideration of that matter. I do not know what that reconsideration was, but, if it was to ensure that an element of our security and intelligence functions should not be reviewed by the relevant committee of this parliament, I would see that as very serious indeed. There have been a number of inquiries over time that pointed to the need for security agencies to be under government scrutiny. It seems to me, as one who has seen both the executive function and the parliamentary function, that the idea is that there are a number of agencies that are subject to review. The committee report points out the extensive nature of that review, in that it applies to bodies like our internal security organisation, our external security organisation, our defence organisations and the Ofof National Assessments. But the AFP is excluded, even though the National CounterTerrorism Plan states: ASIO, other Australian Government intelligence agencies and the AFP maintain overseas liaison channels to gather intelligence and to pursue investigations. It is clear the AFP has an intelligence function; the committee report points out the nature of that intelligence function; and yet, despite being part of those arrangements, that one agency seems to be excluded. I do not think there is any evidence that any other committee will be reviewing the intelligence role of the AFP. If that function is not given to the intelligence and security committee-the committee that deals with the review of intelligence functions-it seems to me that that role of the AFP will be exempt from scrutiny while other agencies will be subjected to it. There is no logic, it is totally inappropriate, and I would urge the government to look very carefully at this report and to reconsider its approach. If it does not, I believe it is being derelict in its responsibilities.",149
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Does the member for Brisbane wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,150
193,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,I do. I move: That the House take note of the report.,150
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 39, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Intelligence and Security Committee Report: Referral to Main Committee",150
195,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Main Committee for debate. Question agreed to. Corporations and Financial Services Committee Report,150
196,Mr RIPOLL,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services I present the committee's report entitled Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",150
197,Mr RIPOLL,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to speak to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services June 2010 report on the statutory oversight of ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The committee have been busy. We have been increasing our understanding of ASIC's role and operations and of the issues facing Australia's market regulator. On 22 March, the committee visited ASIC's Information Processing Centre at Traralgon, in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. This gave us an opportunity to better understand ASIC's business and to experience first hand its call centre operations-really, the nerve centre of the complaints that are received by ASIC. It is my understanding-and I stand to be corrected if it is not the case-that this is the first time the committee has undertaken to do a full committee visit of this very important operations centre. The committee thanks the many staff at Traralgon for their assistance and also for their hard work and dedication. We really got a first hand impression of just how dedicated the people who work there are to doing a great job. The committee also sought briefings from experts in the field of corporate regulation, and we thank Professor Michael Adams and Associate Professor Joanna Bird for providing the benefits of their expertise. It is something that the committee will endeavour to continue to do-to seek outside as well as internal expertise. The committee are also very interested in improving our oversight of ASIC and, as such, we have increased the number of oversight hearings from two per year to four per year, with a view to also playing a more active role and having a more hands-on approach in oversight of the regulator. I now turn to issues that were covered in the report and our most recent oversight hearing, particularly the transfer of market supervisory powers. Responsibility for securities market supervision is being transferred from the Australian Securities Exchange to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The committee visited the exchange's Sydney offices to hear from them about the transition to the new regulatory regime. It then discussed the transition with ASIC at the public hearing later that day. ASIC was confident that it was on schedule to take responsibility for market supervision between 1 July and 30 September this year. The committee is very confident in that process. The committee is also confident in the systems that are being put in place-the redundancies, the computing systems and the legacy left behind between what ASIC does now and will do under new regulation and what the Australian Stock Exchange has done in the past. ASIC indicated that it would start consultation on new market rules for competition between share markets only once the transfer of powers from the Australian Stock Exchange to the Australian Securities Investments Commission have been implemented. The implication appears to be that trading on competitor platforms, such as Chi-X, would not take place earlier than the first half of next year, in 2011. Issues of concern that have been raised this committee, such as contracts for difference, are real issues and the committee is taking these on. The markets for derivatives such as contracts for difference have remained a focus also of the commission's surveillance. The number of participants in markets for contracts for difference grew 23 per cent in 2009, which is an enormous growth figure. These are very risky products suited to market players with considerable knowledge and experience and people who actually do very much understand the risks and limitations that are involved when dealing with these types of market derivatives. The committee's examination of the collapse of Storm Financial and Opes Prime highlighted potential problems when retail investors start trading such high-risk products, as just one example. The committee encourages ASIC to remain extremely vigilant in this area and will itself also continue to keep the derivatives market under active consideration. The committee continues to closely monitor progress being made in the wake of the collapse of Storm Financial. The committee is aware that ASIC has attracted some criticism for the time it is taking to make progress on this important case. But the committee also appreciates that a balance needs to be maintained between public disclosure and achieving the best possible outcome for investors who have lost their lifesavings-and, for some, much more as well. The committee accepts that ASIC is attempting to strike that balance; however the committee also believes that delays beyond July may lead to further questions about the effectiveness of that particular strategy. There is a range of other areas that the committee continues to keep on its agendain particular the issues of rumourtrage. Effective financial markets rely on the communication of accurate information about the by products that are being traded, and rumourtrage is something that is not acceptable on the Australian market. It is the spreading of rumours or false information in order to deliberately affect the price of a market product such as a company's shares. ASIC established Project Mint in March 2008 to investigate such misconduct. The committee is aware that there has been some debate about how best to deter behaviour designed to mislead markets. It has noted that the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, or CAMAC, in a June 2009 report recommended reforms to the Corporations Act to make it easier to undertake prosecutions in this area. CAMAC's proposal has been endorsed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The committee now believes that proposal should receive active consideration by the minister. I know that the minister will take this on board. While I am on that, I again congratulate the minister for the great work that he has done in this area. He has been actually been ahead of the game and, I dare say, even ahead of the market in terms of some of the reforms in these areas. So I congratulate him for his work and I know that he will do a great job in this area in the future as well. I particularly want to talk about recent litigation and some of the areas where ASIC has lost some high-profile court cases in recent years. One in particular was the case against One.Tel, and there was also AWB and Fortescue Metals. These are a small number of the hundreds of prosecutions ASIC has conducted, most of them being successful. The committee is firmly of the view that it should always remain within the capacity of ASIC to take on cases whether it wins, loses or draws, to send a strong signal to the market about its position and to set the precedent or to make certain the laws and regulations in terms of particular cases, and that is what ASIC continues to do. The committee accepts that it is of course inevitable that some litigation will be lost. Lost litigation is not the same thing as failed litigation particularly when court decisions provide greater legal certainty for all parties without undermining the objectives of the regulatory regime. The committee strongly endorses the need for rigorous review of cases particularly those that are likely to be expensive to litigate, and it understands that ASIC is committed to strengthening internal processes to ensure that this occurs. The committee holds its next hearing with ASIC later this week and we will continue to pursue a number of these issues discussed in the report. I thank the secretariat and the committee members for the hard work that they do and their assistance in preparing these reports. I also want to thank the ASIC officials for their continuing cooperation, and I commend the full report to the House. Communications Committee Report",150
198,Ms NEAL,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Communications I present the committee's report entitled Hackers, fraudsters and botnets: tackling the problem of cyber crime, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",152
199,Ms NEAL,COMMITTEES,"Today I table the report of the House of Representative's Standing Committee on Communication's inquiry into cybercrime. Over the past 12 months the committee has heard evidence from a wide cross-section of government, industry and the community on the impact of cybercrime on the Australian public. The report is a substantial contribution to the cybercrime policy debate in Australia. The message was clear and consistent: Australia needs to take a more comprehensive approach, a ‘whole-ofcyberspace' approach that takes account of ordinary Australians and shifts away from the fragmented approach to tackling cybercrime which presently dominates the issue, and move to a coordinated approach between government, the private business sector, service providers and law enforcement authorities. In 2009 alone the number of Australian internet subscribers grew by one million to a total of nine million. The global estimate is approaching two billion. The digital economy is here and here to stay. While the benefits of a connected world are undeniable, increased connectivity brings increased risks. Cybercrime has grown from the nuisance hacker into organised transnational crime committed for vast profit. Malicious code, malware, identity theft and botnetscybercrime continues to evolve and grow. An underground digital economy has emerged by which cybercrime tools and stolen information can be easily traded. These crimes take a significant toll on everyday Australians. Cybercriminals have identified home users and small business as the weak links in the chain and are conscientiously targeting these groups. The emotional and financial consequences for Australian victims of cybercrime are real, lasting and significant. Despite the prevalence of cybercrime, the committee does not accept that the internet is an unpoliced Wild West. The internet is subject to the same laws as the offline environment. I commend the ongoing efforts of the government to combat cybercrime. However, under current arrangements, end users have largely been left to fend for themselves. This is no longer a tenable position. We must achieve a model of shared responsibility that brings industry, government and the community together. To achieve this goal the committee has made a number of significant recommendations. These are based on the unanimous view that e-security education alone is not sufficient to protect end users. The committee has recommended that an office of online security be established within the Department of Prime Minster and Cabinet, headed by a cybersecurity coordinator-a cyber-tsar-to work with all levels of federal, state and territory governments, industry and consumers, and with international partners. The office must be centrally located and not be biased towards one particular policy area such as national security. The coordinator will need to have both government and industry experience-someone who can cut through red tape and work with all parties. The committee has also recommended a 24/7 national cybercrime complaint centrea one-stop shop-and hotline to assist everyday Australians. This approach will also help enforcement agencies to see the bigger picture of organised cybercrime. If we can follow the footprints of cybercriminals, we can ultimately identify them and prosecute them. The report also recommends the development of a centrally managed national esecurity education strategy. The Standing Committee of Attorneys General recently announced national cybercrime measures. I commend greater national collaboration but would caution against seeing this as a role purely for the Attorneys General. The committee has emphasised the importance of a national, multisectoral, strategic and coordinated response to cybercrime through, for example, strong consumer protection and privacy laws. Significantly, the committee has recommended a mandatory esecurity code of practice to put to the internet industry. The recent voluntary code for ISPs is a step in the right direction, but the committee wants a clear obligation for ISPs to notify subscribers when their computers are infected. Nine-two per cent of internet consumers support this notification, and it is very clear that, in the present circumstances, unless the ISPs notify consumers, many consumers are oblivious to the fact that their computer has been hijacked. It is essential to remediate infected computers, dismantle botnets and identify the sources of cybercrime. End users should also be expected to install antivirus software before connecting to the internet.",152
200,Mrs HULL,COMMITTEES,"I rise to support the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications in the tabling of the report of the inquiry into cybercrime, titled Hackers, fraudsters and botnets: tackling the problem of cyber crime. I congratulate the chair of the committee for the fantastic work that she did in her leadership of this committee. As the deputy chair, I certainly appreciated the effort that she and the rest of the committee members put in. I would also like to take the time to thank the committee secretariat for their diligent and dedicated hard work to ensure that this report actually is a report that, I am sure, will not gather dust in the future. I am sure that this report will have many of the recommendations within it put into practice. I am hoping that that will be the case because a significant amount of hard work went into it. Fishing, virus, worms, trojan horses, botnets-one might be forgiven for thinking that this could be just science fiction; however, this is language that we as consumers of the internet must become familiar with. We need to accept that the internet is a valuable form of communication but, as technology advances rapidly, we must implement protection mechanisms that can play a role in protecting consumers against criminal activity that causes devastation and wreaks havoc on the victims. Over the past few years, criminal activity has increased dramatically as a result of utiliand sation of the internet. During evidence given, we were told that when a home user fell victim to a scam the cybercriminal put the respondents of these scams onto what they called a ‘sucker list'. This list is then used to distribute further scams. So, rather than people thinking, ‘Well, I've been caught once and now I will be left alone,' they actually are targeted even more intensely with alternative scams. It is quite a shame to see that people can get caught time and time again. It might be thought that the people who get caught are not savvy people. Well, that is certainly not true. During the evidence we heard that there is huge concern for the future. As our internet speeds increase, the ability to track criminals becomes increasingly difficult. However, we are very fortunate that the same technology used to commit crime against users is also used to catch these criminals. The committee heard evidence from agencies that gave us significant comfort in their expertise, but we also heard tragic and heart-wrenching evidence from people who had been scammed. The one constant comment that we heard from people who gave evidence, advice on evidence and agency advice was that there is a need for intense education. I personally feel that the very nature of the advancement in technology means that consumers must become more savvy and have a responsibility to be educated. In addition, I feel that retailers have an obligation to ensure that consumers are aware of the need to install the protection that they require, such as antivirus software, firewalls and anti-spy software. As a result of how many complaints I have had over the years, I held forums in my electorate to educate my community on the very real issues of cybercrime, identity theft, fraud, the use of people's computers to host distribute of child pornography and other issues. I put out a booklet to explain, in very simple terms, just what people need to look for, the types of protection they need to have on their computers and how they can check their computers to see whether botnets are active on their home systems. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be surprised at how many people are hosting botnets in their own homes without having any idea that they are being used to transfer informationsometimes information that is highly illegal-throughout the system. I commend this report to the House. The committee did an excellent job, and I think that, on the whole and in the main, this is a successful report.",154

205,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Procedure Committee I present the committee's report entitled Building a modern committee system: an inquiry into the effectiveness of the House committee system, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",155
206,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"The House committee system has been operating in its current form since 1987. Some significant reforms were undertaken as a result of a 1998 Procedure Committee report, and other minor changes have taken place over time. Last year, over 20 years after the current system of committees was established, the Procedure Committee considered it timely to undertake another in-depth review, looking at issues such as the work and powers of committees and factors that influence their effectiveness. I thank the people who provided written submissions and those who met with the committee. As part of its inquiry, the committee held two round-table discussions with chairs and deputy chairs of House and joint committees. On behalf of the Procedure Committee, I take this opportunity to thank these colleagues for their time and contribution to the important discussions that took place at these well-attended and constructive forums. In fact, this sort of cooperative, bipartisan approach that was demonstrated at the roundtables is one of the real strengths of House committees in particular. Unlike some other committee systems, House committees tend not to be adversarial but facilitate members working together across party lines to find solutions to problems faced by the Austhe tralian public, delivering a great deal of value to the community on the way. The committee found that, overall, the House committee system has been operating relatively effectively within the framework Report that has been available to it. However, some changes are necessary to strengthen the role of committees within the Australian parliament. To this end, the committee has made recommendations for structural changes to make the committee system work more efficiently and make the best use of members' time. These include reducing the number of general-purpose standing committees and reviewing the number of joint committees, reducing the number of permanent members on House committees, making better use of more supplementary members in committee inquiries and recognising and extending the significant roles performed by chairs and deputy chairs. Some other reforms proposed by the committee include increasing the number of bills inquiries carried out by House committees and giving House committees the power to initiate their own referCommittee ences, noting that they already have the capacity to influence their work programs by negotiating inquiry terms of reference with ministers and by conducting inquiries into annual and audit reports. Changes in technology and in the community's expectations of members and of parliament have meant that the committee system's role has been evolving over the years. Committees act as a bridge between the parliament and the public. The Procedure Committee's recommendations therefore seek to make it easier for the community to follow and engage with committees, including ensuring that the technological tools available to committees are adequate and appropriate, including teleconferencing, videoconferencing, web based solutions and audiovisual recording and broadcasting; providing a more practical and appropriate time in the chamber and Main Committee for the presentation and debate of committee reports; and creating space in the House's schedule for a deeper narrative around committee work, starting with giving chairs the opportunity to make statements in the chamber about their committee's inquiries. No consideration of the effectiveness of House committees would be complete without giving some consideration to the resources available to committees to carry out their work, including funding, staffing and time. While the committee appreciates the constraints of the current fiscal environment, it notes that the House has traditionally had little input into the level of funding required for it to effectively carry out its work. For this reason, one of the committee's recommendations is for the establishment of a House staffing and appropriations committee, whose role would be similar to that of its counterpart in the other place. Giving the House this sort of input is long overdue. It has been both recommended by the Joint of Public Accounts and Audit and proposed by the former Speaker, the Honourable Member for Wannon, earlier this parliament. The report I present this evening is the culmination of a lengthy and thoughtful inquiry process. The inquiry was carried out cooperatively and across party lines, and I thank my Procedure Committee colleagues for their sustained efforts. Their experience with committees, as well as their interest in the inquiry, was invaluable. I also thank our secretariat, Catherine Cornish and Peggy Danae, for the extraordinary amount of work they did on this report. I inform honourable members that I will seek to have this report debated in the Main Committee. The report has aimed to strengthen an integral aspect of the House of Representatives, ensuring that the House committee system continues to meet the needs of the community and the parliament for many years to come. As such, I encourage my colleagues to consider the Procedure Committee's report and to contribute to the debate as they wish. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",155

Two of the most well-known cases are the Moeller and Kiane cases. Dr Moeller was a German GP practising in rural Victoria on a temporary long-stay 457 visa. The Moeller family was refused permanent residency because of 13-year-old Lukas Moeller's Down syndrome. No waiver was available under the permanent skilled visa, PIC 4005, so the Migration Review Tribunal duly rejected the Moeller's application for review of their case. However, following representation by members of federal and state parliaments and media attention, the case was quickly resolved. Luckily for Dr Moeller and his family, the minister exercised his discretionary power and was able to intervene and waive the health requirement in recognition of the compelling and compassionate circumstances, including Dr Moeller's considerable contribution as a rural based medical practitioner to offset any undue costs. Much more tragic was the case of Mr Kiane, an asylum seeker, who received protection in Australia in 1997. Upon receiving a protection visa he sought to sponsor his wife and children to join him. Mr Kiane's split family protection visa application was rejected on the basis that the health requirement was not met by one of his children, an eight-year-old girl with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. The visa has a waiver consideration, PIC 4007, during which family members in Australia offered to guarantee financial and other support. After four and half years in appeal, Mr Kiane subsequently set fire to himself in protest in front of Parliament House in Canberra in 2001. Tragically, he died of his injuries. In its report on the case the Commonwealth Ombudsman expressed, ‘Serious concerns about the fairness and professionalism of the decision-making process.' It is with these sorts of seemingly unfair and tragic outcomes in mind that the committee wrote its report and made its recommendations. The committee's inquiry into the migration treatment of disability has important international origins. In 2008, Australia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the disability convention. This UN treaty proclaimed the rights and values of people with a disability as full and equal participants in society. This parliament is moving to address this issue, not solely because of the UN treaty, but because it is important for the tional interests of Australia and for the fair treatment of people seeking to come here under its immigration program. The migration health requirement set out in the Commonwealth Migration Act 1958 and its regulations is the means by which Australia assesses threats to public health brought from overseas and to contain public health expenditure. Every prospective migrant who wishes to visit or migrate to Australia on a temporary or permanent basis must pass this requirement. The committee's inquiry found that the migration health requirement places an undue emphasis on theoretical costs associated with a particular degree of disability, which disadvantages these applicants relative to others. Currently, if someone is identified as having a health condition, a first consideration is whether the identified level, or degree of the illness or condition will cost the community in excess of the ‘significant cost threshold' beyond which the visa will be rejected. The second consideration is whether granting a visa will prejudice access to services in short supply for other Australians with the same condition. Under this assessment the vast majority of visa applicants in this area-tens of thousands-are successful in passing the health requirement and in gaining a visa. However, the inquiry found that an inordinate number of applicants with a disability or with family members with a disability fail to meet the health requirement. While overall numbers were small-about 1,500-the impact on these families was great. The committee heard from skilled nurses, doctors, scientists and academics who were unable to fill jobs in Australia while waiting for the applicants or that the applicants were being forced to leave after years in such jobs because they had a child with a disability. naThis is, as I said, not just simply a matter of compassion towards visa applicants. (Extension of time granted) Another group who were affected was Australian citizens who could not return home with a stepchild with a disability or reunite with family members left without carers overseas. Others were refugees whose family members were rejected because they had lost a limb under torture or through civil war. The committee found that our present migration regulations explicitly assume disability or conditions associated with a disability will be a cost burden to the wider community. This is based on projected or theoretical costs of health care and community services and payments, such as the disability support pension, irrespective of whether these services would ever be used. In the vast majority of cases, no account is taken of the capacity of the applicant or applicant's family unit to defray costs by care or economic contribution. Neither is there consideration of the economic or social contributions of a migrant or their family. This is an approach that the committee considers needs urgent rectification. The 18 recommendations made by the committee in this report will support changes that will see the significant cost threshold and mode of assessment of disability updated to reflect the actual costs associated with conditions, and the costing methodology made public. Where a person does not meet the health requirement, a waiver discretion is more widely available to assess the social and economic contributions made by a visa applicant, and families have the opportunity to offset costs. Families are not unfairly disadvantaged under the health requirement as a result of a family member having a disability-the ‘one fails, all fail' rule. In Brisbane we had two renal nurses from England who were unable to stay in Australia, despite the great shortage of nurses in the Queensland health system, because one of their children had a disability. These skilled migrants, desconnection perately needed in Australia, had to leave. Finally, for offshore refugee visa applicants who have a disability or other health condition, visa waivers are considered for compelling and compassionate circumstances, especially for family reunion applicants. In particular, by providing greater discretion to migration decision makers at the beginning of the visa process, the committee's recommendations should reduce reliance on the Migration Review Tribunal and ministerial discretion to resolve more difficult migration cases. Overall, this will make for a more efficient, more transparent and more compassionate visa consideration process, especially for people with disability. A lot of the submissions we received argued that the current migration regulations only treat people with disabilities as a burden, not a benefit to Australia, costing Australia rather than enriching it. Many examples were cited of people with disabilities who have come to Australia and achieved great things. One of the cases we heard involved the principle researcher for a University of Western Australia/CSIRO project and his family. The family's visas were rejected at first instance because the applicants' four year old daughter had Down syndrome. A medical officer of the Commonwealth had judged at that time that the girl ‘would be likely to require additional educational resources beyond mainstream education' and ‘supported employment in the future at significant cost to the Australian community'. In this particular instance, a couple of years later, the original decision was overturned by tion. the Migration Review Tribunal. (Time expired)",157

217,Mr KATTER,COMMITTEES,"Kennedy) (9.25 pm)Having presented the Constitution Alteration (Just Terms) Bill 2010, we give notice to the House that we will present a second bill. Whilst the first bill requires Constitutional amendment; the second one is a property rights. Property rights can be removed or diminished by an action of the government only if a budget allocation has been made to compensate under just terms the entity that enjoys or has reasonable expectation of enjoying that right and all affected entities are given reasonable access to that compensaIn presenting the bill to the House, I say that there will be fire and brimstone upon every member of this House, and, please God, the sooner the better. The government has treated with absolute contempt the principle-and the state government is probably worse, if humanly possible, than the federal government-that an Englishman's home is his castle. For those who saw the wonderful Australian movie-maybe the best of all Australian movies-The Castle, it is implicit in that movie the principle that we all believe in. For those who like Russell Crowe, he looks into King John's eyes and King John says, ‘What, you expect me to give every Englishman a castle?' Russell Crowe says, ‘Every Englishman's home is his castle.' We people in North Queensland-and I read an article recently by a fisherman in Adelaide-have had our water rights taken away from us and our timber rights taken away from us. It is very difficult for us to think of a single right that we still enjoywhilst, in theory, the property that is owned by you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, or me or anyone else in this House, has these rights enshrined. Since the days of the Magna Carta it has been true that regardless of your racial background you are a member of the English speaking peoples and those peoples have enjoyed a principle that the Crown is not supreme; the individual has his rights that the Crown cannot assail. In the case of property, if he wants to take that property then let him pay just and rightful compensation for it. Let me be very specific and quote Noel Pearson at the ‘Our land, our sea' conference in North Queensland. He said, ‘For the last 30,000 or 40,000 years, maybe for time immemorial, my people have had access to the water, access to the timber, access to the rocks, access to all of these rights, and a in night'-the Premier of Queensland‘took all of those rights off us without paying a single cent in compensation.' As Noel said: ‘We'll see you in the Hight Court. We have been there before and we beat you last time.' And I will be backing him this time. Peter Spencer had a big rally here at this place. The honourable Leader of the Opposition was there and it was rather ironic-not in any way criticising him for being at the rally-in the sense that almost everything they were complaining about was in fact implemented by the last government, not the current Labor government. Let me simply quote that case. The figures are not correct; not even remotely correct, but the relativities are right. Mr Spencer had a big property, and he had timber on that property. Let us say the value of that property was $2.7 million and the value the banks put on the timber was $1 million. The New South Wales government, under the direction of the last federal government, removed his timber rights. The banks then said, ‘You have just lost $1 million in value, so we are foreclosing on you.' They sold him up for $½ million or whatever it was, leaving him with a debt. That is what we are assailing in this bill. (Time expired) Bill read a first time.",159

219,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. HMAS Sydney",160
220,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,ADJOURNMENT,"Chief Electrical Artificer and acting Chief Petty Officer Allen Leslie Smith thief was somebody I would have called uncle if he had lived. He was onboard HMAS Sydney when it was attacked by the Kormoran, which had been masquerading as a Dutch merchant ship. The battle that ensued meant that every single solitary Australian member of the ship's company-all 645-was lost. Of the Kormoran, the ship that had acted with deception and lured the Sydney so that it lost its firepower advantage, had 317 survivors and lost 80. The stories that have surrounded the Sydney and its wonderful and luminous history prior to it being lost are of the legend variety. The Sydney in 1941 had taken part in battles in the Mediterranean as part of the 7th Cruiser Mediterranean fleet. The Sydney had in battle torpedoed and fired upon Italian ships and had been responsible for sinking the Bartolomeo Colleoni. As Captain Collins-after whom we named our Collins class submarines-ordered the finishing of that ship, cruiser Havock, which was acting in this battle with the Sydney, was standing by to take survivors from the ship. When the Finding Sydney Foundation was formed everyone was delighted that finally a proper search would be made for the Sydney and some of the mystery could be solved. When the ship and the Kormoran were found and we heard again the story of the last halfhour of the Sydney-the only version being the German version-we commemorated the ship and all of her company with a very fine service at St Andrew's Cathedral. The stories of the ship, her courage and her company were celebrated as well as commemorated. In recent times I have had discussions with Allen Leslie Smith's son, my cousin. As I said, Allen died before I was born, but obviously my cousin lost his dad. He and I together are very incensed, as are others in my electorate, about the plaque that is being sent to Germany. It has been negotiated by the Finding Sydney Foundation, after completing arrangements with the German Naval Association and accepting words for the plaque to be sent to Germany to a war museum. The plaque says: In the sea battle off Shark Bay Western Australia between Kormoran and HMAS Sydney on 19 November 1941, 80 Kormoran men and 645 Sydney men were killed. Both ships sank due to the damage they had suffered in battle. In March 2008 the wrecks of Kormoran and Sydney were located by the Finding Sydney Foundation. Today we reach out our hands in friendship, to commemorate those who died at sea together. In memory of those who died in battle, and to remind the living. May the men from both ships rest in peace. It was not an honourable battle. The German ship behaved dishonourably. To whitewash the fact that all Australians were lost and 317 Germans were rescued is to whitewash the greatest loss of naval personnel in the history of Australia. As someone who does have a personal connection and acknowledges it, it is wrong that this plaque be sent. (Time expired) Broadband",160
221,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"Only a few weeks ago the community cabinet visited my electorate of Braddon and I was able to reflect on some of the $450 million worth of investment by this government in my region. In many instances, the government is copartnering with the local government in my region and with the state government. I am very proud that one aspect of that investment is the National Broadband Network. Indeed, Smithton in the far north-west of my electorate, which you have visited on a number of occasions, Mr Speaker, was one of the three starting points in Australia for the National Broadband Network. I was very pleased in April 2009 to be with the Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania when it was announced that the NBN was coming to Tasmania and again in July when the details of the rollout were announced and Smithton was to be one of the starting points. Again, in August, we heard of the establishment of the NBN Co. in Tasmania, namely NBN Tasmania. In October 2009, the shovels began work. They began work certainly in Smithton. Only as recently as June, only a few days ago, the network operation centre was opened in Hobart. I am very pleased to be able to say that there has been a pleasing 48 per cent take-up by eligible premises in the three locations from round 1. Nearly 50 per cent of eligible people have registered to have the fibre-optic high-speed network set up to go to their homes. That is an excellent result indeed. That is the wholesale connection. What we are waiting for now is the retail connections. They will come when we have myriad retailers offering a variety of prices, and thus the competition will begin. Indeed, three providers have already announced that they are interested in the NBN up my way. I notice that one of those is Internode, and they are offering plans of 25 megabits per second, costing just $29.95 and, for 100 megabits per second, offering start-up plans of $59.95. That is a fantastic start. As one of the proponents argues, ‘of course we believe price is the catalyst for rapid adoption.' I know we are on a good thing because those opposite tried a few questions today in question time on the NBN but their back bench were very quiet behind it I can tell you. I knew I had hit paydirt when up in the Main Committee the member for Maranoa was moaning his head off that this ‘won't be a goer' and ‘it won't go here and it won't go there'. Of course, what he was really angry about is that Telstra has now come on board with NBN, as would be the case anyway, sensibly, and now we truly have a new telecommunications structure for the 21st century and onwards. I notice a number of commentators on this matter claim that it is not only important that this new structure works here; I notice the ITU and UNESCO are looking at this set-up very carefully from overseas. It is the view of people like Paul Budde that: Declining telecoms revenues worldwide are an indication that we are reaching the end of the telecoms model whichTelstra has been using telecoms for around 50 years. So, he argues: … with or without the NBN, the traditional telecoms will have to come up with new revenue streams anyway. So the NBN is a goer. Telstra is on board and this system will begin to roll out not just in Tasmania but throughout the nation, and its capacity and its potential is absolutely enormous. (Time expired) Home Insulation Program",161
222,Mr JOHN COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Calare) (9.40 pm)With so many examples of Labor wasting taxpayer funds, mishandling programs and backflipping on policies, you can forgive the public and the press for somewhat forgetting about the Home Insulation Program. While the problem might be out of mind for the Prime Minister, regional businesses and regional communities are all too aware that there are still problems with the scheme. Currently there are businesses still owed money by the government-thousands of dollars are on hold whilst the government's inspections are carried out. The Prime Minister and Minister Garrett, who were responsible for this tragic mess, have not had their payments put on hold, so why should legitimate small business? Why are the small business owners and the insulation contractors paying for the government's poor planning? I wish to inform the House this evening about a scenario being faced by a small business in Parkes, in my electorate of Calare. Hay's Mitre10 was a part of the governments Home Insulation Program. They provided the materials to contractors, who carried out insulation work until the program was dumped by the government. The store is currently owed $26,000 by contractors. The account has been outstanding for six months and the waiting game continues. These contractors are owed by the government and cannot make the payments until they are themselves paid. It is a cycle that is affecting individuals and businesses. It has and will continue to cause businesses to close. It has and will continue to cause workers to lose their jobs. This is their livelihood. It is how they look after their families, send their kids to school and provide for their future. How long can Hay's Mitre10 expect to wait for payments? How many other businesses and contractors are being forced into a similar situation and how many jobs are being threatened by the government's incompetent disaster? Let me say at this moment that at no time should safety be compromised. This scheme has already had tragic consequences, as we all know, with the loss of four lives and over 170 reported house fires. The checking of roofs is a necessity and a must. Australian taxpayers have been forced to provide an extra $1 billion for the peace of mind they deserve. But you have to wonder about the Rudd government's priorities when $38 million is going towards advertising their disastrous supertax and not towards making sure more roofs are checked faster-or never. If they wanted a reason to put out advertising it should have been to warn the public at some stage in the last six or 12 months of the dangers to their own homes care of the Rudd government. Houses remain at risk. Lives remain at risk. The faster these checks can be made the better. The current situation is certainly ing regional communities, I can assure you. On the central west of New South Wales it is hurting them and their families every day. These contractors and these businesses still have bills to pay. The individuals still have mortgages, their employees still have wages and the electricity and gas companies still send their bills. They have been forced to cover the government debt and the government incompetence. The government should do more to help these businesses and more to help these regional communities. I can only ponder why the minister for small businesses has not been championing this cause in caucus and here in parliament. The Home Insulation Program, like so many of the government's schemes, was poorly planned and even more poorly executed. It has cost taxpayers billions and continues to slug regional communitiescertainly in my part of the world. Whilst the Prime Minister may have put it out of his mind, we in the coalition and we in regional Australia have not. I urge the Prime Minister and Minister Combet to fix this situation and let businesses like Hay's Mitre10 in Parkes get on with looking after families in regional communities. Petition: National Schools Curriculum",162
223,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to present a petition to the House regarding the inclusion of the Modern Greek language in the national curriculum that is currently being developed by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority. This petition is significant not only because it is the second bilingual petition to ever be presented to the federal parliament but also because its 19,067 signatures are part of an ongoing nationwide campaign to draw the House's attention to the importance of Modern Greek as a language of cultural, historical and economic hurtimportance to the broader Australian community. The Petitions Committee, of which I am a member, recently approved the petition which I present to the House this evening. This petition also reflects a long standing passion of mine involving the development and teaching of languages other than English in the Australian teaching curriculum, an issue I first addressed in this parliament in 2005. The truth is that over the years, despite successive government policies on language learning and teaching, we have not really succeeded in reaping the maximum benefits of Australia's existing multilingual resource capabilities. The languages spoken in this country come from the hundreds of immigrant communities that have settled here and, of course, the many languages and dialects of Indigenous Australians. In my electorate of Calwell alone there are 140 nationalities and 125 languages other than English spoken at home and I am often witness to the benefits and day-today functionality of speaking a second language. In fact, the language dynamics of my electorate mirror a wider community feeling that we should see bilingualism and multilingualism as one of our greatest tools for enhancing democracy, cultural awareness, intellectual development, trade and diplomacy. As a result of this, when developing guages curriculum I feel we should be mindful not to restrict ourselves by sticking too rigidly to concepts such as community languages and economic languages. We can advance our capacity better if we take a universal approach to the teaching of languages other than English and their relevance to the Australian community must be paramount. Successful language capability can only be achieved if the languages taught have infrastructure which makes them viable in the long term. They must have a dynamic application and a direct relevance to Australia's domestic and international agenda. As such we need to strike a working balance between the so-called economic languages and the existing community languages. To exclude one group at the expense of the other is to set a path for failure in our long-term development. The number of signatures gathered for the petition I present this evening are the first of more to come and are a strong indicator that in this case the Modern Greek language has become not only a relevant working language and resource for the 365,000 people who identify with Greek ancestry but also a linguistic means for future generations of Australians to connect with the global community. I would like to thank the many thousands of people who have played an integral role in putting this petition and campaign together. Among the many I would like to thank are the Modern Greek Teachers Association of Victoria, La Trobe University's department of Modern Greek language, and the other Greek departments in schools and universities across Australia. I would also like to thank my colleague the member for Hindmarsh for the incredible amount of work that he has done in relation to this petition. I would like to also acknowledge the assisa lantance of the Greek Orthodox community of Melbourne and Victoria, the World Council of Hellenes Abroad, the Australian Hellenic Council, SBS, 3ZZZ community radio, Neos Kosmos, other media outlets, and community representatives. In conclusion I want to make special mention of the petition's principal signatory; the deputy editor-in-chief of Australia's largest circulating Greek newspaper Neos Kosmos, Kon Nikopoulos. For more than 30 years Kon Nikopoulos has been a passionate advocate of multicultural issues through the media and the community. Kon believes, like the many who have signed the petition, that community languages are the hallmark of cultural identity and that they serve as a central point of bringing people together. The petition to include the Modern Greek language in the national curriculum is also about giving the wider community the choice to get involved and benefit from a culture that forms a large sector of the Australian population. The sheer volume of signatures in this petition is testament to how genuine the community is in giving the Australian nation the opportunity to embark on a journey to experience and learn more about the Greek language and culture. Community languages are, after all, about the journey of sharing with others what is uniquely important and relevant to the multicultural fabric that makes up our nation of Australia. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Certain citizens of Australia including representatives of community, educational, political organisations, institutions and establishments across the country draws to the attention of the House: The matter the importance of including the Modern Greek language in the National Schools Curriculum as a language of cultural, community, historical and economic importance to Australia and the Australian people. We therefore ask the House to: Ensure that the Modern Greek language is included in the National Schools Curriculum currently being developed by the Australian Curriculum and Reporting Authority. from 19,067 citizens Petition received. Education Funding",163
224,Mr SECKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Be it as I am unexpectedly here to speak on this occasion, I think we have some very important points as a coalition to put forward. I note that it was only a couple of days ago that we announced our regional education fund. As a member of a very rural electorate-Barker has often been referred to as the most rural electorate in Australia; it is a wonderful electorate-we have had some extraordinary feats in the area of agriculture. We only need to look at, for example, how good we are at producing wine in the electorate of Barker. With areas such as the Barossa and the Coonawarra and Padthaway and Mount Benson and Wrattonbully and the River Murray regions, we are very proud of what we do. But it is also very important that we educate our young. We have a very important task in rural areas to ensure that we can educate our young and give them the same sorts of abilities and capacities that their city cousins have. That is why we announced on the weekend the regional education fund. If elected a coalition government will invest $1 billion in a new regional education fund that will provide capital investment and additional support for schools, vocational and education training providers and universities in rural and reof gional areas. Rural people find it much harder to go to university. The fact is that most of the students in my electorate have to leave home to attend university unless they have the opportunity to attend one of the few regional universities, given the limited subjects that they have. I think this really goes to the fact that we originally set up the Higher Education Endowment Fund, or the HEEF, with an initial capital of $5 billion and a subsequent contribution of $1 billion to provide universities with a regular long-term source of infrastructure funding. Upon coming into government, Labor took our idea and renamed the Higher Education Endowment Fund as the Education Investment Fund. Unfortunately, they have drawn down its funds, built up by the previous coalition government, raiding what was meant to be a perpetual, secure, long term source of financing for university infrastructure. As there is only $2 billion remaining in that fund from the original fund-it has not taken Labor very long to draw that down-the coalition would redirect the interest earned from $1 billion of it to finance new projects in regional areas as part of the regional education fund while the capital would stay secure and untouched. That is one of the large differences between the Labor government and the coalition: they have drawn on it without actually returning those funds to the original amount that was set aside by us. This fund will be a long-term investment. It will be flexible, allowing schools, vocational and education training providers and universities to have the freedom to nominate important projects which might include new buildings, equipment or even programs designed to support and encourage teachers to move into or stay in regional and remote areas. The REF aims to improve educational services by providing funding to regional, rural and remote organisations and universities, to establish new facilities or to enhance facilities where a lack of infrastructure, capital works and/or equipment can be demonstrated as a barrier to the delivery of essential education services. It will increase the range of, or enhance, existing educational pathways available to students from regional, rural and remote Australia. It will improve the current resources and facilities available to assist with attracting to regional areasand retaining in those areas-the best teachers and academic staff and it will improve the viability of smaller university campuses and smaller education providers in order to support local, rural and remote communities to develop flexible, long-term solutions for the provision of services to meet community needs. (Time expired) Mr Gilad Shalit",165
225,Mr DREYFUS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise again to speak with deep sadness on the anniversary of the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit. This is the third occasion on which I have spoken on this anniversary in this place and I hope it will be the last. On 25 June 2006, Corporal Gilad Shalit was kidnapped in a cross-border raid into Israel by the armed wing of Hamas, which is a terrorist organisation proscribed in Australia. Two of his fellow soldiers were killed in the raid. He was 19 at the time; he is now 23. For four years he has been held by Hamas. In contravention of the Geneva convention, he is being held as a hostage by a terrorist organisation. The International Committee of the Red Cross and all other representatives have been denied access to him. For his family these have been agonising years. Hamas continues to hold Gilad Shalit as a bargaining chip, seeking to secure the release of hundreds of terrorists being held in Israeli prisons. It is important that leaders around the world continue to demand the release of Gilad Shalit. A former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in welcoming the easing of restrictions on Gaza by the Israeli government, yesterday repeated his call for Gilad Shalit to be released immediately. Let us be very clear about what Hamas is. This is a terrorist organisation that seized power in Gaza through a violent coup. It is a regime that tortures and murders independent activists, including trade unionists. The 1998 Hamas Charter commits Hamas to establishing an Islamic caliphate in the Middle East. It is committed to the destruction of the state of Israel and includes genocidal references aimed at Jews. Hamas is not an organisation that accepts anything that is known and understood about human rights in Australia. It has a totalitarian approach to all media and education in Gaza, which feature incitements to genocide and glorification of suicide bombing and terrorism. Internally, Hamas has carried out attacks on mosques, including in Rafah in August 2009, when the Hamas Brigade surrounded a mosque, firing rocket grenades and killing more than 20 Palestinians, including an 11year-old girl, because of what it perceived as a threat to its authority. Contrast the coverage of this event with the coverage of the recent tragic flotilla incident. Reports on the true nature of Hamas, and the reasons for the ongoing blockade, have been absent in recent news coverage. Criticism of Israel, ostensibly based on concern for the welfare and rights of residents of Gaza, would be more credible if criticism were also directed towards the current rulers of Gaza, Hamas, and its behaviour, which is exemplified in the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit. The Australian government has responded to the flotilla incident by attending to the welfare of Australians citizens involved by expressing concern about the loss of life and by calling for the establishment of an independent Israeli inquiry into the incident. It is very clear that this is necessary to ensure that there is no repeat of the Goldstone report approach. We have reiterated our support for Israel and recognise the unique security challenges that Israel faces-from Iran and the terrorist organisations that Iran supports, including Hamas. And we have called for the allowing of additional aid into Gaza. At no time has the Australian government called for a lifting of the blockade. In particular, the Prime Minister has confirmed that Australia recognises the need for Israel to prevent arms shipments into Gaza. There has been a welcome announcement overnight of an easing of the blockade. Considerable humanitarian aid has been going into Gaza from Israel for several years but more can be done. Israel has announced that it will publish a list of items not permitted into Gaza and will let all other items through. Construction material will be permitted for infrastructure projects under international supervision. Capacity at crossings will be increased to enable a significantly greater volume of goods into Gaza. To end this blockade is simple: Hamas must end the rocket attacks on Israel, of which there have been more than 5,000 in the last four years. It must cease importing arms from Iran. We should not forget Israel's particular security situation. Israel continues to face existential threats in its region, in particular from Iran and its terrorist clients. Iran remains the great threat to the Middle East. Iran has funded and armed its terrorist clients, including Hamas, so that these terrorist organisations can continue their attacks on Israel. Israel has the right and the responsibility to ensure that Hamas does not build up an arsenal with which to terrorise Israeli citizens. Israel is entitled to maintain a legal blockade that intercepts arms which will be targeted at its citizens. Hamas must renounce violence, must renounce attacks on civilians and must renounce its commitment to the destruction of the state of Israel. It must cease violating international law and immediately release Gilad Shalit.",166

Mr Champion to move: That this House: (1) notes that the Rudd Government's $3.1 billion water purchasing plan has secured 110 litres of water to environmental sites across South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales; (2) notes the pending release of a draft report from the independent Murray Darling Basin Authority, which details a long term plan to save the Murray in the near future; (3) notes that the division and disunity in the Liberal and National parties over the Leader of the Opposition's proposal for a potential referendum to give the Federal Government control of the Murray darling Basin if the State Government's refuse to relinquish control; and (4) notes the negative impact and policy uncertainty a potential referendum has on the Murray Darling Basin plan. Ms Parke to move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) 29 May 2010 was the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers and 19 August 2010 will be World Humanitarian Day. These special days commemorate United Nations (UN) and humanitarian workers who provide life-saving assistance to millions of people around the world, who work in conflict zones and areas of natural hazards and who place their own lives at risk in the line of duty; (b) Australia has been a strong supporter of UN peacekeeping operations since the first mission in 1947 and is one of the top 20 contributors to the UN peacekeeping budget; (c) the UN's total peacekeeping budget is US$6.8 billion, or half of one per cent of global military spending, indicating that building and keeping the peace is overwhelmingly cheaper than the pursuit of war; (d) there are over 124,000 military and civilian men and women working in 15 different UN missions around the world. They are not there for personal gain; rather they are engaged in maintaining peace and security and also in building the political, social and economic infrastructure required to ensure conflict zones can make the lasting transition to peace; (e) UN and other humanitarian workers are increasingly being targeted for political and ideological reasons. In the last decade, more than 800 humanitarian workers have died while striving to help those most in need in some of the world's most hostile environments; and (f) the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on 12 January 2010, taking the lives of thousands of Haitians and almost a hundred UN civilian and military peacekeepers was the biggest single loss of life in the history of UN peacekeeping. Prior to that, the largest loss of UN staff life in a single event was the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August 2003. (2) Commends the vital work carried out by UN peacekeepers and other humanitarian workers and calls upon all United Nations member states to ensure the safety and security of UN peacekeepers and other humanitarian workers in the line of duty, and to appropriately punish perpetrators of violence against humanitarian workers.

First, it is correct to say has responsibility that encompasses governis a responsibility that is shared with other minister, as a former minister, would underManagement and Accountability Act and the Act which govern the arrangements that apply managing the spending of government money with ministers. So there is, in effect, a shared Minister for Finance and Deregulation, but other that are crucial to this overall approach. from the book that he refers to, obviously I do not to have said or not said in cabinet or cabinet position. I can only refer him to a quote that I along the lines that I brought to these discusminister's responsibility of seeking to test of any spending proposals that I see that as a that testing or challenging of any proposals, or indeed matters that are put to me biNA laterally by ministers. That is essentially liberations of cabinet or cabinet committees. With respect to the specific matters that ters that are more specifically within the purview minister for finance.
