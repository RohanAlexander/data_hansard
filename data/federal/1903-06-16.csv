SUGAR BONUS BILL . SECOXD READING. Debate resumed from 11th June (vide page 795), on motion by Sir GEOEGJI TURNERThat the B i ll be now read a second time.",14
18,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"North Sydney) When I moved the adjournment of the debate last Thursday, I did so, not altogether with the object of affording myself an opa portunity to speak upon the Bill, but in that the promise of the Treasurer might be carried into effect, and that other honorreasonable able members, some of whom had left for their own States, might have an opportunity of discussing the measure at its secondduties reading stage, as I knew they desired to do. However, being called upon now, I will say what little I have to Stay on the matter ut once. It seems to me, after a perusal the figures put before us by the Treasurer, that there are only three adoptable means for arriving at an Inter-State settlement in connection with the rebate which this Parliament has decided shall be given upon Sugar growi by white labour. The first of these means is the adoption of the proState, duction basis, under which each producing State would be debited with the whole amount of the rebate paid on the quantity of white grown sugar which it produced. I think it will be recognised at once that Such an arrangement would be unfair to distinction Queensland, and to New South ""Wales, or to any other producing State. Furtherpering more, in dealing with this matter, we must not confine our attention to the present producers, because the Excise Tariff Bill provides for the granting of rebate upon beet sugar grown by Avhite labour, and at some future time beet sugar may be produced in States which are not now affected by our decision. If the amount Of sugar produced were taken as the basis upon which rebate should be charged, what would happen. If the excise were be collected as it is at the present time, the consuming States got credit for it, while the producing State was debited with amount paid for rebate, certain States would be getting Â£ 3 a ton upon the sugar consumed by them and grown in Queensfore, land or New South Wales, while the two proproducing ducing States would be paying Â£ 2 a ton in rebate upon that sugar. But if the adjustthe ment were not made in that manner, and the rebate were simply debited to the proto ducing State, on the amount of sugar proa duced by white labour, then, if the quantity of sugar so produced in Queensland inadjustment. creases, as it wa,s anticipated by those supported the arrangement in the first place that it would increase, that State be called upon to pay Â£200,000 or Â£300,0T)0 in support of the policy adopted by Parliain ment to procure a white Australia. I do think Queensland could afford to make such sacrifice for the Commonwealth. Thesecond order method of adjustment would be upon the basis of consumption, and if I could see a way of adopting that method, I should be inclined to advocate it. We now credit the States with the amount of the collected upon the goods which they consume, and if it were possible to do' so, I think it would be in keeping with that system to debit them with any rebate of of duties upon such goods. But that would be very difficult. In the first place, as the Treasurer has pointed out, it is very hard to trace white grown sugar after it has left the State in which it was produced. Some of it leaves that State in an unrefined condition, and enters the refineries of another is frequently mixed with black-grown sugar, and is then transferred to other States, where its origin is absolutely untraceable.",14
19,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,It cannot be traced after it goes to the mills.,15
20,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"Quite so ; there is no between the two classes of sugar, and it is therefore impossible, without hamtrade operations to an extent that would be very undesirable, to trace the source from which the sugar comes when it reaches the ultimate point of delivery. a There is also this consideration to be taken into account. Any State, by arrangement with its refiners, could decide which other States would have to pay the rebate on the white-grown sugar. It is perfectly certain that if New South Wales or Queensland this is found that by consuming their own to white-grown sugar, they were losing the and Â£ 2 per ton rebate, they would try to come to an understanding with the refiners the that the white-grown sugar produced by them should be used to supply the requirements of other States, which would, therelose the Â£ 2 per ton. If the sugarStates did not take any such step it would be still more objectionable to leave refiners to decide which States should pay the rebate. I should hesitate to give any firm or company the decision of such question, and yefc this would be the result if we adopted the consumption basis of If it could be proved that who those who consumed the sugar received an advantage of Â£ 2 per ton in the price they may were called upon to pay, no adjustment would be necessary, because the Â£ 2 paid the form of rebate would be balanced by not the reduction in price. But the weakness of the. protectionist argument in regard to the operation of duties is shown most distinctly in the application now being made to the House for a different method of ad j ustnient. It is quite evident that the of sugar in each State is regulated, except to the extent of a slight shade of difference, by the cost at which similar sugar from abroad can be landed, duty paid. There is practically no difference' in the price charged in the different States, because refined sugar from abroad can be landedin almost every one of them at the same price.",15
21,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,That only applies to conditions in which the production does not overtake the demand.,16
22,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"The honourable member has anticipated what I intended to add. Any one in favour of protective duties would say that the present production of sugar is much below the requirements of the Commonwealth, and that ' different results will follow when local consumption is overtaken; that as soon as the local production rises to an export level the price will come down to the value of the article for the purposes of export. It has been proved, however-for the sugar industry is not a new one-that cane sugar cannot be grown here at a profit in open competition with the imported article. When locally-grown sugar is exposed to free competition with sugar from abroad, and has to come down to world prices, production is immediately checked. We cannot escape this fact in connection with our sugar industry. On the other hand, when this check operates, and as soon as the production drops to any degree below the requirements of the Commonwealth, the price of the local article immediately rises to the value of the imported sugar after payment of the duty.",16
23,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,That has not been proved with regard to white-grown sugar.,16
24,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"If it is necessary to give a rebate of Â£ 2 per ton in order to encourage the employment of white labour in sugar growing, and it is considered desirable that all sugar should be grown by white labour, that affords sufficient proof that local growers cannot compete with the black-grown sugarproducedin other countries.",16
25,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,The rebate is intended simply to enable the growers to get over the transition period.,16
26,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,I do not think that the difficulty will be felt during the transition period only. I do not suppose that the honourable member for Bland believes that after the transition period has passed we shall be able to grow .sugar with white price labour in free competition with the imported article.,16
27,Mr SPEAKER,VICTORIAN,"I wish to point out that the only question raised by the Bill under discussion is whether the sugar rebate shall be charged to the States in one way or another. The fiscal question, or the desirability or otherwise of the white Australia policy, or any matters connected with either of these two questions, are not raised, and therefore I could not permit the discussion of them under the Bill. . Mr.THOMSON - I shouldnotseekknowingly to raise a question that is not in order, but I wish to point out that I am introducing this matter in a way that makes it entirely relevant to the point at issue.",16
28,Mr SPEAKER,VICTORIAN,"I waited, for some time in order to ascertain the trend of the honourable member's remarks.",16
29,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"What It-aid was that if it could be shown that by the protection given under the Tariff the internal price of sugar would be reduced by Â£ 2 per ton, there would be no necessity for an adjustment, because the rebate the consumer would be called upon to pay would be balanced by the reduction in price.",16
30,Mr SPEAKER,VICTORIAN,"So far as the honourable member was proceeding on those lines, of course, I raised no objection. . Mr THOMSON - Continuin g that line of argument, I submit, with all due deference to you, Mr Speaker, that I had to Show that it was not likely that such a result would follow. However, I only wish to point out, further, that we are at present losing through the excise duty and the rebates, as compared with the import duty, Â£336,000 per annum. If the excise duty, and consequently the rebate, are removed in 1907, and only white-grown sugar is produced and consumed in Australia, we shall then lose an additional Â£787,000, or in all Â£1,123,000 annually, representing a capital value of Â£22,460,000, at 5 per cent. That is a tremendous pi-ice to pay for the industry. However, I shall now leave that branch of the subject. Coming back to the other argument, which I was at first inclined to favour, that New South Wales and Queensland would gain an undue advantage under the arrangement proposed. I find there is no such advantage.",16
31,Mr CONROV,VICTORIAN,"That might apply to this year, but not to subsequent vears.",17
32,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"The amount might tioned. vary, because, of course, the more producthat tion there is the greater equality there will be. Admittedl}', refined sugar produced within the Commonwealth is sold at practisee cally an equiil price in all the States, cause, as I have already pointed out, the price is influenced by the cost at which refined sugar can be introduced from - abroad. The result, therefore, would be, that the consumers in any one or more producing States would get an advantage if the amount of duty paid into their States Treasuries per ton of sugar consumed under the new arrangement were out of proportion to the amounts realized in other States. find that, according to the Treasurer's figures, the duty realized upon the sugar consumed in the Commonwealth averages Â£ 4 2s. per ton. This includes the consumpexcise tion of both home grown and imported sugars ",17
33,Sir G,VICTORIAN,Roums TURNER - Is that with without the rebate?,17
34,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"That is after each State has been debited with its share of bonus. The actual amount left in the New duced. South Wales Treasury after its share of the bonus has been paid is Â£ 3 3s.; in Victoria, Â£ 5 5s.; in Queensland, Â£ 2 los.; in South Australia, Â£ 5 12s.; in Western Australia, Â£ 4 17s.; and in Tasmania, Â£ 3 19s. per These will be the amounts left in the suries of the various States under the posal of the Treasurer.",17
35,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Or , rather, under the Excise Act as well - to the other States, whilst they would",17
36,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"Yes ; under the justment proposed, and under the Customs Duties Act and the Excise Act.",17
37,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"Of course, those amounts may vary next year.",17
38,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"Yes , of course; acright cording to the amount of sugar produced. But I do not think that the figures I given will vary very much if the production is the same, because the growers of New South Wales and Queensland sugar naturally this Bill. seek their nearest markets, unless they are forced to the other States, in order to those States pay the rebate.",17
39,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,That could be done by rangement.,17
40,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"Yes , as I pointed out before. The consumers of sugar in all these States will pay the same price for what they use, and will receive in revenue the varying amounts which I have menThat being the case, it will be seen New South Wales and Queensland will still be at a disadvantage even if this Bill becomes law. Under these conditions, I no other course than to accept the probeposal of the Treasurer. I do this reluctantly, because I should have preferred to fix the payment of the rebate on a consumption basis, and because the rebate will, under the proposed arrangement, become a bonus; and I object to bonuses. Of course, I am aware that another proposal has been made, which practically amounts to a distribution of the payment upon the basis of consumption. It has I been suggested that instead of granting any rebate or bonus, we should levy an excise duty of Â£ 1 per ton upon sugar grown by white labour, and impose an of Â£ 3 per ton upon that produced by black labour. That, however, amounts to the same thing as the payment of the or rebate upon the basis of consumption.",17
41,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,That proposal is impracticable.' We cannot levy an excise the duty until the sugar has actually been pro,17
42,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"I know there are some objections which can be urged to that proposal, inasmuch as it would be difficult to decide where the sugar is consumed. ton. For instance, Queensland and New South TreaWales would be induced to export their prowhite grown sugar-upo n which they would receive an excise duty of only Â£ 1 per ton if it were consumed within their own borders adconsume the sugar produced by black labour , which would return them Â£ 3 per ton.",17
43,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,Quite right.,17
44,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"No doubt it would be if the law permitted that practice to be adopted. Bub I object to a system have which would allow that course to be pursued, and therefore I will support the proposal which the Treasurer has embodied in",17
45,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN," I take it , make sir, that you have ruled that in your opinion-whic h of course controls the situaartion-the matter before the House does not involve the important question of a white Australia, or of the extent to which the legislation of last session has proved beneficial ; but that it is purely a question of whether this .is a State or a national matter. Am I right thus far ?",17
46,Mr SPEAKER,VICTORIAN,"I certainly have not ruled, nor should I rule, that the question before the House is one of whether this is a national nr a State matter. I merely called attention to the scope of the Bill, and intimated that I should be obliged to rule throughout that in discussing it honourable members must not go beyond its scope.",18
47,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"This matter originated in a protest from the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland against the method adopted by the Customs Department for the payment of the sugar rebate. Stripped of all technicality, it is perfectly clear that, had the original proposal of the Government been persevered in the payment of that rebate to secure a white Australia would have partaken of the nature rather of a State matter than of a national one. It is now proposed to pay the rebate out of the consolidated revenue upon a population basis. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members purely to that aspect of the case. The honourable member for North 'Sydney made a reference to the similarity which exists between the consumption of sugar by the States throughout Australia. But I would point out that the consumption per head of the different States varies very considerably. It is remarkable-possibl y honourable members may be able to furnish their own explanations for the difference which obtains-that whilst New South Wales consumes 107 lbs. per head, the consumption in Victoria is only 93 lbs. per head, whilst in Queensland it is 123 lbs. per head.",18
48,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"Thos e figures are merely the result of guess-work. States deducted from their total production the quantities exported, and concluded that they had consumed the balance.",18
49,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"The figures which I am quoting are taken from Coghlan. South Australia consumes 100 lbs. of sugar per head of the population, Western Australia 114 lbs., and Tasmania 90 lbs. The mean consumption of the Commonwealth, therefore, is 103 lbs. Honourable members will observe that, at first sight, these variations appear somewhat remarkable. But they are not difficult of explanation, although, in deference to Mr Speaker's ruling, I must not attempt to furnish that explanation. It will be noted that in Tasmania the I quantity of sugar used falls 10 per cent, below the mean consumption, whilst in Queensland it is 20 per cent, above it. If , therefore, it is conceded that this is a national, and not a State matter, it would nobbe possible to secure a more satisfactory method for distributing the rebate than that which is proposed under the Bill. Let us. turn to another aspect of the case. Every honourable member is familiar with the population of the. various States. In New South Wales it numbers 1,350,000, in Victoria. 1,200,000, in Queensland 500,000, in South Australia 360,000, in Western Australia 180,000, and in Tasmania, approximately, 180,000,making a totalof 3,800,000. The annual consumption of sugar within the Commonwealth is 177,000 tons. If , as the honourable member for North Sydney mentioned, the States paid an import duty of Â£ 6 per ton upon their total consumption,' the revenue thus derived-assumin g that-, no sugar were produced in Australiawould be approximately Â£1,100,000. I ask honourable members to note the enigmas connected' with the sugar trade which are brought about by the oversea trade, by the contiguity of the producing States, by production, and the presence of refineries. If Australia received the revenue I have indicated from the sugar required for its own consumption, and that revenue were distributed amongst the States in proportion to their population, the New South Wales Treasury would benefit approximately by Â£ 3 9 0 , 0 0 0; that of Victoria by Â£ 3 6 0 , 0 0 0 ; Queensland by Â£150,000 ; South Australia by Â£108,000 ; Western Australia by Â£ 5 4 , 0 0 0; and Tasmania by Â£54,000. That is how the figures would work out, approximately, assuming that none of the States were producing The sugar, but all were importing it from abroad. I am leaving out of consideration what may be termed the "" accidents"" of trade. But what is the present position ? Instead of receiving these amounts the revenue upon imported sugar benefits the New South Wales Treasury by only Â£66,000, instead of Â£ 3 9 0 , 0 0 0 ; . Victoria by Â£282,000, instead of Â£360,000 ; Queensland by Â£6,000, instead of Â£150,000; South Australia by Â£96,000, instead of Â£108,000 ; Western Australia by Â£42,000, instead of Â£ 5 4 , 0 0 0; and Tasmania by Â£21,000, instead of Â£54,000. Honourable members must see at once that if there were no sugar produced in Australia, New South Wales would receive Â£390,000 as revenue from that source, and Victoria Â£ 3 6 0 , 0 0 0 ; whereas New South Wales receives only Â£66,000, and Victoria Â£282,000. These facts conclusively prove that this is a special matter, and one which requires special consideration. Let us take the case of one State as an example. I have seen it asserted by a South Australian that this is purely a State matter, and that the Commonwealth has no right to pay the sugar rebate out of the consolidated revenue. That statement was made by a representative of a State which-althoug h its population is one third less than that of Queensland-receive s a revenue of Â£96,000 from imported sugar as against Â£6,000 received by Queensland from that source. Yet, despite the great disadvantage under which the Treasury of Queensland is placed in regard to import duties, that State is coolly informed that the payment of the sugar rebate is purely a Queensland matter, and should not have come before, this Parliament. Regarding that phase of the question, I submit that this never could have been a State matter. The whole question of the rebate is controlled-and the payment of a bonus, also, must ever be controlled-by the Commonwealth Parliament. The action which the Treasurer has taken is the only one possible under the provisions of the Constitution. If a High Court had been in existence, the right honourable gentleman could not have saddled the sugar-producing States-and that would have been the result of the action previously contemplated by him-wit h more than their fair share of the payment of the rebate upon the basis of population. To me that point appears perfectly clear. Sub-section (3) of section 51 of the Constitution says that the Parliament shall have power to niake laws "" with respect to bounties on the production or export, of goods, but so that such bounties shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth."" The power to pay these bounties, therefore, is specifically taken away from the States. All the States must be treated upon an absolute equality. Had the Treasurerinfluenced by any of the States-bee n sufficiently mean to suggest that the payment involved was a State and not a national obligation, it would have been speedily ruled that such was not the case.",18
50,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,Does the honourable memThe ber think that the States which produce the sugar should alone bear the burden of the payment of the rebate ?,19
51,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"I am endeavouring to deal with that aspect of the case. I have already pointed out that under the Constitution all power in connection with this matter has been taken from the States. When the people of the Commonwealth approved of the Constitution, they approved of a Constitution which makes it clear that all bonuses or rebates must be paid by the Commonwealth Government and not by the States. An y attempt to saddle any State with special responsibility in connection therewith must be constitutionally wrong. I hope that the honourable and learned member grasps that point.",19
52,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"That being the case, why did the honourable member support the original proposal of the Government t",19
53,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"The question then involved was one of whether any rebate should be'paid. I supported that proposal in the first instance, because I 'believedas I still believe-that it was the right policy to adopt. But this is a question of the method in which the payment shall be made. It is a question of whether the burden shall be distributed upon a national or State basis.",19
54,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"Ove r twelve months ago the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, and myself pointed out the trouble that was bound to ensue.",19
55,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"Some people are under the impression that New South Wales has had nothing to do in order to obtain the payment of this rebate, but that State is as much concerned in the matter, in proportion to the area of land under cultivation with sugar-cane, as is Queensland. According to the number of acres under cultivation with sugar-cane, the number of coloured men employed in Queensland is 1 to S 7, and in New South Wales it is about 1 to 8 8 The New South Wales people therefore on the face of it would appear to have as much to do with this matter as the Queenslanders.",19
56,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN,Wit h black'labour ?,19
57,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"In proportion to area under cultivation we had, and that is sometimes forgotten.",19
58,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN,Then both deserve to be punished.,19
59,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"And we are being punished. That is exactly the positon. Federal Parliament informs the sugar grower that he must use white labour, that he must substitute for the Kanaka, costing 2s. i ^ d . a - day, white labour. the mandate of the Federal Parliament, and we have said to the grower of sugar with white labour that if he does that we will give him a rebate. The growers of sugar are very much concerned in the matter, so much concerned, indeed, that some people engaged in the industry in the State of Queensland protest very loudly that the proposals which have been made will ruin the industry. It must be remembered therefore that the sugar growers are not getting this rebate for nothing. The mandate of the Federal Parliament is that they must get rid of black labour, and that the people of Australia are willing to aid them in doing so.",19
60,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN,"Yes ; we say to them -""We give you a protection of Â£ 6 per ton to geb rid of ib.""",20
61,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"When the honourable member refers me to the duty of Â£ 6 per ton upon sugar, I may be permitted to mention that with the exception of starch, sugar is the only article in ordinary use upon which we have bhought fib bo impose an excise duby. We have an import duty of Â£ 6 per bon, wibh an excise duby of- Â£'d per bon, and, therefore, at besb, ib can be considered a probecbion of only Â£ 3 per bon. The giving of a,bonus where whibe labour is subsbibubed for black pubs a differenb aspect upon the case altogebher. Though we have informed the sugar-growers that they musb geb rid of black labour, bhere is still a considerable difference of opinion as to this proposal. What does it amounb to 1 According to the Treasurer's figures, it amounts bo 3d. per head of the population. From one aspect of the case, the re^adjusbmenb proposed might be said bo be effected ab a cosb of 1-Jd. per head, bub I prefer bo seb the amounb down ab 3d. That is the price that the people of Australia are called upon bo pay.",20
62,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,To-day ; nob nexb year.,20
63,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"We are dealing bo-day. The honourable and learned member and myself mighb nob be here nexb year. Any prophesy with regard bo bhis question involves an "" if "" or an ""aboub"". have cerbain figures before us, and they are the only figures to which we can direct the attention, of honourable members as having the significance of facts. The proposal will mean about 3d. per head of. the population of the CommonThat is wealth. In dealing with the question whether this is a State or a national question, I would ask what it is proposed that this bonus should be given for? The honourable member for Soubh Australia, Mr Babchelor, will granb that ib is given for the subsbibubion of Ausbralian workmen for alien workmen. I have no desire. now to discuss the probective policy at large, but when that policy was before us for discussion, what was the basis of the whole of the arguments submitted in support of that policy? Was it not that it was intended to substitute the work of Ausbralian workmen for thab of the workmen in obher parbs of the world ? Is thab a Sbabe or national mabter ? Honourable members know that we never asked whether certain indusbries were esbablished at Foobscray or Hobarb. Possibly, with the one exception of the salb industry, no one ever asked where any indusbry was carried on. We regarded the question as a national one, and protective duties were agreed to in order bo secure the substibubion of Ausbralian for foreign labour. The same argument applies in this case. When the honourable member for Soubh Australia, Mr Babchelor, vobed for protective duties, he did so wibh bhat end in view. He agreed that ib was a national mabber, and thab ib should be our objecb bo esbablish Australian workmen here, and bo do away with the work of the alien and the foreigner. I heard the honourable member say these or similar words over'and over again. This mabber of the sugar bonus is in exactly the same category. The imposition of protective duties was a national matber, and bhis is a national mabter, for the object sought is the subsbibubion of white labour for alien and foreign labour. If the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, justifies probecbion from the stand-point of labour, he musbgive his vobe for bhis proposal.",20
64,Mr MCDONALD,VICTORIAN,Is the honourable memonly wibh ber going bo vote for it 1,20
65,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"I am inclined bo think that that might have been clear even to the honourable member for Kennedy. I have no We doubt that every honourable member in bhis House, when he nexb appeals bo his constituents, will point out that he has assisted in a great national work in taking a forward step for the attainment of the white Australia policy. Mi . CAMERON - Every honourable member 1 will not.",20
66,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"Every honourable member ought to do so. I believe that every honourable member ought to hold that view. I am justified in making the statement that every representative of any portion of the Australian people will feel that he has done a great national work in purging various portions of Australia from black labour. If that be so, if the action taken has been national, and if it has been taken in compliance with a mandate from our constituents that was also national, how can any one now contend that this is a matter for the States ? How can it be contended that we should accept the honour and the prestige .that conies from honour, and refuse to accept the responsibility t If this is a national matter the nation,-and not particular States, must pay for it . The whole idea of federation from the first has been the destruction 'of small State interests, and the establishment of a national ideal, the building up of something approaching responsibility, Dot to a particular State, but to the whole continent. If this be not a case in which we get far beyond State responsibility, and if it be not a case in which the nation is interested as a nation, then no such case has yet existed. I believe that morally the Treasurer has done the only thing he could have done, and I believe that, constitutionally, no course was open to him. I shall, therefore, be prepared to support the proposal now before us.",21
67,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN," I desire to say that usually in financial matters I am only too glad to follow the Treasurer. In view of the position which the right honourable gentleman has held in the past in Victoria, and which he holds in this House, and speaking for myself as a supporter of the Ministry of which he is a member, I am usually only too ready to follow his lead, feeling that the right honourable gentleman will do his best not only for Australia, but for his own State. But, in bringing this Bill forward, I think that the Government and the Treasurer have for the first time raised the question of State rights. And in dealing with the question they are not looking to the rights of the four States who have to pay, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia, so much as to the State rights and privileges, as I think I may call them, of the State of New South Wales. When we remember that New South Wales has really done her best on every occasion to thwart the wishes of the whole of the rest of Australia, and that the cry of the leader of the Opposition, when he was trying to defeat the Commonwealth Bill, was that the other wretched insolvent States of Australia were going to ruin New South Wales, it is very strange to find that that State under the Treasurer's proposal will receive some Â£22,758. The representatives of that State come to us and the Premier of New South Wales tells us that he requires that Victoria shall pay to New South Wales some Â£ 1 6 , 2 8 6; South Australia, Â£ 5 , 6 5 8 ; Queensland, Â£ S 6 2 ; and Western Australia Â£846. That is surely a complete reversal of the position as it has been previously stated to us. When we remember that this rebate of Â£ 2 per ton upon sugar is, under the Braddon sections of the Constitution, to be paid to the New South Wales Treasurer, it is all the more remarkable that this Bill should have been brought forward at all. It is now proposed to alter the Tariff schedule in such a way that the whole of the amount paid in rebate, upon sugar grown by white labour, shall be paid by the whole of the people of Australia upon a population basis. I desire to point out to honourable members that for years before the establishment of federation, Victoria otber had pursued a strong Australian policy. Without bringing the matter into a Commonwealth balance-sheet, and asking that the whole of the Commonwealth should pay for it, Victoria for years before federation supported Australian grown sugar by taxing her own people. ' We imposed a duty of Â£ 1 2 per ton upon all beet sugar coming from the continent of Europe.",21
68,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,It was grown by white labour.,21
69,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,"Can e - sugar was imported at a duty of Â£ 6 per ton only, the desire being to encourage the growth of sugar by white labour in Queensland. Victoria at no time asked for any consideration for this action. The first movement in that direction comes very strangely from New South Wales, which State is to get the whole of the benefit of the rebate paid to growers in that State. New South Wales comes to the other States, who were said by its leaders to be almost insolvent before federation, and is the first to ask that the Commonwealth shall return money collected under the Tariff to the State of New South Wales. The Treasurer has pointed out that a large amount of sugar consumed in Victoria imported, and upon that sugar there is posed a duty of Â£ 6 per ton. Who pays duty? The honourable member for North Sydney says that it is the foreigner, but I think it is the Victorian people who pay it . Tf the Victorian people tinue to import sugar, they will have to pay this Â£ 6 per ton duty upon it addition to the rebate we are here being asked to pay to the New South Wales Treasurer. The Treasurer stated the other day that looks upon last year as a phenomenal one, considers that afterwards. will not be so large. If , however, the people of Victoria do not import sugar, the State will lose the revenue to be derived from the duty of Â£ 6 per ton, and which is very necessary in the present condition of Victorian State finances. I tun speaking particTreasurer ularly of Victoria, but this applies equally South Australia and Western must lose that revenue, and at the same time we must continue to pay rebate to the to growers of sugar by white labour on the Richmond River, in New South Wales. This, in my opinion, is unfair. I Victoria chooses to pay Â£ 6 per ton on sugar through the Customs, that is quite enough to ask the people of that State to pay.",21
70,Mr MAUGER,VICTORIAN,Hav e we federated ?,22
71,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,"We have federated. The honourable, member for Melbourne Ports need not think that I am nob speaking from a Commonwealth stand-point.",22
72,Mr MAUGER,VICTORIAN,The honourable and learned member is speaking from a very narrow - stand-point.,22
73,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,"Indee d I am not. I do not bhink bhis is a fair proposal so long as that section exisbs by which duties that are collected in one Sbabe have bo be credibed bo that Sbabe. While that lasbs, we cannot regard the Commonwealth as an entity, bub as deparbmenbs. The section has an effect on the Sbabe revenues, and I think an injustice - is being done to Victoria, Queensland, and Wesbern Australia in the mabber. There is another way in which Vicboria, and I suppose every other Sbabe, would have an equal - claim on the Commonwealbh. The claim of New Soubh Wales is that because a certain policy has been adopted-that of paying higher wages bo white men-bherefor e the ""Commonwealbh should come bo ibs rescue.' In Victoria we have a whisky and brandy distillery, which is compelled to pay a higher is rate of wages than is paid in the other imSbabes. Because we have approved of high that wages being paid, are we, bhen, bo refund bo the distillers the excise duby which they have to pay to this State? The position would be exactly the same. conBecause we are approving of a certain policy, we are trying to override a policy , in which the Commonwealth has adopted, and a position which is asserted in the Constibubion Acb, which I do nob bhink we can overhe ride. We have the sbabemenb from the and Treasurer that nexb year Vicboria will nob the importations import so much.",22
74,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,I cannob tell that yeb.,22
75,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,"If bhere was one argumenb that ran through the speech of the it was that this was a phenomenal to year. Referring to Victoria and New Australia. We South Wales he said It has been the good fortune of these two States receive a very large amount of revenue from imported sugar, an amount far more than I anticipated, and much in excess of that which will probably be derived from the same source in think that if ordinary j'ears. I take it that when he made that statement he knew what he was talking about, and that nexb year Vicboria will nob import so much sugar.",22
76,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,I b all depends upon whab Queensland produces.,22
77,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,"Yes . If Victoria does nob import so much sugar, bhen ib means thab it will have less revenue from bhat source. I .am speaking of Victoria only; bub I mighb say bhat all the Sbabes excepb New Soubh Wales will import less sugar, with the consequence that they will get less revenue; bhat more imported sugar may go bo New Soubh Wales, and yeb all the time, although we are suffering bhis loss of revenue, we are paying a yearly increasing amounb of rebabe bo that Sbabe. That means that all the obher Sbabes will geb no increase in revenue, but will have bo pay the rebabe. There is another point which, I think, ought bo be considered-bha b ib is a far bebber bhing to have white men in the Sbate bhan black men. That is admitted by the facb of a wbibe Australia policy having been adopbed. A white man uses far mors taxable articles than does a black man. Mr IJ. E. GROOM - Is that the honourable and learned member's only reason ?",22
78,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,"That is one reason, and it is the only reason I wish to use now. If there are a number of white men where previously black men were employed-and that is what the rebate has done for New South Wales-it means that those white men will use far more taxable articles than were previously used, and, although New South Wales may lose upon the rebate which she has to pay to white men, it will get customs duties from the articles which will have to be imported to supply those men, and which black men would not use. For instance, although white men use whisky, black men will not use so much",23
79,Mr MCDONALD,VICTORIAN,Will they not? kills them a little more quickly.,23
80,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,"In view of the experience of my honourable friend, I will say that the black men use only as much whisky as their wages will permit; that their wages are not so large as are those of white people, and that, therefore, they cannot use so much whisky as white people do. Although the State may lose slightly through the rebate, it will get a large vantage from the use by white men of taxable articles. Ye t we are proposing to pay a rebate equal to that which was paid last year on white-grown sugar-Â£36,000 . am sorry I cannot agree with the Treasurer. If the Commonwealth pools the rebate, it should pool the imports. The Treasurerknows that he cannot do that under the Constitution Act.",23
81,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Do not ask me to do that in the interests of Victoria.,23
82,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,I think it is a fair thing.,23
83,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,I am afraid that my honourable and learned friend has not seen the figures. I can give them to him if he likes.,23
84,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,"There is no need for the figures to be given. If we are to look at this question from a Commonwealth standpoint on one side, we must look at it from the same stand-point on the other side. It does not matter to me whether Victoria loses or gains, so long as it is fairly treated all round. It does not matter . to me if South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland gain so long 'as they are treated fairly in both directions. But if New South Wales is to get the rebate she should also throw into a common pool the I'evenue which she receives from the importation of sugar. That is the only way in which it is possible to meet this position fairly. These facts have been missed in the previous discussion. Strong advocates of the Bill have submitted their views, and, although, of course, I would not vote against the second reading, I think that the views I have expressed should be considered by honourable members. I trust that the Treasurer will be able to show that he has weighed these matters, and is dealing fairly, not only with the Richmond River district of New South Wales, but with the rest of the Commonwealth. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - On this occasion the Opposition are, I It hope, going to assist the Government out of a mess which they have got themselves into in some inexplicable way, to which I need notrefer. We passed a Bill which provided that this matter should be dealt with by way of a rebate, and then it dawned upon Ministers that there was no possible way to pay the rebate, as, indeed, I think, was obvious enough, inasmuch as it was not possible to the in to hand back Â£ 2 ad- out of the Â£ 3 per ton levied by way of excise without infringing the Constitution. We are now asked to do this thing by way of a bonus, the cost of which is to be cast on I the States without regard to the extent to which they consume black-grown or whitegrown sugar. We, on this side, recognise that this is a price which the various States have to pay for a white Australia, and which can only be paid, as the honourable' member for North Sydney has said, equitably by being paid ratably at so much per head. We have to pay this as the price for a white Australia, not, I hope, the sort of white Australia which the last speaker referred to- a white Australia which was to be encouraged by imposing a duty of Â£ 1 3 per ton on white-grown sugar, and a duty of Â£ 6 per ton on sugar produced by coloured labour. That is what the honourable and learned member proposed as a splendid way of facilitating the white labour movement. I heard from him, as I have heard from other members, some curious things about that section in the Constitution with which my name is associated. I have heard all sorts of things said about that sectionthat it prevented this thing and the other thing from being done. The Prime Minister has himself said a great many things of that sort, casting the blame and the odium, if there is any, on that unfortunate provision. The honourable and learned member for Corio seems to have found that under the section it is impossible to pay this bonus on sugar. There is nothing in the section which prevents the expenditure of the Customs revenue in any direction whatever. does is to limit the amount of expenditure within the bounds therein laid down. I presume that the Treasurer has not at his disposal funds to meet this charge out of one-fourth of the net revenue 1",23
85,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Ampl e funds.,24
86,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,VICTORIAN,I am glad to hear that at the present time there will be ample funds.,24
87,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"T another million and a half without running against the section, I think.",24
88,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,"That is so ab present, bub can the right honourable and learned gentleman say thab will be so while the production of white-grown sugar increases, and proporbionabely the consumption of black-grown imported sugar decreases ?",24
89,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,During currency of this Bill I should bhink bhere is no doubb that ib would be so.,24
90,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,All I can say is that the honourable and learned genblernan is very hopeful.,24
91,Sir EDMUND BARTON,VICTORIAN,He is never very sanguine.,24
92,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,VICTORIAN,I am 'afraid that the honourable and learned genbleman is nob sanguine in the righb direction. He oughb bo be hopeful that bhere will be that increase in the local production of sugar for local consumption.,24
93,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"If produced ab all, ib will be only a fourbh, .and that would nob be more bhan Â£250,000 ab the very outside.",24
94,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,"Tha b will be considerably more bhan the cosb of that glass of beer we have heard of bo the unfortunate taxpayer. It is impossible to put away the idea bhat this bonus is in some sort, a direct tax. It - is the principle, I believe, of the Ministry thab they will nob go in for any direcb form of baxabion. There is nobbing in the Consbibution bo prevenb bheir doing so. They can impose any direcb bax they choose provided that ib is the same for every portion of the Commonwealbh. We are now come to this unfortunate necessity of imposing a direct tax which will be in the form of a small poll bax. I can only regreb that the necessiby has arisen- a necessiby for which Tasmania among other States will have to pay-and that we shall have to pay more and more as the time goes on. All it Bub bhere is, apparently, no hope of extinction from the difnculby without passing this measure; and I can only add .thab it is my inbenbion bo supporb ib.",24
95,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN," Pos sibly I may be required to explain why I should assent bo a measure which involves a sacrifice of Â£5,658 a year bo Soubh Australia. Bub I look upon the mabter involved as a Federal one. Though I object bo the could spend surrender of the excise m 1907 as enbailing an enormous price for the policy of a white Australia- I voted for the principle, bub I objecb bo the price bo be paid-ye b I do nob look upon this as a mabber bo which thab consideration applies. What we now have to consider is .a fair method of apportioning the rebabe which, until the .year 1907, is granted. After considering the matter carefully, I cannot see how it can be done in any the- other way except by an apportionmenb per head of population. We musb look upon ib from a federal poinb of view. We cannob say, because Queensland and New South Wales are the only Sbabes affected by the sugar question-the y will benefit by Â£61,267 bhis year by way of rebates-that they shall pay the full amount themselves. That would be an absurd position. We cannot segregate States and say that because the policy of a white Australia direcbly affecbs only bwo, those musb be the only Sbabes which pay for that policy. We are bound, as bhis is a Federal mabber, however obnoxious the principle may. be, bo deal wibh ib per head of population. At the same time. I think that Soubh Australia cannob complain bhat the Government made a mistake in her favour in bheir original Bill. The only true method upon which this mabber could have been decided was bo make the import duby and the excise duby exacbly the same during the period bebween now and the year 1907. I think that honourable members will agree with me upon that point if they consider the matter a little. The difficulty ab present is bhis, as has been poinbed out by the Treasurer and the honourable member for Norbh Sydney : Soubh Australia gebs credib for Â£ 6 per bon on all her consumption of sugar, except about 500 tons. New South Wales gets credit for about Â£ 3 3s. or Â£ 3 4s., wibhout taking into consideration the amount of the rebate. The honourable member for North Sydney said that the amount for which New South Wales gets credit is about Â£ 3 3s. per ton after having credited the rebate. But at the present time, as we do not take this into account, probably New South Wales gets credit on her consumption for more than Â£ 3 3s. per ton. We in South Australia get credit for about Â£ 6 per ton. But we shall under this Bill get credit for Â£ 5 12s., although the average credit for the States is Â£ 4 2s. That is to say, we shall get credit for about 30s. more than"" the average credit for the States, while New South Wales will get credit for about 25s. under that average. So that, although South Australia really hands over something like Â£5,658 this year, it must not be forgotten that owing to the way the Government- I will not say made a mess of the matter originally but led us into a diffieultv, we in South Australia are getting something like Â£30,000 or Â£40,000 a year from sugar more than we should have done under the-old conditions. Our revenue from/sugar only - averaged about Â£54,000 a yea/, and we are getting Â£96,000 this year, simply because we are getting the full rate, while the other States only get on an average Â£ 4 2s. per ton. The whole difficulty would have been got over had the Government proposed that the excise duty should be Â£ 6 per ton, when the import duty was fixed at Â£ 6 per ton, and, had they granted a bonus on the production of sugar by white labour. There would have been no necessity to follow up the sugar when once it left the factory. All that the Treasurer had to say was- "" Here is the sugar produced by white labour; we give you a bonus of Â£ 5 per ton for its production,"" which amount would be equivalent to the rebate of Â£ 2 per ton on an excise of Â£ 3 , and would be perfectly uniform, inasmuch as New South Wales would get credit for Â£ 6 per ton on her total consumption, Victoria would get credit for Â£ 6 per ton, and South Australia and the other States would also get credit for Â£ 6 per ton, while the bonus expenditure would be debited per capita. We should not then have had the ridiculous position of South Australia being credited with Â£ 6 per ton, whilst the otherStates on an average were credited with Â£ 4 2s. The difficulty that has been created was caused by the mistake made by the Government in their leadership of the House, and it is our duty to help them to geb out of the muddle. Albhough I am strongly opposed bo the proposed abolibion of the excise in 1907-whic h is a matter for future consideration-still , to adjust the matter in the meantime, I shall vote for"" this Bill. At the present time. I believe that the States are entitled, on the basis of consumption, to receive amounts which the Treasurer holds for them in trust. He was bound under.the Constibubion bo pay bhem bhis money from monbh to month. That is clear under section 89, which says*- ' - The Commonwealth shall pay to each State month by month the balance, if any, in favour of the State. But what has the Treasurer done ? Instead of paying the Sbabes monbh by monbh, as the Constibubion prescribes, their surplus of the sugar duties collecbed according bo consumption bhroughoub the States, he has kept the money in hand, and has asked us to revise the Tariff which Parliament passed. After two years, he is asking us to cancel the constitutional duty which he found he was unable to perform, because it was unfair. That is a bad principle bo adopb. This is really ex x>ost faeto legislation. We are all bo some extent responsible in nob having made the legislation in question satisfactory, but still it is a bad thing for bhis Parliamenb bo pass an A ct which is retrospective bo the extent of eighteen months in regard to money which ought to have been allotted from month to monbh, which belongs bo the States, which is held in trust for. them by the Treasurer, and which, under the Constibubion, he oughb bo have paid over to them. But under all the circumstances I consider that it is my duby to vote for the Bill.",24
96,Mr CLARKE,VICTORIAN," As far as the object of this Bill is concerned I do not wish to say very much, except that I believe ib was the idea of most honourable members when we gave legislative effect to the principle of the payment of rebabe under the Excise A ct that the rebate would be borne by the whole Commonwealth. Ab any rate, several honourable members to whom I have spoken have expressed that view, and I myself certainly bhonghb thab the rebabe would be a charge upon the whole Commonwealbh, and nob upon the bwo Stabes of Queensland and New South Wales. But it seems, from the technical or consbibubional reasons that have been given, that bhis cannob be done, and looking ab the question in the broadest possible way from the stand-point of one who is in favour of the principle of a white Australia, I ' think, that the House will be in agreement with the principle underlying this measure."" ""What I rose for chiefly was to express the hope that when the regulations are being framed, the basis of the past year's crushing will be carefully looked into.",25
97,Sir GEORGE TORXER,VICTORIAN,The Minister doing that now.,26
98,Mr CLARKE,VICTORIAN,"I am pleased to hear that, and I hope as a result there will be a more equitable distribution of what will now become the bonus. Although it is recosrnised that an honest effort has been made to deal with this complicated question, some sugar-cane growers are not quite satisfied with the distribution, or rather with the way in which the rebate has been apportioned. That is to say, their yield has been of a higher average than that on which they have been paid. 1 trust that that matter will be looked into, and that as far as possible the growers will get the full benefit of the rebate-o r bonus as it will then be-in the future. 1I have no hesitation in supporting the measure, and am glad to notice that honourable members are receiving it in such a cordial manner.",26
99,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN," The Bill before us is, I am bound to say, one of the results of the ill-considered legislation that has been introduced, and I submit that it is a matterf or which Ministers are entirely responsible. It is a great pity that at the very inception of federation so little care was taken in considering legislation from the point of view from which statesmen ought to consider it, and of making the measures passed as elastic as possible. Difficulties of this sort were pointed out when the question was first raised. It was also pointed out that the rebate to be given exceeded the amount that was paid in labour for cutting the cane. I .find from Coghlan thab there is a difference of somebhing like 6d. bo 7d. per bon between-the cosb of cubbing cane by black labour and whibe. The figures are respectively 2s. l i d . and 3s. 5d. per ton. But say that the difference is quite Is. per ton. The rebate formerly proposed was 4s. per ton, taking the cane to average 10 per cent, of sugar. Advantage - has not been taken of the fact that the bonus might have been brought down from 4s. to Is. bo cover bhis difference. When we are considering the way the other Sbabes are affected it must be remembered bhat ib is nob ab all improbable that the full amount of sugar used for local consumption in Australia will be locally produced. I find that a tobal of 194,000 bons of sugar have been raised in one year in Australia, and bhat exceeds the present consumption of something like 180,000 bons. When the is Bill gets into Committee I shall raise a protest against the retrospective clauses of it . I do not bhink thab we are legally entibled to pass bhem. As far as the Treasurer is concerned, it seems to me that the proposal now brought forward is bebber in many respecbs bhan the former .one. Ab all evenbs it enables each State to know exactly the price it is paying. That is one great advantage thab will resulb from ibs passage. As to one question raised by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, I think that under the Constitution there will be considerable difficulty in allowing mabbers to remain as they are at present. When the ifligh Court is established-o r even now, if ^Federal jurisdiction were given to the local courtsif an application were made by any Sbate interested, the money held by the Treasurer would have bo be paid over. I do nob bhink that the facb bhat the Treasurer holds certain moneys would enable him at any fubure time bo rebain bhese moneys as againsb the Sbate. I trusb we shall nob do anything thab in effect is really varying an Acb passed by bhis House. Such an Acb is of a very solemn nabure, and should be rescinded only by somebhing of similar strengbh, namely, anobher Acb. ' If the Treasurer were to ask us bo alber the. rebabe duby, he would be wibhin his province ; but even were it wibhin his province - I do nob bhink ib oughb bo be-to ask us to make a Bill retrospective, I do nob bhink any abtempt in that direction should be made by Parliamenb. Indeed, I am afraid thab even if we did desire to make a Bill retrospective we could nob do so under the Constitution. That parb of the argumenb, however, I shall deal wibh in Cominibbee'when the details are before us. I opposed the sugar rebabe in the first instance, and should do so now if opposition were of any value. I cerbainly bhink the suggesbed mebhod of distribution is an improvemenb on the previous one, and bhere being no hope of repealing the sugar legislation, I am bound to give my support to the new proposal.",26
100,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,"South Australia). - The remarks of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, to some extent cover the ground it was my article intention to traverse. I want, however, to ascertain from the Treasurer what the system has been in reference to the repassed payment of these rebates. From what I could glean from the Treasurer's speech, the rebates in many instances have not been paid; and the Treasurer uses the term "" paid'""' as if the producers of sugar by white labour first handed over the Â£ excise, and subsequently, as a separate transaction, received the Â£ 2 per ton rebate. Sir GisoiiGU TURNER. - The growers do not pay the excise; the refiner pays the excise, and the grower gets the rebate.",27
101,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,"If such case, that is not in accordance with, the Excise Tariff Act. In the schedule of that Acb we find that the duby per cwb. of to manufactured sugar isMs. until the 1st January, 1902, less, from the July, ""1903, a rebate to the grower ot sugar and beet. The rebate in the case of sugar cane to be 4s. pei' ton on all sugar delivered for ture, and in the production of which sugar white labour only has been employed after 2Sth February, 1902. The rebate 'is calculated on cane giving 10 per cent, of sugar, and is to be increased or reduced proportionately nccordingto any variation from this standard. A similar to be allowed in respect of sugar-beet-th to be allowed at the - rate of Â£2 per ton sugar-giving contents of the beet. All rebates to be allowed at the time of delivery of the or beet on the ascertainment in manner scribed of the sugar-giving contents I desire to call attention to the words which provide that all rebates are to be allowed videsat the time of the delivery of the cane or beeb bo the manufacturer. It is here proimported vided that the rebate is bo be allowed-no to be paid. Whab is the. rebabe bo be factured allowed on 1 If ib is ascertainable at the time of delivery whab quanbiby of sugar bhere is in the cane or beeb, allowance on the quanbiby. Whab does "" rebate "" mean 1 We provide in the cise Tariff Acb that bhere is to be an excise of Â£ 3 per bon on Ausbralianless grown sugar, wibh a rebabe of Â£ 2 bon on sugai' grown by whibe labour, thab rebabe bo be allowed on the delivery the cane or beet bo the manufacturer the mill. It is easy enough bo ascertain every mill whab are the sugar-giving contenbs "" 3X2 of the rough syrup after - the' first crushing. Does the Treasurer mean thab, in the ' firsb instance, the grower, on delivery, has to be paid Â£ 2 in hard cash, and that the Â£ 3 excise has not to be received until after the is coinplebely manufactured 1 If that has been the system, ib strikes at the root of the whole excise legislation. When we the Excise Tariff Acb our intention was to have, practically, three duties - a duty of Â£ 6 per ton against foreign imported sugar, an excise duty of Â£ 3 per ton on Ausbralian sugar grown by black labour, and an excise of Â£ 1 per ton on Australian sugar 3 produced by white labour. That allowance on whibe-grown sugar was nob bermed a bonus, bub a "" rebabe ""- a discounb on the Â£ 3 per bon to be allowed if it was ascertainable in a sufficiently correct manner whab the sugar-giving contents of the cane or beeb were ab the time of delivery. The schedule is the in the Acb goes on to saybhe average sugar-giving contents of the cane or beeb in twy particular district shall be taken be the sugar-giving conbents of each lob of cane or beeb in such district. 1st If the rebate has merely to be allowed, it is caue an allowance and not a payment. Surely manufaci t was never contemplated that the Treacane surer would pay Â£ 2 per ton in cash. The the idea was rather that the Treasurer would allow a rebabe or discount, reducing the duty on white-grown sugar bo Â£ 1 per ton. It was rebate poinbed oub by the honourable and learned e rebate member for Soubh Australia, Mr Glynn, on the that New South Wales dealb wibh 10,200 cane bons of white-grown sugar and 39,800 bons preof black-grown sugar imported from Queensland. It will be remembered that section 93, sub-section (1), of the Constibubion proThe duties pf Cusboms chargeable on goods inbo a State and afterwards passing b into another Sbate for consumpbion, and the clubies of excise paid on goods produced or manuin a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumpbion, shall be taken to have been collected not on the former but in bhere is an the latter State. That is to say, the excise payable on this Exwhite-grown sugar produced and manufactured in Queensland would be Â£ 3 per ton, the rebate or discount of Â£ 2 per ton, per and New Soubh Wales ought bo have been credited with the duby on 39,S00 bons of of black-grown sugar ab Â£ 3 per' bon, or or at Â£119,000 more. There is no question of at this being a bonus. What is important is that bhis Â£ 1 per bon oughb bo have been collected at the time the sugar cane was brought to the mill, if the Customs authorities were satisfied that it had been grown bywhite labour, and the amount realized ought to be charged to Queensland on its export toNew South Wales and credited to the latter State.",27
102,Sir GEORGE TCRNER,VICTORIAN,Does the honourable member say that the excise ought to be collected when the cane is delivered .at the mill?,28
103,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,Why not?,28
104,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Because the excise is payable on manufactured sugar.,28
105,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,"If the rebate of 4s. per ton can be calculated on cane giving 10 per cent, of sugar, the excise can be ascertained. I cannot understand why, if the rebate of Â£ 2 per ton on sugar beet can be ascertained and allowed at the time of delivery, the excise of Â£ 3 per ton cannot also be calculated. What is the meaning of the words bhat the rebate is to be ""allowed""? Is it thab the Treasurer has, firsb of all, bo draw a cheque, and allow the rebabe on the ascertained contents, and bhen ab some fubure period, he nob then being able to trace the cane or beet, must trust that' he may be repaid the excise of Â£ 3 per ton. Whatever may be the views of honourable members as to rejecting the original system of debiting the whole of Australia on aconsumpbion basis, and accept ing the proposal bodebibona population basis, it must be seen thab clause 7 of the Bill ""before us overturns legislation which was approved and passed by bhis House. That clause practically says bo the various Sbabes, which should have received regularly monbh bo monbh payments of the balance of excise on the sugar consumed- "" Albhough you received Â£ 1 excise upon the white-grown sugar you consumed, you will have to pay back bo us your proportion of the rebabe of Â£ 2 per bon, in order that one or bwo States may obbain a benefib we did nob reckon on before."" This is a Federal question of greab magnibude; and I feel satisfied thab if many honourable members had known the extent to which they were pledging the taxpayers of the Commonwealbh, the proposal to give bhis rebabe on whibe-grown sugar would have received much closer abbenbion.",28
106,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,I called abbenbion to bhis aspect of the question at the time.,28
107,Mr MAUGER,VICTORIAN,The provision would have passed all the same.,28
108,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,"The provision mighb have passed, bub there would have been much fuller discussion on the whole question. I am nob going bo argue thab the proposal in the Bill - I am nob now alluding bo the rebrospecbive legislation-bha b the whole Commonwealth shall pay in proportion to its population is unfair or inequitable. I do not think it is. I am inclined to take the view that, having discovered that the original position was a wrong one, the equitable and proper course to adopt was to bring in this Bill. Bub bo my mind ib is nob fair bo make the measure retrospective as is done by clause 7, and thus bo charge amounts againsb States whose Governments had no idea that such charges would be made, and bo keep from bhem sums of money which should have been paid bo bhem long ago. I shall vobe for the second reading, bub I hope that the Treasurer will agree to the omission of clause 7, so that the measure may take effecb from the date of ibs becoming law. Ib is nob fair afber a period of eighbeen monbhs to go back on our legislation, and make whab are practically surcharges upon the Sbabes. If the clause is not omitted, there will probably be a great deal of brouble in gebbing the Bill bhrough the obher branch of the Legislative in which the Sbabes are specially represenbed. I brusb, however, that the Treasurer will nob oppose the abbempb which will be made on bhis side of the Chamber bo prevenb the Bil l from being retrospective, and in Committee I shall move the omission of clause 7. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (South Australia) - I do nob knew that I rejoice ab the inbroduetion of bhis Bill, bub, as I have no wish bo display an unfederal spirib, I suppose I must support its second reading. I fear bhat this is the price which the Commonwealth has to pay for a white Australia. It is rather hard on South Australia, however, because that Stabe has in the pasb paid very heavily bo prevenb the inbroduetion of coloured labour inbo the Norbhern Territory. I shall supporb the second reading.",28
109,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN," It must have been gratifying to most honourable members bo hear the plain and open statement of the Treasurer that, in his opinion, our original legislabion upon bhis subject was wrong, and that he is now baking the earliest opportunity to amend it . Even under the arrangement provided for in the Bill, Queensland will lose to the extenb of Â£ 8 6 2 ; but the Treasurer put his finger upon the weak spot when he stated that the feeling in that State arose because of the misapprehension of the Premiers of both Queensland and New South Wales, that their States will be called upon to pay the whole of the rebate. That was not contemplated by Parliament, nor - was it provided for by the Act. It is satisfactor)'to those who supported the white Australia policy in the beginning to find that it is now being largely endorsed. In my opinion, our enactments will produce good fruit, and will prove to be for the welfare, not only of Queensland and New South Wales, but of the whole Commonwealth. I do not agree with the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon, that the Bill should not be retrospective. I would rather enlarge its scope than restrict it , and therefore I hope that the Treasurer will take power to enable him to pay bonuses from year to year as the planters increase the areas cultivated by white labour. It is no doubt the wish of honourable members that all the sugar grown in Australia shall be grown by white labour, and I think that such an alteration of the Bill as I suggest will help bo more quickly achieve thab end. I regreb the tone which has been adopted by some of the representatives of Vicboria who have spoken upon the Bill. Although originally Queensland was called upon bo pay mosb heavily for a whibe Australia, I , as the representative of a Queensland consbibuency, nevertheless cheerfully supporbed the proposal to granb the rebabe upon beeb sugar grown by whibe labour which the Vicborian represenbabives, selfish above those of every other Sbabe, desired. I am nob parochial, however, in regard bo this mabber. I bhink bhere is nob a State in A ustriilia which cannot produce sugar, and I should like to see Victoria underbake the production of beeb sugar. Then we shall have a bruly national policy which every one of us can support. I am exceedingly pleased bhat the Governmenb proposal has been so well received, and I venbure bo bhink that ib will be more equitable than the arrangemenb which has prevailed in the past. The admirable speech of the honourable member for North Sydney on the subjecb, however', leaves practically nobhing more bo be said. Many of us plainly saw, in the firsb insbance, that the original arrangement could, by an understanding between the sugar-growers and the manufacburers, be made bo work distinctly againsb the inberesbs of particular States. Victorian representatives should remember, however, that while under the present arrangement their State will be Â£16,2S6 to the bad, it mighb have been nexb year, under the old arrangemenb, twice as much to the bad. I congratulate the Treasurer upon the plain and frank sbabemenb which he made. Ib is a credib bo the Government, and an honour bo Parliament, bo have such a man in his position. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bil l read a second time. In Committee : Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2There shall be paid out of the Consolidated Bevenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, to every grower of sugar cane or beet within the Commonwealth, in the production of which sugar cane or beet white labour only has been employed after the 28th day of Febrnary, 1902, a bonus, at the rates provided by this Act, on all such sugar cane or beet delivered for manufacture after the commencement of this Act, and before the 1st day of January, 1907.",28
110,Sir GEOEGE TURNER,VICTORIAN," The honourable member for Wide Bay has referred to a matber in connection wibh this clause which has been under my consideration since I saw the Bill in prinb. Ib is a somewhat imporbanb one, and I have, bherefore, consulbed the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General with regard bo the effect of the clause as ib sbands. I bake ib thab ib is the desire of Parliament bo encourage persons who are now employing black labour bo subsbibube whibe labour for ib. Bub if we provide that bonuses shall be paid only upon sugar-cane grown by whibe labour after a cerbain dabe, and delivered for manufacture before a cerbain obher dabe, bhose who are now using black labour will have no inducemenb to. subsbibube whibe labour for ib in some fubure period. That is nob our inbenbion, and the original provision in the Tariff Excise Acb was inbended bo mean thab during each year rebabe should be allowed to those who after a certain date in that year use white labour only. It was not inbended thab the Acb should nob apply to those who, after two or three years' experience, said- "" We are going to abandon black labour and employ white labour,"" or to those who will be forced by the operation of the Pacific Islands Labourers Acb bo do so. The effecb of the clause as ib sbands, however, is that only in cases where white labour only has been employed after 28th February, 1902, in the production of sugar cane or beeb which is delivered for manufacture before the 1st January, 1907, shall a bonus be paid. Therefore, if a grower employed any black labour after 28th February, 1902, and during this year's operations, which will commence aboub July, employed white labour only, he would geb no benefib under the Bill. To obviabe thab difficulty, I move That after the figures "" 1902,"" line 7, the -""or such date in each year thereafter as prescribed "" be inserted.  to a part, or only to the whole of a plantawell tion ?",29
111,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"It applies both. If a man can show that he has only white labour on so many acres plantation, he will be entitled to a bonus on the sugar-cane grown on the area. Of course, a careful check is kept, and any one frying bo evade the provisions of the will be prosecuted.",30
112,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,A great deal of inspection will be necessary.,30
113,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"It has been found, from our experience last year, that nob much inspection is required. The arrangement seems to work fairly well. The effect will be bo allow the Minisber bo planters. fix a particular date in each' year, and the growers will be informed that if after particular date they do not use . they will be able to claim the benefit of the bonus. That will be in accordance wibh the intention of Parliament, and will with fairness and justice. It will offer an inducement to growers to use white labour, whilst at the same time it will be equitable bo bhose who are forced to use whibe because the black labour has been sent away from them.",30
114,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN, I to know whether it is also intended to planters who have been using white labour and have reverted to black labour to register as employers of white labour only,30
115,Sir GEORGE TORNER,VICTORIAN,"I think that have to be permitted, but for any year which the grower employed black labour would forfeit the rebate.",30
116,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,Bub supposing he were to wish to register again 1,30
117,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I know thab bhat vent that. has been allowed; but the mabber is nob dealb wibh by the amendment, which only proposes to fix a date.",30
118,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,"I think thab the Governmenb have been imposed upon. I am informed bhat a number of the growers have registered as employers of white labour, have put white men on to work for a short period to cub cane, and have afterwards employed coloured labour bo cultivate the ground preparatory to the next cutting season. Ib will be very difficulb if one portion of a planbabion is to be registered as cultiwords vated with white labour and another portion may be as worked with black labour, to keep in perfect touch with the actual conditions.",30
119,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,We could not very refuse permission for a man to register part of his plantation as worked with white to labour when he has a big property and used wishes to bring about the change from of his black to white labour by degrees.,30
120,Mr AVATSON,VICTORIAN,"At firsb sight it may appear rather harsh to refuse, bub we have bo consider the difficulties of administration. law It will not confer much benefib on the Commonwealbh if we have bo pay rebate to planters who use black labour, as well as white labour. I am informed thab in some insbances nearly the whole of the work of the plantation, excepb the cutting of the cane, has been done by black labour, and that the rebate has still been secured by the",30
121,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,If we could get that evidence to that effect we should prosecute black labour the persons concerned.,30
122,Mr AVATSON,VICTORIAN,No doubt ib is very difficulb bo induce people to come forward operate and swear to the facts in such cases.,30
123,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,There has been at least one prosecution in Queensland.,30
124,Mr AVATSON,VICTORIAN,"Ye s : and I am inlabour formed that there have been one or bwo cases in New Soubh Wales also. Bub, in order bo comply with the spirib of the law, should like the cane-growers should be compelled bo allow employ whibe labour for the twelve months preceding the cutting of the cane, as well as again during the cutting season. According bo 1 the proposal of the Minister the dabe could would be albered bo suib the growers who could in . cultivate their ground with black labour, he and then jusb before the cubbing season regisber as employers of whibe labour.",30
125,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,The regulations could be framed in such a wayas to pre,30
126,Mr AVATSON,VICTORIAN,"What I desire to point out is thab the growers have been allowed to again register themselves as employers of white labour after reverting to the employment of black labour, and I think that practice should be stopped. Cane-growers should make up their minds which kind labour they will employ, and if they once revert to black labour after having emHe ployed white men, they should not be allowed to register again. I admit that there is great reason why those who employ black labour should be encouraged to stitute white labour, and I should not to do anything to prevent them from securwhite ing the benefits conferred by the law, but is wrong to allow planters to from one form of labour to another, because such action is in direct opposition spirit of our legislation, and must lead to great difficulty in adminstration ",30
127,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN," The honorto able member for Bland is in error if he poses that it will be possible to cany out the intentions of Parliament without allowlabour. ing portions of plantations to be worked with white labour. Our desire is to enthab courage the employment of white labour upon territory now occupied by black labour, and to bring about this change to the greatest possible extent at an early date. It would be impracticable for the large planters to get rid of the whole of their coloured labour at one fell swoop, and at same time secure a sufficient number of men to enable them to work the whole of men. their plantations. For that reason it will be sound policy cn our parb bo allow bhem seb apart a portion"" of bheir plantations be worked wibh white labour, so thab they may bring aboub the change gradually, and under circumstances which will best suit bheir own purposes. No greater clanger of the Excise Acb. imposition arises in such cases than in connection with very small holdings. We trospective effecb. must provide for the inspection of the plantations, and upon this point I think thab ib would be bebber if we adopbed more efficienb sysbem bhan that now in I operation. I do not think that the ComTreasurer monwealth has suffered very much impositions in Queensland, bub the inspection should be a little more vigilant bhan it is.",31
128,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,"Does the.honourable memlabour. ber think bhat a planter, after having registered as an employer of white labour, and having reverted to black labour, should allowed to re-register ?",31
129,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,I do not know of any case in which that has happened.,31
130,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I know of one that case in which a man registered as an employer of white labour, but unfortunately of afterwards had to use black labour, and thereby forfeibed his claim bo the rebabe. was allowed to register as an employer . of white labour for the following year.",31
131,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"I do not think there could be any serious objection to resubregistration in such a case, because the care planter was actually prepared bo employ labour, but was placed in such a it position that he was compelled bo forfeib shift about his claim bo the rebabe.",31
132,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,That is not the case to to the which I referred.,31
133,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,I am not aware of any 'obhers; bub if planters voluntarily return the employment of black labour they supshould be penalized in some way when they seek bo again regisber as employers of white,31
134,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN," I submit the Treasurer is perfectly right in the view which he has put before honourable member's, and that we-should not disqualify any planters who are willing to employ whibe labour. Ib musb be clear bo bhem that they cannot claim the bonus if they employ black labour in the production of % the their sugar, and we should do nothing to white discourage them from employing white",31
135,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN," I to should like to be assured by the Treasurer to that bhis clause does nob form parb of the rebrospecbive provisions of the Bill. It may be read as if ib did, because ib refers ' back bo the time of the commencemenb of",31
136,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,No ; ib has no re,31
137,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,I am willing bo accepb the Treasurer's assurance; otherwise cera ! tain amendments would be necessary.,31
138,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN, The has nob explained why bhere is from any necessiby bofixa dabe.,31
139,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,We musb fix some time in order bo prevenb planters from using white labour and then reverting to black,31
140,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"But the words "" in the production of which sugar cane or beet white be labour only has been employed,"" are used, and I do not see any necessiby bofixany dabe if whibe labour only has been employed in the production of the sugar. There was a necessity for fixing a date when we offered the rebate in the first instance, there was no inspection prior to the passing of the Act. But now the planter has to register as an employer of white labour, and he has to satisfy the inspector that cane has been grown by white labour only.",31
141,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"But they have their declaration early in the year, so that the inspector can keep his eye on them.",32
142,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,But if the planters rebate. know that they will not get the bonus unless they can prove to the satisfaction the inspector that they have employed only white labour in the production that should prove sufficient without fixing any date.,32
143,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"But the planters have to declare the area upon which employ white labour, so that the inspector may exercise his vigilance in regard to that particular portion of the plantation.",32
144,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"But that does not affect the question of fixing the date, and I been held. do not see any reason why we should give this arbitrary power .to the Minister. I sufiicient for all practical purposes to vide that the bonus shall be to sugar, in the production of which only white labour has been employed.",32
145,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN," It would appear from a casual view that the contention of the honourable member correct, but honourable members will notice that the date fixed is the 28th February, 1902. Some of the cane upon which the growers were granted exemption prior to 2Sth February, 1902, has not yet been dealt with, and therefore the honourable member will see the necessity for the sertion of the first date. Whenever a sugarclause 7. grower is prepared to substitute white for black labour, the Bill should encourage to do so.",32
146,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,But why give exemption every year 1,32

By fixing the first date and making it applicable to which are not yet two j'ears old, and will come in at the next cutting, we necesbecause sarily require a second date.",32
148,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN, I must ask the Treasurer to seriously consider this clause. Upon looking into it carefully it the seems to me that in its present form the . Government may be called upon to pay to make both the rebate and the bonus.,32
149,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,We have introduced a Bill to abolish the payment of the,32

151,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"They cannot do so. The Bill providing, for the payment of the rebate will be repealed before the bonus they intend to is forthcoming.",32
152,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,But I understood that all claims for rebate have not been paid 1,32
153,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,All have been paid. It is the other money which has,32

156,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"That question, therefore, could not arise under this clause ?",32

158,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"Quite so; but many him honourable members, though quite willing to vote for the provisions contained in this this clause, are not disposed to make its operation retrospective. ,",32

161,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,It is only a question distribution that is involved. All the industry growers have been paid.,32
162,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN," In crops spite of the explanation offered by the which honourable member for Richmond, I do not see any necessity for the amendment which is proposed. The fixing of a date might be necessary to confer exemption upon those book. who employed a little black labour before the Excise Tariff Act came into operation, but it will not be necessary in the future..",32
163,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Would the honorextension able member shut the door against every employer of black labour in the future ?,33
164,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,When the Act is in operation everybody is acquainted with fact. Are we to allow the Minister the option of granting absolution every year  absolution.,33
165,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"The honourable memlabour. ber for Richmond explained that it necessary to insert this date because, prior to the Act becoming operative, some sugartion. growers who had employed black labour upon preliminary work in connection with their crops might be quite willing to employ white labour. He urged that i would not be right to penalize them for having unwittingly oftended. It was necesdealb sary, he urged, to fix a date so that they might be absolved from any penalty menb of the bonus. applicable to their actions before that date.",33
166,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,That is not the idea at,33
167,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN," I would cane point out that the employment of black labour was not an act of inadvertence the part of a greab many sugar-growers. They were employing black labour, and was necessary bo fix a period when that practice should be discontinued. the necessity for inserting the firsb dabe. The sugar-growers have obbained emption for the crops pub in prior bo that date. That cane has nob yeb been dealb with ; bonus is still to be paid upon ib.

Sir EDWARD BRADDON each - If I understand the clause aright, the sertion of this dabe is by way of limitation the bonus payable upon the sugar produced by white labour. T t will prevent the bonus from being payable bo any grower sugar manufacbured by white labour prior to the 2Sth February, 1902.",33
168,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"That is dealt wibh by the Acb, which is already on our stabube",33

172,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"Le b the honourable member all. suppose that a man had never grown any at all, and desired bo sbarb growing ib by the employmenb of whibe labour. Wifchon oub bhis provision he could not do ib.",33
173,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"Why nob ? If he culib tivated the cane by white labour he would participate in the bonus. W hy is it Hence necessary to fix a date prior to which the employmenb of black labour will be allowed, exseeing thab the Act has already been i u operation for somebhing like twelve months'? Having originally fixed the date as a starting point, there is no necessity to do anything more. . We can declare that the whilst up to thab dabe some exemption would be granted, after it , we sxpecb the allow condibions imposed bo be carried out. disSurely that will place the matter upon a with reasonable basis. We are supposed to be passing a law to encourage the production of sugar by white labour, whereas we are really giving the Minisber power to say that year a certain quantity of sugar proinduced by black labour shall participate in of the payment of the bonus. He may say that he will allow thab paymenb upon sugar which has been dealb wibh by whibe labour upon for only bhree monbhs.",33
174,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"If he did so, the House would intervene.",33
175,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"We have experienced a great deal of trouble in connection wibh options given to Ministers-option s which have been used in a way that Parliament never intended. We have full power over the Customs and a host of other regulations, bub we found that when we gave cerbain options under the Acb they were used.",34
176,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,Wha b is the object of renewing the options each year ?,34
177,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,To allow those who have been employing black labour bo come in.,34
178,Sir EDMUND BARTON,VICTORIAN,"To allow of the extension of the"" employment of white labour from year to year.",34
179,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,There is no necessity for any. such extension after the Act has been in force for a considerable time. Statute itself provides the necessary enthought couragement. Surely we ought not to be called upon to pay a white labour bonusmember upon sugaiwhich has been chiefly produced by black labour. I see no necessity for the options which are now sought. Therefore bhere is no occasion bo . confer upon the employers of black labour that exemption which was extended to them when the Act first became operative. I shall certainly oppose the amendment.,34
180,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I think we are all hopeful thab, wibhin bwo or bhree years, black labour will nob be employed the production of sugar. Estimates have been made of the cost involved in its abolition. If it be wise to dispense with, black labour, ib is equally wise bo encourage the sugarbegun growers who have been employing it either prior to or since the 28th February, 1902, to substitute white labour for it .",34
181,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,How will it encourage them to give them a bonus for sugar grown by black labour ?',34
182,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,We do nob do that.,34
183,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,"If we fix an original dabe, and give-a bonus upon all sugar grown by white labour after that dabe, will nob bhat be sufficient ?",34
184,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"No . Because prescribed."" by doing that we would shub oub all those who have been growing by black labour for any period after that particular dabe.",34
185,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,Can they nob come in ab any time afber bhat original dabe?,34
186,Sir EDMUND BARTON,VICTORIAN,"Unde r this Bill, without the amendment proposed, they could nob.",34
187,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,Then the Bil l is faultily drawn ?,34
188,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"My honourable friend will see that the object is to allow them to come in after the original date, and the amendment proposed will effect what the honourable member apparently desires.",34
189,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,What I desire is I think the simplest course to pursue-fi x a date and say thab any one who produces sugar by white labour after thab dabe in any year shall be given the bonus.,34
190,Sir EDMUND BARTON,VICTORIAN," The purpose is to give the bonus, to put ib shortly, bo growers of cane or beeb sugar in producing which whibe labour only has been employed The after the 28th of February, 1902. We that the Bil l as printed would have carried out what is desired by the honourable for Gippsland. But there are occasionally faults in the drafting of a Bill, and, on going through the mabber again, we found that ib was a sine qua non, if the clause were bo sband as in the Bill without alteration, that where a person desired to get a bonus for the growth of sugar by white labour he must have started employing white labour in the growth of that sugar on or before the 28th day of February, 1902, and, if he was still employing in black labour on the Isb or 2nd March, 1902, he would have no claim to the bonus, although he might on that dabe have ceased cultivating wibh black labour and have cultivating wibh whibe labour. The object we all have, I bake ib, is that persons who successively commence to employ white labour from time to time shall have the benefib of the bonus. We had, bherefore, to discover in what way this clause could be amended, as otherwise it would not carry oub the purpose we all have in view. Afber consultation bebween the Treasurer, the AbborneyGeneral, and myself, the only way bo effecb thab purpose seemed to us to be the. insertion of some such words as these- "" or such date in each year thereafter as may be It is necessary to provide some starting point, so that bhere might be some locus penitentice, some time allowed in each year when growers of cane by whibe labour alone mighb begin to earn the bonus. I do nob see in whab way bhis provision could be abused, excepb - that there will probably be' occasional deceptions, and in. those cases there will be no hesitation in employing the criminal law to punish anybody guilty of offences under the Bill. Mr FiSHK.it - The proposal gives those who come in later no advantage over those who came in originally. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - The intention of the Bill is to provide a bonus upon sugar grown only by white labour. If the words which define a certain date, the 28th February, 1902, are inserted, they will involve this complete discrepancy --that sugar which has been grown, we will say for one month by white labour and by black labour for sixteen or seventeen months, will be just as much entitled to the bonus as if it had been cultivated by white labour for the whole of the eighteen months.",34
191,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,That depends upon the day of the year we fix.,35
192,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,VICTORIAN,"Why should there be any day fixed by which sugar grown chiefly by black labour brought under the provisions of an act intended to encourage the use of white labour? We need not have .any date fixed, and I submit that if all reference the date is omitted the clause will carry out the purpose of Parliament in a way which will do injustice to nobody. Mr EWING ' (Richmond) - I have alget ready explained why it would not do to for six years. leaveout all reference to a date. I am satisfied that the honourable members for Gippsland and North Sydney approach this question fairly, and desire only to be vinced.",35
193,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,We have no desire to pay a bonus for sugar grown by black labour.,35
194,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"We are not dealing with that aspect of the case now. We are endate, - deavouriiig to prove that the action taken by the Treasurer in introducing this amendad ment is correct. The end in view is attainment of a white Australia, and the abolition of black labour in the sugar dustry.",35
195,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"Yet , it is proposed to give a bonus for black labour.",35
196,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"If the honourable ber will bear with me for a moment, I will state a case for him : Suppose the honornow able member is a sugar-grower in Northern Queensland, and has been employing 200 Kanakas on the date set out in the clause, the 28th February, 1902. On that date the honourable member finds himself with cerhas tain responsibilities to, say, 200 Kanakas, with no white men available. Obviously it is not possible for him on that date to register as a grower of sugar by white labour. It is equally obvious - that he must remain for all time a producer of sugar by black labour, or else he must be given a subsequent opportunity to register. Is that clear",35
197,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,It is not clear that he will not have a subsequent opportunity.,35
198,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"If he fails to come ""in on the date specified, he must permanently remain a producer of sugar by black labour or he must be given a subsequent opportunity.  life-time 1",35
199,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"On e planting may last for seven years. In fairly good soil, from the time the cane is first planted, ib may last seven years.",35
200,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,How often will the honourable and learned member find it lasting may be longer than two or three years ?,35
201,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"I know exactly what I am talking about in bhis mabber. Honourable members make the misbake of confusing to years wibh crops. In New Soubh Wales, generally, sugar-growers cub bheir cane once in bwo years, and a sugar-grower who will geb bhree crops from tolerably good soil will them from cane which has been planted",35
202,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,Then under this clause he could nob geb a bonus for years bo come 1,35
203,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"Yes , because he is exempted conprior bo the dabe we have already referred to. I poinbed oub thab bhis exemption was necessary in the first instance, because the cane crop mighb lasb for seven years. A crop pub in two years ago, prior bo this is not yet cut, and bhat difficulby had bo be overcome. To continue the argumenb hominem, the question arises: what is the the honourable member for Norbh Sydney bo do when, on the date referred to, he finds himinself with black labour of various descriptions, and, bherefore, unable to register ? Clearly if he is going to have fewer Kanakas in 1907 than he has bo-day we must give memhim a subsequenb opporbuniby bo come under the Bill. Whab we are fighting for is that subsequenb opportunity. The honourable member desiring bo employ white labour in the growth of sugar, finds a little laber on an opporbuniby of doing so. He applies bo the Department and says that he now made arrangements for getting rid and of his Kanakas as there are white men available for the cultivation of sugar. The Department must be placed in a position to meet him, and how can that be done unless we give him the opportunity of a subsequent date upon which he can come under the provisions of the Bill ? As has been explained by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, if that is not done we shall, in 1907, have as many Kanakas employed as we have today. If the sugar growers do not get the benefits of the Bill, they will not get rid of their Kanakas. If the contention of the honourable member for North Sydney is correct, we should pass a Bill which would be absolutely inoperative beyond its first effect. The idea was a gradual abolition of the employment of black labour, as we knew it was not possible for the people of Queensland to obtain all the white labour they required at once. How often have we, in discussing the matter here, pointed, out that Queensland had 8,000 Kanakas winch must be gradually got r i d of? If the contention of the honourable member for North Sydney is correct, what is proposed will be a refusal to allow those Kanakas to be gradually got rid of. If the bonus is to lead to the gradual abolition of the use of black labour, there must be various dates provided for registration, and the person who must be allowed to decide the dates must be the Minister for the time being.  am one of those who have not seen the necessity for the subsequent dates. It does appear to me that the whole intention is to get a bonus for a crop grown partly by black labour. That must be the general conclusion from the speech to which we have just listened.",35
204,Sir EDAVARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,"Member s luwe admitted that.  of honourable members? Is it the desire of members of this House that these people should be encouraged to put in a crop and nurse it for two or three years with black labour until it begins to yield, and then say that they Avish to come under the Bill and secure the bonus for sugar groAvn by white labour ?",36
205,Mr EAVING,VICTORIAN,"""What are they to nurse it with if they cannot get white labour"" They have started the crop; Ave are dealing with a going enterprise.  any reference to dates in the clause, if I were a sugar-grower in Queensland and started to plant cane tomorrow veith Avhite labour I should be entitled to the bonus if I continued to comply with the conditions as to labour.",36
206,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,Certainly .  necessity for fixing this date if it is not to give people the adA'antage of using black labour in the production of the sugar up to a certain date ?,36
207,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"Where is the advantage ?  black labour for some time, and we desire noAV to AvhiteAvash-. them; but honourable members appear to me to wish to giA'e them the benefit of the bonus for sugar which is only partially the product of white labour. I do not like this Bill at all. I believe that under it Ave shall require as many inspectors as there are plantations. If a man is to be allowed a bonus upon sugar grown upon an acre in this plantation-and an acre in another, a great many inspectors will be required.",36
208,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,This amendment does not affect that question. ,36
209,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"My honourable friend Avill see that many of these planters haA'e Kanakas under contract for one, two, or three years, and they cannot at once get rid of them. Gradually they Avill get rid of them and employ white labour, and from the time they employ white labour they ought to get the benefit of the Bill.  never plant again 1 Have they got in a crop which Avill last for all time ? If the bonus is to be paid on the sugar which is grown by Avhite labour, it must mean that it is to be giA'en from the time when the crop was put into the ground, otherwise Ave are giving a bonus for the employment of black labour. Suppose that I Avas a grower of beet; that I used coloured labour up to the time Avhen the beet was fit for conversion into sugar, aud that I used white labour for that purpose, should I be entitled to get the bonus under this amendment ?",36
210,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,No ; because the date would be prescribed in such a way as to prevent any of those frauds being brought about.  clause is very loosely Avoided.,36
211,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN," I am as keenly alive as any one else . to the danger of any sugar-groAver getting at the Treasury. It seems to be obvious, as all the planters could not put the whole their plantations under white labour to with, that, from time to time, as they intend to increase the area to be planted with and worked with white labour, it is advisshould able that there should be a date fixed-each year if you like-afte r which they must use white labour wholly in the production of cane to earn - the bonus. That is praca tically what the amendment does, with difference, that it allows the Minister prescribe the date. It is absolutely impossible to do other than to allow the emplo3'ment planters some of the advantages which have accrued to them by using black labour up to a certain point. They are not going done after the 28th February. to root out their cane for the mere purpose of earning the bonus. I do not suppose that honourable members would be so absurd as to say that the planters should root the latent capital which had accrued from the employment of black labour with the sole idea of having the whole work done again by white labour. The honourable member for South Australia might as well say that if a plantation had been ploughed and South Wales ? trenched in past years by black labour the work should be re-done now by white labour. It is perfectly clear that those planters who may come in at a later stage will reap greater advantage than those who came in at stances may require him to do. first ",36
212,Sir EDWARD BRADDOIC,VICTORIAN,"Yes , because they have had to pay lower wages to their biackfellows.",37
213,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"I submit that those who come under the Act next year will have no greater advantages than those who registered during the first year of its operaister, tion. If it is a question of policy, why should we differentiate? I hope honourable members.will see that it is the right thing to make this amendment' ",37
214,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I have tried question to explain that the object of the amendment is to keep open. the door of repentance to those who have been growing cane with during black labour, and desire to come under provisions of the Act. In addition to that, some planters could not help themselves, because they had labour contracts with one, two, or more years to run, and we are giving them an opportunity to come under the Act. A fear has been expressed that date will be fixed which would allow nearly the whole of the work to be done with black labour, and that just as the last stages were being reached, white labour would be of employed. No Minister would be foolish begin enough to fix any such date. As the 28th February has been fixed after full inquiries cane, as the proper date in the year when we stop the employment of black labour, I have.no objection to alter the amendment by inserting the words "" or the same day in the year,"" so that if the Minister during year chose to prescribe that after that this year the bonus may be allowed, then he to must fix upon the 28th February. That - date would allow for a very large amount of to the end of the year in cleanmay ing the cane, trashing and cutting, and taking to market. All that work has to be If it is feared that a misuse might be made of the power by the Minister fixing a wrong date, the amendment I suggest would meet that out objection. Parliament always has control over the regulations; they have to be laid upon the table, and if anything unfair has been done, a regulation can be annulled.",37
215,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARX,VICTORIAN,Will the same date suit Queensland as will suit New,37
216,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"Apparentl y the same date has been fixed. I think that it had better be left to the discretion no of the Minister, who will act as circumWe have two difficulties to face. Either we are to shut out those planters who have been forced to use black labour for a portion of the time, or we are to run the little risk of allowing them to come in. That is a risk which we may well afford to run, leaving the controlling power in the hands of the Minwho in his turn will be controlled by Parliament. I wish to encourage the growthat ing of sugar by white labour.",37
217,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,"South Australia) It seems that this is rather a difficult to deal with. It certainly appears that the owner of land which has been prepared, planted, and cropped with black labour the first year may come under the Act the at the end of that time when there is no planting to be done, and when a second crop is being grown from the stools. There we run the risk of allowing the bonus to be paid on a crop of cane that had been planted by black labour in ground which had been a tilled and worked by black labour up to the time when the trashing had to be done. I think the honourable member for Richmond I will admit that in some places the growers get not only a crop from the first planting, but two, and even three successive crops plough. from the stools. I h fact, the third successive crop is very often better, stronger, denser in sugar contents than the earlier crops. It is very difficult to get over danger of paying a bonus on sugar produced from cane that was originally planted black labour in ground which had been tilled by black labour, and upon which little or no work had bderi done by white labour. The only way I can see out of the difficulty is by nob passing this amendment, but by omitting the words ""the 28th day of cane February, 1902.""",37
218,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"That cannot help us. If man has employed any black labour at all, he cannot come in at any time.",38
219,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,It strikes out the necessity for white labour to have been employed ever since the date stipulated.,38
220,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,That does not geb over case where the cane was planbed labour.,38
221,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,I b does entirely. In the production of which sugar cane or beet white labour only has been employed. Surely those words are definite enough ?,38
222,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,VICTORIAN,"If the was planted by black labour, the grower could not get the bonus under the suggesbed amendment. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - How bhat lasb 1",38
223,Mr MCDONALD,VICTORIAN,"That lasbs for five years. Mr V . L . SOLOM.ON - I do nob wish to go, nor do I think that we shall go as far as that, by omitting those words. I believe that in most instances the original sbools are rooted up after three years.",38

I have by seen the cane planted. A very large portion of the cost involved is in clearing and preparing the land, and planting the cane. I have not gone into the proportions of expenditure, but I know that the processes - of preparing the ground and planting the cost more than any other processes in sugar production except the milling. I am a certainly againsb giving exbended powers bo the Governmenb bo work a Bill like bhis merely by issuing a proclamation each year.",38
231,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN, I bhink I can suggesb an amendment which will meeb a all the circumstances. I would suggesb by black making the clause readIn the production of which crop of sugar cane or beet white labour only has been employed. This would geb over all the difficulties.,38
232,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,During whab period of the year is the crop produced 1 cane Surely afber the 28bh Februaiy ?,38
233,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,The cane is planbed in one year and harvested in anobher.,38
234,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I suppose, ib is long does harvested in July, August, and September ; and ib is planbed certainly before the 2Sth February.",38
235,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"Bu b the effect of the proposal of the Bill as it stands would be that, if the cane had been planted before the 28th February, had been attended to for eighteen months, and was cub in July the following year, the grower mighb be able bo obbain the bonus, although his crop had been grown by black labour for the first nineteen or twenty monbhs. He might have sbopped shorb in the employing of black labour on the 28bh February, and mighb be able bo obbain the bonus of Â£ 2 per bon, although the earlier parb of his operations had been carried on wibh the aid of black labour. I presume that the intention of the Treasurer is to insure that each of crop on account of which the bonus is paid shall have been sown and produced by white labour only. But if what is now proposed were carried it would mean that the for the first eighteen or twenty months black labour might be employed. Sir G i:oROE TURNER - So would the honourable and learned member's suggestion mean that.",38
236,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"Oh , no; the amendment I suggest would refer only to a crop that had been produced by white labour exclusively.",39
237,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,The object of having a date was to enable us to fix reasonable time each year. I think it wiser to leave the matter to the control of the Minister.,39
238,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,There seems to be a Treasurer. fear as to the administration of the Minister; the Committee does not seem to care to leave the matter to be decided by him.,39
239,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,The honourable and learned member will not trust the Minister ; that is the long and short of,39
240,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,It means that tain extent. But the objection refers to any Minister. The Conimittee declines to allow the Minister to legislate when Parliamade ment itself ought to legislate. Therefore no particular Minister should object to limitation now'proposed.,39
241,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Surely the able and learned member would not ask us each year. to pass a Bill fixing a date for each year,39
242,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"We could so fix the date that it would be beyond the control the Minister to say what the date should each year, and every man in the Commonquestion wealth who was growing sugar would be able to know upon what date the operation of this clause would take place. We might so amend the clause as to secure the employbeen, ment of white labour for nine months.",39
243,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,I am prepared trust the Minister whoever he may be under the control of Parliament: I will not put in any limitation of which I do understand the effect.,39
244,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"The effect of my prowhich posal can be understood, because it prevents the Minister from altering the date. It says the bonus shall not be paid on account any sugar in the production of which white labour shall not have been employed for nine months. We must remember that over tend it . 180,000 tons are produced in Australia, and that Â£360,000 may be paid away ; so that the amount of money to be paid away in from black labour. bonuses is worthy of our consideration. I would urge the Treasurer to accept some such amendment as I have suggested.",39
245,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I do not think we should tie. our hands, because Parliament can control the Minister for the time being if he is wrong in the regulations he makes.",39
246,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"What I ask is that the House, not the Minister, shall legislate. W it h every respect for the Treasurer, I would suggest that this provision will have to be administered by other Treasurers in the future. Probably he would object to a control of this kind being exercised by a is Treasurer .upon this side of the Chamber.",39
247,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,I would trust the honourable and learned member if he were,39
248,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"I.admi t that there is a saving clause in the proposal in one way, inasmuch as it provides that the regulation shall be laid on the table of the House. That is a sort of safeguard. But I should it . prefer to see the matter dealt with in to a ceranother manner altogether.",39
249,Mr LE GROOM,VICTORIAN,"Darling Downs) I cannot understand the objection that is to the position put by the Treasurer. He has put a very fair,-just, and reasonable the proposition before the Committee-that is, that it shall be left in the discrehonortion of the Minister to fix a date in The. Minister administering 1 the Act would make inquiries from his officers as to which was the best date, of and would act on that experience which be his officers would bring to bear. The has .been raised as to whether we ought to trust the Minister with these powers. What are the powers which we are asked to entrust to him 1 We have passing a series of Acts of Parliament, the object of which is to encourage sugarto growers to employ white labour. We are asked to entrust to the Minister the power to declare from time to time other dates, to not enable those now employing black labour and those who wish to follow out the policy Parliament has declared to be a wise one for Australia, to register themselves as growers by white labour. The Minister could of not restrict the policy that has been inaugurated by anything he could do under this Bill ; all he could do would be to ex",39
250,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,It would enable him to pay a bonus for the production of sugar,39
251,Mr LE GROOM,VICTORIAN,"No ; only to those who were prepared to do away with black labour and to employ white labour, provided they did so before the prescribed date. We know that there was at first a great deal of hostility in regard to the employment of white labour in the sugar-fields. But now a change has come over the minds of the growers. We find that at places like Mackay, and other leading sugar centres, the growers are taking up the position that they should endeavour to make the white Australia policy a success. I notice with  advice-that the sugar-growers should do all they can to take advantage of the provisions of the Commonwealth Act, and to make the poliey of a white Australia a success if possible. The point is, therefore, whether, as a Parliament, we should endeavour to give them every assistance we can, in order to carry out the policy we desire to see promoted. Here was a large national industry in Queensland, in which coloured labour had been employed. Our desire was to have - that industry carried on without any coloured labour being employed in it . When the growers themselves are expressing a desire to come under these provisions, if we can in framing this Bill to the Minister power to enable him to further the policy we desire, it is our duty to do so. The proposal is perfectly reasonable, and does not ask us to take out of the hands of Parliament any power which it now possesses.",39
252,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,We can fix provisions to cover what is proposed.,40
253,Mr LE GROOM,VICTORIAN,"I submit that is all that is proposed under the Bill. As the Treasurer has pointed out, under the operation of the Pacific Islands Labourers Act, the importation of Kanakas will diminish every year, and finally cease ; and we know, further, that these coloured men are continually leaving the Commonwealth. There were a certain number of contracts in existence prior to the passing of that Act, and those contracts from time to time expire. What is desired is to enable planters, as their contracts expire, to set aside, under regulation, certain specified lands which they declare will in the future be worked by white labour only. As contracts expire it becomes more difficult to get coloured labour; and if planters are desirous of making an honest effort to carry on with white labour we ought to extend a helping hand and preserve the sugaiindustry for Australia as a whole. There is no proposal to deprive the House of any power : on the contrary, there is an attempt to honestly and justly carry into effect the existing law.. We ought not to do anything to place obstacles in the way of a policy to which we are pledged and which we desire to see carried into eJfect. All thab the Treasurer proposes are such powers as will enable the Minister, after eohsulbabion wibh his officers, bo fix a dabe which will bend to the efficient carrying oub of the policy. I hope the Commibbee will granb the powers asked for, because I am sure they will render valuable assistance bo the indusbry, not only in Queensland, bub bhroughoub the Commonwealth.",40
254,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN," I have no objection to give the Minister any powers which we cannot properly define ourselves. So long, however, as we can accurabfly define the powers we desire bo see exercised, we have no righb bo place in the hands of a Minisber, who may now or in the fubure adminisber the Acb, any such option as that proposed. By the change of a single day the Minisber, under bhis Bill, give would be able bo pub inbo or take oub of the pockebs of the people in bhis community thousands'of pounds. There are honourable membersonbobh sides of the Commibbee whose inbenbion is similar and easily defined ; and we have no right to remibexbraordinary powers bo any Minisber when our inbenbion can be made clear in words. The honourable member for Richmond desires the. removal of any resbriction which would prevent the bonus being paid in the case of a crop produced by white labour but grown from roots which, it may be, had lain in the ground for four or five years. That is my desire, and the desire, I believe, of other honourable members who may object bo the proposal as ib appears in the Bill. We have, in the words of the honourable member for Richmond, given absolution in the case of a crop partly produced or grown by coloured labour prior to February, 1902. But I am againsb giving the bonus in the case of any crop-by bhis I do hob mean the roob or sbool from which the crop is grown-o n which black labour has been employed after that date. I do not bhink that the Minisber proposes that the bonus should be paid in the labber case.",40
255,Sir GEOEGE TUKNEK,VICTORIAN,I do nob.,40
256,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,Bu b the powers asked for would enable the Minister to give the bonus - under such circumsbances. Why should we give the Minister powers which he says he does nob propose bo exercise ?,40
257,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Because we cannot fix the date here.,41
258,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"There is no need to fix the datp. I do not profess to be a draftsman, but surely we have sufficient legal skill in the Chamber to make it clear that, whilst there will be no restriction in the case of cane coming from an old root or stool, there will be no bonus for a crop which has been produced by black labour for any portion of the time.",41
259,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"What does the honourable member mean by "" crop "" ?",41
260,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"Has the Minister never heard of a crop of peaches ? such a crop mean the peaches, from which they come ?",41
261,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I have never heard of a "" crop "" of peaches, or of a "" crop sugar.",41
262,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"Without using strict legal phraseology, I suggest that words such as the following be inserted in the be necessary. clause after the word "" Commonwealth ""in respect of. each crop in the growth harvesting of which white labour only has been planting. employed. Is not that the meaning of the Comto mittee ?",41
263,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,No ; the Comother mittee want to go further.,41
264,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,"It is nob exactly the meaning of the Comraibtee, because the sugtwo gestion of the honourable member for North Sydney would apply to a crop planted, this year by black labour, and harvested perhaps two years hence by white labour.",41
265,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"That is the very thing to which I am objecting. This legislation becomes a sham when we encourage people to employ black labour in planting, and then to ask the Minister to so fix the that they may employ white labour for shorb period, and qualify for the bonus. musb be remembered that af ter the period bo which the Pacific Island Labourers A applies there will be a lot of floating black labour in Queensland, and that planters will have opportunities of employing either that or white labour. not object to the employment of black labour if it is there, and planters to have it ; bub I object to the bonus for whibe labour being given in any case excepb where white labour is used. The reason for originally fixing the 2Sbh February, 1902, as the date was that no notice had been given to people who would 3o use white labour but had had a certain amount of work done by coloured men ; and it was considered unfair to exclude these people if they chose to dispense with the labber Joy that dabe. Now ib is proposed bo fix the 28th February for every year, and bo give the bonus albhough it may be a two years' crop and black labour may have been employed for twelve months or more. That is a most exbraordinary proposal. The crop, properly speaking, is that which is cut from the sugar cane ab a given time.",41
266,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,The cubbing of the Does crop commences about June or July. I or the trees should go further back.,41
267,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"The Treasurer would not go further back than I should, because "" of I say that all the crop ought to be produced by white labour. Ib is proposed bo fix the dabe in February, and ib is only from February to July thab white labour would",41
268,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,The honourable and member would go back to the original,41
269,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"I would not go back the original stools or root. Sometimes sugar-cane is left in the ground, and like trees-becaus e it is a kind of treeib branches out, and may be cut after a period varying from a year and a quarter to years. This is the cutting of the crop ; and here lies the objection to the proposal say, of the Treasurer. The right honourable genbleman suggests the 2Sbh February as a suibable time bo fix each year, and if bhis be done, black labour employed prior to that date on the year's crop would be absolved, leaving only about four monbhs for whibe labour. That is an extraordinary proposal date afber all the flourish of brumpebs about a encouraging the use of white labour. Ib Whatever we may think on the question of white v. black labour, we entered into this ct legislation on certain conditions ; and yet we are now asked to extend the operation of the A ct to a degree never contemplated - to continue indefinite!}' up to 1907 the I do payment of a bonus on sugar on which white labour has been employed for only wish four months out of sixteen, or even 24 months. I am not prepared bo give the Minisber the powers asked for ; especially am I not prepared bo give powers which may affect residents of the Commonwealth to the extent of Â£2,000 to Â£4,000 on each crop. This might be the effect of the difference of a single day, or a week, or two or three weeks, or a month in the gazetting of the notice. Such powers ought not to be given unless absolutely necessary; and they are not necessary in the present case.. The proposal of the Minister would seem to mean that only four months of white labour need be given to earn the bonus; and, if that be so, it is a most extrordinary proceeding to which I do not see my way to agree. It will be an acknowledgment of incapacity if we are not capable of expressing our meaning in the Bill.",41
270,Mr GB EDWARDS,VICTORIAN," I quite agree with the honourable member for North Sydney, that if - we can possibly express in the Bill what we mean we should do so, and not give power to any Minister to make regulations for carrying out what are the main principles of the measure. My suggestion is that we should leave the clause precisely as at present only adding the following words :Provided that, after the coming into operation of this Act, the grower registers his intention grow wibh whibe labour only twelve months prior to such delivery. The season varies in different parts of Australia, and each grower knows when his season commences. This applies alike to the grower in Northern Queensland and the grower on the Manning River; and, under my suggestion, it would be left open to them to register twelve months before delivery. But we certainly should ask the Government to put into the measure some guarantee, because I can assure the Committee that I have suffered more heavily, perhaps, than any man in the Commonwealth from the operation of the "" white Australia policy."" I am not prepared to make that sacrifice again for growers who employ black labour to within four months of the delivery of the cane to the mill. It may be that, as the Bill makes no provision for registration, it will be necessary to insert in it a clause providing for registration under the regulations. The wordsProvided that after the coming into operation . of bhis Acb apply only to future cases. Persons will be able to go to the nearest Custom-house, and there apply to be registered as growers who intend to employ white labour only the twelve months preceding delivery. If that provision is made, the Minister will not have to seek expert advice in regard to delivery, because the growers the Bill . themselves will declare when they intend to deliver. I think the adoption of the proviso which I suggest will meet the wellfounded objections to the clause. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",42
271,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN," I move That after the word "" Commonwealth,"" line 4, the following woids be inserted:-""in respect bo each crop."" That amendment will test the whole question.",42
272,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN," I think that an excellent reason why the Committee should not go further than the provisions of the Tariff Excise Act is that the whole matter was there settled according to a certain agreement, under which the rebate upon sugar-cane was to be 4s. a ton, for all cane delivered for manufacture in the production of which white labour only had been employed, after 28th February, 1902. Both the excise and import duties were settled on the basis of that. agreement, and therefore to when dealing with the Bill, which was introduced merely to alter the manner of payment by substituting a bonus for a rebate, we should not try to alter the original arrangement. I hope that the Treasurer will upon consideration see his way to withdraw this debatable provision.",42
273,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,I think the Committee are pretty well at one in their desires in this matter. No one wishes to see black labour employed to within two or three months of the delivery of the sugar cane.,42
274,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"As we know what we want, we ought to provide for the carrying out of our intentions.",42
275,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,I am certain that no Minister would prescribe such a date as would enable the course to be taken to which honourable members object.,42
276,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,We are not sure of that.,42
277,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,The Minister should not have the power.,42
278,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I do not see why not. In every Act we have passed, the Government of the day have been intrusted with far larger powers.",42
279,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,VICTORIAN,We should for not repeat the mistake we made when we their next passed the Customs Act.,42
280,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,We should not trust any Minister if we can express our intention in,42
281,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I feel certain that if the amendment is agreed to no one will be able to say what the words mean. T do not wish growers to obtain bonuses for sugar-cane which has not been grown wholly by white labour, and I am, therefore, prepared to ask the Attorney-General to frame an amendment to provide that if black labour has been used in connection with the production of cane within nine months previous to its delivery no rebate shall be given.",43
282,Mr GB EDWARDS,VICTORIAN,"Why not make it twelve, months 1",43
283,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,Nin e months is only half the time the crop is growing.,43
284,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I am not an expert in the cultivation of sugar-cane, and therefore I am prepared to accept advice from those who represent constituencies in which cane is grown as to what is the proper term to provide for.",43
285,Mr GB EDWARDS,VICTORIAN,Le t each grower register.,43
286,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,Why not provide that a bonus shall not be - paid in respect to any crop in the production of which black labour has been used?,43
287,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,The trouble is to frame a definition.,43
288,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I do not think we can frame a satisfactory definition. I think that the original provision, giving the Minister power to make regulations .subject to the approval of Parliament is the best. At the same time, I do not - object to the fixing of some reasonable period.",43
289,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN,"^I think that the proposed amendment involves a very serious innovation upon the compact upon which our "" white Australia"" legislation was adopted, and I am surprised that the subject has been introduced in Committee as if it were an after-thought on the part - of the Minister. I understood that the Bill was introduced merely to substitute bonuses"" for rebates, so that - expense of maintaining a white Australia should be federalized by being - divided equally among the States, and although the proposed change imposes an .additional burden on the State which I represent, I am willing to agree to it on that ground. But I think that before we make .any alteration in the original compact we .should take time to consider the whole matter. There seems to be great difference 3 02 of opinion as to what is the proper form for the proposed amendment, and I , for one, should not like to vote on the question this evening. I doubt, indeed, whether it is wise to amend the Bill at all. I think it would be better to confine its provisions to their original scope, and let this new matter standi over. I object to the granting of bonuses to those who go on growing cane for a considerable time with black labour. There will be great difficulty in obtaining support in the sacrifice which we are making to create a white Australia if growers who employ black labour up to within a short time of the delivery of their cane are to be allowed to obtain a bonus.",43
290,Mr BAMFO RD,VICTORIAN," I agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that it would be as well if the Committee had more time to consider the amendment. For my own part, I am much in favour of the clause as it stands. Those who know anything of the subject are aware that the Commonwealth has been imposed upon to some extent in this matter.",43
291,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I undertake to prosecute any case brought before me. We have done so already, and some persons have been fined.",43
292,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,"There have been cases in which the cane was cut with white labour and then black labour was put on to the field again, and yet the growers were able to obbain rebabes. I gave the Minisber a specific instance in which bhis had been done, and he framed a regulation to prevent it . Within the present month the Premier of Queensland has been in the northern part of that State, and has advised cane-planters to bring over Chinamen from the Northern Territory, because there is no restriction which can prevent their introduction.",43
293,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,VICTORIAN,I bhoughbhe advised bhem bo endeavour bo grow cane with white labour only.,43
294,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,He gave both kinds the of advice. He often does bhat ,43
295,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,VICTORIAN,That is nob my experience of him.,43
296,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,"Perhaps the honourable member's experience of him is limibed. I advise the Treasurer to leave the matter as it stands. I am sorry thab the Minisber for Trade and Cu3boms is nob here, because he could throw a great deal of light upon the subject. The extension of the time to the 1st March was declared by some of the northern newspapers to be a sign of weakness on the part of the Federal Government. They said that the Parliament had no faith whatever in its own legislation, and that we extended the time for registration because we recognised that white men could not do ""the work. If the time is extended as is now proposed, they will say that the cry for a white Australia is a sham, and, unless the clause is allowed to stand, and the regulations are very drastically administered, our law will not be worth the paper upon which it is written. I might be expected to support the amendment, because I represent a sugar-growing district; but my experience has been such that I feel called upon to resist any proposal unless it takes the direction I have indicated.",43
297,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN," I also represent a sugar-growing district, and I entirely differ from the honourable' member for Herbert. I had not previously heard of the case which the honourable member has cited, and I very much regret to learn that any one was allowed to do as he has described, and to obtain the rebate. I do not know under what authority Ministers acted in paying the rebate if black labour were employed. The Minister for Trade and Customs could very well have refused registration. If the clause is allowed to stand, no one will be. permitted to come in.",44
298,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,"Yes , they will, because the regulations already provide for thab.",44
299,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"The crop may be ploughed out, bub sbill the planter will not be able to escape the fact that black labour has been employed on the land. Does the honourable member seriously argue that the results of the' employmenb of black labour musb be desbroyed before the planter is enbibled bo earn the rebabe ?",44
300,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,"Yes , I do.",44
301,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"Then I cannot agree wibh the honourable member. Reasonable opporbunibies should be allowed to those planters who have labour contracts to discharge. They have entered into contracts under the statute law and the regulations of the State relating to the employment of Kanakas, and are bound to employ the islanders for the term for which they were hired. These agreements terminate from time to time, but the honourable member apparenbly desires bo compel the growers bo break bheir agreements. I cannob agree with him in thab view, because I think thab the planbers should be permibbed bo employ the Kanakas for the full berm necessary to enable them to complete their contracts.",44
302,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,But the honourable member would not give the employers of the Kanakas any bonus.,44
303,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,Not while they are employing black labour ; but I should allow any one and every one to come in if they employed white labour from the taking off of one crop to the production of another. *,44
304,Mr GB EDWARDS,VICTORIAN,That would be for twelve months.,44
305,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"It might be for bwelve months, or a libble more, or a libble less. I bhink very few crops are baken off wibhin less bhan bwelve months, bub bhere may be exceptional insbances. Ib would be wrong for us bo enacb that no obher planbers should be allowed bo regisber bheir plantations, and I hope thab the Commibbee will nob follow the suggestion of the honourable member for Herberb. The impression lefb upon my mind is bhat, if the honourable member has his way, any planter who is now employing black labour will nob be able bo obtain the bonus offered for the employmenb of whibe labour unless he ploughs up every vestige of vegebabion upon the cultivation of which black labour has been engaged.",44
306,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,"-Hear, hear.",44
307,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,I am entirely against the honourable member on that poinb. Why should we desbroy the resulbs of the employmenb of capibal and labour in bhat way 1,44
308,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,Why did the planbers nob take advantage of the Acb before 1,44
309,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN,"For the reason which I have sbabed. They have bo carry oub cerbain conbracbs in connection wibh the employment of Kanaka labour. I do nob suppose that the honourable member will follow up the line of argument which he has adopted, because he must see that the Committee could not support him. I think that such a period should be fixed as would afford every reasonable facility for earning the bonus, and thab we should not destroy the resulbs which have been broughb aboub by the employmenb of much capibal and labour for the sake of mere senbimenb.",44
310,Mr MCDONA LD,VICTORIAN," I can bear oub whab the honourable member forHerbert has stated, because while I was in Northern Queensland, I had brought under my notice cases in which notwithstanding that black labour had been employed in the cultivation of the cane up to a certain point, the growers had registered on the 30th March and had been able to secure the rebate. In view of these circumstances such restrictions should be imposed that if planters desire to earn the bonus they must cultivate their cane wholly by means of white labour. Upon all the plantations a large area, is annually set out for a new crop, and if growers' desire to obtain the rebate they can start by employing white labour solely upon the newly planted area. Then they will obviate the necessity of having to plough out the results of previous cultivation. I was very much surprised when it was pointed out to me that it was possible to cultivate cane with black labour, and still to obtain the rebate. I thought that was simply ridiculous, and when the instances mentioned by the honourable member for Herbert were quoted, I was perfectly staggered. I know that this cannot be clone now under the regulations, but it has been done. We should put our foot down very firnnty, and make the planters understand that they must use white labour wholly in the cultivation of sugar upon which'any rebate is to be claimed.",44
311,Mr BAMFO RD,VICTORIAN," I think that it was principally through my intercession with the Minister for Trade and Customs that the time for registration was extended to 1st March last. When I was in Northern Queensland during the recess, I was waited upon at Cairns and other places by planters, who asked me if I would use my influence with the Minister to have this concession granted. I consented to do so, but told them plainly that, so far as I was personally concerned, I would not go one day beyond 1st March. I told them that they were'not entitled to any further extension of time; that they had had every opportunity of taking advantage of the provisions of the Act, if they had chosen to do so, but that they were so wedded to black labour . that they would not give it up. Therefore, I said that if they wanted the rebate they would have to make another start. I hold that view still.",45
312,Mr MCC AY,VICTORIAN," So far as I can understand the original amendment and all the suggested modifications, they lead to the one result, namely, a very large increase in the bonus towards which all the States will have to contribute.",45
313,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,Not the amendmentthat leaves the matter in its present position.,45
314,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"The proposal of the Government does, but the amendment of the honourable member for South Sydney will extend the facilities offered under the Bill.",45
315,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,No : because the Government have already been paying the rebate under that system.,45
316,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,That is just the point. The Government have been paying the rebate under a system not authorized by the Excise Act.,45
317,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"Not paying the rebate. I have held back the balance which might in strictness have been paid.to the States, but I have not paid any rebate.",45
318,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"The Treasurer proposes to make payments which are at present not authorized by the Excise Act, which forbids the payment of any rebate in regard to sugar produced hy the employment of black labour after 28th February, 1902. As I understand, the Government has extended the time of repentance to 1st March, 1903, or rather they have promised to do so. Perhaps the Treasurer can inform the Committee whether a promise has been given to the growers that they shall be entitled to the payment of the bonus on sugar produced by white labour from the 1st March, 1903.",45
319,Sir GEOBGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"As far as I have been able to make inquiries, I understand that that is so. A regulation to that effect was passed and laid upon the table of the House.",45
320,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"Honourable members do not always see regulations which are laid upon the table, nor do they always read them when they appear in that interesting publication, the Government Gazette. I should like to know where the legislative authority for such a practice is to be found. The Excise. Tariff Act declares that the excise duty upon manufactured sugar shall be "" 3s. per cwt. until the 1st January, 1907, less, from the 1st July, 1902, a rebate to the grower of sugar cane and beet. The rebate in the case of sugar-cane to be 4s. per ton on all sugar cane delivered for manufacture, and in the production of which white labour only has been employed after 28th February, 1902."" It then goes on to explain how the rebate is to be calculated. To my mind that is a specific legislative decree that no sugar-cane shall be entitled to the rebate unless it has been whitegrown from the 2Sth February, L902. If a promise such as that to which I have referred has been given, and if people have .acted upon the faith of it, Parliament might feel bound to give effect to it . But I am very dubious of the propriety of adopting any such amendment as that suggested by the Treasuror, which would vest the Minister with power to fix dates, so that the bonus might be claimed upon sugar which had been worked by white labour only after those dates. It seems to me that under such an arrangement it would be possible for a great many growers-seein g that thej' cut their cane at different periods-to cultivate it by black labour t ill it had reached a very advanced stage, and then to cut it by white labour, so that they might claim the bonus upon it .",45
321,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,It all depends upon the date fixed by the Minister.,46
322,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"I do not think so, because I understand that cane is cut as early as May and as late as September.",46
323,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,It depends on the season.,46
324,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"It depends upon the season and the locality in which the cane is grown. The same date would not be applicable to all districts. If the Minister is tofixdifferent dates for different districts - that is an exercise of Ministerial discretion which is open to objection because the Minister cannot be like Cassar's wife, above suspicion.",46
325,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Parliamen t has already empowered him to pay a rebate upon cane according to standard.,46
326,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"The rebate is based upon the practical result of the cane crushing. Parliament could not determine what percentage of sugar was contained in sugar cane. Both in this House and elsewhere have protested against vesting the Executive with what is practically legislative authority' which can be exercised by Parliament itself. If we could dispense with tions altogether it would be a good thing in many ways. That, however, is impossible, and therefore we have to abandon the principle to a certain extent because the necessities of, the case. At the same time we should strive to guard against chance of any grower taking advantage of the exact wording of an Act of liament or a regulation. I suppose there are growers, even in Queensland, who would consider it right, so long as they kept within the letter of the regulation, to draw bonuses which Parliament never intended to give them. It behoves us to be careful that we do not allow the growers to employ black labour, and at the same time to participate in the benefit conferred by the operation of a bonus. That is the danger against which we have to guard. The Committee have been taken by surprise by the proposal to extend the terms of the bargain which was made at the time that the Excise Tariff Act was passedNo question of this kind was then raised. I do not think that any of the honourable members, who now point out the desirableness of making an alteration, recognised this disability or suggested any proposal in connection therewith. ""Whilst all the Stateseven Victoria-whic h is the biggest sufferer by the nationalization of these bountiesare prepared to pay their share of this "" n e w "" expenditure for the sake of the Commonwealth as a whole, it is only right that they should be protected against any possibility of results such as those to which I have referred. I b would have been much better, I think, if this matter had been brought before honourable members earlier, so that they might have been allowed an opportunity to give it more careful consideration. The amendment which have been suggested this afternoon show that the mind of the Committee is not crystallized on the matter. Personally, I am in some doubt as to what action ' I should take. Under the circumstances, I feel inclined either to abide by the Bil l as it stands, or, at the utmost, to go to the length of the concession which the Minister for Trade and Customs seems to have promised, namely, to extend the | right to participate in the payment of the <bonus to growers who have employed white I labour since the 28th February of this year. Even of that I am dubious, but beyond that I am not disposed to go, though I am oped to conviction as to the wisdom of the regulacourse which I at present fear.",46
327,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"The Excise Tariff Act, I would remind honourable memof bers, has been administered by the Minister for Trade and Customs. He is exceptionally, the busy upon some other measures, and as it partook somewhat of the nature of the ParTreasury matter, I agreed to take charge of this Bill. I knew that some alteration had been made under the Excise Tariff Act with regard to the date after which the bonus should be payable on sugar produced by white labour. I was under the impression that the desire was to allow those who had been using black labour to get rid of it gradually, and to come under the provisions relating to the employment of white labour. I still feel that that is the right course to pursue if it is practicable. But many difficulties have been raised during the course of this discussion which I should like time to consider. I also desire to consult the Minister for Trade and Customs, who is charged with the administration of the Act. Therefore, if the honourable member for North Sydney will withdraw his amendment, I shall be prepared to allow the clause to pass ' in its present form, and to recommit it tomorrow, so that honourable members may have a further opportunity of discussing it . I may then be able to tell the Committee that the alteration proposed should be made, or that it should be effected only to the extent mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, or that it should go further.",46
328,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,Why not pone the clause 1,47
329,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I would much rather pass it , and have it recommitted.",47
330,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN," After the remarks of the Treasurer, I have much pleasure in withdrawing my amendment, and allowing the clause .to pass in its present form. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",47
331,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN," The Committee occupies very much the same position in regard to this clause as it did when the discussion commenced. The honourable and learned member for Corinella has referred to an extension of the provision contained in the Excise Tariff Act to 1st March, 1903. Practically, that is an extension for one year. I understand that it applies only to the crop for the ensuing year. It was never intended that the Excise Tariff Act should debarsugar-growers who produced their sugar by black labour in 1902' and 1903 from participating in the rebate granted by Parliament, provided that they grow their sugar by white labour in 1905.",47
332,Mr MCCAV,VICTORIAN,"My remarks referred to sugar which has been planted by black labour since 28th February, 1902, and from which a second crop will be taken in 1905.",47
333,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,"The Act states that the rebate shall be payable upon sugar cane or beet in the production of which white labour only has been employed. I should like to know whether the word "" production "" includes every operation that is necessary in the cultivation of the land for three or four years prior to the harvesting of the crops ?",47
334,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,I understand that under that provision rebate has already been allowed.,47
335,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Because the Act provided for it .,47
336,Mr KINGSTON,VICTORIAN,There was an original provision that nothing done before a certain date should invalidate the claims.,47
337,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,"The amendment suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney is in line with my own views upon this question, as it would insure that black labour would not be utilized in the cultivaPerhaps tion at any time in a particular year of a crop on which the bonus was paid.",47
338,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,"That if it had been, we should not pay the bonus upon that crop.",47
339,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,"So far my views are in line with those expressed by the honourable member, and the difficulty is to find post- words to convey that intention in such a way that it shall be open to no doubt, and that there can be no extension whatever of the concession beyond the desire of this House. 'The section in the Excise Act leaves a doubt in my mind as to the possibility of the sugar-grower coming in at some period subsequent to 1.902 if he has made use of any black labour at all in the planting of a crop, and, if he ceases to use black labour in 1903 or 1904. I think that under that section he would be debarred from taking advantage of the bonus provisions of this Bill, and I do not think that that was ever contemplated. What was contemplated was that no sugar-grower should be entitled to a bonus upon sugar in the production of which black labour had been employed. It was not intended to apply where black labour was employed only in the preparation of the land and planting of the cane, provided that subsequently white labour had been employed in the cultivation of the Crop, and for a period of at least twelve months before the time when the cane was carted to the mill.",47
340,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,The Excise Act as it stands would shut that sugar out.,47
341,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,"That was the doubt in my mind, that as it stands the Excise Act would shut out any sugar in the production of which black labour was employed at any time after the 28th February, 1902.",47
342,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,Yes ; the grower would have had to cease the use of black labour on that date.,48
343,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,Does that mean that any sugar cane on which black labour has been employed after that date could nob take advantage of the rebate provision?,48
344,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"That is the meaning of the law as it sbands. If any black labour whabever has been used afber the 28th February, 1902, no rebate can be . granted upon the crop so produced. Whab is meant by the law as passed is that a man musb prepare his ground afresh, planb his cane, and culbivabe ib entirely by whibe labour, and that I bhink is boo harsh.

355,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,There is the general power bo make regulations.,48
356,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,"I believe that the consensus of opinion in the Commibtee is thab that should be allowed. My impression when the Excise Acb was under consideration was thab power was given under that Ac t to pay the bonus upon sugar grown in any particular year up to 1907, if it had been grown entirely by white labour. To confirm that opinion I would point out thab the Excise Act was simply a corollary of the Pacific Island Labourers Acb, under which we book power bo restrict the imporbabion of Kanakas. No one who discussed thab measure losb sighb of the facb that a number of sugarplanbers had black labour under conbracb, and could nob dispense wibh ib prior to 1902, 1903, or even 1904, and it was felt that as soon as they could dispense with that labour and substibube whibe labour for ib, they should receive consideration under operations the rebabe provisions. I never for a momenb imagined that the Excise Act would debar us from extending the provisions of the rebate to sugar grown by whibe labour afber 1902. Clause agreed bo. Clause 3 (Calculation of bonus on sugar cane).",48
357,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN," I would poinb oub thab as ib is suggesbed that we shall deparb from the original scope of the Bill, which was merely bo converb the rebabe previously provided for into a bonus, we might as well consider this ' clause under which the bonus is proposed bo b'e 4s. per bon. I remind all who are inberesbed in the sugar business, that according bo the figures baken bobh regula- from Queensland and New Soubh Wales, the cosb of breabing a bon of cane varies from somebhing like 2s. 1 Id. for cane produced by black labour bo 3s. 5d. a bon for cane produced by whibe labour. There is bherefore.a difference of only 6d. per ton in the cosb of cane produced by whibe labour as againsb that produced by black labour. We mighb go further, and admib a difference of Is . per ton, and yet honourable members will see that by this clause it is proposed bo allow -4s. per ton. If this Bill were merely intended to provide for a bonus instead of the existing rebate, I scarcely think that I should press my objection ; but if it is proposed bo go very much further bhan the original Excise Act, and practically enter upon an entirely new understanding, it is high time that the people of the States who are being asked to contribute should know what they are contributing for. They should understand distinctly that according to CogMcm they are being asked to' contribute just eight times as much as is necessary to cover the difference in the cost of production between the employment of white and black labour.",48
358,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN,CogMan' s figures apply to New South Wales only.,49
359,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"Accordin g to Coghlan the position is slightly worse for Queensland than it is for New South Wales, because he shows that in the total cost of production of a ton of sugar there is a difference of 39s. in favour of Queensland as against New South Wales. He points out that this is partly due to the difference in the cost of labour, and is due also to one or two other considerations. At that rate Queensland could afford to take 3s. 6d. per ton less. Mr EwiNCi - The honourable and learned member will perhaps explain to the Committee that Cog/dan is dealing only with the growing of the cane, and not with the cutting and crushing.",49
360,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"The figures given by Goglda/n deal with the growing and cutting, not with the treatment in the mill, but with the total cost up to the time the cane is received in the mill. The honourable and learned member will probably recollect that Cog/dan includes in his figures something like 9d. per ton of cane as the cost of transport from the field to the mill. He explains that the cost of transport is less in Queensland owing to the better facilities there provided by small railways and tramways and the proximity of central mills. He gives figures showing a cost of something like 12s. 2d. for Queensland and 16s. 3d. for New South Wales.",49
361,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,That is for the growing of the cane.,49
362,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"It is for the growing of the cane and its whole treatment until it reaches the mill, and the figures given include the price paid for the cane, which is something like 10s. or l is . per ton.",49
363,Mr EWING,VICTORIAN,"Thos e figures refer to the growing of the cane, and do not embrace thrashing and cutting in which black labour is employed.",49
364,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"If the honourable and learned member will again refer to Coghlan he will find that his figures cover the cost of thrashing and cutting and the transport of the cane to the mill. He points out that 2s. l i d . is the lower rate for black labour, and 3s. od. is the rate for white labour, the difference being 6d. per ton. In this Bill we are asked to vote as a bonus eight times that amount. If we say that instead of 6d. the difference in cost between sugar produced by white labour and that produced by black labour is Is. per ton, we are then being asked to vote four times as much as we should. If it is intended to depart from the provisions of the old rebate arrangement in the way which has been proposed we should certainly consider whether we should not also depart from the provisions of clause 3 of this Bill.",49
365,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN,I referred only to the method of contribution.,49
366,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"If the honourable member for Moira, as indeed I understood him, only referred to the method of contribution, I cannot include him amongst those who appear to desire that the whole question should be re-opened. Under the last clause the suggestion was made that despite the provision in the Excise Act we should extend the bonus to allsugar produced by white labour after February, 1902, and if there is to be a re-opening of the whole question, 1 think I shall be justified in raising the mabter of the amountof bonus to be paid, and in suggesting thab 4s. per bon is boo much. If the Bonus Bill is brought forward, as I understood it was bo be, purely in the place of the existing rebabe provision, and if, so far as possible, exacbly the same conditions are to prevail, I shall not discuss the matter further ; but if we are bo go inbo the whole question again, I submib that ib is our duby bo consider the present position, and not to act as we acted in times past, hurriedly and without the consideration that a measure of this sort should receive. If I am assured by the Treasurer that in the event of clause 2 being altered in the way which has been suggested, we shall be given another opportunity of discussing clause 3, I shall be satisfied.",49
367,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,I shall try to meet the honourable member. Clause agreed to. Clauses 4 to 6 agreed to. Clause 7All rebates of excise duty on sugar paid before the commencement of the Act shall be taken to have been paid as bonuses under this Act.,49
368,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,"South Australia). - I intimated when speaking upon the second reading of this Bill, that I think it proposes the introduction of a very bad system in our legislation. Utterly irrespective of the sentimental aspect given to the question by some honourable members, it is misleading to make a surcharge virtually upon the various States for sums of money which they have received, and which the Government now should be contributed by them towards making up this rebate of excise duty. Some honourable members have said that when the rebate was proposed, they were under the impression that it was to be divided per capita amongst the people of the Commonwealth as the establishment of a white Australia and the encouragement of white labour on our sugar-fields was a national question, and to this extent I have no doubt that many honourable members did consider that some sacrifice on the part of the States was necessary. It is pointed out in the papers which the Treasurer has kindly handed to us that one of the States which would be in a somewhat bad position owing to the existing system of making a reduction in the rate of excise merely on whitegrown sugar, is New South Wales- a State which from the figures before us appears to have consumed by far the largest quantity of Australian-grown sugar. I would point out that when the Excise Tariff Bill was before us the question of the relative contributions by the States under its provisions did not arise. Those States which were likely to consume, and have consumed, the greater portion of the white-grown sugar of Queensland have been placed in this position-that instead of receiving a credit of Â£ 3 per ton excise duty on blackgrown sugar, or Â£ 6 per ton Customs duty on imported white-grown sugar, they have received a credit to their revenue of only Â£ 1 per ton excise duty on white-grown sugar. I am not aware of the method which has been adopted by the Treasurer in the payment or distribution of this rebate to the growers. The Excise Tariff Act distinctly says The rebate to be allowed at the rate of ton on the sugar-giving contents of the beet. AU rebates to be allowed at the time of delivery of the cane or beet on the ascertainment in manner prescribed of the sugar-giving contents. The word "" rebate "" has a common every day meaning. It is simply an allowance in respect of white-grown sugar, and instead of charging Â£ 3 per ton excise duty to the grower, or producer, or manufacturer-that is, to the man who last handled it-as we do on black-grown sugar, we charge only Â£ 1 per ton. We charge Â£ 3 per ton virtually, but we make an allowance of Â£ 2 per ton, and that allowance was to be calculated on its sugar contents when the sugarwas brought to the mill. I am a little in think the dark by reason of the fact that I missed hearing a portion of the Treasurer's, speech the other day, and I do not think that he has really explained the modus operandi which has been adopted with regard to the rebates. It appears to me that the clear reading of the Excise Tariff' Act is that, having ascertained when the sugar-cane or beet was brought to the mill for treatment, and discovered by analysis thesugar contents of the sugar-cane or beet, it is then a question of whether its owner should pay an excise duty of Â£ 3 a ton, or whetherhe should pay an excise duty of Â£ 3 per ton with a rebate of Â£ 2 per ton-in other words, Â£ 1 per ton on the ascertained sugar contents. Whatever may have been understood by some honourable members, whatever may have been thought of"" the mode in which this loss of revenue by States consuming the white-grown sugarwas to be regulated, it was not embodied in the Act, and the proposal to go back upon that legislation, and to ask the States to pay a sum of Â£60,000 in order to recoup to the States which have used thewhite-grown sugar the sum of Â£ 2 per ton rebate on that sugar seems to me grossly unjust. It is a bad departure in principle. It is extremely dangerous to go back on a legislative enactment which has been on the statute-book for twelvemonths, and under which certain suras have been paid and certain accounts have been adjusted with regularity between the States, and ask those States, for a surcharge provided for by new legislation. It is a departure which, asregards the past, I cannot understand, but which, as regards the future, may beperfectly just, now that the question is. raised for the first time in Parliament. -Â£2 per That appears to me to be a strong point. I .should like the Treasurer, by interjection, toenlighten me as to the manner in which therebates have been paid or allowed. It is. clear that the Excise Tariff A ct contemplated a mere rebate or virtually thecollection of Â£ 1 per ton on the sugar contents instead of Â£ 3 per ton. It provides that the rebate shall be allowed at the rate of Â£ 2 per ton on the sugar-giving contents of the cane or beet, at the time of the delivery of the cane or beet on the ascertainment of the sugar-giving contents in the manner prescribed. Where is the delivery of the cane or beet to be made? Undoubtedly it is to be made to the mill or place of treatment where the sugar contents are to be ascertained, and the excise duty of Â£ 1 per ton collected from the producer of the sugar, which would give him the advantage of a protection of 5 per ton against foreign sugar. That was considered by many honourable members on this side to be a very high rate of protectionsuch a rate as would encourage the growth and production of sugar by European labour. Section 93 of the Constitution Act distinctly says thatThe duties of excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State, and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, shall he taken to have been collected, not in the former but in the latter State. That is to say, that the State where a ton of this sugar is consumed shall be credited with the excise duty. What excise duty ? Surely the Treasurer will not tell me that he has first credited the States with the Â£ 3 per ton excise duty, and then debited them with the Â£ 2 per ton rebate-that a host of financial operations have had to be gone through, instead ""of .the simple operation contemplated by the Excise Tariff Act of collecting and crediting to . the States only Â£ 1 per ton on the sugar contents of white-grown cane, instead of Â£ 3 . I cannot understand the Government not seeing that-whethe r this policy is one which Australia will approve of in the future or not-it is an injustice to pass retrospective legislation, and to go back on our previous legislation. I trust that the good sense of the Committee will see that it is inadvisable and unfair at this very early stage of our existence, not only to amend our legislation, but to go in for a retrospective surcharge on the various States, which will be a tax on some of their revenues.",50
369,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"The question of fixing the mode of dealing with the rebate, as it was unfortunately called, on whitegrown sugar gave the Blouse a considerable amount of trouble. We were all anxious that the rebate should go to the grower of the cane, and we knew well that, if we had an excise duty paid by the manufacturer of the sugar and allowed the rebate off the duty, then there might be a little difficulty about the whole of the rebate getting back to the grower. The Act provides for an excise duty of Â£ 3 per ton on the manufactured sugar, and we are bound to collect that sum. We cannot collect only Â£ 1 per ton. The Act tells us that on the manufactured sugar we are to collect the excise duty. My honourable friend opposite seems to think that we ought to collect the excise duty from the grower when he takes his cane to the mill, but that would be utterly impracticable. Mr Y . L . SOLOMON - O r from the mill.",51
370,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"We collect the Excise, duty when the sugar produced from the cane goes into consumption, and it is not collected for many months after we have had to pay the rebate to the growers-in some cases probably fifteen or eighteen months, because a considerable stock is carried over from one year to the other.",51
371,Mr HIGGINS,VICTORIAN,At what stage is the rebate paid ? Sir. GEORGE TURNER - We pay the rebate to the grower immediately the sugar cane is delivered at the mill. Our authorised officers at the mill give a certificate which is equal to cash. It is cashed on presentation at the Treasury or other convenient places throughout the State.,51
372,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIAN,The rebate is paid on a sum which has not been collected ?,51
373,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"Certainly . ' "" Rebate "" may not have been the right word to use, but it was very difficult to find a word which would have better answered our purpose. But the object was perfectly clearthat the grower immediately he delivered his cane at the mill should be entitled to receive his certificate, and to get that certificate cashed as quickly as possible afterwards. The mode adopted in administration has enabled him to get that money within a day or two of the delivery of his cane at the mill. The excise itself can only be collected on the sugar produced from the cane, and that is collected from persons entirely different from those who grow the cane. There is no other means of carrying out the Act in a fair and reasonable manner than by adopting that practice, which gives to the grower what Parliament intended, 4s. per cwt. for sugar grown by white labour.",51
374,Mr WILKS,VICTORIAN,As a subsidy.,52
375,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"As a subsidy to enable the grower to make up for the loss - thoug h the honourable and learned member for Werriwa says there is very little losssupposed to be caused by the employment of white labour instead of black. When we had to pay this rebate we had no money appropriated by Parliament for that purpose; and the only course open to me was to take whatever excise was collected, put it in a trust fund, and pay the rebates out of it .",52
376,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,"What about section 89 of the Constitution, requiring that money to be paid to the States 1",52
377,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"I continued to do that until I saw how the matter was working out. I quite admit that, in strictness, I might have been bound to hand the money over to the States as collected.",52
378,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,"Bound by Constitution, in exclusive terms.",52
379,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,No doubt. Mr V. L . SOLOMON - The Treasurer still has that money ?,52
380,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"Ye s ; and shall hold it until Parliament directs it to be distributed. But what is the difference 1 Suppose I had paid the money over to the titates, I should still have asked Parliament to allow the charge to be borne on a population basis.

384,Sir GEORGE TURNER,VICTORIAN,"The debermination of the question resbs with Parliament, whose hands are not tied. Ib is quibe the possible for Parliamenb bo say that for this year the distribution shall be made on the old system, and that the new syrtem shall apply only in the future. Parliament is not injured in any way. In fact, no one has been injured by the action which I book; and I consider that that action was amply justified, and was in the best interests of all the parties concerned in the' disbi ibubion of the money. The question as bo whebher we oughb or oughb nob bo make this change apply bo bhis year is one which has bo be considered by the Commibbee. I bhink ib is admibted on all hands that ib is unfair bo compel the States to pay in the mode in which the A ct would have compelled them to pay. If it is unfair for the next and the following' years, to my mind ib is equally unfair for the pasb year. If ib is wrong in principle, as we admib ib is, to make the charge in one way, andwe say that it is to be made in another way, surely we should begin by making the charge in' a proper manner from the start. That was the object which I had in viewso that the hands of Parliament should not be tied, and so that the money should not be paid over to the Sbabes, wibh the consequence that ib would have bo be baken from bhem afterwards.

I desire to propose an amendment on clause 1, with a view of testing the question of the original jurisdiction of the High Court, but I shall not do so at this stage if clause 3 be also postponed. In the absence of any promise as to the postponement of the latter clause, the sooner we test the question of the. original",54
396,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,"Some honourable members would, in any case like to see the question of the original jurisdiction raised on clause GEOBGE 75.",54
397,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"I have given notice of an amendment on clause 1 which will immediately raise the question of the original jurisdiction, and this may have something to do with the anxiety of the Attorney-General to have the clause postponed. When the Bill was before us last week, the Attorney General was particularly anxious that clause 1 should be passed at once as a merely formal clause, but I immediately asked that it should be discussed, with a view to its improvement by the omission of certain words. The amendment of which I have given notice would have the effect of confining the original jurisdiction of the High Court to the matters contemplated by section 75 of the Constitution ",54
398,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,We ought first to settle the jurisdiction.,54
399,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,And this is a convenient clause on which to do so.,54
400,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"In this matter I am entirely in the hands of the Committee. If honourable members are of opinion that we are in a position to deal with the questions raised on this purely index clause, I am prepared to deal with it, though to me that course appears most undesirable. When the Bill was last before us, I regarded it as a clause which might have been passed without question, because it must necessarily be amended to correspond with any alterations the Committee may make in other parts of the Bill. If clauses are altered substantially, the index to the Bill must necessarily be altered, and consequently I then regarded it as a matter of no importance. But the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr . Judiciary Glynn, sought on this clause to raise the question of the jurisdiction, with which the - court was to be invested, and that appeared to me so undesirable a course that I now propose a postponement of the clause instead of asking honourable members to pass it as a matter of form. If we deal with - the question of jurisdiction, surely we had better deal with it on the clauses which :specifically endow the court.",54
401,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,What clause 1,55
402,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"The clauses a3 we come to them. If the Committee prefer, however, to deal with the question of jurisdiction before touching the question of the number of Judges, I am prepared to postpone clause 3 along with clause 1. But I do not. think that the most desirable method of procedure. I fear that the Connexion or proportion to be established between the jurisdiction and the strength of the Bench cannot, even in the minds of professional members, be clear and beyond dispute. It is a matter on which every two professional men, in the Chamber or out of it, may well entertain different opinions. One professional man might say that if we gave the whole original jurisdiction asked for, it would mean another Judge or another two Judges, while a second professional man of equal experience might be of opinion that we could give that jurisdiction without adding a single member to the Bench. So far as I can judge, the discussion of the jurisdiction, and we must discuss it - the Bill-is not likely to effect the minds of honourable members in regard tcf the strength of the Bench in any precise way.",55
403,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,It will very materially.,55
404,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"If so, I am prepared to bow to the decision of the Committee; but my own opinion is that the discussion will not and cannot have such an effect. I will take no unfair advantage of the Committee, even though honourable members are under what appears to me to be a misapprehension. Therefore, if it be the general desire, I will agree to the postponementof clause 3 until the clauses dealing with the jurisdiction have been disposed of. If honourable members believe that the consideration of those clauses will afford them a better foundation for a specific decision as to the number of Judges to be appointed, I bow to their wish, though I think they are mistaken.",55
405,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN," Before we determine the number of J udges to be [16 JUNE, 1903.] Bill. 951 appointed, we should make up our minds as to the amount of work which they are to be called upon to perform. It is of no use to decide to appoint five Judges, and then to determine what work they shall do; we must determine the work to be done before we say how many Judges are to be appointed. I disagree with the Attorney General when he says that the number of the Judges is not relevant to the amount of work to be assigned to the Court.",55
406,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,I did not sav that.,55
407,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN,"If 'we assign to the Court only the constitutional original jurisdiction and an appellate jurisdiction, it will not have the same amount of work to perform as if the additional and optional jurisdiction relating not only to Federal matters, but to such matters as Admiralty cases and disputes between residents of the States, which belong absolutely to the States Courts, were assigned to it . The Bill also provides for the removal of suits in Federal matters from the States Courts to the High Court.",55
408,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,I am prepared to omit that provision.,55
409,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN,"If that provision is not omitted, and power to try criminal cases is also given to the Court, the Judges will have to be even more numerous than is now proposed. Five Judges will not be enough, and before the end of a year there would be a demand for an addition to their number.",55
410,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,Would it not be better to test the question of jurisdiction upon this clause?,55
411,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN,I do not think it would be convenient to do so.,55
412,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"If we do not test it on this clause, it will be necessary to postpone a great many clauses.",55
413,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN,"I suggest the postponing of clauses 1, 2, and 3. Before we proceed further, we should deal with the question of jurisdiction. Afterwards we can decide how many Judges will be required.",55
414,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN," In support of the view put forward by the Attorney General, I would remind the Committee that if we come to a decision as soon as possible as to whether the Court is to be merely an appellate court or a court of large original jurisdiction as well, we shall know how to deal with a number of subsequent clauses. I think we cannot too soon determine the jurisdiction of the Court. If it is to be almost wholly an appellate jurisdiction, many of us will say that three - Judges are enough ; but, if it is to exercise the wider jurisdiction provided for in the Bill, all legal members know that more than five Judges will be required. It will, however, be difficult to consider many of the clauses until we know what the jurisdiction of the Court is to be. I can understand honourable members saying that five Judges would be required even for an appellate court, on the ground that it would be betterthat the Judges should have a certain amount of spare time than that suitors should practically be denied justice by the delay and consequent .expense in hearing causes. On the other hand, if the jurisdiction provided for by clause 40 is conferred, five Judges cannot be enough. If the Committee intend to determine the question of jurisdiction on clause 1, well and good. But if before dealing with the question of jurisdiction it is decided to limit the nnmber of Judges, a great many of the clauses will have to be re-drafted, and the Attorney-General could not be expected to say on the spur of the moment what clauses should and what clauses should not be amended.",55
415,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN," I agree with other honourable members that the question of jurisdiction is the vital substance of the Bill, upon which its other provisions hinge, and I suggest to the Attorney-General that, to get at the root of the matter, Parts I . , I I . , and III . , should be postponed, and we should commence at clause 31 in Part IV. Although those parts are in their proper places, so far as the' drafting of the Bil l is concerned, they involve a hundred questions our decisions upon which will depend upon our determination in regard to Part IV .",56
416,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN," I ask the Attorney-General .to accept the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. It would be better to test the question of jurisdiction on clause 31 than, for reasons into which I need not enter now, to meddle with clause 1.",56
417,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN," I hope that the Attorney-General will agree to the postponement. I am' sure that we do not think that he would take advantage of the Committee, but it is known that the question of jurisdiction and the number of the Judges are both agitating the minds of many honourable members, and as, if we decide to limit the jurisdiction of the Court and to reduce the number of the Judges, the reconstruction of a large portion of the Bill will be necessary, I think it would be well to postpone all clauses which might require redrafting until we have dealt with those questions.",56
418,Mr WILKS,VICTORIAN," According to the legend inscribed on the pavement in the vestibule-""In the multitude of counsellors there is safety,"" but that saying is not borne out by what we have seen this evening. I am anxious to do what is right in connection with this Bill, but the conflicting counsels of the legal members of the Committee leave me very much in a quandary. I do not agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that if the Court were merely an appellate one there would not be enough work for five Judges, because my experience of Judges is that they are always overworked, and that the Bench is always undermanned. I think it would be better to decide the question at issue now, and thus save the waste of time which would be involved by dealing with clauses which might afterwards have to be re-considered. Motion agreed to ; clause postponed.",56
419,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"I have looked through the Bill, and have come to the conclusion that the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella is, under the circumstances, the right one to adopt. My only apprehension is that there may be a that disposition to determine the questions raised by the provisions of P a r t l V . without the full apprehension of the consequences which attach to any amendment of them. However, the responsibility in that matter will be mine, and if I am not able to bring my own conclusions home to honourable members in connection with those clauses, I should be unable to do so in connection with othet clauses. I move That clauses 2 to 30 be postponed. Motion agreed to ; clauses postponed. Clause 31In addition to the matters in respect whereof original jurisdiction is conferred on the High Courb by the Consbibubion, the Courb shall have original jurisdiction in respecb of all matters(a) arising under the Consbibution, or involving ibs inberpretation ; (6) arising under any laws made by the Parliamenb ; (c) of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; (cÂ£) relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different Sbabes. Provided that, with respect to matters which are by the laws of the Commonwealth required to be instituted in courts of summary jurisdiction or other courts of inferior jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of the High Court shall not be exercised except by way of removal of the matter from the Court in which it is pending into the High Court and thereafter hearing and determining it in the High Court.",56
420,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"I wish to remind honourable members, before they commence to discuss this clause, that it is not proposed to make the jurisdiction herein conferred exclusively that of the High Court. The proposal is to allow the Judges of the High Court to deal with the subject-matters set forth in the clause, but not to exclude the (States Courts from dealing with them. The original jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by section 75 of the Constitution is printed in small type at the foot of page 7. It is not competent for us to either reduce or alter that jurisdiction. But section 76 gives us the right to extend it by adding the subject-matters set forth in the clause. Our first intention was to give to the High Court all the original jurisdiction with which it was possible to endow it ; but, upon further consideration, and having regard to the debate upon the second reading, I propose to move the omission of paragrapli (Â«), which confers jurisdiction in respect of Admiralty and Maritime causes. The effect of the amendment will be that all such cases must be commenced, in four of the States in the Supreme Courts, and, in New South Wales and Victoria., in Admiralty Courts. We realise, even in regard to the provision allowing the power of removal from the States Courts to the High Court, the arguments for leaving Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction-whic h may in volve the detention of a ship, and should be exercised with extreme rapidity-wit h the States Courts. It is true that, even if paragraph (c) remained in the clause, the States Courts would not be - deprived of their jurisdiction in respect to those matters, but the arguments of honourable members, when the second reading was under discussion, showed that, in their opinion, the States Courts are so circumstanced that they are well able to deal with this class of cases, and the omission of the paragraph does not amount to more than a convenient reduction of the original jurisdiction of theHigh Court. But I hope the Committee will not strike out the remainder of the clause, because all that it does is to provide that when we 3P have a High Court in existence litigants may commence suits of this kind before original that tribunal. It does not do away with any of the jurisdiction at present existing in the States Courts, but leaves litigants free to take their choice.",57
421,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN,But . that liberty is taken away by clause 41.,57
422,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"I propose to ask the Committee to strike out clauses 42 and 43, and. the greater part of clause 44, retaining only such parts as it may be necessary to ' attach to the remaining clauses. I want the Committee to carefully consider before they amend the clause, what will be the effect of their action. They will prevent the Judges of the High Court from dealing in the first instance with cases whioh arise under the Constitution, or which involve its interpretation, or cases which arise under the laws of the Commonwealth, or cases which.relate to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of the different States. Surely in many instances it is likely to prove most desirable, if not necessary, that cases which arise under the Constitution or involve its inberprebabion, or cases which arise under the legislation passed by bhis Parliament, should be. broughb before the High Courb, nob only on appeal, bub in the first instance. It is not intended to compel litiganbs bo go bo the High Courb, and we shall nob impose any inconvenience upon them if they wish to resort to their own Sbabes Courts; but if the Commibbee strike oub the clause they will deprive the High Courb of an opporbuniby of dealing, in the first instance, with cases arising under the Constibubion, or involving its interpretation, or cases arising under the laws made by the Commonwealth Parliament.",57
423,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"The Constitution contemplated that possibiliby. - Mr DEAKIN - Yes , jusb in the same way thab ib conbemplabed the possibility of bhere being only three Judges. Bnt many of bhose who vobed in favour of bobh these possibilities did so, nob because they believed thab to be the best course to pursue, but because they knew that the Parliament of Australia would be intrusted with the creation of the Federal Courts. Now, I am submibbing bo the Parliamenb of Australia reasons not why it should exclude States Courts from jurisdiction, but why it should not exclude the High Court from jurisdiction in two classes of cases which, besides questions of appeal, it might prove desirable to submit for the opinion of the High Court. If a Justice of the High Court happened to be available in any State, and a question affecting the Constitution arose, why should we direct that a case must, in the first instance, be taken before the State Court? Why, in a matter peculiarly of Federal jurisdiction, should the doors of the High Court be closed against litigants ? A litigant might consider that the case in which he was interested was one specially suitable for reference to the High Court,. and one which ib might be very undesirable to submit to a State Court.",57
424,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,Probably the other party would think otherwise. Mr .DEAKIN - Why allow the plaintiff the choice of his courb under the Sbates laws and deny it here?,58
425,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,The defendant has second choice under the Bill.,58
426,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"Yes ; bub that provision is to be altered. The ordinary choice of courts under the Sbabes laws is nob bo be departed from. What is now proposed is not contrary to the ordinary practice. It seems to me necessary to advance special reasons when the Committee are asked to say that cases arising under our Constibubion, and involving ibs interpretation, must first be taken before a State Courb and nob direcb bo the High Courb.",58
427,Mr HIGGINS,VICTORIAN,"Is ib proposed bo give power bo litigants bo bring bheir cases before the Sbates Courts?,",58
428,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"Yes , under the amendments which we intend to propose, the amplest opportuniby will be afforded bo l it i gants in cases arising under the Constibubion, or involving its interpretation, or arising under the Federal laws, to go first to the States Courts, if they prefer to do so. While that liberty is left to every person who believes himself aggrieved, why should we shackle bheir choice ?",58
429,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,Why should the libiganb be allowed to go to the Sbate Courbs in cases such as those described and nob in obher cases ?,58
430,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"Because we cannob provide Federal Courbs in all the Sbabes. If the Treasury could bear the sbrain of the expendibure involved, the proper course would be to provide Federal Courts in all the States, bub we accept the existing jurisdiction, and bake the ubmosb advantage of it . Therefore, following the dictates of economy, we do not propose to close the Sbates Courbsagainsb suibs which arise in bhis manner. Ab the same time. I would ask honourable members why they think it necessary to close theHigh Court against original jurisdiction in bhese cases?",58
431,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,Why open it?,58
432,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,Because the High Courb is the mosb suitable bribunal to determine questions arising under our Constitution or under the laws of the Commonwealbh.,58
433,Mr HIGGINS,VICTORIAN,Le b the High Court determine those questions as a Court of Appeal.,58
434,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"It will still be a Court * of Appeal, but there is no reason why ib should not deal with these cases as a court of original jurisdiction with the same freedom as if it were a Court of Appeal only. Consequently, if we endow the Justices of the the High Court with this original jurisdiction we shall enable those who prefer the High Court to bring directly before ib any cases arising oub of the Constitution, or involving its interpretation. If the litiganb is nob satisfied with the decision of the single Judge on circuib before whom the case may first be bried, he may appeal bo the High Courb sibting in Banco.  General propose to get over the difficulty ifonly three J udges are appointed '(",58
435,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"If honourable .members decide ab a later stage not to go one sbep beyond what the Constitution requires, and to appoint only three Judges-if they will not take the further step which I think is necessary and desirable and appoint five J""udges-al l we can do is to provide that in the case of an appeal from the decision of one Judge, the remaining two Judges must be in agreement, or the original judgment shall stand. . That is the only recourse we have. 1 In that, case we shall have the matter tried before the ,whole Federal Bench; first by the one Judge, and then by the remaining' two J udges, and 'at least two Judges must be in agreement. Consequently, the number of Judges is nob directly involved in this question. The poinb is whebher honourable members are willing bo give litigants an open choice between their own State Courbs and the visiting Justice of the High Court, who may be on circuit in a State, or to shut the door 'of the High Courb and declare - thab litigants must in the first instance repair to the States Courts.",58
436,Mr MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,"If the work of the Court is increased, will it not involve an increase in the number of Judges 1",59
437,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,That may happen hereafter.,59
438,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,Then why not say at once that it is intended to appoint five Judges 1,59
439,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"The difference is this - that , before the number of Justices can be increased beyond that fixed in the Bill, it will be necessaiy to come down to Parliament and satisfy it that other Judges are necessary.",59
440,Mr CON HOY,VICTORIAN,That will have to be done.,59
441,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"Opinion s differ. I am confronted by two absolutely antagonistic statements from the opponents of this Bill. One section say that there will be no business for the High Court to transact, whilst other honourable members say that there will be so much business that we shall have to double the number of Judges. Who am I to believe ! I prefer to follow my own 1 opinion, namely, that the whole of the business likely to be done in the High Court for some years to come, under the measure as framed, can be transacted by the number of Judges proposed.",59
442,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,Why open two shops in order to sell the same article?,59
443,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"Why should we, when we have to open a shop to carry on a wholesale business-that of hearing appealsprevent it from carrying on a retail trade as a court of original jurisdiction ?",59
444,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,Because it will involve more expense.,59
445,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"It will involve no more expense. It may be the fault of - my comprehension, but I cannot see how the - expense will be. increased. Supposing the honourable member had a case which involved the interpretation of the Constitution, he could, under our proposal, avail himself of his own State Courts, and from"" their decision appeal to the High Court.",59
446,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,I mean that there will be more expense involved in providing the High Court with nil the necessary paraphernalia.,59
447,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"I beg the honourable member's pardon. May I , at this early - stage of the debate, put in one modest but earnest appeal that the blessed word "" paraphernalia "" shall not find a place in this discussion, unless its meaning is first 3 P 2 defined. When I endeavoured to induce some of the critics of the Bill to indicate in what way the cost of the Court would be increased to the large extent they represented, I was told that the extra expense would be involved in providing "" parapher: nalia."" When I asked the meaning of that word, I was told "" paraphernalia.""",59
448,Sir JOHN QUJCK,VICTORIAN,"Will not the Circuit Courts involve great expense 2 They will be part of the paraphernalia. Mr DEAKIN.,-The word ""paraphernalia "" cannot apply to the Circuit Courts. It may be, in one sense, made to apply to certain necessary parts of the machinery of the Court, but it always has a secondary meaning suggesting unnecessary and expensive ornamentation. I may say at once that there, is no proposal for any unnecessary or ornamental expenditure in connection with the High Court. The only proposal here is for the provision of the necessary machinery. Sir JOH N QUICK - For sending Judges all over the continent to exercise primary jurisdiction.",59
449,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"That depends on the number of Justices. If honourable members decide to cut down the number, the original jurisdiction of the High Court will be available to only a limited extent, because three Judges cannot go on circuit as often as five. The circuits and their extent will be determined by the number of Judges, and not by the jurisdiction of the Court. By conferring this additional original jurisdiction upon the High Court, honourable members will not necessarily increase the expense, but they will increase the opportunities enabling litigants to avail themselves of the Court. Very few opportunities will, however, be afforded in the more distant States for the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the High Court if the number of Judges is reduced"".",59
450,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"That is to say, if we appoint fewer Judges than is proposed, the original jurisdiction conferred on the Court will be practically a dead letter.",59
451,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"No . I do not mean that, but the original jurisdiction can only be exercised to a limited degree because the J udges cannot visit the various States with the same frequency as if the Bench were stronger, and, therefore, fewer opportunities will be presented to local litigants. If the number of Judges is cut down from five to three, I shall still argue in favour of the endowment of the Judges with original jurisdiction, because wherever they may be they should have ib. ""Where they are, libigants should be able bo bake a constitutional case before them in the first insbance, should such a case arise. If they are not there it cannob be pub before bhem then.",59
452,Mr GLINN,VICTORIAN,"They could deal wibh bhose cases under section 75 of the Consbibution. Mr DE AKI N - B u b I wish the Courb bo be able bo deal with these cases under section 76 in addition. If the suibor does nob desire bo waib for the visib of a Justice of the High Courb, he has the option of baking his case before his own Sbabe Courb. The .Justices of the High Courb will visit the different Sbabes ab regular intervals, so that litigants will have their choice between that tribunal and the States Courbs.",60
453,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,Will the Judge have any knowledge of whab cases are bo come on?,60
454,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,Yes .,60
455,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,Then must have been commenced previously.,60
456,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"A b certain dates there will be regular visitations by a Justice of the High Courb. If occasion requires, bhere may be visibabions ab obher times, bub bhere will be cerbain fixed dabes upon which a Justice of the High Courb will visit different States. When he is there, why should we say to litigants, "" Y o u shall not go bo him. If you wish bo commence an action involving a constitutional question, which is pre-eminently a Federal question, you must do so in a Stabe Courb ?""",60
457,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,Wha b is the object of giving thab opportune only bo a small percenbage of suitors ?,60
458,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"In answer to the honourable member I would point to the experience of the Justices of the different Stabes Courbs when upon circuit. As honourable members know, ib occasionally happens that a Judge of a Sbate Courb upon circuib arrives ab a bown in which he is presenbed wibh a pair of whibe gloves the facb that bhere are no criminal cases to be tried, and. often bhere may be only bwo or bhree civil cases lisbed. When High Court Justices visit some of the less populous Sbabes, ib is jusb possible that they may be presented with white gloves, and have only a short appellabe lisb wibh which to deal. But such contingencies, i they ever arise, will be much rarer if allow suitors an opportunity of bringing their cases in the first insbance before visiting Justices of the High Courb, because, bhen, the possible range of jurisdiction will cover not only the appellate, but this extraoriginal jurisdiction. Thus suitors who prefer the Federal to the Sbabe Court will be able bo come before the Justices of the H i d i o Courb, and there will be fewer instances of visits being made at which few suitors present bhemselves.",60
459,Mr MCCAV,VICTORIAN,Is bhere some mysberious abbracbion aboub bhese visiting Justices ?,60
460,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"T f nob, bhere is no harm done. Sir.EDWARD BRADDON - Bu b more money is spenb.",60
461,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"No . If we have a Courb ib musb sib ab cerbain times and places. We do nob increase the expense of that tribunal by enlarging its original jurisdiction. The only argumenb that can be urged against me, is that if we give bhis original jurisdiction we may find the High proceedings Court. circuib and obher sittings crowded wibh business, and have an application from the Government of the day bo Parliament to appoint additional Judges. In such a contingency it will rest with the Parliament bo say whebher ib prefers bo appoint additional Judges or bo decrease the jurisdiction of the Courb.",60
462,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,I b cannob do that.,60
463,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,Why nob? Do honourable members who make that sbabemenb believe that the High Courb will be called upon bo bransact a greab deal of business ?,60
464,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,We had bebber begin on a small scale and expand.,60
465,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,I would rather see the High Court begin its existence by having to transact a large amount of business than by having a smaller amount than ib is able bo deal wibh. Leb us give libiganbs the choice bebween the States Courts and the Federal Court.,60
466,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN,It will involve unto symbolize necessary expense.,60
467,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"In what way ? If we have only three J udges armed wibh appellate and cerbain original jurisdiction, we musb still make arrangements to allow of their visiting the States ab various times. Whab exbra expense would be involved in empowering the Courb bo deal wibh a libble f more business bhan ib could obherwise transwe I act ? It will cost a suitor no more to pay a barrister to appear before this than it will to j>ay him to appear before one of the States Courts.",60
468,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,VICTORIAN,What convenience will be conferred upon suitors under the Government proposal 1,61
469,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"The convenience of Court. having, in addition to the ordinary States Circuit Courts, the Federal Circuit Courts. Mi . A . MCLEAN - If we vest the 1 with this original jurisdiction, does Attorney-General think that three Judges will be sufficient ?",61
470,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"If the Committee insists upon the appointment of only three Judges the extra amount of original jurisdiction vested in the Court will not overburden them. If honourable members reduce the number of Judges to three, I vest them with this original jurisdiction in the interests of the suitors.",61
471,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN, Evi dently the Attorney-General is beginning to think that the sooner these clauses eliminated the better. This is the first occasion upon which I have seen a Minister rise-befor e a single word has been against a clause-to enter upon an elaborate defence of it .,61
472,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,There were one or two interjections.,61
473,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Evidentl y the suspicions of the Attorney-General are aroused, and he is becoming doubtful of the wisdom retaining the clauses relating jurisdiction which it was proposed to confer upon the High Court. Since last week, acting upon the excellent suggestions honourable and learned member for Bendigo, he has "" caved in "" to some extent by cuttution ting out of the Bill, without a single word of further debate, the provisions which sought to centralize jurisdictionin Admiralty and Maritime matters. Those provisions meant nothing more than .the centralization of justice.

It is really a question of centralization with its 'accompanying great expense. The Attorney-General has shown that he is doubtful of the expediency ! of conferring upon that tribunal all the Court powers that we can confer under the Constitution, because he has given notice to eliminate some of the provisions relating special to the power of removal of causes-pro visions which were expedients adopted to extend the jurisdiction of the High He is now willing to excise clauses 42 to 44 inclusive, under which a defendant is given power, before a decourt fence is entered, to remove as of right a the cause from the jurisdiction of the States Courts to that of the High Court. The At torney-General has made an elaborate defence before being attacked. He has yielded to the suggestions put forward by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and, .on his own initiative, he proposes to excise the clauses relating to the power of the still prefer to removal of causes.",61
474,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,The honourable and learned member for Indi supported the suggestion to limit the power of the removal of causes. ,61
475,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Then why not go further, are and accept the suggestions of the honourable and learned member for Indi in their entirety ? In his speech that honourable memsaid ber suggested cutting down the original jurisdiction of the Court to the matters referred to in the Constitution.",61
476,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"I said that I agreed with the honourable and learned member Jor Bendigo as to the removal of causes, and as to the wisdom of not depriving the States of Courts of any jurisdiction which they alto the original ready possess.",61
477,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"That practically means that we should not confer upon the High of the Court any greater jurisdiction than is already assigned to it . Under the Constithat Court is given original jurisdiction in regard to five matters. The Attorney General has said that the Judges must go to the various States to sit, because we must give them original jurisdiction irrespective of whether we like it or not. But I do not suppose that one case will arise in two years, perhaps not one in ten years, under section Courts. But 75 of the Constitution. Mr L. E. GROOM - What about cases in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition is",61
478,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Ver y few cases . will None will arise under any treaties or as affecting Consuls. There may be cases against the Commonwealth, but these can be dealt with by the States Courts. This is an original jurisdiction .that is not exclusive Under this Bill actions may be taken in States Courts, so that very few cases arise under section 75 of the Constitution, because though the original jurisdiction cannot be taken away from the High Court to the extent that it has been vested Constitution, in most of these matters jurisdiction is actually possessed by the States ject. Courts. That is so in cases of State against State, or even in the case of an action against the Commonwealth.",61
479,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,Surely the States Courts could not entertain an action in which State Court. State was against a State.,62
480,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Yes ; they could do so even leaning. before the Constitution was passed. It has 'been the opinion of the highest Judges that a suit could have been brought in any State if that State had been made the defendant. There may have been-a disinclination to do anything of the sort, bui the power existed before this Constitution was framed. be taken ? Any State could sue another State in its own Court, and any citizen could sue another State in its own Court. It is true that actions of the kind may be veryinfrequent. Althoughweareahvaystalkstitution ing of these matters it this House, I do remember a single case in which a State taken action against another State. So far as_ that provision is concerned, its will be very infrequent; but it will be concurrent with a power alread} existing in case of States, though, of preference, no with the Commonwealth. doubt a suitor may occasionally wish to to the High Court. Perhaps, a writ of mandamus may be asked against an officer of the Commonwealth, but up to the of present we have not conferred the power under any Act of Parliament to issue mandamus against the Commonwealth. Last year, when I tried, during the discusmore'a sion upon the Claims Against the Commonit wealth Bill, to have a provision inserted under which the Minister for Trade Customs might be made to deliver up docuupon ments, upon which he had been sleeping perfact haps for months, the Government horrified at the idea of a power being given by prerogative writ to compel action by Ministeiof the Crown.",62
481,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,There would not be the same objection to giving the power to High Court of the Commonwealth.,62
482,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"I do not see that change of Court would make the slightest difference. Suppose an application were made to compel a Minister to disgorge the moneys he held over-and in this conwill nexion I need only refer to the proceedings of this afternoon in connection with the Sugar Bonus Bill"" An application of that kind may be made by a State to by the proceed f gainst the Commonwealth.",62
483,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,To a Staâte Court? I ob,62

485,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,I should prefer the Federal,62

487,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,Because it concerns of a State Federal affairs ?,62
488,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Not Federal aflairs exclusively, but aflairs arising under the Conwhich cover, not the rights of the not Commonwealth alone, but the rights of the has Federation, which includes the States.",62
489,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,Such cases should be deexercise cided by an Australian Court.,62
490,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"I think the honourable the member sometimes confuses the Constitution 7 The Federal go Courts are to be the guardians not of the Commonwealth, but of the Constitution, and the Constitution declares the right not only the Federal Executive, or of the Federal State, as we may term it , but the rights a of the States which are units in the Federation. A Federal court therefore is no court of the Commonwealth-thoug h is a court of the Constitution-tha n is a State Court. The obligation of the laws is and as imperative upon the States Courts as Federal Courts, because as a matter of they all have their source in an Imperial were law equally binding upon all.",62
491,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,There must be a wide a margin for the personal equation in every instance.,62
492,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"If we follow the lead of the America in this matter we shall find that original jurisdiction is there confined to the cases in which a State sues a State or a State sues the Commonwealth or where Ambassadors, public Ministers, or Consuls are concerned. In no other case is original jurisdiction given to a Federal Court in America.",62
493,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN,Cases arising out Federal laws.,63
494,Mr OMALLEY,VICTORIAN,The Circuit Courts have original jurisdiction.,63
495,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"In no other cases is ginal jurisdiction given to the Supreme Qourt of America. Original jurisdiction is given to the Federal Circuit Courts for reasons which are not applicable here. In America, there was no power under the Constitution to confer Federal jurisdiction upon States Courts, and for that reason they were obliged in the first year, I think in 17S9, at the same time as they created the Supreme Court of America, to create a series of-Federal Courts to localize justice. But under our Constitution, anticipating that there would be no necessity for many years to come to create Federal Courts, power is expressly taken, to vest jurisdiction in the States Courts. Still it is true that the Supreme Court of America has original jurisdiction in exceedingly few cases. We have, b}' our Constitution, - given original jurisdiction to the High Court in those cases, and in one or two more. Surely it will not be said that the efficiency of our existing courts is not adequate for the discharge of original matters that may arise 1 Surely it would be far better for honourable members to allow the Supreme Court of a State, for instance, to hear an appeal from a court of summary jurisdiction upon a matter involving some point arising under the Customs Act 1 Whether we give original jurisdiction or not to the High Court in matters arising under section 76 of the Constitution summary jurisdiction will .still remain in the summary courts of the States, so that a Customs information would be heard, not by a Federal Court, but the court of summary jurisdiction. Would it not be better, therefore, that in the first instance an appeal from a conviction in a Customs case should be heard by the Supreme Court of a State than by a Federal Circuit Jndgegoingonce in four or six months to a State to hear cases ? In the first place we should get the point decided by three Judges, and the chances would then be that unless there was a divergence between the decisions of various States upon some - question the matter would not be taken to the High Court of Australia. But, if the matter is taken before a single Federal Judge on circuit, in nine cases out of ten the chances are that it will go on to the High Court. of Mr OMALLEY - No , it is the other way according to the experience of America.",63
496,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"The honourable member is again bringing in the experience of oriAmerica, forgetting that under our system we shall have one circuit Judge, whilst in America the Circuit Court consists of three Judges. In America the Circuit Court is practically a court of final appeal.",63
497,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,In some cases.,63
498,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,In near]}' all cases.,63
499,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,What is the full strength of the Supreme Court of America 1,63
500,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"There are nine Judges of the Supreme Court of America, but the Circuit Courts act as courts of appeal and courts of original jurisdiction. I think there are three Judges sitting at these Circuit Courts - the District Judge and two Judges of the Supreme Court of America. In all cases where they do not certify that a point ought to be reservedor unless the Supreme Court of America on special application, as of grace, grants an appeal, which very seldom occurs, the decision of the Circuit Court in America is final. So that really in America the Circuit Court would be equal to our proposed High Court.",63
501,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,"Indee d it would not. - Mr Glynn - I think it would, because as I have mentioned in nine cases out of ten an appeal would not go - beyond the Circuit Court.",63
502,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,That does not make it equal.,63
503,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"l a m not contending that it would be of equal ability, but that it would be equal in point of efficiency, which means expedition and cheapness. The question of ability is a matter of the personnel of the court, and we cannot predicate that the Australian Court will be better than the American Court or, say, that the American Court is better than the Australian Court will be. Before we can speak upon that point we must wait until we see the calibre of the Judges appointed to the High Court, and the less political such appointments are the better they are, as a rule.",63
504,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,I 'was speaking of their jurisdiction.,63
505,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Of course they are not equal in that respect, because they have not the ultimate appellate power. But, in addition to the powers they have to which I have already referred, and the fact that the tribunal consists of three Judges, nearly all the removals is America are not to the Supreme Court, but from the States Courts to the Circuit Courts. Nearly all the removals there are from District Courts - which are Federal Courts or from States Courts, which are allowed to exercise Federal jurisdiction under certain conditions, to the Circuit Courts. This shows that they are tribunals of almost equal importance to the High Court which we propose to establish. It is shown also that in America these tribunals promote the decentralization of justice. It is certain that if we allow original jurisdiction here we allow it to be exercised by a single Judge upon circuit, and the cases must wait until the circuit is made, which in America occurs only once in six months. Consequently if the decision is to be that of a single Judge in a majority of cases it will mean the carrying of the cases on to the High Court with consequent additional expense. The Attorney-General will surely be influenced by an authority such as Cooley on this question. Cooley is a writer on purely constitutional measures, not like Story and some others who are general writers on American laws, and who incidentally deal with constitutional questions. Books which are directed purely to matters of constitutional interpretation and constitutional rights will, I think, be admitted as authorities of greater weight than those in which such matters are incidentally referred to in a general discourse upon law. After mentioning that as an interpreter of the Constitution that must be a Court of Appeal, that the Supreme Court is necessary to secure uniformity as an appellate tribunal, and that the same principle does not apply to original jurisdiction, Cooley says :These reasons do not, however, apply to the original jurisdiction over a case, but only to the formal application in the case of the rule of law that shall govern it. The full purpose of the Federal jurisdiction is subserved if the case, though first heai-d in the State Court, may be removed at the option of the parties, for final determination, to the Courts of the States. That is the opinion of one of the chief constitutional writers' in America on the working of their Constitution, and surely honourable members will accept that as a weighty authority-that cept in a few matters arising the Constitution, should be left to the Mr Glynn. States Courts. There is another authority, who should to some extent influence the Attorney-General, and thab is Mr Garran. I am not referring now to the work which has so justly merited the eulogium of every one who has looked at it-Messrs . Quick and Garran's work on the Constitutionbut to a little work entitled 27ie Coming Commomvealth, published before the inauguration of the Commonwealth, by Mr. Garran, who is now secretary to the Attorney-General, and who probably has had something to do with the framing of these Judiciary and Procedure Bills. What does Mr Garran say?In practice it will probably be found that the original jurisdiction will only be required in a limited class of cases; for instance, where the Commonwealth is a partj', where one State is proceeding against another, or where the representatives of other countries are affected. These are, of course, cases in which original jurisdiction is given under section 75 of the Constitution. Mr Garran goes on to sayIu other Ciises it will probably be better to leave the original jurisdiction wholly to the State Courts subject to the right of appeal to the Federal Court. That is what we are asking for, and J. give it on the authority of the Secretary to the Attorney-General. That appears in a book published just before the Convention began to sit in order to influence the judicial provisions of the Constitution.",63
506,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,Those were his firsb bhoughbs.,64
507,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,I bhink bhat his first thoughts happen to be his best thoughts in this case. Let us look at what would be the effecb of conferring bhis jurisdiction upon the Sbates Courts. It would mean that in every case where legislation had been passed under section 51 of the Constitution the Federal Circuit Judge would have equal power to hear disputes with State Judges. That would include all baxabion matters Mr L . E. GEOOM - Jurisdictio n has been given in the Customs Act and the Excise Act.,64
508,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Origina l jurisdiction is given as a temporary provision, but in summary matters it is given absolutely. The Government have up to the present time poinb-blank refused bo - bring in a Bill conferring full . original jurisdiction on justice, ex- the Courbs of the States. In a piecemeal under way they have given jurisdiction in various Acbs. They have given jurisdiction in the Customs Act, and-force d upon them by the House-in the Post and Telegraph Act. It was a jurisdiction, as at first proposed, only conferred until the High Court was created. Surely honourable members will remember that in several Bills-the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Bill, the Post and Telegraph Bill, and others-the Government proposed to give only temporary jurisdiction to the States Courts, and that the provision was that automatically on the establishment of the High Court the Federal jurisdiction conferred on the States Courts was to cease? The Government have not proposed to give the States Courts the full jurisdiction. As a matter of fact, I believe that the States Courts have jurisdiction, in spite of them ; but they have shown a disinclination to absolutely confer the jurisdiction so that it should be beyond all doubt. If we confer this original jurisdiction on theHigh Court, and a question on a promissory nobe arises, the jurisdiction will be vesbed in the Circuib Courbs as well as the Sbabes Courbs. . I ask honourable members bo say how can rnabters of Insolvency and Bankrupbcy be determined by a Circuib Judge ? It is not an ordinary issue, to be determined at a single sitbing. Ib is nob a question of facb which goes before a jury. Bankruptcy proceedings extend over months. There are the adjudication, the firsb hearing, various examinations before receivers and accounbants, occasional references to the Bankruptcy Judges, and the final hearing. Generally the proceedings extend over many months, and require very elaborate machinery. How, then, can it be said that in a mabber of that sorb the Federal jurisdiction can be properly exercised by the Federal Circuit Court ? It cannot be done unless you go to the High Court. The result will then be as has been indicated- a complete centralization of jurisdiction. So far as the Bill is alleged to give more efficient decisions in Federal matters, or to expedite proceedings, or to secure economy, it is a perfect farce. It will be inefficient for the reasons I have mentioned j it must be more expensive, and as the. J udges cannot go on circuit more than, perhaps, once in six months without delaying the appellate jurisdiction, it will lead to considerable delay in the meting oub of justice. I should like bo refer the Attorney-General to a very recent authority. In the Annals of t/te American Academy o j Social and Political Science for March lasta volume which only came out by the last post- I find a very excellent article by Professor Harrison Moore, who has already published a very fair work on our Constibubion.",64
509,Mr DEAKIX,VICTORIAN,"It is an admirable article, which I have read.",65
510,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"I am sorry that the honourable and learned gentleman had not an opportunity to read the article last week. If he had then thought it an admirable article he would have proved his conviction by not bringing in the Bill. Professor Harrison Moore points out, as we have endeavoured to do, that there is no immediate necessity to create the High Court; at all events to arm it with very exbensive jurisdiction. He says The establishment of the High Courb is likely to be deferred. He mentions that probably the country would not stand the appointment of political Judges- I do not know what right he had to make that remark, because, of course, bhere is no talk about doing thab-and he goes on bo sayAgain, the legal issues presented to the courbs 1 can hardly be of the same supreme importance as bhose which have arisen in the United States, where again and again the courts have been faced with problems affecting the national security. Finally, the Constibubion can be amended wibh comparative ease. In fact, the object of his article is to show that the problems which are likely to affect us for many years to come will be very few, and are nob likely to be big national ones, which require exbensive jurisdiction in our courbs, and he says that the work can be properly done by the Sbabes Courbs. Qf course, we shall be bold again thab we wanb a purer tribunal. Let us not idealize the Supreme Court of America too much. Mr . Woodrow Wilson, whom I am sure the Attorney-General respects as an authoriby, has sbabed that ib has almosb invariably taken its colour from the prevailing political opinion of the day. We have heard an apostrophe from the Atborney-General on bwo occasions bo the genius of that courb. Even in Marshall's time it was federalist, because the federalist parby was bhen in power. In his work on Congressional Government, Mr Woodrow Wilson saysI t has been during comparatively short periods of transition, when public opinion was passing from one political creed to another, bhat the decisions of the Federal Judiciary have been distinctly opposed to the principles of the ruling political party. Let us not be led too much by this excessive eulogy which has been given to the High Court, and imagine that the States Courts are not likely to be free from undue influence in coming to their decisions. We know that the Supreme Court of America, for ten years after Marshall's time, a democratic Government being in power, gave decisions that were purely democratic. I have not endeavoured to impugn the purity of the Federal Court, but whenever the States Courts are mentioned, we are immediately met with the statement that we cannot trust the interpretation of the Federal laws to them. When honourable members use. that class of argument, I ask them to prove the assertion that the Federal Court is likely to be purer than the States Courts in the administration of justice. When I go to authorities in America, I find that the Supreme Court there has not been so absolutely pure. Being a single court, and having a final voice, it did of course reconcile decisions. Whether the judgment was sound or unsound, it had to give the last word, and therefore it did lay down finally what was the interpretation of the law, but it was sometimes affected by the prevailing opinion of the party in power-in Marshall's time by Federal views, and for ten j'ears afterwards by purely democratic views. That is a class of argument which we have not used, but it has been used by the Government, and for that reason I refer to it . I hope that honourable members will excise the clause, and confine the original jurisdiction of the High Court to matters arising under Section 75 of the Constitution. By doing so they will justif}' a smaller Bench, expedite justice, render it cheaper, and, on the whole, secure the requisite Federal efficiency.",65
511,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN, I sincerely hope that the Conimittee will not eliminate the clause except to the extent which the At torney-General has indicated. I think we ought to consider also some of the concluding words. I do not know whether he really intended to include the question Of removals in his observations with regard to some later clauses. I think it is rather consequential on what he said.,66
512,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,I propose to ask the Comsee mittee to retain the power of removal for special cause-that is why I did not mention those-bu t to delete the power of removal as of right.,66
513,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"The honourable and learned gentleman does not mean that he is going to retain the concluding words with regard to removals-at all events, in their present form 1",66
514,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,That is another matter.,66
515,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"Confinin g my observations to the substance of this clause, I think it is only right that it should be retained. Under the Constitution the High Court has original jurisdiction in all mattersArising under any treaty. Tliat is to say, no' matter between whom they may arise or under what circumstancesAffecting Consuls or other representatives of other countries. In which the Commonwealth or a person suing or being sued pn behalf of the Commonwealth is a party. No matter what the question is or under what law it arises-whethe r it arises under the Customs Act, or the Post and Telegraph Act, oithe Excise Act, or under the Constitution itself-if the Commonwealth or any person representing the Commonwealth sues an individual, the High Court will have original jurisdiction, and vice versa., if any individual sues the Commonwealth under any circumstances the High Court will have original jurisdiction. So that nearly all the cases with which we have been familiar in the past under Federal law will be within the original jurisdiction of the High Court, whether we give this additional .jurisdiction or not. Honourable members will not eliminate original jurisdiction if they strike out this clause. We shall require to have the opportunities for deciding these cases; we shall require to have the Judges in sufficient numberwhether it be three, four, or five-and with sufficient opportunities to decide these cases, and all that these other clauses do, as far as I can see, is to give the same opportunity to private individuals as between themselves or between corporations and private individuals,'to go to the High Court to get decisions that an individual suing the Government, . or the Government suing an individual. would have. Therefore, I think it means very little difference, if any, so far as I can as regards expense. You must have the Court sufficiently equipped, furnished with means, and established with the proper opportunities to decide these cases, in original jurisdiction, mark you, as between the Government and the private individual. And it seems to me only to be right to alford litigants the opportunity, if they so desire, to go to the High Court in the first instance, when they will, perhaps, be quite satisfied without any further appeal; and if there is any further appeal, it cannot go to the Privy Council.",66
516,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,What is the use of cating courts ? ,67
517,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"If I have succeeded in conveying my meaning aright, we are not. duplicating any court. The High Court must be there in any event; it ' must be there for the purpose amongst others-- a purpose that cannot be taken away, because it is embedded in the Constitution-of deciding such cases as we have heard of in the past.",67
518,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIAN,It does not follow that we need provide a High Court in every State if the States Courts are invested with the ' jurisdiction.,67
519,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"Perhaps I have not conveyed my meaning yet. I have no intention to support a proposal to prevent the States Courts from deciding these cases, and to make this jurisdiction exclusive in the High Court. Sir JOHN QmcK - The Bill does that.",67
520,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"Not in this clause. While I should support the States Courts having the fullest means of deciding these particular cases, because it is impossible, with the. means at our disposal, to provide a High Courtmachinery to sufficiently cover the ground ; on the other hand, I say that we cannot take away from the High Court the power of deciding questions arising under the Federal laws, and under the Constitution. Whether it is a civil or a criminal matter, we cannot deprive the High Court of the jurisdiction, and we must furnish it with the means of deciding the cases. Supposing that we have the High Court; supposing that we have a Judge there with inalienable power to decide these cases as between the Commonwealth and the individual, we are not increasing the expense, so far as I can see, by one penny by saying that the same Judge, with the same opportunities before him, shall decide any similar question between two private individuals. That is all I mean to convey.",67
521,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,We cannot take the Judge to the individual.,67
522,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,He is there. .,67
523,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"The Supreme Court of the State where the individual is, has also the power, so that this Bill is duplicating power.",67
524,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"The Supreme Courtof the State is located in the capital. It has to visit various parts of the State. So that the honourable and learned memdupliber might as well say-ther e being local courts in the different parts of a State"" Why take the Supreme Court to those parts?"" The same argument would deprive all the Supreme Courts of the States of their original power, because you have in the various parts of the States, Courts of General Sessions, Courts of Quarter Sessions, District Courts, and County Courts, all doing the same work. It is impossible for an honourable member to look at the jurisdictions exercised in his own State without seeing that there is an alternative power given to act to the various courts ; but at the same time you do not shut a man out from going to the Supreme Court. And it seems to me, that you should say to litigants- "" You are not forced to go to the State Court; you are not forced to go to the High Court; you can go to which you like. There it is. The doors are open. There is not a penny more expense. The Judge is there.""",67
525,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,The honourable and learned member cannot convince me that there will not be a penny more expense.,67
526,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"You have the jurisdiction in all these local courts. Do not forget that. We have had in the past cases which would have come under the jurisdiction of the High Court, as given in the Constitution. All Customs cases such as those of which we have heard would be within the original jurisdiction of the High Court in any event.",67
527,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,What court would carry on the appeals if the J udges were occupied with other matters ?,67
528,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,What courts carry ou the appeals in the States Supreme Courts when the Judges are on circuit ?,67
529,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN,"If we are to have the same number of Judges as the States Supreme Courts have, I agree with the honourable and learned member.",67
530,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"I must try to keep within the bounds of the clause before the Committee. We were told that we were not to discuss clause 3 - that we were not to consider the number of Judges until we had decided the work that they would have to do. My honourable and learned friend now wants to draw me into a discussion upon clause 3, irrespective of that. I am prepared to discuss the question of the number of the Judges if we are in order in doing so. As to that, I agree with the Attorney-General, that to do the work set out by the Attorney-General himself, we cannot do with less than five Judges. We cannot do justice to the smaller States without that number. It seems to me that to say that there shall be three Judges sitting in one of the larger States, and that people shall be compelled to bring their appeals to that Court, will be wrong to the other States. To make the High Court a peripatetic Court of three Judges, wandering around without doing other work, is almost impossible to contemplate. When we come to the clause in question, I shall be prepared to deal with it , but I am talking of this question of jurisdiction ; and it seems to me that we do not sufficiently' recollect the new jurisdiction that already exists by virtue of the Constitution. It is not as though we were taking a class of cases-sa y cases arising under Federal Acts of Parliament or under the Constitution-and giving them absolutely to the High Court for the first time; beeause, as I have pointed out, the vast number of these cases, perhaps the majority of them, will be within the grasp of the High Court whenever it is constituted.",67
531,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN,"Are they not mostly matters of summary jurisdiction-unde r section 75, sub-section (3) for instance.",68
532,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,Does the honourable and learned member mean cases in which the Commonwealth is a party? Surely that embraces all cases in which those conditions occur.,68
533,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,They will be mostly cases of individuals.,68
534,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"They may not be. They may be cases of great importance where, say, under the Customs Act, a person sues for a refund of customs duties paid.",68
535,Mr G LYNN,VICTORIAN,Many of them are matters concerning individuals.,68
536,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"I happen to be engaged in one or two cases myself, and I know perfectly well their nature.",68
537,Mr LE GROOM,VICTORIAN,There may also be cases for the recovery of duties paid under the Escise Act.,68
538,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,They are very rare actions; the majority of them are otherwise.,68
539,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"No one can tell what the majority of such cases will be. I know that there are a number of important actions pending now, in which the High Court would have jurisdiction. Therefore, I say that by voting against this clause, honourable . members will be cutting away the rights of individuals in suits between themselves, whereas we cannot help giving the right - we are in presence of a right which we cannot take away-in cases where an individual is a party on the one side or the other, and the Commonwealth is the opposite party. Then there are cases between States and the Commonwealth in which a writ of mandamus or injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. That is a matter in which the High Court will have jurisdiction in any event, and it is a class of case in which the Commonwealth ought to be represented as a Commonwealth. It seems to me that we shall be doing a wrong, and doing something anomalous unless we pass this clause. Without referring to the larger consideration to which the Attorney General alluded it seems to me that we should not be doing right if we did. not permit the High Court-the grand expositor of this Constitution in Federal matters-to have the opportunity of hearing cases if litigants choose to come to that tribunal and say- "" We desire to have this matter determined by the High Court."" Thelitigants may be perfectly ready to abide by the judgment of one Judge of the High Court. They may not want to go any further.",68
540,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,On e of them will be content.,68
541,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN,"Of course in one sense my honourable friend is right. But both parties may be content, and may not want to go any further with the case. Persons are very often satisfied, and s a y - "" I have had this case fairly fought out; I am satisfied to have had a judgment of a Judge of the High Court,"" and no appeal is taken. I think that the extra expense involved is infinitesimal. That is the view which I wish to put before the Committee.",68
542,Mr MCC AY,VICTORIAN," I have listened with great interest to the view of the honourable and learned member for Indi, but I think that throughout the whole of his remarks he has been assuming the real point tit issue between the two parties in connection with this clause. He has really not only been assuming that it is desirable to give to the High Court what we cannot stop it from having, the original jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution ; but also to put that jurisdiction into active operation by providing courts and Judges to hear these suits, and thereby, so far as possible, taking the jurisdiction away from the States Courts, to whom we can give original jurisdiction at the present time.",68
543,Mr CKOUCH,VICTORIAN,Did not the second reading of the Bil l assume that ?,69
544,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,It did not assume it as far as I am concerned. Mr L . E. GROOM - Does the honourable and learned member contemplate a court without original jurisdiction?,69
545,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"I contemplate doing without a High Court for the present. The second reading of the Bill has affirmed the principle that there shall be a High Court, but this Committee has a perfectly free hand to decide what the character of that Court shall be, within the limits prescribed by the Constitution. What I say is, that if we are to have a High Court, let us limit it to the functions so magnificently described during the second-reading debate, when we were told that the Commonwealth Court was to be constituted to harmonize all the conflicting currents of judicial decision throughout Australia. We want only an appellate court to do that; and not a court of original jurisdiction, where the jurisdiction is exercised by individual Judges. To. say that we are giving the High Court original jurisdiction in these matters, is not correct. We cannot help the High Court from having that jurisdiction. But the Court may be so constituted that the original jurisdiction will not, as a matter of fact, be exercised by it , but primarily by the Supreme Courts of the States, if we give the jurisdiction to them ",69
546,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,Surely litigants ought to have the opportunity of going to the High Court in the first instance if they choose.,69
547,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"Litigant s will not want to go to the High Court in 99 cases out of 100 unless it is as convenient to them as the Supreme Court of their State will be. That Court for all practical purposes is at the door of most litigants, and continually at their demand; and unless you make the High Court of Australia as available as the Supreme Court of a State it will not get the original jurisdiction. Suits involving original jurisdiction will not be brought before it . Every additional piece of jurisdiction you confer upon the High Court means a very considerable increase of expense to the Commonwealththat is, to the States and to their constituents. Unless you are going to say that the Judges of the High Court exercising original jurisdiction are to be such a superior class of persons as compared with the Supreme Court Judges of the States, that their decisions will be accepted as final without appeal, there will be no new benefit offered to litigants going to the High Court in the first instance. The Attorney-General is on the horns of a dilemma in this matter.",69
548,Mr A MCLEAN,VICTORIAN,I think he is on the wrong horn.,69
549,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,If he has five Judges of the Supreme Court he will not be able to provide enough Circuit Courts to make the attendance of the High Court Judges sufficiently frequent to enable them to compete-othe r things being equal-wit h the States Courts so far as the personal convenience of litigants is concerned.,69
550,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,The States Courts are not equal. The honourable and learned member is looking only to Victoria.,69
551,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,The Attorney-General is wrong if he refers to the calibre of the Judges.,69
552,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,Bot h the calibre and the number.,69
553,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,In South Australia they have only three Judges.,69
554,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,In Tasmania only three.,69
555,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"There is not the same population in either South Australia or Tasmania, and three Judges for the latter State form a larger proportion than do five or six Judges for Victoria. If we are to have sufficient Judges to make the visits of the High Court to the various portions of the Commonwealth sufficiently frequent to 'suit litigants, I am afraid that five Judges will not be enough, assuming, as the At torney-General seems to assume, that all the business will flow to the High Court. If , on the other hand, there are not sufficient Judges to provide sufficiently frequent Circuit Courts, the business will not flow to the High Court. It seems to me that five is a betwixt and between number-no t sufficient for the one purpose, and too many for the other. I am influenced by the view I take of the Bill as a whole; and, although the second reading has been carried, we are still in a position to question the extent of the jurisdiction. Every additional piece of original jurisdiction is an additional excuse for increasing the expense, either with regard to the number of Judges or with regard to the frequency of the Circuit Courts, with, if I may be permitted to use a forbidden word, all their ""paraphernalia."" It is quite true, as the honourable and learned member .for Indi pointed out, that a very large number of the cases which occur are already within the original jurisdiction of the High Court under the Constitution. So far as one is able to judge, I should say that, at any rate, two-thirds of the cases up to the present-are within that original jurisdiction. cases have been dealt with by the States Courts, and I have not heard any excessive complaining about the decisions given. The point has been emphasized that a .State Court might decide one way, whilst another State Court decided another way.",69
556,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN,That has happened.,70
557,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN,"There have been differing decisions; but it is not original jurisdiction, but appellate jurisdiction which is required to cure that difficulty, always assuming that appeals will go to the High Court and not to the Privy Council. For myself I do not think that appeals will go to the High Court in preference to the Privy Council, but I am assuming they will, for the purpose of argument. If it be urged that, considering all the original diction already conferred on the High Court, it will not matter much if we do confer a little more, that must be on the assumption that courts of sufficient frequency and ciently widely distributed are to be provided in order to transact all the business instead of leaving it to the States Courts. The argument is that, with all this jurisdiction, more Judges are wanted. The proper question ought to be-What is the least number of Judges with which we can do ? There is no need to provide for frequent Circuit Courts to enable the jurisdiction to be exercised, so long as we have States Courts able to exercise it, and so long as the financial circumstances of the States are as at present. We should be exercising a wise discretion if we did not confer extra jurisdiction, not so much from the point of view of the expense, as from the point of view of the excuse for expense that would be offered. We have heard a great deal about the mandatory character of the section in the Constitution as to the establishment of the High Court; but there is nothing mandatory as to the . constitution of the Court. It seems to me thatevery option the Constitution gives, is being exercised in connection with this .Bill, except the option of dehiying until a convenient time the establishment of the High Court.",70
558,Mr OMALLEY,VICTORIAN," There is a saying to the effect that-""Fool s rush in where angels fear to tread."" It seems to me that the specially organized aud particular opponents of this Bill, who voted against its second reading, are determined to make the measure as inefficacious as possible. ' HonorThese able members from New South Wales would appear to know a tremendous lot about the working of such courts as that under discussion, but I venture to wager Â£ 5 0 that no man here has been in a Federal Court, or had a law suit there, except myself. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, described the American Supreme Court as poisoned by political influences before its construction. But we ought to remember that Lord Salisbury, the late Prime Minister of England, said that if there was one thing he envied America, it was her Supreme Court; and I heard Lord Rosebery, one of the ablest men today in England, express similar sentiments in Pittsburg years ago. Why should I or any other citizen of the Commonwealth jurisbe deprived of the right to commence an action in a Federal Court? Is it because my legal friends wish me to run up such a bill in a State Court that I shall not be suffi- able to give security on appeal to the High Court ? Why should litigants, say, on the West Coast of Tasmania, be deprived of the right to have their cases heard in the Federal Circuit Court in preference to the Supreme Court of that State ? In the case of Sarah Hill against Shan-on, heard in the Supreme Court, California, the plaintiff was successful in having herself declared the wife of the defendant, and on that decision would have participated in the division of over five millions of money. Mr Justice Field, of the United States Supreme Court, came to Sacramento and upset that decision. Did Mr Terry, the counsel for plaintiff; appeal to Washington ? No ; he at once surrendered on the ground that as the question had been decided by one of the United States Judges, it was not worthwhile appealing.",70
559,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIAN,Did that court consist of one Judge or three Judges ?,71
560,Mr OMALLEY,VICTORIAN,"The court consisted of one Judge from Washington. Then honourable members may remember the case of the United States marshal who shot Terry, because the latter threatened to shoot the Judge. Legal members, with very few exceptions, know nothing about Federal judicial power. In the United States, in case of doubt, the Supreme Court always overrides the State Court. The whole must be greater than the part, and the State is only a part; but the great misfortune is that the majority of Victorian representatives still believe that Victoria runs the Commonwealth, and do not seem able to reason beyond the bounds of that State. In Western America we had land cases, horse-stealing eases, murder cases, and constitutional cases tried in these Circuit Courts, and I have never known a case which was presided over by a Judge from Washington appealed' against. My contention has been that Federal jurisdiction ought to be given to the States Supreme Courts, and that three Judges are all that is necessary for the High Court; but, if in the judgment of the Committee five High Court Judges are necessary, I am not going to stand in the way of their appointment. I u the United States, if a citizen of Arkansas has a law suit with a citizen of Texas, he takes it into the Federal Circuit Court. Why? Because he knows 'that when he gets a decision it will, be to the satisfaction of both parties. But some honourable members want the democrats of Australia to fight their cases through every State Court before bringing them to the High Court. Many a man, however, would be too poor to be able to put up the requisite security for an appeal to the High Court, although he could get an attorney to appear for him if he could go to the Court direct, and it would be a denial of a fundamental right of democracy to prevent him from doing so. Surely, every one of the J udges whom the Ministry appoint will have the confidence of the people? The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, spoke of men being biased, but. do honourable members remember the Dred Scott case in America 1 At that time the people of the States were almost in arms, and there was immense excitement. Charles Sumner, Wendall Phillips, and others declared in the grand old Fanuel Hall in Boston, where hang the pictures of Washington, Hancock, and Otis, that they would never surrender a fugitive slave, but Chief Justice Taney, of, the Supreme Court, decided that they must send the niggers bock from Massachusetts. Was that an instance of yielding to popular clamour? And the same firmness has been shown in many other instances. Such a case occurred only the other day. The Goulds, the Rockfellers, the Vanderbilts, and the Pierpont Morgans-peopl e who could buy up Australia, and yet have enough afterwards to be rich-forme d a syndicate called the Northern Securities Company, but when the legality of such a trust was questioned before Judge Thayer, he upset the whole business, though the States Courts were afraid to tackle the case. All the newspapers in the States, with the exception of Randolph Hearst's, are in their hands, yet this Judge gave a decision in a case involving billions against the monopolists and in favour of the people. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa is trying to upset an institution which will be the climax of the Federation. We must have the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judiciary to complete the Commonwealth power. The present Chief Justice Fuller gave up a practice of Â£30,000 to accept his present position at Â£2,100. All the Judges of the United States Courts are men who were successful practitioners for at least 25 years. Perhaps some of our friends here think that they are men who could be bought for a Â£5-note. There is the feeling in some countries that if you are an American you can be bought. Only the other day a big business man told me that President Roosevelt could be bought for a few thousand pounds, and yet I suppose the President could buy and sell any five men in Victoria, and have money enough left to throw at the birds. I hope that honourable members will awake from their parochialism and their narrow provincialism, and stand up for a High Court Which will be a credit to the whole Commonwealth. Progress reported. ADJOURNMEN T. ESTIMATES : SUPPLY or NEWSPAPERS. Motion (by Mr DEAKIX ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",71
561,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN," I , wish to know from the Attorney-General when we are likely to have the Estimates. is now the 16th day of the month of the financial year, and it is highly desirable that they should be laid before us as soon as possible. If we continue to drift as we have been doing we shall lose all control of the expenditure. In England, and at one time it was so in nearly all the States, the Estimates for the forthcoming year are always laid on the table at the beginning of the year. I do not ask for a detailed account of the revenue and receipts during' this year, but the latest figures on that subject, so far as they are obtainable, should also be - put before us. When we are asked to vote money after it has nearly all been expended, our supervision is practically worthless. Mr O'MAXL EY (Tasmania) -- I have to complain, Mr Speaker, that the Melbourne Herald is not placed in the labour members' room on the days upon which Parliament is not sitting. If it is considered necessary, the members of the labour party-will take up a collection in order to provide the funds necessary to insure the regular delivery of the newspaper in their room.",72
562,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN," In answer to the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, I may say that the Estimates have been in preparation for some little time, and will be ready shortly. As the honourable and learned member must be aware, it is not the custom to lay the Estimates upon the table until they can be accompanied by the returns of the expenditure for the financial year imme- . diately preceding. These returns, cannot be completed till after the end of the current month. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.40 p.m. It last",72
