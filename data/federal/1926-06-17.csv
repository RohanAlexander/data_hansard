2,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"In .another place, an honourable senator asked the following question:Could Parliament, in allotting powers to a court, stipulate that the hours of industry should not be more than 44 hours per week I The responsible Miniater repliedOf course it could. It would be a very foolish thing to do; but it could be done. This answer will be published, and - I therefore ask the Attorney-General whether it would he possible, under the Constitution Alteration Industry and Commerce Bill , for this Parliament to lay down hours and conditions, or must it leave such matters entirely to an authority?",14
3,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"U n d e r the proposed powers, it would not be possible for this Parliament to legislate for the hours to be worked in any industry. It would, however, be possible for the Parliament to l i m it the powers of a wages board, committee, court, or other authority to the prescription of hours within specified limits. That limitation would be merely a restriction of the power of the authority , and would not have effect in fixing the hours of industry.",15
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not quite f o l low the Attorney-General. What the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory) wanted to know was whether the powers conferred on this Parliament by the proposals contained in the Constitution Alteration Industry Commerce Bill include the power to limit the scope of the tion of a court, wages or other authority in. such a way as to in fact prescribe the number of. hours which the people of this country are to work. I think the Attorney-General's reply did not make the matter, quite clear.",15
5,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"The answer to the question in the for m submitted by the right honourable gentleman is "" No . "" Although this Parliament'would have no power to legislate as to wages or hours, it would be within its discretion to confer upon any authority set up by it such powers as to the determination of wages and hours as it thought proper. It would be possible for the Parliament to provide that no award, regulation, or determination of an authority should prescribe more than a certain number of hours, or less than a certain number. That would be within the power of the Parliament under the proposals' to be submitted to the people. Such legislation, however, would not of itself do anything more than confer power upon the authority subject to a limitation, which power that authority would exercise according to its discretion; Parliament could not itself f i x the hours of work in any industry. That would be a matter for the industrial authority to consider. ELECTORAL OFFICIALS . COMPENSATION FOB. EEFERENDOMS.",15

Debate resumed from 21st May (vide page 2238), on motion by Mr LATHAM That the bill be now read a second time.",16
15,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [2.44] - . t as . The bill provides for the amendment of the Arbitration Ac t in certain respects. It is proposed to appoint a court of three judges with life tenure, and to provide pensions, for conciliation commitr b i - tees, and for the carrying on of the work of the present court after .the 26th June next, because the term of appointment of the deputy presidents expires on that date. Attorney-General (Mr Latham) urged that this was an urgent measure, and therefore did not include other necessary amendments of the Arbitration Act, which he preferred to leave in abeyance until next year. I regret that we are not dealing more extensively with the act, because for many years past, in its present form, it has heen most unsatisfactory to both employers and employees. The awards of the court and the appeals against them have led to confusion and considerable litigation, so far as the trade unions are concerned. Some persons areopposed to arbitration altogether, claiming that, in view of our experience of it, the system should be entirely discontinued. I wish to say at once that I differ from that view. I believe that arbitration has served a good purpose, having done much to prevent industrial upheaval in this country. Somepersons think that a system of arbitration is inefficient if it fails to prevent industrial disputes. That is 'a wrong impression altogether. Nothing will prevent disputes from arising from time to time. We cannot prevent that any more than we can prevent breaches of the criminal, civil, and equity laws. We shall never prevent industrial disputes.",16
16,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,O r litigation between parties.,17
17,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so. was never contended by the advocates of 'arbitration that it would effectively prevent industrial disputes; all that was claimed for it was the minimizing of them. If - we analyze the position since the arbitration system wasintroduced, we shall find that it has prevented many disputes from arising in Australia. I was pleased to hear both the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) say that there are fewer industrial troubles in Australia than elsewhere.",17
18,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Thei r statements were a little belated.,17
19,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"They were true, notwithstanding. There is less time lost through disputes in Australia than in other countries. We are in this happy position because of the existence of arbitration courts and wages boards to deal with the disputes that arise from time to time. The first proposal in the bill is the appointment of judges with life tenure. Personally, The I do not like that, because, from my experience of industrial matters, I know that we cannot always obtain the services of men able to deal suitably with industrial problems. We may appoint men, who, although good lawyers and adept in conducting cases in the courts, may otherwise be unsuitable. The proceedings in cases under the Arbitration Act is based, not on that of ordinary courts of law, but on equity and good conscience, and therefore we must have judges who are suited to the special work required of them.",17
20,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,Me n who are conciliators.,17
21,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes , men who are. suited to the position.",17
22,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Does the honourable member think the appointments should be filled by lawyers?,17
23,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The bill provides for that. The appointments are to be for life, and there is no way to remove a judge of the court except, in case of misconduct, by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Such a thing is not likely to happen in regard to a member of the judiciary i u Australia. The judges should be, and are, men of high standing, and can be trusted; but a man may be temperamentally unsuitable for arbitration work, and if he cannot be It removed from the industrial bench his presence there may in the long run cause a good deal of friction. Employers or employees, though in favour of arbitration, may be reluctant to go to the court if it is presided over - by judges whose judicial, conduct is unsatisfactory. The Attorney-General has urged, however, that, because of a recent decision of the High Court, it is necessary to give the arbitration judges life tenure in order that they may be invested with judicial authority. In emphasizing that reason he is supported by trade union leaders. One cause of dissatisfaction with the court is that it cannot punish breaches of awards, or give interpretations of its awards; such matters must be referred to other courts. If this amendment, to give the arbitration judges life tenure is agreed to, the necessity for carrying appeals to the High Court will be obviated. That is. the one thing that commends the proposal to me. At the present time the unions spend thousands of pounds on appeals to the High Court, and they naturally desire their finances to he relieved of that strain. Instead of being able to take an award back to the original judge, who has heard a great volume of evidence concerning the industry, and knows what was in his mind when he made the award, the parties must go to the higher court and brief legal talent at considerable expense in order to get an interpretation of it . For that reason the trade union leaders am>reciate the necessity for this amendment. Although the appointment of arbitration judges for life is distasteful to me, those men who represent the unions before the court, and know all the defects of the sent system, are agreed that life tenure of the judges, although not otherwise desirable, is necessary in the interest of the unions. They have accordingly recommended that this bill be accepted. The recent interstate conference in Melbourne of representatives of the Trades and Labour Councils also decided that the bill should be supported on the ground that it would vest the Arbitration Court .with complete jurisdiction, and obviate the necessity for appeals to the High Court. Whilst that is the attitude of two representative bodies, some other men in the Labour movement condemn the proposal. Men occupying high positions in ""the various States are making the mistake of confusing this bill"" with the referendum proposals, and are telling the workers that the suggested amendments of the Constitution are for the purpose of referring the 44 hours' week to the Hieh Court. I wish to make it perfectly clear-and I hope that attention will be paid to my remarks-that the standard week is quite distinct from the referendum proposals. The Arbitration Court, presided over by judges appointed for life, will be in operation before the referendum proposals are voted upon by the people.",17
24,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",18
25,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"And that. court can proceed immediately to fix a standard working week. The New South Wales Parliament recently passed a law making the standard week 44 hours; but the awards of the Federal Court provide for a week of 48 hours, and as a State law cannot override a Commonwealth law, all Federal awards operating in New South Wales that provide for the 48 hours' week must be observed. This conflict of State and Commonwealth authority led to considerable trouble; but, after a stoppage of work in certain industries for some weeks, a temporary settlement was arrived at on the basis of alternate weeks of 44 hours and 48 hours respectively. The question of a standard working week is still unsettled, and that is another reason why this Court, vested with complete jurisdiction, should be constituted and in operation as soon as possible, so that the dispute may be dealt with, and unionists in New .South Wales may know what is expected of them. It is true that if the additional constitupre- tional powers which are being sought for this Federal Parliament by a referendum of the people are granted, a decision of the Commonwealth Court may become a comimon rule; but, regardless of the referendum proposals, it is essential, that something, be done to define the position of the trade unionists. If the unions were to withdraw from the Arbitration Court, there would be nothing to prevent the employers from forcing them into the court. I desire to stress that point. If industrialists have an idea that they will escape from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, either by the expiration of current awards or by refusal to register, they make a serious mistake. In the past, the unions almost exclusively have taken the initiative of registering under the Arbitration Act and taking plaints to the court; but, if the unions attempt to stand aloof, the employers can take the initiative; they can register at any time and cite the industrial unions of any State to appear before the Court, and any decision of the Court must prevail over any State law or decision of a State tribunal. There is no escape from that, and it is desirable that a very general misunderstanding of the question should be removed.",18
26,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,An award does not expire; it continues to operate until the court cancels it.,18
27,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so; and it - is a very important point. I . have made this statement i u order to explain to those who wish to know the true position that this bill is in no way connected with the referendum proposals. Whilst I have a personal objection to men being appointed to the Arbitration Court for life. I must give weight to the opinions of union leaders, who come in . contact with the court almost daily, and who declare that it should have appellate jurisdiction. There are men who say that we must do something because of the decision of the High Court that only judges with a life tenure can exercise judicial authority, and because of the difficulties that have arisen from the conflict between State and Federal laws.",18
28,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,"The decision of. the High Court will stand, irrespective of (the decision of the electors at the referendum.",19
29,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The fact that there is no escape from that decision needs to be impressed on the public mind. Statements appear in the press attacking individuals because they favour the establishment of a court presided over by judges with a life tenure- a proposal which is erroneously believed to be part - of the referendum. Even if the referendum proposals are not accepted by the people, this legislation will persist. This bill provides for the appointment by the Commonwealth of judges at a salary of £3,000 per annum for the chief judge, and £2,500 per annum, which is £500 less than the salary of a High Court judge, for each of the other judges. We shall be able tb discuss that matter when dealing with the Judiciary Bill, but I wish to mention now that I am opposed to the payment of pensions to judges. I recognize that we must have the best judges procurable, and must pay them a high salary: but unless they make provision for it through a superannuation fund, or by other means, they are not entitled to a pension. The question of pensions for judges was decided in this Parliament at the time of the first appointment of the judiciary. was not made a party question, and the proposal to pay pensions was defeated, by 29 votes to 20. Included among those who voted against the payment of pensions were two of the present judges. This bill also provides for the appointment of commissioners to conciliate in disputes. That is a wise provision. Such commissioners are required, not only for settling disputes after they have arisen, but also for preventing them. Generally, the disputes that cause strikes and lockouts are .brewing for several weeks before work ceases, and it is very difficult to settle them when that stage has been reached. Prevention is much better than cure. Stoppages of work inflict great hardship on the community, and after a stoppage has occurred the men often accept what they could have obtained Avithout it if there had been a conciliatory.authority with power to intervene. Something like that has happened in the coal industry. Commissioners of the kind provided for would be able to confer with both parties to a dispute before a stoppage of work occurred, and by conciliation would have every prospect of preventing serious trouble. When it is no one's business to intervene, and the parties are left to settle their own differences, small grievances are magnified, and the dispute grows to unmanageable proportions. The intervention of a commissioner, and the exercise of a little common sense in the early stages of a dispute, would generally be sufficient to prevent serious trouble.",19
30,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Is not that the practice of the coal tribunal? ^ Mr Charlton - That tribunal has done good work, and there has not been a strike by the miners since it was created. The dispute that has just been settled relates to the engine-drivers in the coal industry; it had nothing to do with the miners. The engine-drivers have agreed to submit their case to the tribunal, thus proving its efficacy again. The tribunal has the right to call the parties together, and it did so in this dispute. This provision is absolutely necessary if wes aim at preventing serious consequences from industrial disputes. I believe that if a conciliatory commission hadtaken action at an early stage of the It recent dispute in the coal industry, no cessation of work would have occurred. I am not saying, and have never said, anything about the merits of that dispute. I am not satisfied with the provision that gives power to the Attorney-General to intervene in any industrial dispute before the court. I admit that, in making a general rule, care should be taken not to exclude any of ' those affected by it ; but I am not satisfied that the clause will not permit the Attorney General to intervene at any time. When he was speaking on the motion for the second reading, I interjectedDoes it not give to any person in the community who feels he is interested the right to go"" to the court? The honourable the Attorney-General repliedI t does not do that. The words of the clause disclose the meaning quite clearly When the Attorney-General has given the scribed notice in writing to the court, court inserts an advertisement in the Government Gazette, and "" upon publication of notice in the Gazette any person or organizahighly tion or association of employers or employees may apply to the court."" There is probably justification for this provision if application has to be made an organization of employers or employees whose members feel that they would be tunate. affected by the decision of the court; but the clause bears another interpretation,, for it readsThe Attorney-General on behalf of the Commonwealth may, by giving to the Registrar notice in writing of his intention so to intervene in the public interest in any proceedpart heard. ing before the court in which the question standard hours of work in any industry or of the basic wage is in dispute. That seems to give the Attorney-General the right to intervene irrespective of whether any one makes an application for him to do so or not.",19
31,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,"What is the of "" intervene "" 1",20
32,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It can only mean "" intervene in the interests of the Goattempted vernment."" The Attorney-General's reply to me indicated that he does not intend to do that, and that it is not intended give that power to any Minister. The Attorney-General may mean that, but the clause gives him wider power. That mat-' ter will have to be further considered the committee stage. One of the chief objects of this bill is to allow a general rule to be made in Commonwealth awards. Many people, in the community believe that the enforcement of a common rule in the matter of hours of work would prebill clude the fixing of a less number of hours proposed referendums. for special work, such as that connected with sewers, which is unhealthy; but I am of the opinion that it would he quite competent for that to be done.",20
33,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,That is quite correct.,20
34,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It should unat doubtedly be stressed that, although this court could fix the maximum hours, special tribunal could fix less, for industries.",20
35,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Is that the Government's interpretation of the clause?,20
36,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I would rather not answer that question with a simple "" yes "" or ""no."" I shall deal with it when I reply. A short answer might be misleading ",20
37,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I shall be quite presatisfied if the Attorney-General deals the with it fully later, for I do not want to the put him in an unfair position. It is necessary .for us to make provision for the 'cases now before the court to be "" .concluded; and, unless the bill is passed by both Houses before the 30th June, the by present deputy presidents will he obliged to retire. That would be most unforOne of our greatest troubles in regard to arbitration has .been the congestion of business in the court. I am given to understand that, a even now, 105 cases are listed for do, hearing, in addition to those that stand One of the latter is the of important Railway workers' case that Sir John Quick has been dealing with for some time. It would be disastrous if the hearing of that case were not completed, for that would cause intense dissatisfaction among the railway workers, who have meaning been waiting for a long time for the settlement of their claim. I have dealt with these clauses seriatim, and have not. to make a speech on the general question of arbitration, for I realise that it is desirable for us to pass the bill as to soon as possible. Some if its proposals are objectionable to me; but, as the representatives of the federated trade unions and the Trades Hall Councils of at Australia, at a conference held in Melbourne, have approved of it, I shall vote for its second reading, though I reserve to my party and myself the right to move amendments at the committee stage. I have tried to make it quite clear that the has nothing whatever to do with the Whether the questions to be submitted to the people are approved or negatived, this bill, if passed, will remain on our statute-book, so those issues should not be clouded by it. I trust that an effort will be made an early date to effect some other neccisary improvements to the Conciliaa tion and Arbitration Act; but we can special deal with that at the proper time.",20
38,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"Gwydir) [3.18] - I wish to offer a few observations on this bill from the point of view of the primary producer. We who represent country interests have always supported legislation of this character, for we believe that it tends to minimize dissension, strikes, and dislocations of trade generally. I have listened with the utmost interest to - the .debates in this House during the last few weeks; but I have heard very little aboiit the affairs of the primary producers. Our main consideration has„ been the industrialists and employers in secondary industries; but Arbitration Court awards fall very heavily upon those who are engaged in primary production - in .this great Commonwealth, for they are the' only, section of the community which cannot pass on extra costs. I do not desire to labour that point, but it is most serious, - as I'propose to show. The cost of production is invariably increased by awards of the court, for nearly every determination given provides for higher wages and improved conditions. Although I admit that this does not directly concern the primary producers-for , with exception of those engaged in the shearing industry, they are not obliged to pay - the higher rates to their particular employees-ye t it has a very great, though indirect, effect upon production costs in primary industries. These matters are always taken into account in connection with secondary industries. . The Tariff Board ensures .that the manufacturer is shedtefled from, unfair .outside competition, and the Arbitration Courts sees-and we hope it always willthat the worker receives, a living wage. The. effect upon primary production, is never considered. I do not object., to either the Tariff Board or the Arbitration Court, but I wish to emphasize that the position into which we 'are getting as' a result of these continual increases in wages and tariff imposts is becoming intolerable - The man who is engaged in primary production has to accept world's parity for his, products, and the existing system is undoubtedly having a bad effect upon the rural industries. Only recently the Arbitration Court, sitting in Perth, saddled the sheep industry with an additional £100,000 on account of shearing expenses. I do not quibble with that decision, but if it had .happened to any other business ' a considerable outcry would have been raised. It will operate very harshly on the man who is engaged in sheep raising in a small way.",21
39,Mr COOK,Unknown,He cannot unload the extra cost.,21
40,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,He cannot pass it on.,21
41,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That is rather an immoral claim. It does not follow that he is entitled to pass it on..,21
42,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"If he did he would merely be following the example that has been set by the secondary industries, which do not fail to pass on every increase. Country dwellers do not contend that the working man is not entitled to - receive an increase to counterbalance any extra cost of living, but they do want to know what consideration is to be given to the primary producer. If he is making such immoral profits that he can bear the extra costs which are continually imposed upon himnothing can be said, but the statistics which are available prove that primary industry is not such a profitable undertaking.",21
43,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The remarkable thing the is that that increase in wages was madeafter wool had fallen from £33 to £17 a bale.,21
44,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"That is so. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) said the other night that when the dried fruits industry was absolutely ""down and.out,"" and the Government was greatly concerned as to what actionshould be taken to put it on its feet, theArbitration Court made an award which increased the wages of the men who were employed in that industry. The workers are entitled to an increase when the cost of living rises, but is it not absurd that at a time when an industry is languishing the employees in. that industry should have their wages increased ?

The conclusion cannot be escaped that land is going out of occupation.",21
45,Mr FORDE,Unknown,That would not be good sheep land.,22
46,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"I do not think it can be, because men. hang on to decent land as long as they can. But instead of settlement advancing it is going back, and one of the principal reasons is that on account of the high cost of production it is not worthwhile to try to do anything with inferior land.",22
47,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"When pastoral leases revert to the Crown - in Queensland and are subdivided for closer settlement, there are as many as 1,400 applicants for some blocks.",22
48,Mr BODGEBS,Unknown,Those prizes.,22
49,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The successful applicant must reside upon the land for five years, or .it is forfeited.",22
50,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"I admit that there is a tremendous land hunger in Australia ; but, at the same time, the figures which I have quoted prove that large areas are reverting to the Crown. Queensland is a striking example-it has gone back to the extent of '20,000,000 acres in the period covered by the figures. I honestly believe that the system of leasehold tenure in that State is the cause.",22
51,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Would it not the fact that the beef industry is not now in as good a position as it was formerly ?,22
52,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"That applies, to a certain extent. My recent visit to Queensland convinced me that one of the principal causes is the system of leasehold tenure. I listened with interest the other night to honourable members discussing that system in connection with the lands of the Northern Territory. The following paragraph, which appeared in yesterday's Melbourne Herald, is significant':ECONOMIC LAWS. NA Brisbane, Wednesday - An interesting contribution to the subject of economic laws was .made last night by the former Minister of Lands of the Queensland Labour Government (Mr H. F. Hardacre), who is now a member - of the Land Court Bench. - Mr Hardacre said if they raised wages they destroyed industry and created unemployment. He had found that two-thirds of the cattle holdings in North Queensland would soon have to go out of business, and probably the country would have to be abandoned 'because of continual increase in the cost of production and low prices that had made it unprofitable to carry on. Mr Hardacre correctly appraised the position. The high cost of production is causing many people to ask themselves whether it is worthwhile to put their money into land when a manufacturing industry in the city, or even bricks and mortar, would give them a better return without the risks that attend primary production. Whether land is held under leasehold or freehold makes a very big difference. When a man takes up land, he desires that it should be his own.",22
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY, The honourable member will not be in order in comparing the leasehold and freehold systems under this bill .,22
54,Mr ABBOTT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I shall not labour that point. Honourable members know that if a man owns his house he will i m prove it , and if he rents i the will not. That applies also to the occupation of land. In Queensland, I saw land upon which I worked 20 years ago reverting to its original state because it did not pay to keep it in order. That means the deterioration of an asset of the country. In connection with the effect of high cost of production on land settlement, I have a few more figures showing be due to the number of land-holders in Australia, which I think are interesting. For the years specified the number of landholders in the various States was: LANDHOLDERS. State. Year. Number. New South Wales 191516 93,983 1921-22 72,059 Victoria 1912 66,811 1919 72,679 1916-17 23,412 South Australia 1921-22 23,840 1919-20 15,028 Western Australia 1923-24 17.847 191718 13,847 INDUSTRY. Tasmania . . 1921-22 14,230 Australia 1915-16 213,081 1921-22 200,655 Figures are not available for Queensland, but I do not think that the Queensland figures would improve the position.",22
55,Mr A GREEN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,The big fellows have gobbled up the little fellows' estates.,23
56,Mr ABBOTT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I thought there might be something in that, and therefore looked into the matter. I fouud that in nearly every State the men holding from 500 to 1,000 acres about held their own. I confess that I can find no satisfactory explanation for these appalling figures, which are taken from the official Year Book. There are no figures published which go to prove what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) has suggested. There must be some reason why the number of people going on to the land is less than the number leaving it. It seems to me that the high cost of production consequent upon awards given by the courts of this country affecting primary industry, is one of the main reasons for the reduction in the number of land-holders. It is absurd to talk of immigration when our own people, who are the best we could possibly have on the land, are leaving it. ""What are we to do with the migrants who are being brought into the country when the figures show that our own people are leaving the land? We need to discover some means of increasing the number of our own people on the land before we talk of settling people coming here from other countries who will not make nearly as good settlers. I think that the awards of the Arbitration Court, which are made without regard for the conditions of the primary industries, have a good deal to do with the matter. I have a few words to say about the wool industry, in which I am interested in a small way. I do not see how it is to continue to carry the baby for the Commonwealth, as it has been doing for the last few years. I have here some figures showing the number of sheep-owners in the Commonwealth. They were used in an address given by Sir John Higgins at a conference held in Melbourne on the 12th June, 1925, and were taken by him from the Commonwealth Year-Booh. They show that there are 80,000,000 sheep in the Commonwealth, and they may be roughly divided in this way:96 per cent, are in flocks of 5,000 and less, and only 3 per cent, are in flocks of over 5,000. I admit that 3 per cent, of the owners own nearly^ one-half of the total number of sheep in the Commonwealth; yet half the sheep in the Commonwealth are owned by small men. I should say that a man with 5,000 sheep is clearing, roughly, about £1,500 a year at the present price of wool. Honourable members may say that that is a good return, but to secure that return the sheepowner has, in iny opinion, had to invest something like £20,000 - Good country that will carry a sheep to the acre year in and year out is worth about £3 per acre.",23
57,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,How much? It is worth £10 per acre in Victoria.,23
58,Mr ABBOTT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I am speaking of New South Wales, and trying to be as conservative as I can in my calculations. For an investment of £20,000, the man owning 5,000 sheep secures an annual return of £1,500. If he put his capital into Government loans at 6 per cent., - he would get an annual return of £1,200 without any effort, and if he put the same amount into city property, he would probably get a return of 10 per cent. I think it would be very risky for a man to put £20,000 into a pastoral property today because of the continual rise in wages and in the cost of living. Honourable members should bear in mind that the pastoral industry carries a tremendous risk which does' not apply to any other industry. It carries the risk of being suddenly and absolutley wiped out at any time. I have experienced its risks, though not to the degree that some people have done. A pastoralistmay get an apparently prosperous year, and next year he may be entirely ruined because of a change in the season. I should like to put before honourable members three instances showing the conditions under which people who are not taken into account in the fixing of awards are called upon to struggle. I propose to quote from a letter from a friend of mine who is a rural inspector of the New South Wales Government Savings Bank. I frankly admit that he sent me the letter to see if ' something might not be done in the three cases to which he refers in it.",23
59,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I understood the honourable member to say that the wool-grower is suffering from awards of the court, but has he not the right to put his case before the court?",23
60,Mr ABBOTT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The court takes into consideration that an industry is worth so much. It returns a certain number of million pounds a year, and the court bases .its award on the cost of livin g to, the worker, and does not inquire as to the profits or losses of the individual wool-grower. Whilst I admit that some men make large fortunes out of wool, I stress the fact that a great many men engaged in the wool industry are not making anything like the incomes from it that some honourable members think they are.. The first case referred to in the letter I have received is as follows:A man came to me one night in the country - a n old man-li e had driven 60 miles across wet, black-soil plains. He unfolded a story of his struggles; drought and floods had wiped him out. His son, .acity barber, had lent him some money to buy food, which had enabled him to remain on his property. His other son, while droving, was bitten by a snake: and', being many miles from a doctor, 'had no alternative but to chew the affected part out, which lie proceeded to do. The old chap still struggles on. The next case referred to is stated in these terms- I spent a iidgJit with a man near Rowena. It was shearing time. His two sons were shearing, a daughter was doing the machine exiperting, the mother was picking up and wool rolling, a daughter .was mustering, and another girl was doing the housework. A self-contained unit! By doing this they were enabled to make ends meet. It was just after a drought, during which time the parents (mum and dad) had brought the cattle to the coast, and the boys and girls had taken sheep to Queensland. Some young girls remained at home to care 'for; ^the property. You can imagine what privation and anxiety all this meant, particularly for the old people. There is no consideration of the wages, if any, being paid to the sons and daughters of this man, or of the charges that his industry oan bear, and what he can afford to pay. Such questions are not taken into consideration by the courts. The last case referred to is as follows: .At Narroiniiie, a young returned soldier returned' in 1019 in time to put his crop in. It failed. The next year, being a good fanner, he had a bumper crop. A bush fire swept through and burned hundreds of bags of wheat already stacked, 200 tons 'of hay, and all his fences. His dwelling was just saved. This meant going into debt to replace the fences and to carry on. The next year was almost a failure; the following year was a total failure, despite the fact that every acre was sown on fallowed land .which had obtained three prizes in the fallowed land competition. The cause was unprecedented dry weather. Everything that could be done had' been done to ensure a crop, but the return was nil. He is still struggling, and hopes to pull through some day. There is no inquiry as to what this man's cost of livin g is, and what wages he can pay. If we do not realise the actual conditions of the primary industries, we shall pull the whole fabric of Australia down upon our heads. ' I do not wish to: be regarded as an alarmist, but it seems to me that the returns and figures show that the position is becoming very serious.",24
61,Mr FORDE,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Thos e engaged in some primary industries not affected by A r b i tration Oourt awards are worse off than some of the sheep-men-the dairy men, for instance.",24
62,Mr ABBOTT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"That does not affect my contention that the primary industries of Australia are. not floimshing. We must realise that the tariff and the arbitration courts are intended to assist the secondary industries. As a primary producer, I should be glad if everything I took from the land were consumed in Australia. If the secondary industries are so increased that they will make use of everything grown by the primar y producers, it will be avery, fine thing, but having looked into the figures, the position at present does not seem to me to be very hopeful. Our exportation for 1913 ' of primary products, including minerals, was worth £72,833,454; and of secondary products, £2,304,693. In 192223, our exports from primary industries amounted to £110,636,535. The increase, no doubt, was due largely to the increased prices for wool and wheat, which have prevailed since the war, but, in 1922-23, the exports of the secondary industries amounted to only £4,114,774. In 1923-24, the last year for which figures are available, the exports of primary industries amounted to £111,898,488, whilst the exports of secondary industries were only £4,264,057. Until we are able to export more secondary products, there will not be much chance of progress in Australia. - If the primary producers leave the land, and production ceases, what shall we live on ? We cannot live long on our own fat. I have - tried to find a solution of this difficulty, but, I confess, it is beyond my power to find one of any practical value. The only suggestion that I can make is ridiculous. It is to assist primary industries as we are assisting secondary industries, and the men ployed in them, by appointing a parity board which will decide, for example, that the high cost of wages and living has increased prices by l d . a lb. for wool, and 6d. a bushel for wheat, this in - ing crease to be made up to primary producers by the Government minutes before. of the country. The community today making such a contribution to the workers and to the manufacturers, and, as a result, primary production is on down grade. Unless we have production, and decreased cost facturing secondary products, Australia will not long be prosperous. living in a fool's paradise. If primary production fails, the whole foundation upon which the prosperity of Australia rests will collapse.",24
63,Mr SCTJLLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Y a r r a ) [3.47] - The debate on this bill has certainly been interesting, but a good deal of it has been irrelevant. I compliment the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Abbott) on making an interesting address to the House. He has contributed information of value, and because of that I take no exception to his speech, although it was somewhat wide of the bill. bill, asi the Attorney-General said, is really a temporary measure to fill the in terregnum between the expiration of term of appointment of the deputy pretorian sidents of the court, and the general amendment of the Arbitration Act, when the Attorney-General has obtained, as hopes, enlarged constitutional powers. Of course, if those powers are not granted, Parliament will still need review generally the Arbitration Act an early date. W it h the intentions the Government I find myself generally in approval. Some honourable members have spoken of the failure of the A r b tration Court, believing that it should be scrapped, and that we should dispense with the whole system of arbitration. plication of science to industry. That opinion has been expressed by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook). I gather from the honourable member for Gwydir that his sympathies tend i a the same direction. He reviewed the condition of the prifrigerators mary industries. Exactly what he in tended to prove, I am not too sure; plus but I should say that his speech was intended to prove thab the Arbitration emCourt has produced all the woes of the man ou the land. That cannot be borne out by facts. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) made a pertinent interjection respecting the dairyindustry, and the same idea the had crossed my mind a few Probably there is, is no primary industry today in Australia that is in a worse condition than the dairying industry, and, strange to say the for that industry, there is no award of greater the Arbitration Court, or of wages of manuboards, so far as I know.",25
64,Mr ABBOTT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,The arbitration awards We are have certainly affected the cost of living.,25

If that is their contention, then I ask them to carry their minds back to the time when there was no intervention by wages boards or arbitrations courts in the industries of this country, and to consider the condition of the men who were then on the land. Were they as well off as they are today? The Mr Rodgers - Yes .",25
66,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,I say no.,25
67,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Does the honourable the member remember the period in Vichistory when the dairying in -' dustry alone saved the State?,25
68,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Yes ; and I can tell he the honourable member the secret of its success at that time. I lived in the country, and worked under the conditions to then obtaining, and I know what Austraat lia owed to the dairying industry when it of was flourishing. I can remember when the suppliers of butter were working under wretched conditions, and unable to i - send their surplus out of the country. One of the first things that made the dairying industry possible was the apThe scientist made it possible to send surplus . butter overseas, and to manufacture butter all the year round. There was the discovery of the creamery, and the invention of machinery for butter-making. The method of keeping butter in reon board ship and in store - houses made possible the export of sursupplies. But prosperity came with the breaking up of the large estates, and the better utilization of land. the industry developed and prospered, two things operated side by side-one , the non-regulation of the wage's and the building up of probably the worse in dustrial conditions in Autralia.; and the other, the soaring of land values to the very skies. What the dairying industry is suffering from , particularly in Victoria, is the high rents that the dairymen have to pay, and the high prices of land. Twenty years ago land was subdivided around Terang, Camperdown Warrnambool, including Black's estate at Noorat, and Manifold's land in the Camperdown district, which, although beautif u l land, was sheep-sick, and would not carry three-quarters of a sheep to the acre. It was returning from. 5s. to 6s. an acre. That land was leased at 15s. an acres on long terms. The dairyman who leased it made fortunes until the leases expired. They then had to pay from £3 10s. to £3 15s. an acre for the same land. Over-capitalization is what the dairying industry is suffering from today.",25
69,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Most of the dairymen there have their own freehold.,26
70,Mr SCTJLLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Most of the men holding freehold there today did not get in on. the ground floor. They bought at high prices, and the interest they are paying is just as great, or greater, than the rent that they previously paid.",26
71,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Does the honourable member remember the Manifold subdivision ?,26
72,Mr SCTJLLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,I do.,26
73,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Was not that land sold to the dairymen on generous terms?,26
74,Mr SCTJLLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"No . I have come into personal contact with a number of the men who bought land at the Manifol d subdivision, and I know that the terms of the sale were not generous. High prices were paid for the land, and the dairymen will be working during this and 'the next generation to pay for their holdings. In the early subdivision, some of Manifold's land was leased at 15s. an acre; but it must be borne in mind that previously that same land was returning only from 5s. to 6s. tun acre. When the leases expired the terms were not so generous. Some of the tenants, before the leases expired, parted with them, because they were given to understand that the leases were to be As forfeited,' because of the application of the land tax, which was certainly an absurd position. When they afterwards bought the freehold of the land, they found that the interest they had to pay on the purchase price was greater than what they had previously paid in rent.",26
75,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,The honourable member should try to buy out some of those men.,26
76,Mr SCTJLLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Does the honourable member wish to suggest that the dairymen are well off, and that the story that and we have heard of the ruinous position of the industry is wrong ? I do not want to be drawn into a discussion on secondary and primary industries. We are now dealing with the arbitration system. I wish, however, to dispute the statement that the Arbitration Act is responsible for the woes of the primary producers: Some of their sufferings are real, and this Parliament has never turned a deaf ear to genuine requests for assistance. I agree absolutely with the honourable member for Gwydir respecting the importance of building up our primary industries, but I suggest that that will not be brought about by low wages and sweating conditions, or the non-regulation of conditions of employment. I suggest, therefore, that some of his illustrations were not too fortunate, especially his reference to the pastoral industry and the increased costs because of arbitration awards. He and the honourable member for Wannon stated that the wages in that industry were raised by an award of the Arbitration Court just at the time when the price of wool had slumped. That may be true, but do they suggest that the living wage should not have been considered or weighed by the court because the price of wool had fallen that year ? If arbitration awards were based on that principle, some men would receive £50 per week because of the colossal profits that are now being made in the industries in which they are employed. I suggest to honourable members who raise that argument that it must cut both ways. If the court based the genera] average wage on the general average profit of an industry, the workers in many industries would receive considerable increases in wages. I tell honourable members who are endear vouring to find faul t with the. A r b i tration Court because it increased the wages of workers in the pastoral industry in a year when the price of wool had fallen, that no other industry in Aussettled, tralia has done so well as the wool-growing lockouts. industry. I admit that the men engaged in the dairying industry, as settle them quicker. well as those in the fruit-growing in dustry, are barely making a living. But I dispute the statement that the wages they pay are responsible for their position. The honourable member f Gwydir said, "" It is all right to fix wages in the manufacturing industries, which have the advantage of a protective tariff, but it is not fair to fix wages in mary industries, which are unprotected."" Has this Parliament not protected the protheir ducers of dried fruits by increasing tariff, and does it not pay a bounty upon their exports? The Arbitratio n Act is not responsible for the primary producers' table. losses by fire and drought. However, we are not expected on this - occasion to bate the general question of whether arbitration courts are or are not desirthis able. Arbitration as a means of settling industrial disputes is the accepted policy of Australia, and I do not believe that any thinking people would urge a revera sion to the conditions that prevailed to the introduction of the arbitration principle.",26
77,Mr ABBOTT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,-Joc k Garden would.,27

Men who say that there should be no arbitration court or collecclava tive bargaining are to on both sides of fence. There are some such among ministerial supporters, but none are to be found on this side. We have pinned our faith to constitutional methods, but we for Gwydir. do not go to the extent of saying that a man can be denied the right to refuse work under conditions that he regards unjust, or that'industrial disputes can entirely prevented. So long as there buying and selling of human labour, long will men dispute about the price of it. Sometimes one side will be wrong, and sometimes the other side; occasionally perity. both will be wrong. We have never made the mistake of saying that the blame always on one side, but those who attack the workers seem to suggest that they must always be in the wrong.

99,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I admit that ; but that does not meet my point that the fundamental objection to appointing judges to the Arbitration Court for life can be removed by an amendment of the Constitution. However, ' the Government has not chosen to adopt that course, and we must either continue with a court devoid of judicial power to interpret or enforce its own awards, or we must appoint the judges for life. In the circumstances, we must swallow the pill of life tenure, because if the Arbitration Court is to function effectively it must have judicial power. This bill also provides a means by which a general decision can be arrived at in regard to the basic wage and the standard hours. As I read clause 6, a case affecting only one union and one body of employers may be before - the court, and if the proceedings involve the questions of standard hours and the basic wage in that industry, the Attorney-General may intervene, whereupon everybody who is interested in the deterA mination of those issues may be heard in the court. Every proceeding before the court, every application for an award, will have a bearing upon the That question of standard hours, whether the applicant is asking for more or less than the standard. I shall be interested to hear the Attorney-General explain how the general rule will be applied. For instance, there may be a dispute between the carpenters' unions and the employers. The union may ask for certain hours, and the employers may refuse to grant the request. The question of the standard hours would arise in that dispute, and if the Attorney-General intervened, all those interested-whic h means practically every union and every organization of employers-woul d have the right to he heard.",28

That, gations, however, is hardlv the point I wish to make now. If the representatives of other industries than those actually cerned in a dispute were represented the court, and the basic wage and standard rate of hours were fixed, the award of the court would apply only to the ticular industry concerned in the dispute. I shall be interested to hear how a general rule could be made in those circumstances. A general rule is not a common rule; and, as to that, there is some confusion in the public mind. . A general rule, I understand, is a rule that annlies to all industries represented at a hearing, but only to those employers or employees interested in the particular dispute. That, therefore, does not overcome the difficulty of the common rule, and I see no way of overcoming it under our present Constitution. I gathered from the second-reading speech of the honourable the Attorney-General that the clause relating to intervention by the Attorney General does not mean that the Attorney General, as representing the Eederal Government, may intervene and argue the merits of the question in dispute unless a Commonwealth Government department is concerned.

It would be easy to alter the clause so that any one who believed he was interested could apply to the court without the intervention of the Attorney-General, the decision could be left entirely not with the court. That might cause the court to be inuudated with applications to to be heard. Many people might feel that they were interested in a case, but they might not have the right to apply to be heard, because the Attorney-General had not intervened. I should like the opinion of the honourable the Attorney General as to the meaning of the following proposed new sub-section:judge shall, ias from time to time required Governor General, make such investiinquiries, and reports in relation to industrial matters or to any public matter or any power of the Commonwealth as the conGovernor-General specifies. in Docs the proposed new sub-section 18B (1), which relates to the power of the Attorney-General to intervene, limit that parpower to permitting parties to apply to be beard with, regard only to standard hours and the basic wage? I should like that to be made clear. There, is the f o l lowing provision in the proposed new sub-section:Upon publication of the notice in the Gazette any person, or organization or association of employers or employees may apply to the court for liberty to be heard and the court may, if it is of opinion that the applicant is interested in the determination of the question, permit the applicant to be heard and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. "" Publication of the notice in the Gazette ""-that is all that has to be done in connection with the basis upon which all future awards will be built, namely, standard hours and basic wage. If a notice in the Gazette is sumcient for that purpose, why not permit claimants before the court to cite respondents by publishing a notice in the Gazette? One union showed me a list of 5,000 names of respondents, each of whom had to be served with a copy of a log. The names of the respondents have to be printed, and the log posted to each of them, and that procedure has to be repeated when the summonses are issued. Some unions, when they file a claim, are involved in an expenditure of about £500 for printing and postage alone.",29
112,Mr LATHAM,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"If we are forced to proceed under our present powers, I shall tenure. be prepared to propose, as an alternative to the existing procedure, a procedure similar to that which the honourable member suggests, but only as native, because there is room for doubt as to whether it would be effective in law. All those difficulties w i the referendum proposals are agreed to. Mr Scullin"" - Then , of course, the common rule will operate, and it will be necessary to cite every employer in an industry. I am glad to have the assurance of the Attorney-General at this stage that the procedure may be improved later. I shall not examine the bill furthe at this stage, because it is only a short and temporary measure. I content myself by saying that every attempt to render arbitration easier and more successful will meet with the support of honourable members on this side. One of the objectional tions of unions to arbitration is that there are too many obstacles blocking the way to the court. The heavy expenditure entailed, the months, and sometimes years, of delay in deciding cases, the litigation that has to be engaged in , and rhe other obstructions placed in the way of arbitration by employers, have done more than anything else to discredit arbitration. If we believe in arbitration, we ought to sweep them all away, but I admit that we cannot do that under the existing Constitution. That is one of the reasons why it is necessary to enlarge the industrial powers of the Commonwealth.. I wish to add to what my leader has said, and to assist him in removing the misapprehension in the minds of the public that the appointment of arbitration judges for life, which is provided for in this bill, is part of the proposed amendments of the Constitution. The statement has frequently been made that the carrying of the referendum proposals will empower this Parliament to establish authorities to deal with iiidustrial matters, and that those authorities will remain u n t i l the Constitution is further amended.",30
113,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"As a matter of fact, it will have just the opposite effect.",30
114,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,That is so. What the amendment of the Constitution will do is to give this Parliament power to establish authorities.,30
115,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,And determine their,30
116,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Yes , and it will be able to alter or amend legislation of that character from time to time. What it can an altercreate, it can destroy.",30
117,Mr WATSON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,What will become .of this court in the event of the referendums l l be removed if being carried?,30
118,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I assume that the court will continue to function with in not creased powers j but it will be possible for us to set up such authorities as State wages boards and State arbitration courts, if they.are required, or commissions, or conciliation boards, if they are deemed desirable, to deal with questions affecting r industry. Parliament will have authority over not only wages and hours, but also in such matters as child endowment, workmen's compensation, and other kindred subjects of great importance to the people. Those who say that even if the constituamendments are approved, this Parliament will be able to do very littl e more thani t can do now, are not full y informed on the matter. Even today Parliament acts through an authority. At present Parliament can only deal with industrial disputes and the limitation of them : but under the amended powers that are being sought, it will be able to set up authorities or tribunals to deal with every phase of the industrial situation, and to make a common rule. I draw attention to the reply of the Attorney-General this afternoon to the question of the honourable member for Swan (Mt. Gregory), dealing with the important question of hours. It indicated that this Parliament would be able to pass a law authorizing a tribunal, not only to fix hours, but also to fix the maximum hours beyond which no one could go. I intend to support the bill, but propose, in committee, to try to effect certain amendments to it, with the object of improving it.",30
119,Mr MANNING,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Macquarie) [4,34] I shall support the bill as I realise that it will lead to an improvement in our existing arbitration practice. I should not have participated in the debate did I - not thiuk a few words should be said on one aspect of the matter. I have listened with interest to the discussion that has taken place during the last few days on the proposed constitutional amendments. The question has been raised by that, debate, both inside and outside of this House, whether industrial arbitration has been of any real value. As I believe one concrete example to be worth a dozen generalities, I propose to relate the history of arbitration in the pastoral industry, with which I am most acquainted. I feel sure it will prove beyond question that the system has been most advantageous. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) a few days ago pointed out what the workers of Australia had gained through strikes. But. .even though I am quite ready to admit that at times arbitration courts make awards which are not altogether satisfactory either to the employees or to the ployers, I am firmly of the opinion that, with all their imperfections, they have been more advantageous to both sides than strikes have ever been. The strike, as the honourable member for Adelaide pointed out, is an obsolete weapon which sliould be forgotten. The first pastoral award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court was made in 1907 by Mr Justice O'Connor. Previously, the general rate for shearing had been 20s. per 100 sheep, and for shed hands 22s. 6d. to 27s. 6d. per week with keep, according to the class of work done. These rates were increased by the award to 24s. per 100 for shearing, and to from 27s. 6d. to 30s. per week with keep for shed hands. The award operated until 1911, when a new award was made by Mr Justice Higgins, which did not alter the rate for shearing, but increased the rate for shed hands to 37s. 6d. per week with keep. In 1917, a.further award was made by Mr Justice Higgins which, in view of the great increase in cost of Jiving owing to war conditions, . increased the rates, with the consent of the graziers, to 30s. per 100 for shearing, and 60s. per week for shed hands. In 1917, award rates were fixed for the first time for general station hands. Those were as follow:-For adults, 48s. per week with keep, or 63s. per week without keep. His Honour compared the 48s. rate with the previously ruling rate of 20s. to 25s. per week with keep. It was subsequently determined by the court that the "" found "" rate was excessive, and it was reduced to 42s.j but in 1920 it was again increased to 4Ss. per week. The 1917 award was fixed for the period 28th June, 1917, to 31st December, 1920, and covered the States of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia; but during its currency the Australian Workers Union applied to the Queensland State court, and obtained increased rates and reduced working hours, thus deliberately taking advantage of two tribunals at the same timer It was ouite clear that; in the following year, 1920, trouble would occur in the southern States unless the Queensland rates and hours were conceded. As the cost of living had undoubtedly increased since the 1917 award was made, it was-agreed in voluntary conference that the rates of the' Queensland award should be wanted for the season; but without prejudice to future proceedem- ings in the Arbitration Court. The conference agreement rates were 40s.. per 100 for shearers, and 90s. per week for shed hands. These terms continued in force until His Honour Mr Justice Powers, in June, 1922, after hearing full evidence and argument, fixed the shearing rate at 35s. per 100, with 70s. per week for shed hands. The day that this award was issued, the officials of the Australian Workers Union instructed members of the union to refuse to engage, notwithstandino that they had undertaken, when the i conference agreement was made, to accept any reduction that might he subsequently considered by the court to be justified.",31
120,Mr LACEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Did not the judge admit that he made a mistake in that case?,32
121,Mr MANNING,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Yes ; and he rectified it immediately. I have given the corrected rates. The consequence of the action of the Australian Workers Union was-that a strike prevailed throughout the greater part of the 1922 shearing season, and the union and several of its officials were fined for taking part in it, and were ordered by the High Court to discontinue it. As the union found itself unable successfully to carry through the strike policy, it accepted the award at the beginning of 1923; and later in the season, applied to the court for a variation of it, based on the increased cost of living; and it was granted a shearing rate of 3Ss. per 100, with a rate of 75s. lOd. with keep for shed hands, and 52s. per week for station hands. Those rates were current until a few days ago, when a new award was made in Perth giving the slight increase of 2s. per 100 for shearers, and other slightly altered conditions. In the light of that history, can any one do other than admit that arbitration has been beneficial, not only to the workers, but also to the pastoralists? Some pastoralists think that they have been obliged to pay excessive rates. I have nothing to say either for or against that, for the rates were fixed by a judge after hearing f u ll evidence on the matter; but I think that even those who feel that way must admit that the industry is in a better position through having enjoyed many years of unbroken peace than it could possibly have been in had it been subject to a series of strikes, with the payment of slightly lower rates of wages. iinfortunate that officials of the Australian Workers Union, and the leaders of other unions, have at times incited unionists to disobey awards of the court. That has done more than anything else to bring our industrial arbitration system into disrepute. In 1923, the leaders of the Australian Workers Union practically forced many of the members of that union to go on strike. In the brutal vocabulary of the strike-monger, there is an epithet which is often used most unjustly; and, rather than risk its application to them, many unionists would participate in what they were convinced was an unreasonable strike. Actually, they are forced into striking. That is not simply my opinion. In the Australian Worker, of the 14th June, 1923, an address is reported, which Mr H . E. Boote, a prominent member of the Australian Workers Union, and a leader in the Australian Labour movement, delivered at the Australian Workers Union convention. The following is extracted from it:He congratulated the convention on their policy for 1923. At' the same time he realized it was not only a difficult, but a bitter, and therefore a courageous, tiling to do. In that connection a conviction had been growing up in his mind for a considerable time, and had .been .brought to a finality, with recent events. That was that they had to reviise their attitude towards the great masses of men and women who comprised the Labour movement. They had always spoken of the rank and file as if they were very militant, as if it was necessary to keep a leash upon them, that the officials of the organization were holding tliem back, and that, if they only gave tliem their heads, something would be doing. He had come to the conclusion, not hurriedly, perhaps regretfully, that they would have to revise that opinion. They were not as militant as they always supposed them to be, and the Australian worker, with all his magnificent qualities, was not an economic fighter. The leaders of thought in the movement would have to recognize the character of the material with which they dealt, and act accordingly. That was why he congratulated them on their 1923 policy. They saw it was no longer possible to put up a fight which would lead to victory, and, therefore, as bitter as it might be, they had admitted for the time being that they had been stopped, not because of iwhat anybody in authority had done, but because of what' the rank and file had failed to do. It was obvious, if their movement was to make progress in the future, tiheir militancy must be manifested on the political field. I am glad that the Government has inI t is troduced this bill, for it will make the position of the workers more secure. I trust that honourable members who advocate the referendum proposals on the public platform will point out that, until the Constitution is amended, we shall not be able to have any other than a stunted arbitration system. As the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has said, the proposed amendments to the industrial power of this Parliament, are necessary to enable a. common rule to be applied to industry, and that, in my opinion, is essential before we can have genuine and general satisfaction with the operations of the court.",32
122,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Lang) [4.44]. - Bot h the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) and the honourable member for Y a r ra (Mr Scullin) have stressed very strongly the need for recognizing that the provisions of this bill should not be considered in conjunction with the proposed amendments of the Constitution. This is an entirely separate and independent measure, and even if no move had been made to amend the Constitution, its introduction would still have been necessary. I am not to be found in the ranks of those who condemn the arbitration courts, and the work which they have done, and I dissociate myself entirely from the antagonistic views that bave beeu expressed by some honourable members on this side. Although the Commonwealth Court has been greatly hampered, and its methods havei n many respects been cumbersome, and although it has not fulfilled the ideals of those who powers. were responsible for its establishment, it has accomplished a great deal of very useful work, although there has been sometimes congestion, delay and expense in connection with getting it to function. It s principal difficulty has been that it has lacked the power to enforce its awards. Unfortunately, some of its awards, which have been made after a very minute and earnest investigation, have been flouted, and it has not possessed the power to ensure their enforcement. This measure is, other things, designed to that very serious disability those who administer the Arbitratio n Act. It contains a provision, under which the new court will be clothed with ample powers to enforce its awards. Many persons at one time indulged the hope that the establishment of arbitration courts would bring about the end of the strike era, but that hope has not been fulfilled. Certain organizations have considered that their interests would be best conserved by having recourse to the strike weapon, and they have taken that extreme step before seeking the intervention of the court. Such a difficulty is inescapable with human nature as it is. I should like to have seen in the measure a provision whereby an organization which had had recourse to a strike before asking the assistance of the Arbitration Court, would not have its claims considered until that strike was declared off, and normal con- ditions were resumed, so that it could approach the court fre* from the reproach of having precipitated action that might prejudice its case.",33
123,Mr LACEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,That principle is now adopted by the judges of the court.,33
124,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Quite so; but there is no such provision in the act. It should not be left to the judges to make that stipulation: it should be stated in express terms in the act so that unions would know exactly the position in which they stood. The reason for the proposal to appoint judges with life tenure has been full y explained by the Attorney-General (Mr Latham). I join with those who consider that it would be preferable to appoint judges for a fixed term, which could be renewed subject to good behaviour. Apparently that is not possible under our existing Some provision ought to be made for an'age limitation. There comes a time in the life of every man, when, by reason of age or infirmity, those faculties which enabled him to discharge his duties efficiently have become i m paired.",33
125,Mr BRUCE,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Unde r the Constitution the Government is precluded from making provision for an age limitation.,33
126,Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I recognize that. But it is a disability that ought to be removed from the Constitution. I among disagree with those who think that penremove sions ought not to be provided for judges. from That is a wise and a just provision. In cidentally, may I remark that this Parliament frequently concerns itself with the provision of pensions for other sections, but never seeks to make a similar provision for its own members. That is an omission which one day, perhaps, will be remedied. Some members of Parliament, are able to make provision for old age or infirmity, without a pension scheme; but it must be remembered that others are not in that fortunate position, and some such provision should be made for them. One of the most i m portant provisions in the bill , and one which commends itself to my approbation, is that which deals with the appointment of conciliation commissioners. I endorse the remarks which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) made in the course of his speech this afternoon. Some means should be devised for bringing the parties together and effecting a settlement by conciliation before a dispute reaches the stage when it is necessary to have recourse to arbitration. The bill provides that means, and it is one of its best features. It is likely to produce better results than have so far been achieved by either wages boards or arbitration courts. - and I dare say many other honourable members-woul d prefer wages boards or similar institutions, if they could be factorily set up under our Constitution, but that is not possible with our restricted powers. If the referendum proposals are endorsed by the people, the system of settling disputes might be extended to include, not only arbitration courts, but also other tribunals such as wages boards and conciliation boards. who are personally acquainted with the details of an industry in relation to which a dispute arises, could then meet at a round-table conference at the seat of the trouble. Each side would be able to give expert advice, and a satisfactory conclusion ought to be arrived at with much greater expedition than is possible with any other form of tribunal. I am sure that honourable members will give the Government the credit of endeavouring to establish tribunals which it believes, and we all hope, will reduce the number of industrial-disputes, and go a long way towards establishing an era of industrial peace. With that established, we shall have a stable groundwork for the future prosperity of Australia.",33
127,Mr LACEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Grey) [4.57] - My principal reason for rising is to refute certain statements that have been made by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning), and to give instances, other than that which he quoted, of the breaking of awards. I shall always cheerfully support any action of the Government which will tend to expedite the hearing of cases in the Arbitration Court, and give the judges wider powers to effect that purpose, and enforce their awards. The honourable member for Macquarie referred to a strike that occurred in the ranks of the Australian Workers Union, subsequent to its having been given an award of the court. In that case, the judge admitted having made a mistake to the extent of 200 sheep a week. He based his award upon a judgment that had been given previously by Mr Justice Higgins. In readjusting the wages of the shearers, he did not completely rectify the mistake, but dealt only partially with it . I could quote a mass of evidence in contradiction of the assertion of the honourable member for Macquarie, showing that that I great organization, after having waited for years to have its claim heard by the Arbitration Court, had received an adsatisverse award, and yet had advised its members not to take drastic action, but to rely wholly upon the system of arbitration. Considering the extent of its membership, very few disputes have occurred in that organization since it was brought into existence. It is interesting to note the large number of converts that Those have been made to the principle of arbitration. Until recently, honourable members opposite were opposed to that system. When I first contested the Grey seat in 1922, I received from a body known as the Single Purpose League a circular letter in which I was asked to state my opinion in regard to arbitration. That letter stated that National Liberal Eederations, the Country partyin' fact, almost all the political organizations that were opposed to the Labour party-were pledged to abolish the Arbi tration Court.",34
128,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,That is not so.,34
129,Mr LACEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The Single Purpose League is still in existence, but it is remarkable how many of its members are now in favour of arbitration. I am very pleased that so many honourable members on the other side have been converted to that principle. There are many anomalies arising under the existing Arbitration Act which are not dealt with in this measure. I do not approve of the fixing of wages solely upon the cost of living without taking into consideration the profits of an industry. It must be admitted that every worker should receive a wage equal to l i e cost of living. Every one must have the means to live; but where an industry is flourishing, and its profits would enable the employers to pay their workers more thaan a living wage based upon the cost of living, they should do so. Mr Justice Higgins, in some of the awards he made, said that, whilst the wages he fixed were based on the cost of living, he left it to the employers from time to time to reward the services of employees at rates higher than those he fixed. I know of very few employers who have done so. I know of some squatters who have paid shearers more tban the award rates. I know of many small squatters, or men engaged in mixed farming, who would never think of asking their shearers to work for award rates; hut always pay more.",34
130,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,And they give them better conditions than are given by others.,35
131,Mr LACEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Yes ; they give them better conditions than are provided in many of the big sheds - I have noticed that, when an employer is in direct touch with his men, he shows them much more consideration than is shown by the chairman or manager of a company who is not in direct touch with its employees. When an employer is not in direct touch with his men. he will fight them on the least pretence, and will not give them the conditions which he would be prepared to give them if he dealt directly with them. Although Mr Justice Higgins left it to employers to specially reward efliciency and skill, in the great majority of cases they pay no more than the basic rates. It is said that employees often break awards, but awards are more frequently broken by employers. Certaiu conditions prevail when employers approach the Arbitration Court, and wages are ad-' justed ou the cost of living whilst those conditions prevail; but in nine cases out of ten, when an increase of wages is granted to employees, the' employers set to work immediately to alter the conditions under which these men have to work, and so.break the award. I know of some industries in which men work in groups, and, immediately an award was given in the case of one of these industries, the number of men employed in it was reduced. When an employer alters the conditions uncier which the employees have to work, he breaks an. award just as certainly as do employees when they demand higher wages than have been awarded to them. All these things should be taken into consideration. If the tration Court had the right to determine whether an award has been broken or uot, the industrial position might be proved. I welcome the establishment of conciliation boards. I know of many large organizations that have tried to do something in this direction by appointing disputes committees. But, in the case of soulless companies, the directors of which do not come into direct touch with the employees, it is often found that an employee who has acted on a disputes committee is dismissed from his occupation. In this age such things should not occur. When a man who is familiar with the conditions of the industry in which he is employed possesses the confidence of his fellow workers to such an extent that they elect him to a disputes committee, he fulfils a very useful function indeed by acting upon such a committee. The Leader of the Opposition stated that conciliation boards would be able to prevent disputes arising, and I agree that they should be able to do so by performing work which, in some instances, is done by disputes committees. I hope that the bill will have the effect desired. Further legislation is required to ensure greater expedition in the settlement of cases brought before, the Arbitration Court, and I trust we shall be given an opportunity to consider legislation of that kind.",35
132,Mr WEST,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"East Sydney)' [5.10] - I . regret the gloom and sorrow that has been introduced into the debate by the references which have been made to the unfortunate position of the men on the land. It would appear that we cannot discuss measures of this kind without such references, and the painting of glorious pictures of the. advantages enjoyed by those who live in the, cities. I can tell the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr. Abbott) that there is more misery in 40 square feet in the city than is to be found in four square miles in the country. The purpose of fhis bill is to secure the appointment of a number of judges. Fortyfive lines of the measure are entirely devoted to making provision to give them splendid salaries, high travelling expenses and good pensions. After that there is not much of the bill left. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Latham), as a member of the legal trade union, upon the care with which he has provided for Arbimembers of his union. I take the view that judges should be treated in the same way as persons following other occupaim- tions. They should be paid salaries in accordance with the importance of the position they hold, and there should be no excuse for them becoming old-age pensioners. I am sorry that the House should, i u this matter, depart from principles previously laid down. Speaking of the difficulties of people engaged in the pastoral industry, I may inform the honourable member for Gwydir that I often attend agricultural shows, and I have found that the greatest number of buyers of motor cars there are men coming from the country districts. They are purchased with ready cash, and not under the hire system, the adoption of which will , sooner or later, be regretted in Australia, America aud England. I have noticed , 1 further, that it is men on the land whe pay the highest probate and death duties. I hope that honourable members will discontinue the gloomy statements made from time to time about the difficulties of - people' on the land. We know that too high a price is paid for land, and the man who holds land has, in most cases, to carry a "" blister."" People on the land are much better off today than they ever were before. Millions of money have been spent in providing them with roads, and there are many whose lands adjoin these roads. We are subsidizing country people to a much greater extent than city people. The residents of the city have to pay rates and taxes to municipal authorities, but those authorities are given no road grants from the revenues of the country ? Many years ago, when acting as secretary to the Labour Council in New South Wales, I induced a number of public men, including Sir Joseph Carruthers, Sir George Dibbs, Mb-. B B . Wise, and others, to deliver addresses to my - colleagues on conciliation and arbitration. I remember that a Commission, of whioh Sir Robert Garran's father- a very able man-wa s a member, reported in favour of conciliation and arbitration. In the building trade in Great Britain , with which I was connected, it was the practice, in November of each year, for representatives of trade unions connected with the in dustry, and of builders, to . meet in Manchester and other places, and fix the hours and conditions of labour in the industry for the next twelve'months. I have in my library a book which is 154 years old, and in it are set out wages in the building trade and piecework rates in other trades. In the early days we were told that supply and demand should govern, wages, that the fixing of wages was ridiculous, and that it was stupidity to try to interfere between - employer and employee. Now all these things are being done. Instead of continuing the present system of arbitration, we should appoint conciliation committees, on which employers and employees will be represented, with power to appoint their own chairman, and, in the event of no agreement being reached on certain matters, the decision of the Arbitration Court would be final. At one time. conciliation committees operated satisfactorily in New South Wales; but the employers insisted on being represented on tliose committees by members of the legal profession, and this eventually led to the appointment of arbitration courts, composed of persons with a knowledge of the law, but, unfortunately, not of the technicalities of the various trades and callings with which they have to deal. The bill provides that the Attorney General-as the representative of the Government-ma y intervene in a case before the court, and I take strong exception to that. The States of New South Wales and Queensland are the most progressive in the Commonwealth, both - in production and social reform. Their people are happy and contented, and this is evidenced by the numbers of persons that arrive there from other States. The workers of those two States now enjoy a working week of 44 hours. If the question of standard hours is referred to the Arbitration Court, the Government may, - under the bill, intervene, and, in that event, would probably influence the. court's decision. Judges are only human; and being in the pay of the Crown,, it would take a lot of argument to convince them that the workers of New South Wales and Queensland were entitled to a working week of 44 hours, when workmen in other States were working 48 hours a week. Until the common rule is introduced, we shall have to bear our present disabilities. The Attorney-General has given no real reason for the appointment of judges with life tenure, or for the payment of pensions. The Arbitration Court will be an expensive tribunal, costing the country from £20,000 to £25,000 annually. Each judge will require an office, a messenger, a typist, and an associate. A deputation of which I was a member once asked Sir Henry Parkes for an increase of salary for a particular officer, and lie wisely replied that, once a man was given a salary of £300 a year and placed in an office, the expenses multiplied and a department was soon created. The great trouble throughout the world today is overcapitalization of industries. We have an illustration of this in Great Britain . Through over-capitalization, the railways, and the shipping and mining industries cannot afford to pay the wages that were ruling prior to the war. Australia will soon be in the same position - The great British f i r m of Vickers Limite d and others have set an example to us by reducing its capital by one-half. Companies that are over-capitalized can neither provide a sufficient margin of profit for their shareholders, nor pay adequate wages to their employees. When in committee I hope that this legislation will be amended to bring it more into conformity with the ideals of the Labour party.",35
133,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Wannon) [5.30] --If the system of arbitration, involving the artificial regulation of wages by constituted authorities, is to continue, it is advisable to improve the machinery of the Arbitration Court in many of the ways proposed by this bill ; but, at the risk of standing alone, I declare my fundamental opposition to the arbitrary adjustment of the relations of employer and employee without regard to the economic conditions of the industry concerned. This method of awarding rates of wages and hours of labour, following upon an artificially created dispute, and the consideration by the court of all sorts of extraneous factors, is little better than guesswork. I believe in industrial conciliation; but conciliation and compulsory arbitration are as wide apart as the poles, for the one aims at prevention, and the other at a rule of thumb ' adjustment of relationships. Having emerged from the artificial and unsound conditions brought about by the war, the country's outstanding need is a sound economic stocktaking. During the war all sound methods, and all (the safeguards of industry were dispensed with ; our ordered systems of finance and economic production were cast to the winds. Currency and values were inflated, and every other index to sound economics went by the board. By now the nation should have returned to normal conditions, but it continues to pursue the alluring, bouncing ball of extravagance in our social and economic life, for which a crude system of compulsory arbitration, which is merely a compromise between warring elements, is mainly responsible. What arbitration - judge is prepared to base awards on the true economic conditions in the dairying, f r u it growing, and poultry industries? By the aid of crutches-bountie s at this end and preference at the other end of the world-som e primary industries are still able to keep going; wheat growing and wool-raising are sound, and they are mainly supporting the nation. What other primary industry can prosper under existing conditions? I believe in good wages, sound wages, that leave some clear money to the worker; wages or business that leave no money are unsound. In opposing the principle of compulsory arbitration, I do not wish anybody to think that I would dismantle the whole machinery of compulsory arbitration, and terminate the awards that it has produced. I would not summarily take from any worker anything he has gained legitimately from the court, but I ask that the Commonwealth shall evacuate the field of industrialism, and leave the responsibility of regulating wages, hours, and working conditions to the wages boards and systems of collective bargaining that the State authorities have established. I would institute a system of economic in vestigations and reasoning by means of wages boards; and, better still, I would appoint a committee in each industry to inquire and report as to what wages the industry could afford. If it be sound and equitable for an arbitration court to award in the secondary industries conditions that ensure a good standard of livin g to those engaged in them, is it logical or just that the same court should not be able to exercise jurisdiction in the primary industries to ensure decent conditions for the.men, women and children by whose labour they are carried on ? Neither the court nor this Parliament can award such conditions to those in dustries. Other than the value of our primary production, there is no f u n d of national wealth from which oan be paid any wages that courts arbitrarily fix in primary industries. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Abbott) did not exaggerate the d from rural employments to the secondary industries. In the factories, men get high wages and work short hours; in the rural industries long hours, much drudgery, and often inadequate rewards are the rule. Parents livin g on the land are anxious to give their children good education aud the other benefits of modern civilization, but the condition of most of the rura l in dustries in which they are engaged does not permit them to do that. sorry that the Government is not proposing as the first feature of its economic programme a sound stocktaking of the nation's industries. During the war, and in the years immediately following, this country enjoyed abnormal prosperity. Many of the nations of Europe were not producing, and Australia, a rich land with only a few people to feed and clothe, was able to get high prices for its abundance of wool and wheat. of which other countries were short. Upon the prosperity which resulted from high production and high prices we have overdrawn, and, in addition, we have pledged future generations by an orgy of national borrowing unprecedented in the history of Australia. But one who attempts to draw attention to this uneconomic inflation receives only a chilly hearing, and is supposed to be out of sympathy with modern thought. To those men who promise higher wages and better conditions in industry without regard to the funds from which those things are to be paid for, will come a day of reckoning. Last week the Arbitration Court in Perth in creased the wages of shearers by 2s. per 100 sheep, and proportionately advanced the payment of shed hands and other workers in the industry. Yet wool which twelve months ago averaged £33 per bale has fallen to £ 1 6 or £ 1 7 per bale; the price of lamb, which for nearly three years was about Is. per l b. on the London market, is today below 6d.; and 'Button, which ranged from 7d. to 8d. per l b . , is now worth about half that price. At this very time of depression in the pastoral industry, that clumsy instrument called an arbitration court orders the payment of increased wages. I am not concerned so much about the fate of the large land-holder or squat[126] may ter; he can look after himself. But this and past governments are responsible for having settled thousands of r if t returned soldiers upon grazing land. In my own electorate, estates were subdivided into sheep farms, and they are suitable for nothing else. The holders paid high prices for land and stock for which many of them have not yet paid. W it h the prices of wool, mutton, and lamb down 50 per cent., some of those men are on the verge of bankruptcy; yet they are required by the court to pay increased wages and offer better conditions to the workers. It is I am unpalatable to me to have to say these things, but it is the duty of somebody to point out the unsoundness of the economic conditions that prevail from one end of Australia to the other. When General Pau came to Australia to acknowledge, in behalf of the French people, the part that our soldiers had played "" in saving their beloved France, he observed closely the resources of our nation, and declared that the pastoral and agricultural industries were its two breasts. Australia's total national debt is approximately £1,000,000,000. The wool clip is worth £3-5,000,000the estimate of the value of the forthcoming clip of .2,250,000 bales, at from £16 to £17 a bale-is not equal to the annual interest on the national debt. The exportable surplus of the coming wheat harvest, at current prices, may realise from £30,000,000 to £35,000,000. The total interest of the national debt is £55,000,000, and the invalid, old-age, maternity, and war pensions amount to another £15,000,000. These are in escapable, annually recurring, obligations. It will, therefore, take the whole of the proceeds of the wool clip and of the wheat harvest to pay the interest on the national debt and the pensions of this country. A f t e r that, what is left? Where is the mystic fund out of which the ever increasing wages awarded by the Arbitration Court are to be paid ? I ask that a halt shall be called. We ought to get right down to a sound understanding of the economic basis upon which the industries of the country rest, and alter a system that does not produce results. I desire the worker i u this country to have his margin of hope, and to have some clear money for his life's work. ! am not an advocate of low wages, for I believe that the worker and his family should have reasonable recompense for their to i l ; but that cannot be obtained under a system that hoists the cost of living against the worker while pretending to aid him. The system has ignominiously failed, and all the patches that this bill places on it Will not make it sound. The world at large has rejected it , although misguided people in this country still support it . I believe that the Government has the. best intentions in endeavouring to improve the system, but the system is essentially unsound. ought to adopt a system by which those on both sides in industry can come together on a sound economic basis. Let the workers be paid under conditions similar to those prevailing in the United States of America. I do not wish to copy any country slavishly, but a system which, like ours, gives no clear money to the men engaged in industry, or to the primary producers, is unsound both for them and the nation.",37
134,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The trouble was that, under the old system the workers did not obtain, anything like their fair share of the proceeds of their labour.",39
135,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I would not restore the old system, and I hope that the honourable member will not accuse me of that. I have already said that I believe in collective bargaining, and that wages boards and conciliation committees provide for that. I would not allow any man arbitrarily to fix the wages of another man. But I say that the arbitration system is not the right system, and that the Government, even if this bill is carried, and the referendum proposals accepted, should take steps to establish an economic council composed of representatives of all shades of opinion-the employers and employees in the secondary, and particularly in the primary industries, learned economists from the universities, judges with experience in the. courts, and others. When the mem^ bers of such a council come to comprehend the fact that we are not drawing from a bottomless well of wealth, and that the day of reckoning is coming, a solution of our problems may be in sight. Soon we shall be unable to borrow, or, if we do borrow, to create an asset worth the money we sink in it . I defy any honourable, member to say that the cost of any public Work in Australia is not excessive. A recent illustration is the works being carried out by the Federal Capital Commission at Canberra. No public servant can live in a decent home at Canberra, whether he buys it or rents it , unless he pays £3 a week for it . The whole system is economically \insound. The publio servants cannot stand it, and the community generally cannot stand it, and I hope it will soon d a w on them that the conditions under which the primary producer of this country labours are f u n damentally unsound. I wish we could We have a roving economic committee. I should like to see it move into the dairying and fruit-growing areas, and into the cattle country of the north of Australia, where on wide, rich, pastures men cannot pay tlieir way. Cattle men in Queensland are nearly down and out, first because of the ravages of a drought, and secondly, because what ought to be one of Australia's greatest industries is in such a condition that it hardly pays to slaughter a beast to sell it in the world's markets. It does not pay at prespnt in the north of Australia to breed cattle, and that niaens that it does not pay Australia to keep her place in the great meat industry of the world. Our national affairs require a thorough ovei-haul, but the Gilbertian farce of placing heavier imposts on industry in its worse hour continues in the Arbitration Court. These things are evidence to me that the farce ought to be stopped before disaster ensues.",39

137,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I do not dotibt the honourable member's earnestness or sincerity, but if We compare Australia with other countries, we can say, without be l n | boastful, that it is in a far better condition than any of them.",39
138,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,I am afraid that is not saying very much. It does not meet the argument of the honourable member for Wannon.,39
139,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"On a bill like this, there is no need to enter upon a discusbecause sion of' the boundless resources of this try. The Government is doing something to move along life's pathway with wellis ordered steps, with co-ordination and organization. If we revert to a disorganized industrial system we shall be way to our doom. Not only in the indusAustralia trial, but also in other spheres, more, and uot less, organization is needed.",40
140,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The honourable memsay ber for Wannon did not say a word against organization; he believes in it . - Mr Fenton - That may be so, but he reached very doleful conclusions. He said that the continual raising of wages in this country, notwithstanding our of good wages. natural wealth, would lead to disaster. He spoke of the enormous sum to be paid out every year tq meet, our war obligaif tions; but there is one item that he not mention. One of the greatest drawcountry. backs to this country is not that the worker is given a living wage, but that we have to meet ah annual interest bill an ostrich. of £50,000,000. In a few years we shall be paying twice as much for borrowed always good wages. money as we paid not long ago. I do not object to money being borrowed mined within our own borders. When the Fisher Government floated the first loan in this country, it was hardly expected that the people would respond to the tent of more than a few million pounds. It was seriously predicted by some honorview able members, who thought that they knew something of commerce and finance, that the Government was asking for too much. Apart from what we pay in Auscluding remarks. tralia, we pay from £25,000,000 to but £30,000,000 in interest overseas.",40
141,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"It is, therefore, sary to produce new wealth, not to borthrough row it .",40
142,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,I am pointing that the progress of this country is hindered by the payment of large sums of money to the worker. The honourable member mentioned the United States America; but that is a high-wage counfew try.,40

150,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,High wages are not,40
151,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Thei r value is deterby the necessaries and comforts that they will purchase. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Abbott) could not help having at i l t at the tariff; but the exhonorable member for Wannon did not do thac, for he takes a broad national of our fiscal policy. He realizes that secondary, as well as primary, industries are necessary for the welfare of the country. But I disagree with his conN o t high wages, other factors, are undermining our stability. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) suggested necesthat Australia had suffered seriously industrial troubles-he ' read his brief remarkably well-bu t other circumout stances contribute more than what not may be called "" days off "" by the workers. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) and the honorof able member for Perth (Mr Mann) a days ago qiioted passages from a recently published book on industrial conditions in the United States of America, which seems to have had considerable in on honourable members opposite. I have in my hand the annual report of the of Commerce and Industry for 1922, which contains, among other things, an American article on "" The Elimination of Waste in Industry,"" that indicates conclusively that the workers are not chiefly to blamo. It includes the tableResponsi- ResponsiIndustry Studied. Assayod Assayed against against Management. labour. Relationshipper cent. per cent. Men's clothing manufacturing 75 16 Building industry- 65 21 Printing 03 28 Boot and shoe manufacturing 73 11 Metal trades.. 81 9 Textile manufacturing . . 50 10 I think even honourable members opposite will be prepared to admit that that shows quite clearly that inefficient management in industry is responsible for more waste than strikes, limitation of output, ancl other methods that are sometimes adopted by workers to achieve some measure of justice. I remind honourable members that those figures iefer to industry in what is reckoned to be the most efficiently organized country in the world. When we are considering the conditions in the United States of America, it is well for us to look at them in a broad way. The following paragraph is also from the article that I have already quoted: Some of the evils of restriction of production are chargeable to owners and management. Tn the building trades, contractors, builders, and supply dealers have restricted production by maiintaining high prices, collusion in bidding, and unfair practices. At times there has been collusion beween employers and la'bour, tending to raise prices unduly. The waste from these causes cannot be measured in this study. All these factors militate against achieving the maximum degree of success. Unfortunately, in the hurry to get rich quick, many business men descend practices that no one can excuse. more casualties occur in America than in Mr Fenton. Australian industries. On that point this report statesA report on national vitality, prepared in 1U09 for the National Conservation Commission, appointed by President Boosevelt, estimated that there were then about 3,000,000 persons seriously ill at all times in the United Responsi- States of America. This meant an average bility annual loss per person of thirteen days owing Assayed against to illness. It was estimated that 42 per cent, Outside of this illness was preventaJble, and that such bility bility contacts (the Public, prevention would extend the average life by Trade over fifteen years. Since that report was issued an apparent reduction in illness has been ships, and accomplished; so that today an estimate of other Factors). between eight and nine days working time lost 5 through illness is probably near the fact. per c""nt. It appears, therefore, that between .1910 and 1921 conditions improved so much in the United States of America 9 that 210,000,000 working days were 14 saved to the employees through improved 9 health. The article proceedsIn discussing public health conditions there is no clear distinction between the standing 16 of the 42,000,000 persons classed as gainfully 10 employed in the United States and those specifically engaged' in industry. The 40 42,000,000 men and women gainfully employed probably Io3e, on an average, more than eight days each annually from illness disabilities, including non-industrial accidents- a total of 350,000,000 days.",40
152,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,All this goes to show the necessity for economic stocktaking.,41
153,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I have no objection to that. If any honourable member thinks that he sliould sound a warning note, that is his business; but the doleful sentiments with which the honourable member for Wannon concluded his speech were, in my opinion, unwarranted. Better organization is needed in industry. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) knows its value to the primary producers, for I suppose that the various co-operative producing and marketing movements that he has been connected with in the last quarter of a century have saved them hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is common for comparisons to be made between city and country life, usually with the object of showing the privileges and conveniences enjoyed by those who live in the cities; but I dare say that, notwithstanding the variety and amusement that may be had in a city like Sydney, with its 1,000,000 and.more inhabitants, or a city like Melbourne, with about 900,000 people, honourable members who have lived in rural districts for the to greater part of their lives would not Many dream of residing permanently in a city. I admit that those who are engaged i primary production have to work long hours-in the dairying industry, their work is practically continuous from beginning to the end of the year. I sire to see rura l conditions improved, I believe that gradually greater comforts are being provided for those who live back. The telephone system is spreading its influence further and further, the greatest invention of all-wireless takes to the homes of country people sures that it was impossible for formerly to obtain. Generally speaking, although the working hours may be longer and the rewards of labour for the time being not so great, rural lif e is much to be preferred to that in the city. The health statistics prove that those who live in rural areas are much more fortunately placed than the dwellers in congested parts. The average working man in the city frequently has 'to travel 5, 10, and more miles to his work, which he has to reach by about half-past 7 o'clock in morning. That necessitates early rising, and results in a late return, to his in the evening. I am acquainted w i men in my constituency who are supposed ber to be working under favourable conditions, yet they could not reach the polling booth in time to record their votes before 8 o'clock in the evening. I hope that coucCourt try members, instead of preaching dishe affection amongst their constituents, w enlarge upon the pleasures and healthtralia giving qualities of country life. The timony of medical men who have iuquired into the health of those who are employed settled in industries in the United States of P. MCM . Glynn America, is to the following effect: there comes to the worker fatigue; secondly representative colds; thirdly, tuberculosis; and fourthly, death. The industrial statistics of the United States of America show that, annually, 350,000,000 days are lost through sickness and accident; proving that the health of the people in that country is very much inferior to what is in Australia. High wages, greater put, and other alleged benefits are dearly purchased if they are obtained at the expense of human life. I am pleased that the industrial organizations are limiting the hours worked by men who are engaged on piece-work. Australians pride themselves upon their physical standard. The recent, great war showed that n the Australian soldiers were second to no others in the matter of mentality and physique. Why? In the first place, we the have sprung from a good stock. The best deof Britain's sons came to Australia in and the early days of her history, and we are their descendants. We live under more outhealthy conditions than those which exist in most other countries, and we have and thus been able to build up a race whose physique is not excelled by that of pleaany other nationality. We should not them attempt to copy the methods that areadopted by other countries. W it h all its wonderful wealth and large output, the death rate in the United States of America, especially in the big industries, is much greater than it is in Australia. The part of the bill in which I most strongly believe, and that which will prove the most effective, is the provision relating to the appointment of conciliation commissioners. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) said this afternoon, it is much easier to prevent an industrial disthe pute than to settle one. I add my tribute to those of the Attorney-General (Mr . home Latham), the Leader of the Opposition th (Mr Charlton), and the honourable memfor Y a r r a (Mr Scullin), to the work which has been done by Mr Justice Higgins. Although he was preceded in the office of President of the Arbitration by the late Mr Justice O'Connor, had to break fresh ground, and he has ill left behind him a record of which Ausis proud, and from which other tescountries have benefited. Tens of thousands of workers haye had their troubles by conciliation. Whilst Mr . was the member First for Angas, he was also the legal of practically all the Broken Hill mine-owners, and of a number of employers in South Australia. He always met the secretary'of the union, and, together, they drew up an agreement in accordance with the regulations of the act. It was taken along to the it Registrar of the court, and was subseoutquently made an award by the judge. I hope that provision will be made which will enable the conciliation commissioners to intervene whenever there is likely to now be trouble, and thus have the matter settled amicably. I do not think that much opposition will be displayed to the bill. If amendments are proposed from this side I trust that the Attorney General will, if possible, allow them to be incorporated in the measure. We shall' then have a better Arbitration Act than we possess at the present time.",41
154,Unknown,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Sitting suspended from 639 to 8 p.m. Mr 'BLAKELEY (Darling) [8.0] This bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act makes provision for certain departures from practices which have been followed for some time. It proposes that the judges of the Arbitration Court shall have a life tenure of office, and shall be entitled to pensions, and. it makes provision for a distinctly new departure from present practice in permitting the intervention of the Attorney-General in disputes. Speaking gene rally, the federal unions which are making use of the conciliation and arbitration court endorse the principles of the bill, but are disappointed that its scope is not more extended, and that it does not make provision to remedy disabilities from which they are at present suffering. As they endorse the principles of the bill, and particularly the provision for a life tenure for judges of the court, and the power to interpret their own awards, instead of leaving their interpretation to police magistrates, I have very little opposition to offer to the measure. I hope, however, that when the bill is being considered in committee, the Government will be prepared to accept amendments drafted by those who have used the existing law for many years, namely, the committees and officers of federal organizations. This is only another example of the way in which the Conciliation and .Arbitration Act has been tinkered with during the nine years that I have been a memher of this House. In 1920, the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for NoTth Sydney (Mr Hughes), introduced a bill containing very elaborate machinery for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. It provided for a Commonwealth Council of industrial representatives, district councils of industrial representatives, special tribunals, and local boards. In introducing the measure the right honourable gentleman pointed out the complete failure of the then existing Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as evidenced'by the congestion of the Arbitration Court at the time. There were then some 120 cases awaiting attention. That congestion might be directly attributed to the then Prime Minister, because of his lack of sympathy with the work of the court, and his refusal to appoint more judges to relieve the congestion. The Industrial Peace Bill was brought down with a flourish of trumpets. It was to be the last word in conciliation and arbitration. The stage was set, the scenery and machinery were placed nicely in position - bu t nothing functioned. I am inclined to think that when the measure was passed, it was not intended that it should function. The proof is that it was made use of almost exclusively by the coal-miners of Australia, and only on one 1 occasion by the seamen. The machinery of the act has functioned in connection with those industries, ancl no others. It has proved of great benefit to the coalminers by securing almost complete industrial peace in the coal-mining - industry. To read the political propaganda published in the press from time to time by Mr MCDonald, secretary to the Coal Mine . Owners' Association, one might imagine that the coal-miners of the country do nothing else but go on strike. That is not so, because, speaking comparatively, the industry in the three main coal-bearing States has been carried on peacefully under the Industrial Peace Act. It would seem that it was purely an accident that the act was applied to the coal-mining industry. It may have been that tliose responsible for it had it in mind that, while serving one purpose, they might cover up their tracks by making the measure apply to other industries. I have given very close attention to the arbitration laws of this country, and particularly to the federal laws dealing with the subject. I have noted with regret the way in whioh the Arbitration Court has been used for political purposes. The judges of the court have in the past been hampered in their work. We have seen a Prime Minister adopting the extreme course of attacking, through the press and on the floor of this House, a judge of the High Court who at the time was President of the Arbitration Court. A feud was started at that time by the right honourable member for North Sydney 'and was carried on by one side. The greatest enemy of Mr Justice Higgins will agree that he was never inefficient or neglectful of Ms duty to the country in hia position as President of the Arbitration Court. Apparently the Industrial Peace Act was introduced as a means to displace Mr . Justice Higgins by .making his position intolerable. It had that effect. Almost immediately after it became law, he was practically farced to resign his position as President of the Arbitration Court. The Government of the day was afraid that a 44-hour working week would be determined by Mr Justice Higgins, and as a result of a very cunning trick, for which the then Prime Minister was responsible, it was decided, in order that the 44-hour working week should not be made a common rule for federal in dustries, that there should be yet another tinkering with the arbitration law, and a bill was brought down which made it impossible for working hours to be fixed by a court consisting of less than three judges. At the time, honourable members on this side stated frankly that the only reason for the introduction of that measure was to enable the Government, under instructions from the employers of the country, to set up au obstacle to prevent the workers getting what was due to them. So far as it dealt with the question of hours of labour the measure passed at that time was a scandalous measure.",43
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Order ! The honourable member is not in order in reflecting 1 upon legislation passed by this Parliament.,44
156,Mr BLAKELET,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Then , I shall say that the Government acted scandalously Cowards, theworkers of. the country whenthey introduced and passed that piece' of legislation.. The Prime Minister and the government of the day were not: even then satisfied, that the vested interests were properly protected from the establishment of a 4.4-hour week. When the legislation, providing that hours of labour could not be dealt with, by less. than, three judges was placed on the statute-book, the scenery and maohinery were again placed in proper position, but there were no actors. The government of the day of. which you, Mr Speaker, were, a member, failed to appoint judges to the court for nine months. It deliberately prevented one judge from, fixingworking hours and deliberately refrained from appointing other judges in order that the question might be settled bythreejudges. Ultimately, other judges were appointed, but because of political influence, a 44-hour working week has not yet been fixed. I am hoping that one good result giving the judges of the court a life tenure of office will be the removal of the fear of extinction, by a government of the day, of a judge who dares to do things opposed to its policy. I do not say that the judgeswho vacate their position at the. end of this month have been influenced, by the ' f a c t that two of them will then be outof a job, and have consequently refrained from doing justice to the workers of Australia by fixing a 44-hour working week, but it may be a factor in the delay of the settlement of the question. There is nob a judge of the Arbitration Courts, whose judgments I have read, who is not apparently favourable to a 44-hour working week, but notwithstanding the sympathy of the judges of the State and Federal courts, the fact remains that we have been compelled to do outside the court that which should have been done in the court many years ago. I trust t h a i the judges who are appointed will take up the vexed questions of a basic wage 'and a universal 44-hour working week for the Commonwealth, and will ! deal with them as they should have been dealt with many years ago. The b i ll now under review is practically the Industrial Peace Ac t only it provides for commissions, instead of the elaborate machinery of a Commonwealth, and district councils of industrial representatives,. local boards-, and special tribunals. Power is given under the bill to create commissions> to deal with special matters, and with that I agree. Elaborate machinery may be all very well, but if it cannot be operated it is of very littl e use to the workers of the country.. A universal working week of 44 working hours is inevitable. It was recently adopted in New South Wales,, outside of and despite the Arbitration Oourt, but steps were immediately taken to refer the question to the High Cora-t. As a result, the workers under Federal awards are in a most in vidious; position. This matter is indeedserious. On the 17th May, Mr Justice Powers, in the Federal Arbitration Court, 1 when dealing with this subject, saidThe law, as it now stands,, is that, the minimum, nates fixed as such are maximum rates so far as the power of the State Parliaments orthe State counts or boards is oon' cemed. Thelaw, asit. now stands, is that the maximum hours fixed by the Federal court's awards as maximum hours are minimum hours so far as the .power of the State Parliaments or State courts or boards is concerned. The .effect of the position is that the Federal - awards are now to be sanctuaries under which respondents to Federal awards can flee to - escape all State laws, commissions, arbitration courts, and wages boards decisions, which are imposed upon all other citizens, in a State. 'That is as to rules and conditions fixed by .Federal awards. TJiis must cause dissatisfaction by requiring a minority of employees under Federal awards in the different States to work on lower wages and for longer hours than the great body of employees in those States. If that is the effect, and I think - then the unions will not assist to build the :Banctuaries into which the respondents can flee, and will apply to determine the awards as soon as the period ifor which they were made expires. The unions are already lodging applications for relief. That is an extraordinary position to develop in this country. Under a State Labovr Government, the workers of New S.ouA ""Wales have been able to obtain wagei and conditions far in advance of those granted by the Federal Arbitration Court. I have'no doubt that the exercise of political influence on that court has been a great factor in bringing about that position. The State Labour Government of New South Wales adopted a working week of 44 hours. Mr G. FBANCIS - Does the honourable member suggest that political influence was used in that case!,",44
157,Mr BLAKELEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Yes , but not upon the judges. A majority of the members of the State Parliament came to that decision.",45
158,Mr ABBOTT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,How large majority?,45
159,Mr BLAKELEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"It was sufficient to establish a 44 hours' working week in New South Wales. This question has agitated the minds of the workers of this country for many years. It will be remembered that a Labour Government, some years ago, instituted a working week of 44 hours in New South Wales. The Nationalist party there went to the country on that issue, and, when returned to office, immediately instituted a working week of 48 hours. next elections the Nationalist party were defeated mainly because of its refusal to adopt a 44 hours' working week. That principle, so far as New South Wales ancl Queensland are concerned, is definitely fixed, and no Government there dare to re-institute a 48 hours' working week. The agitation for a working week of 44 hours is gradually extending to the other States.",45
160,Mr DUNCAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,HUGHES - Does the honourable member favour a working week of 40 hours?,45
161,Mr BLAKELEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"In some industries a working week of 40 hours is too long. I have worked in industries in which a working week of 30 hours was too long. Any person who has had experience of it is, rock-chopping, either in .tunnels or in trenches, well knows that it is impossible to avoid miners' phthisis after doing that work for six months. In 1912 a gang of nine men were rook-chopping in Sydney. Four years afterwards five of them were dead, three of them were so ill that they could not work, and the ninth man was liable to cease work at any time.",45
162,Mr BELL,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Is that any argument in support of a universal working week of 44 hours?,45
163,Mr BLAKELEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"It is an answer to the interjection of the honourable member for Boothby. There are other industries whose working hours should be less than 44 a week. There is no doubt as to the desire of the workers themselves. They, and not the people who talk academically about economic factors, do the job and produce the wealth of this country, and, therefore, should be the determining factor respecting hours of work.",45
164,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"On what principle does the honourable member suggest that was the the hours should be fixed at 44 a week? Of course, one understands that there are various occupations in which a smaller number of working hours should be fixed.",45
165,Mr BLAKELEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,The general principle is that a 48-hours working week is too long. Mr MAxwELL.T-yThat is not a principle.,45
166,Mr BLAKELEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Surely it becomes a principle if the workers decide that a working week of 48 hours is too long, At the and does not give them sufficient time for relaxation and recreation. Surely they are. the most competent to judge what is a fair working week. Apart from that, it has been laid down on many occasions by employers such as Leverhulme, Ford, and others, that there is a point of time after which the resistance and vitality of a worker decreases, and a distinct economic loss is occasioned by working beyond that point. That has also been determined by medical men and others investigating the subject, and we are quite content to accept their views, because we know from personal experience that a working week of 44 hours is inevitable.",45
167,Mr LISTEK,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Does the honourable member suggest fixing the working week of a wife at 44 hours ?,46
168,Mr BLAKELEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"S h o u l d we restrict the working hours of members of Parliament to 44 a week? The honourable member reminds me of the intelligent elector who stands on the edge of the crowd asking whether beer will be laid on to his house, is the candidate in favour of making an inland sea, and other more or less silly remarks, well knowing that such things would be i m possible. The honourable member realized that, too, when he makes such a puerile interjection. The appointment of judges to the Arbitration Court and the right of intervention by the Attorney-General to refer to it the question of hours and wages will not be opposed by me. Bhould like to know whether a judge of the court will be able to deal with the question of hours in respect of a section of industry, such as the rock-choppers, or will three judges be required. That is, of course, a matter primarily for the committee. The Council of the Federated Unions is in favour of the bill, and we hope that at least an earnest attempt is to be made to establish the Arbitration Court on a proper basis. I regret that because of the referendum proposals, the general amendment of the act has been postponed for at least twelve months. We hope that when this legislation is operating the political in - fluence which has been used previously on the Arbitration Court will disappear, and thus enable the workers to obtain a universal working week of 44 hours and a universal basic wage.  should not speak on the bill had not the honourable member for Grey (Mr . Lacey) this afternoon referred to a certai n circular issued by the Single Purpose League, in which, he said, was a statement that, among other organizations, the Liberal Federation of South Australia was opposed to arbitration. As a member of that federation, I wish to inform the honourable member and any others who may be under the same misapprehension, that the Liberal Federation of South Australia is not opposed to the principle of arbitration. As a matter of fact, that is a plank of its platform. A statement was made this afternoon by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton)- that some workers- I presume he meant in dustrial workers, because I do not think, that he refers very often to the country workers-ha d an interval of thirteen hours from the time of going to work in the morning to the time of returning in the evening. He said that that was a serious state of affairs, and showed that the conditions of work in the country were.fa r better than those in the city. 'But farmers' wives, especially in the outback mallee country, rise at 4 a.m. at harvest-time; they toil hard through the day, and are rarely free to retire before 10 p.m. They work those hours through seeding time, except that they do not rise until 6 a.m. I T speak on behalf of my farmer friends, because I have lived amongst them at varioustimes, and assisted, them with their harvesting, and I was, for many years, in business in a rural district. I am glad to see in this bill provision for conciliation. The attempts that are made in this Parliament and outside to set employer against employee, and vice versa, are mischievous. If conciliation were aimed at, and practised more generally, employer and employee, and the vast majority of the people in country and in city, who, though not parties to the disputes, suffer most by them, would fare better. I heartily support the bill, which, I hope, will prove another step towards industrial peace. . Mr COLEMAN (Reid) [8.32] - The bill provides for the reconstitution of the Arbitration Court by appointing judges with lif e tenure, because the High I Court has decided that, according to the Constitution, judicial power cannot be exercised by judges appointed for a prescribed term. It further provides for the appointment of industrial commissioners and the payment of pensions to judges. The proposal to appoint judges for life has, I understand, the approval of a representative majority of the trade anion movement.; .therefore it is not for me to oppose it . I say - that advisedly. flor fourteen years before entering this Parliament. I was a - union official, and - was able to observe the - operation of the - arbitration system, and, in regard to industrial niatters, I am prepared to be guided very largely by those with whom .1 was associated in the administration limdiustrial unionism. Mr ""WATT.'-Wi3 1 the honourable member explain why the Labour movement approves of giving life tenure to judges - of the Arbitration - Court? Mr COLEMAN. - The Labour movement desires that the Arbitration Court shall have power to interpret and enforce its own awards. . The High Court has construed the Constitution to mean fihat judicial power can be exercised only liy judges appointed on life tenure. ""Whether or not that is a correct interpretation ""Of the .Constitution is not arguable; it must be - accepted. The Arbitration 'Court's lack of judicial authority has been iresponsible ior much expense, delay, and inefficiency, and .the unions have been reluctantly compelled to submit, for the time being, to the consequences arising vout of the High Court's decision, - to which I have referred. Nevertheless, it is the opinion of the Labour 'movement that the Constitution should he asnended to enable this Parliament to - determine the terms, conditions, . and tenure upon which the judiciary shall (function, I cannot understand why the Government did not include an amendment to that effect in the 'Constitutional - proposals recently passed by this House which are to be submitted to the people. Mr G. PRANCIS - Anothe r reason for granting life tenure is that the judges' must be above suspicion of self-interest or undue influence. .",46
169,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I agree that that is desirable; but this Parliament should have ithe right to determine the conditions upon which the judiciary shall operate. This is the only Parliament in ""the British Empire that has not that residuary power. Every State parliament can prescribe the age of retirement, and other conditions governing appointments to the bench. Most, if not all, British - aranities have recognized the necessity placing the judiciary beyond tihe influence - of party political warfare by giving life tenure to the judges, subject tocertain conditions. But onost communities recognize that an arbitration tribunal should not function in the same way as an ordinary court, nor be governed by similar principles; it should be composed of young men of progressive outlook, who can respond to the impulses in the comof munity towards advancement and soeial reform. An arbitra-tion court conyposed of judges who have been on the bench for twenty years or 'more may possibly be a menace to industrial peace. Eor all practical purposes the court, which will exercise tremendous power, will be beyond the jurisdiction* of this Parliament, and, therefore, thought the majority of honourable members may today consider appointments for life desirable, a day may come when they will rue the creation of a judicial instrument which may >eause a great deal of industrial trouble, and exercise its power to the economic detrianent of Australia. I have no desire, nor do I think has any one else ou this .side, that the judiciary should be subject to the whim or caprice of any political party, and ithe tenure of judges be terminable almost by executive act, but .1 strongly urge that judges of the Arbitration Court should be appointed for a prescribed term. The .accepted - canons - of legal good behaviour are not likely to be broken in the determination of ;an ordinary action in the ordinary law - courts, but a great deal of mischief might occur in connection with an arbitration, court if it did not enjoy the confidence and trust of the parties appearing before it. That is why the Arbitration Court judges should not the .appointed on the same tenure and terms as are other members of the judiciary.. The Arbitration Court should set aside purely legal considerations, and adjudicate upon the conflicting claims of the parties in a spirit of conciliation, common sense, and equity. It is unfortunate that the High - Court 'judgment .has compelled ns to .adopt a course which, is other nircumstaincea, the common sense of Parliament would not endorse.",47
170,Mr WATT,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,How does the honourable commember expect a 'bench of judges to put for aside legal considerations and procedure 1,47
171,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Why this revolutionary desire on the part of the right honourable member to do away with legal procedure ?,48
172,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I think the right honourable gentleman is justified in suggesting that the Arbitration Court should not be hampered by the ordinary legal forms. The Government has adopted the wrong course in not asking the people to amend the Constitution in order to give to the court judicial power, regardless of the terms upon which its judges may be appointed. I reiterate my statement during the debates on the two Constitution amendment bills, that this Parliament should have plenary authority over its own agencies. It is absurd that it should be subject to its own creatures, but as I have already said, I accept this bill because the trade union movement of necessity approves of it . My attitude is perfectly logical.",48
173,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,It is very obsequious for a member of Parliament.,48
174,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"That remark is mere humbug. If the honourable member is quite candid, he will admit that his course of political conduct is governed very largely by the opinions of bodies outside, which are responsible for the presence, in this House, of himself and other honourable members opposite.",48
175,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,I cannot admit that.,48
176,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The honourable member may not admit it , but it is true of very many honourable members opposite. I dosire the arbitration system to function satisfactorily, and those who have to submit to the authority of the court are entitled to have their views considered. That is the justification for my attitude. I have had plenty of opportunity of Observing the general effect of arbitration. For many years I was associated with that militan t organization of seamen which has been involved in so much trouble recently through insisting upon the economic rights of its members. Later, I organized clerical workers. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Eodgers) attacked the arbitration system, but failed to propose a substitute. do not intend to delve into the dark ' ages in order to find a justification for industrial conciliation and arbitration. No advocate of the system claims that it will entirely prevent industrial disputes. Only an idiot would pretend to prescribe a panacea for the ills to which the party politic is heir. Throughout history strikes have occurred, and will continue to occur. I need not remind honourable members of the strike ou the Tower of Babel, or the strike of the Israelites, who were held in bondage by the Egyptians. No industrial authority has ever maintained that industrial strife can be abolished. The best that this Parliament can do is to try to make the industrial instrument for settling industria l disputes efficient, and reduce the cause of strikes. I say to those honourable .members opposite who have been .loud in their denunciation of arbitration, that if arbitration were abolished tomorrow the militant organizations would not be seriously injured. They could rely on' the jungle law in a straight-out fight, and we should get back to the days of direct action; but grave injustice would be inflicted on that great body of people whom the Government purports to represent, and who are misnamed the middle class-the professional workers and the clerkswho were ground between the economic millstones in the past because they had not sufficient collective consciousness to organize to better their conditions. A few years ago the shop assistants, the bank clerks, and even the journalists who record our debates in this House, were denied a tribunal to determine their conditions of employment, with tjhe result that while the wages of artisans and labourers were being advanced by arbitration, and collective bargaining and strikes, the wages of professional workers and clerks were at a stand-still. Arbitration gave to them a charter by which they could maintain a wage standard in accordance with the progressive increase in the cost of living. The journalists gained substantially by their first application to the Federal Arbitration Court. The abolition of arbitration would inflict a grave injustice on the large section of the community that desires to operate peacefully by resort to industrial tribunals, it would tend to create industrial chaos, and it would I certainly not be to the advantage of Australia. Those who talk about the value of conciliation seem to forget the industrial history of this country. It is impossible to have successful conciliation unless there is behind it the shadow of compulsory arbitration, or the mailed fist of force-direc t action. For instance, when I first became secretary of the Clerical Union, the employers would jiot confer with me because my union was not entitled to approach State Arbitration Court. A Tory Government in New South Wales had denied to the clerks the right to approach the State Arbitration Court. It was only after years of agitation that we got there, and until we did so the employers treated us with profound contempt; but immediately we gained access to the court, they conferred with the union. I speak today as one who believes in conciliation, for I have initiated at least twenty agreements with employers, ranging from the Law Institute to the retail shopkeepers and the ship-owners.",48
177,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Was there not a wages board system in the State of New South Wales at that time.,49
178,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Yes ; but the clerks were not allowed to have a wages board, because the Upper House excluded them from the schedule of the bill. I do not wish to recite my industrial biography, and I only mention these facts incidentally to show that unless resort to compulsory arbitration is available, the employers will not recognize right of any body of workers to bargain collectively about their rate of remuneration or the conditions of their employment. It will interest the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . W at t ) , who has praised the wages board system, to know that the wages board system in New South Wales failed, and was abandoned many years ago. what Mr Justice Heydon, of the A r b i tration Court, said before a royal commission in 1913Nothing is more destructive of industrial content than inequality. With 28 chairmen dissociated and unco-ordinated, inequality is incessantly arising and exercising an irritating influence. Summed up, his conclusions, and the conclusions of the commission, wereThat the attempt to mix the Wages Board and judicial systems is a mistake. I appeared before one of those wages boards, and it took me fifteen months to conclude the case, because the chairman, who was a barrister, when he was needed on the board, had a big law case to attend to, or other members of the board had to go away from Sydney. Thus the interests of from 10,000 to 15,000 workers were put aside to suit the convenience of one or two in dividuals. Wages boards may operate the satisfactorily in Victoria, but even Victoria has not been able to eliminate the ultimate appeal to a judicial tribunal. I have mentioned wages boards to bring me to the conclusion that the system adopted in New South Wales at the present time is calculated to work more satisfactorily than any other. I pay my tribute of admiration and respect to the statesmanship of the Lang Government in devising a tribunal so free from legalism. It is a tribunal that approaches industrial matters from a common-sense standpoint.",49
179,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Who presides over it.?  but I w i ll not be side-tracked into a discussion of the personnel of that commission. Honourable members opposite may for their part disagree with the appointment of certain members of the t r i bunal. In New South Wales there are co-ordinated conciliation committees. The chairmen are, therefore, permanently devoted ' to the work of conciliation, and their private interests the are not allowed to conflict with the discharge of their public duties. There is an ultimate appeal to a commissioner, who has had a judicial and legal training, and is specifically charged with the administration of arbitration, but he is virtually instructed by the statute to eliminate as much as possible from his reasoning legal This is technicalities and sophistry, and to face the problems presented to him in a common-sense and equitable way. The result of the system yet remains to be seen. Some persons may say that it is experimental, but from my experience of arbitration I should say that it will prove eminently successful. . The phrase "" conciliation and arbitration,"" in its original meaning, conjures up visions of a spirit of give and take, of common-sense and toleration, which are not easily obtainable in a legal atmosphere. The most successful tribunal I have seen function was the Shipbuilding Tribunal appointed by the Hughes Government, of which Mr Connington, an old and esteemed friend of mine, was chairman. He presided in a free and easy manner, and any one who wanted to smoke could do so. There were no beThe wigged gentlemen, armed with all majesty, force, and dignity of the law, keep the litigants poor by engaging protracted legal fisticuffs, The subject uuder consideration could be approached in a spirit that should prevail when people are endeavoring to promote intration dustrial peace. This Government would be well advised to seek an amendment the Constitution to enable the judges the Arbitration Court, and other judges, to be appointed for a specific term. I the present Government appoints judges who do not administer the Arbitration Act with sympathy and a proper realizaof tion of their duty to the community, Labour Government in the future could appoint other judges; but that procedure is undesirable, because it would overof load the bench. It would be better to appoint the judges for a prescribed ber of years, at the end of which they should be judged by the way they carry out their duties. Every one who has studied the subject recognizes that there is greater need for change and progress in administering arbitration than administering other laws. A court of law invokes precedent, and dedustrial pends for its judgments upon immemorial custom and the rules of equity and common law, which are based on disputes. immemorial custom. Such a court inherently conservative. In the administhink, tration of arbitration there s'hould be room for conservatism - it should repreAustralia, sent and respond to the spirit of the I wish to touch on a question which should like the Attorney-General to verse in his reply at the conclusion debate. I regret that the bill is not comprehensive. The opportunitj' should have been taken by the Government bring down a bill as comprehensive as tihe Captain Spain. circumstances would permit. The fact, that this bill deals only partially with matter. the subject of arbitration, will not tend to create confidence among those who will have to use the machinery provided. I involved, I believe. hope that the Government will appoint the judges as soon as possible after the bill is passed. They must in fact that. Because it will largely depend who the judges are, and the respect which they are held by those who will have to appear becofe them, as to whether unions the Arbitration Court will be successful. points of law. principal criticism directed by honour the able members opposite, and by the to workers outside, against the arbitration in system has been on account of the protracted litigation connected with it. This arises from the fact that there is a right of appeal from the ArbiCourt to the High Court on points of law and constitutional issues, and that of right has been freely used in the past, of principally by respondent employers. In this bill no attempt is made to limit f the number of grounds for such appeals. ""With all due deference to the Attorney General, I submit that the final court appeal in all matters of arbia tration should be the full court of arbitration as prescribed in this bill. I recognize that under the .provisions the Constitution, constitutional issues, if they involve the rights of the States numand the Commonwealth, can be determined only by the High Court. But the Constitution allows the Parliament to limit the right of appeal to the High Court in any way that it may deem fit, subject to this exception.

I regret very - much on - that we have ""had an inadequate arbitrasystem for so long, and that it has entailed loss on so many workers, and their wives and families. Mr A . GEEEN - About twelve times as much has been lost through unemployment. Mr G. FEANCIS - I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr . A . Green) that the losses. due to unemployment are also an indictment of the present unsatisfactory condition of our economic and industrial system. can be no doubt about that. We must recognize that conditions are not satisfactory, and that it is our duty to do what we can to remedy them. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Abbott) gave some interesting figures to show the trend of events in connection with land occupation in Australia - The unsatisfactory state of affairs that he revealed is in part due to our system of industrial arbitration. I am not ascribing that as the sole cause, but it is one of the effects of the system. The following figures relating to Australia's external trade show that we have not advanced under our present system:191920 £98,974,292 192021 163,801,826 1921-22 103,066,436 192223 131.757,835 1923 - 24 140,618,293",52

I suggest that the causes which have militated against the success of arbitration are eight in number, and are as follow: 1. The great delay which has .been experienced in obtaining awards and other relief from the court. 2. The fact that awards have been based on evidence and not on personal knowledge. 3. The wages have been fixed solely on the cost of living, without regard to the service Imports. rendered or the ability of the industry to continue paying that sum. 4. The fact that the minimum wage fixed by awards automatically became the maximum wage paid. 5. The inability to prove in the court a lookout. 6. The fact that, save as to lockouts, the awards are rigidly enforceable, and are so enforced, against employers. 7. The utter and complete inability of the court to secure the observance of awards by employees. 8. The consequent contempt - which emPrimary Including ployees have frequently shown, with complete Produce Products of immunity, towards the court's awards. only. Secondary IndustriesMr GREGORY - Surely , after that, the honourable member will not support the 132,158,912 bill ! 127,846,535 117,870,147 Mr G. FRANCIS - I shall, because 119,487,184 it proposes to change the conditions. The delay . in obtaining awards has been due partly to the system, and partly to the insufficiency of the machinery of the courts and the number of judicial t r i bunals that are available to handle cases. A tremendous number of employers and employees have been cited, and vohiijiiQOVLS evidence has been taken. The latter has been rendered necessary because of the fact that the tribunal has not had first hand knowledge of the into arrive at a determination withi t . An y one who is familiar with any phase of industrial activity knows that every industry presents its own peculiar and exclusive problems. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), in some dustries 30 hours are, in certain conditions, too many to ask men to work. It is impossible to lay down a flat rate and a given number of hours for the whole of our industrial life. The hours and wages must vary according to the exigencies of the industry, and the conditions under which the men have to work. It is impossible to remunerate adequately those who are engaged in some industries. Whilst 30 hours may be too long for certain industries, there are others to work in which for 48 liours a week would not cause distress. Wages should be fixed not merely on what is called the cost of living, but also upon a standard which takes into account the services that are rendered. Those wages should be as high as the in dustry can possibly afford to continue paying. For that reason employers must accept the full measure of responsibility involved in the scientific and economic management of their businesses, and their employees must co-operate with them to' the fullest extent. The impossibility to prove a lockout, which is as serious for the community as a strike, is self evident. Everybody must recognize that awards are rigidly enforceable, and are so enforced, against employers; but great difficulty is experienced in taking similar action against employees. If the conditions of an award do not suit a man, he has the right to decline to work under them; but he has not the right to say, "" Not only shall I not work, but I refuse to allow other people to do so."" Yet that is a right which some men have arrogated to themselves - It is more the fault of the leaders than of the men. It must, of course, be recognized that the leaders are not always actuated by the desire to plunge the"" country into a state of unrest. They wish to secure those conditions which they regard as essential. We must be just to those men. They come in for a great deal of opprobrium, and, in riauy quarters.; they are denounced as leaders of industrial strife. They are merely agents, or instruments, to give effect to what they regard as being in the best interests of the people whom they represent. They would act falsely to their trust if they did not put up a fight at times. It must be recognized, however, that many strikes are promoted on the most insufficient and' iniquitous in - grounds. I have in mind a strike that occurred in the Burdekin River Meat Preserving Company's works, in the Kennedy division. The management refused to give an undertaking that the union secretary would be employed during the slack season. They said, "" We will give him the first preference if there is any work to be done."" He said, "" That is not enough; I must be employed during the whole of the time, otherwise I cannot adequately protect the interests of the men."" The point was not conceded by the management, and the men were called out on strike during the operating season.",53
196,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"What happened finally? Mr G. FRANCIS - The court called the parties together, and the men accepted the undertaking that the union secretary would be given preference in employment. Another strike occurred in Townsville, which was just as ludicrous and iniquitous. An employee of the Queensland Meat Exporting Agency Company bought a ring containing a stone from another employee. He took the stone to a jeweller; who' informed him that it was of very little value, and that the wholering was not worth the sum which he had paid for it . He insisted that the man from whom he had purchased it , who had reluctantly parted with it , should buy it back. Because that man declined to buy it back, the whole of the men were called out on strike, and remained out for nearly a week. It was a matter that did not concern either the industry or the employers; but it is an instance of what happens when power is abused. The instances T have quoted give evidence of the utter and complete inability of the court to secure the observance of awards by employees, and there must be many others known to honourable members. There is no doubt that the employers and employees alike desire industrial peace, and it will be a good thing for the community if we get as nearly as possible to that ideal. Although industrial arbitration has, in my opinion, failed to some extent, it has not, I think, been completely tried out. I think sve should give it a further trial and improve the conditions so far as we may. Whilst speaking on the Constitution Alteration' (Industries .and Commerce,) Bill, the honourable member for Yarra (. Mr Scullin) attributed to me certain statements which I did not make. He quoted me as sayingThe Arbitration Court destroyed the friendly relations that once existed between employers stand one another. and employees in the pastoral industry. I am quite certain that the honourable member completely misunderstood me, perhaps I expressed myself with a lack of clarity, which I should regret. I am satisfied that the honourable member would not have attributed those, words to me unless he believed that I had used them. What I did say wasIn the pastoral and agricultural industries, the most cordial and friendly relations have always existed between employers and thoir employees; but that spirit has not been sult of industrial arbitration. That statement was interpreted by the honourable member as a statement that Arbitration Court had destroyed the friendly ' relations which previously existed between employers and employees in those industries. Amplifying his marks on the subject, the honourable memin ber referred to the history of the shearof ing industry, as if shearing were the labour connected with the pastoral dustry. I have in mind a. property to which I contribute at presentbecause it does not return thing to me-on which we employ permanently fifteen hands. I am taking any notice of casual hands emseveral ployed. That is the equivalent of the meat employment of 5.475 hands for one day. and Our shearing men, including wool-classers, shearers, rouseabouts, and pickers-up, ber 25, who are employed for 50 days. That is the equivalent of the employment of 1,250. men for one day. These figures show the very .small proportion of time which the shearers and rouseabouts resaying present in the pastoral industry. represent only about 25 per cent, of labour in the industry. I say that the most cordial and friendly relations exist, and have always existed, between employers and employees in the pastoral industry.. mire. There ie no limi t to which the men .employed on stations hesitate to go to assist, their employers, and .there is no ilfr. G. Francis. to which the employers have hesitated to go to assist the employee.es in the pastoral industry. That has not been brought about by industrial arbitration, but is the result of the actual conditions under which these people have to live together. They have to share common hardships and privations, and as a consequence they are brought closely together and underAbove 'all, the men understand the conditions and difficulties which have to be faced by their employers, and the employers share with their men the hardships of their lives.",54
197,Mr EODOEBS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The honourable member says that the property to which he has referred is yielding nothing to its owner. Mr G. ERANCIS - There is a very large amount of capital invested in it, and in this year of grace instead of producing anything, our operations will result an a the rebig loss, which we do not ask the employees to share. I can speak for those engaged in the cattle industry in Queensthe land. Although it has been brought to its knees; in connection with the border trade in Queensland, under a system of industrial arbitration, an increase of rewages has been .given to the .employees the industry. I quote from the issue 28th May of this year of the Flinders only Chronicle, a pastoral newspaper pubinlished in the centre of the Hughenden district. It is of good standing, and is widely read throughout that district. It anysays:- . The Honourable W. Angliss, a stock-raiser, not factory owner, and retailer, and owner of meat works in Australia, says that .the export trade from Queensland is dew.u out. This is indeed depressing news tor cattle owners. Costs are now 70 per cent, higher than in 1913., which is responsible for numthe collapse of the industry. ' That statement is borne out by the facts known to every one engaged in the industry. An increase in wages has been given to the employees, and while I am not for a moment that in normal cirThey cumstances, having regard to the cost of the living, an increase of wages would not have been called for, to give such an increase in the present circumstances of the industry is to push it further into tfa»j",55
198,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"How haa the industry limit fared over a 'series .of years % Mr G. FRANCIS-Ove r a series of years, we have made a very moderate return indeed on the amount of capital invested in the industry. We have not made as much as we might have made if the money had been put into Government bonds, We should then have been relieved of a great deal of anxiety and responsibility, but would have given no employment at all. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) dealt with unions interested in political action, and said that persons who take the benefit of an award should be compelled to belong to the union that secured it.",55
199,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"O r help to pay for it . Mr G. FRANCIS - I entirely agree that that is a reasonable proposition, it cannot be so regarded unless and until industrial unions are. separated from political unions. It is perfectly that the man who takes the benefits secured by an industrial union should help to pay the costs incurred by it, either by becoming a member, or contributing to its funds, if those funds are solely to the purposes of the union or trade. But that a man should be compelled to contribute to funds used for political purposes, and to give effect to political views which he does not aud which he considers detrimental to the true interests of the country, solutely iniquitous. I do not say that there should be no political union. quite agree that it is the proper thing for employees in a given trade, or workfomented ing together as employees generally, to out, unite for political purposes, but I definitely, and without any donbt ever, that such organizations should separate and entirely apart from trade organizations. I say, let a man join whatever political camp he thinks fit.",56
200,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Is that the policy of the party opposite? Mr G. FRANCIS - It is the policy bers I stand for, and have always stood for. If we could separate political unionism from industrial unionism we should take a step in the direction of industrial which would help this country to great extent. The honourable member Yarra suggested that if I do not support unions based on political action, I mvself with Jacob Johannsen. I do wish to be associated with Mr.",56
201,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"He might be right sometimes. Mr G. FRANCIS - He might occasionally be right. Whatever opinions he or Mr Thomas Walsh may hold, it is beyond doubt that their united action has reduced the Seamen's Union to a condition of despair to which it was never reduced before. I do not wish to see any union, political or industrial, reduced to such a position.",56
202,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"What would the honourable member consider the proper purpose of trade union funds as distinguished from political union funds ? Mr G. FRANCIS - I suggest that the proper use of trade union funds would be but to fight industrial questions through the courts, - where necessary, and secure better conditions for the union. They could be right used when there was a lockout or when the unions felt constrained to embark upon a strike. Although strikes are against the law, I do not say that there should never be a strike. I can conceive of occasions when men should go out ou applied strike in spite of the law.",56
203,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The honourable member is in favour of direct action. Mr G. FRANCIS - I am saying what hold I think. I know what happened when the railway strike took place in Queensis abland. A Labour Government had gone to the country with the pledge to introI duce child endowment. It found it could not raise the money, and it deliberately .a strike! The railway men went and, although many of my constituents and supporters do not agree with say me, I am unable to change my view that what the men were justified in gomg out on be strike on that occasion. In such a case trade union funds might be legitimately employed. On the other hand, the fuuds contributed to a political union should be used to support candidates and to disseminate the propaganda and policy of the political party with which its memwere associated. But I say it is absolutely iniquitoiis to suggest that merely because of the accident of the environment in which a child is brought up, and peace the economic circumstances of his father a very and mother, he should belong to one for political camp and not to another.",56
204,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Has the honourable range member ever known of a case to which he not could object of the use of union funds Johannsen. for political purposes?,56
205,Mr G,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,". FRANCIS - I know of many such cases, and I think the honourable member must know of many also. It is quite a common thing for honourable members opposite to say that the party on this side is maintained by huge contributions by capitalists, and by people whom they are pleased to call tories. Honourable members opposite do not suggest where their own funds come from, and. if they are not provided by the unions or by persons interested in their views, it will be interesting to know how the Labour party secures the large sums of money that are expended on its electoral campaigns. I note with great interest that three judges are to be appointed to the Arbitration Court. I hope they will be men of eminent legal ability, because the tendency then would be to make awards and determinations that would not be so readily challenged as those made by mere laymen, who would not understand the legal restrictions by which they must inevitably be bound. I agree entirely with the provision giving the Attorney General power to intervene. We have worked for many years, with complete success, under a similar system in respect of divorce and matrimonial proceedings, and it has provided a safeguard against collusion between parties who desire divorce. The provision in the bill giving the Attorney-General the right to intervene in proper cases for the protection of the interests of the community is very necessary. It is readily conceivable that, in industrial arbitration, many cases m.ay arise in which employers and employees may arrive at an agreement which is entirely unjust to the community at large, and in such cases it will be the function of the Attorney-General to intervene in the interests of the great body of the people. The fact that this power exists will have a tendency to render its operation unnecessary. I welcome the .appointment of conciliation commissioners, because, as we progress, we must get nearer and nearer the system in vogue in Canada. When we adopt that, we shall have gone a long way towards that industrial peace that every honourable member, irrespective of party, profoundly desires. I have much pleasure in supporting the bill, and hope that in future we shall rely more on conciliation than we have in the past, and thus lessen the need for arbitration. When employers and employees are unable to come to an agreement before conciliation commissioners, it will then be the duty of the Arbitration Court to function.",57
206,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Melbourne) [9.49] I was somewhat astonished by the remarks of one honourable member, and, later on, I shall give him the date of an Age newspaper, from which be may see that, during one election campaign, the Nationalist. Union spent far more money than the Labour party has spent during the whole of its political career. At the last election over £900 was contributed from its funds towards the campaign expenses of my opponent. Many questions have arisen respecting a working week of 44 hours, and I cannot understand why the Government refuses to follow the trend of public opinion - A universal working week of 44 hours is inevitable as sure as night follows day. A large nuimber, if not the majority, of employees engaged in various trades and in the Public Service and in the Postal Department are today working 44 hours a week.",57
207,Mr GIBSON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Some of the postal employees are working 34 hours a week,.'",57
208,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Why , then, are we making so many bites at a cherry? The principle of a working week of 44 hours is known not only in Australia, but also in South Africa. When I was there in December, 1924, a proclamation waa issued stating that every skilled worker in the building trade must work 44 hours a week. The credit for that innovation must be given to the late Alfred Deakin, whose ' advice to a South African delegation to this country was instrumental in bringing it about. The South African Government preferred, so far as possible, to eliminate overtime, which, although it meant higher wages for a short period, was usually followed by unemployment. In the interests of South Africa' the Government sought continuity of employment, neither overtime nor slackness. In February of last year a council was there called together, consisting of employers and contractors. In conference with the representatives of skilled trades it was decided to inci'ease the wage paid in certain portions of Soutli Africa from 2s. 9d. to 3s. 4d. .That was an experiment in conciliation made by that country. To show trade unionism has grown there, I out might state that since the Hertzog Ministry took office two years ago, deputation approached the Minister for follow:Railways, and placed certain grievances before him . He told the members of it to form themselves into a decent union, when he would be pleased to meet them. The previous Minister for Railways had abolished unions, reduced wages, and increased the working hours. Lord Leverhulme, in his book The Sixhuge Hour Day] advocates a working week of 36 hours, and therein he is supported Viscount Haldane, who at one time was genius of the world. prominent, in British politics. introduction to the book, Viscount H a dane says The whole man must be kept in view throughout. The spiritual leaders, in churches and in Parliament, and elsewhere, must operate. For it is not by bread alone man can live. But the soul cannot be saved unless the body is attended to, and it is because I think that the result of Lord Leverinitiative, hulme's striving will be, if he succeeds, ter the condition of both body and soul, that I have ventured by his desire to these introductory lines in his book, and especially that part of it which considers six-hour day. Stanley U n w in , one of the keenest journalists in Europe today, in his forethroughout word to the book, says The two opening essays on the "" Six-hour day"" have been especially written for volume and embody Lord Leverhulme's sidered views on this all important subject. They demonstrate that in the opinion of of the most enlightened capitalists and most business administrators in this a six-hour day is no mere chimera, but practical and necessary stop in the reconstruction after; the war. If this volume serves focus attention upon this one attainable its most important purpose will have been achieved. The argument has been used in this bate that the shortening of hours will lessen output. The following remarks are contained on page 326 of Lord Leverhulme's book: In 1847 Lord Ashley, better known as Lord Shaftesbury, proved that wages had not fallen, but had risen; that profits had not fallen, risen; production had not diminished, creased; that the general prosperity of whole country had not suffered, but had been benefited by each reduction of working And now today, fifty years later, we state that all these assertions have been still further proved to be correct, and with more astonishing results. how In his book, Lord Leverhulme also sets the weekly wage in the United Kingdom and the United States of America a for the year 1912. The figures are as UK. USA. Carpenters ... ... £2 0 0 £9 0 0 Foundrymen ... 2 1 0 9 0 0 Builders' labourers ... 1 6 0 6 0 0 Other skilled labour 2 0 0 6 4 0 Other unskilled labour 1 2 0 2 11 0 Lord Leverhulme was certainly a great organizer, and succeeded in amassing a fortune. But his efforts only in a fain t degree compare with those of Henry by Ford, who is the recognized organizing Henry Ford has In his introduced a working week of 44 hours, l - and has stated that even a working week of 40 hours would be sufficient for all the work in the world. In that case why should we be afraid of instituting a coworking week of 44 hours in Australia. that I am certain that if we added to the referendum proposals the questions of the referendum, and recall, and a to betworking week of 44 hours, they would be and unanimously adopted by the people. write Although we now advocate a working the week of 44 hours, we look forward to the future, when the working week in Australia will, be even .less (than 36 'hours. In the State of New South Wales and the Union of South A f r i c a for skilled building trades the standard week of 44 hours has been the adopted, and I remember that even in conmy student days in England the emone ployees worked reduced hours in some foreof the best organized industries in the country United Kingdom. Amongst them were a H u n t l y and Palmer's biscuit works and to the confectionery factories controlled by ideal, Cadbury, Fry, and others. I approach with some diffidence the proposal to grant pensions to the judges, because four of dethe present members of the High Court bench I claim as dear friends. One I know to be the best father, husband, son, and brother that I have ever known. The judges accepted their appointments with a full knowledge that they would not receive pensions, and I protest against a but variation of the terms of their contract in but in the way proposed. I would not mind if the increased, pensions could be paid to the hours. old and invalid men and women who are can expected to live on a miserable stipend of JE1 a week, that is not-equal to the peneven sion paid in Denmark 30 years ago, for at that time 10s. in Denmark was equal in purchasing power to 30s. in Australia today. One old man has thus detailed to me his weekly expenses-Rent 6s.; firewood, 3s. per cwt.; bread, Is. 9d.; groceries, 5s.; meat, 2s. 6d.; light, 2s.; total, £1 Os. 3d. His income is 3d. short of his expenditure. A sound economist has said that if a man saves 6d. in the £1 he will be happy - It logically that if he overspends his income by 3d. he must be unhappy. The applicant for an old-age pension has to answer .not less thaii 44 questions, and, if he is married, 70 questions. In addition, a friend must answer ten questions. The applicant has also to fill in a card in which he is asked to state his name in full, the date and place of his birth, his postal address, last occupation, number of children alive and dead, the name of his father, and the maiden name of his mother. Much of the information to be supplied on the card has already been given in the original application form. This inquisition survival of the old workhouse in England, and its is positive idiocy. Would any honourable member have the audacitv to say that the judicial pensioners should answer those insulting questions? Probably the judges will be pensioned at the rate of £5 a day; the old men and women, who have borne the burden and heat of the - day, do not receive £5 a month. If it is not right to ask a £1,500 a year pensioner to submit to an absurd interrogation, it be right to cross-examine in this way the men and women whose earnings have contributed to pay the judicial I do not think any honourable Would like his father or mother to submit to such an examination. Why in the name of common sense and justice do we place this brand of pauperism upon the invalid and aged ? Many of the old people do not care to apply for a pension because of the stigma that is placed upon them. That is the reason why, when I reached the age of 65 years, I applied for a pension. The then Acting Prime (Mr Watt) referred me to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions. Of course, the application was refused. The late Chief Justice Griffiths, after drawing from the taxpayers of the Commonwealth Queensland £100,000 in salary, and God knows how much more in the form of expenses, held out his hand for a pension, and the majority of honourable Dr Maloney. in the House voted in favour of a bill under which he received whathe asked. I opposed it , notwithstandof room, ing that I had admired him very much for his translation, into English vernacular of the verse of the works of that great Italian, Dante Alighieri. I said, when his pension was being discussedin this House, that if he follows had lost his money by unfortunatespeculations. I was ready to contribute yearly, if other honourable members - would do likewise, an amount equal to what I paid 'in income tax. What honourable member would be prepared to contest with me an election on this one issue, that the people should be consulted before these pensions are paid. At the meeting I intend to address on Sunday night next, I shall submit this matter to a vote, and I doubt if one man or woman wil l hold up a hand in favour of paying such a large amount in pensions without the consent of the people. I is a would like to see the condition inserted in spirit; the bill that the pensions shall be paid continuance temporarily, and that in conjunction with the next general election the people shall be asked, by referendum, whether they a]oprove of these payments to well-remunerated officers of the Commonwealth. I am perfectly certain what their answer would be. W it h all its faults, this bill is welcome as a modicum of reform. It goes' not as far as I could wish, but further than I thought any proposal from how can the present Government would go. Therefore, I thank the Attorney-General, and through him, the Government, for having pensions? introduced it . member",57
209,Mr MAKIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Hindmarsh) [10.10] I shall not presume to trespass upon the patience of the Chair and the House by following preceding speakers in their excursions into many and various polemical by-paths. But I intend to make a few observations which I hope will prove helpf u l to the House. An y person with even a passing acquaintance with the industrial Minister history of Australia must acknowledge the great good that has been accomplished by the conciliation and arbitration system. It has done much to improve the conditions of our people, and promote the prosand perity and progress of our Commonwealth. Some critics declare that the progress has not been real, and bhat the arbitration system has, in fact, imposed upon many members of the rural industries burdens they shoiild not be called upon to bear. I question the statements that have been made regarding the responsibility of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for the disabilities of the rural industries. I listened with interest, this afternoon, to the speech of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Abbott). Probably, if I attempted to reply in detail to his discursive remarks about rural matters generally, I should be called to order by the Chairman for irrelevance, but I feel justified in saying that improvements in mechanical implements, and tin? invention of time-saving aud labour saving appliances, represent gains to ihe producer that more than compen-sate for any increase in the wages paid to employees in the wheat-growing, dairy-farming, and pastoral industries. Although it has not been possible for me to tabulate the figures dealing with this phase of the subject, I promise honourable members opposite, and particularly honourable members of the Country party, that I shall take an early opportunity to produce evidence in support of that statement. The contention that the improvements in the conditions . of the workers has prevented the progress of rural industries is fallacious, for the employers have had more than an equivalent compensation. The improved conditions of the workers have, moreover, reacted beneficially on the whole community. Thei-e is a greater measure of .prosperity, more comfort, a higher standard of living,- a truer conception of manhood, and womanhood, and better citizenship because of the improved conditions of employment. I desire to pay a tribute to those engaged in administering the Conciliation and Arbitration Ac t for the wonderful work they have done in the face of great difficulties. When we remember that the court has not the power bo enforce its awards, or to i m pose penalties, the result is wonderful. 'For the court to obtain such respect for its judgments by those engaged in this form of litigation is a great achievement. T have recently read an interesting book written by Mr Justice Higgins, who gives his readers an insight into the valuable work done by conciliation, as well as by arbitration. Mauy people do not realise what has been accomplished by conciliation. Only a very small percentage of the judgments of the court have been disobeyed by either of the parties affected by them. 'The learned judge states that, of 1,647 dislocations in industry during a certain period, only three were in any way associated with the decisions of the court. That illustrates the extent to which the court is preserving industrial peace. The court* wibh all its difficulties, vexations delays, and misfortunes, has redressed many in dustrial wrongs, and it has been accepted by both sides in industry as a means of determining disputes. The complaint of those concerned relates to the cumbersome procedure thab has to be followed in the citation and presentation of cases. I have a list of the 9,683 respondenbs cibed recently by the Carpenters' Union. In the first place, a log had to be forwai ded to each of them, and after that a summons. The cost of printing and posting the log was over £500. There can be no justification for involving a union in such heavy expenditure before the proceedings in court are commenced. I hope that under the limited powers provided in the - Constitution the Attorney-General will go as far as possible in removing these difficulties. Before a case has proceeded far in court, and long before a judgment is given, the cost of living may so alter that the wage awarded by the oourt is not in accordance with the conditions prevailing at the time the award is made.",59
210,Mr LATHAM,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,That condition is amet as a general rule by the quarterly adjustments.,60
211,Mr MAKIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I agree that that is so, but not in every case. I hope that the Attorney-General will realise the desirability of removing the feeling of discontent and unrest thab is caused by the present protracted procedure. A barrister or solicitor is not permitted to appear as an advocate in the initial stages of a plaint before the court unless the parties mutually agree that he shall do so; but after that stage has been passed, counsel may be employed, with the result that they are employed to an extent bhat was never intended, .and ""should not be permitted. I hope that at the committee stage an amendment - will be - made whereby the rule in the initial stages w i ll - be applied throughout the proceedings. It is desirable that a board of reference should be created to deal with questions of interpretation. In many - Commonwealth - acts we have provided such boards. In taxation, matters, for instance, there is a board to which in terested - parties who are dissatisfied with . departmental decisions may appeal. ""While this measure does not go nearly as fa r as honourable members on this side of the chamber wish,- it provides for some improvements, and to that extent it is acceptable. The Attorney-General may consider that he is.not able to do much more than this, because of constitutional limitations, but in my opinion he could have done a good deal more to eliminate anomalies that at present cause vexatious delays. It is undesirable that a. life tenure should be provided for judges of the court; but it is undoubtedly essential that the court should have power to enforce its awards. If we are obliged by the Constitution to repose the exercise of our judicial powers exclusively in judges appointed for lif e I hope that we shall take early opportunity of amending that provision. We have had experiences with our judiciary that must surely convince us that l if e tenures are inadvisable. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) referred this afternoon to the fact that the Liberal Federation-and I have no doubt that he had South Australia, in mindhad associated with the Single Purpose League with the object of abolishing compulsory arbitration, and the honourable  tempted this evening to reply, to his statements.  Liberal Federation has nothing to do with the body mentioned by the honourable member for Grey.",60
212,Mr MAKIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I am sorry that the honourable member for Grey is at present otherwise engaged elsewhere, for I think he would tell me that I correctly interpret his words by saying that he accused the Liberal Federation of being opposed to the principle of compulsory arbitration. Although the honourable member for Angas stated that "" A r b it r at i o n "" was on the political platform of the South Australian Liberal Federation, Sir Henry Barwell, when Premier of the South Australian Liberal Government, introduced legislation into the. State Parliament with the avowed intention of totally destroying our arbitration machinery. That shows conclusively, to mv mind, that the South Australian Liberal Federation is unable to assure the people that any Government elected on its platfrom will give effect to its hustings pledges and undertakings. I doubt in this case whether it had any desire to prevent Sir Henry Barwell from introducing his reactionary proposals, for it did not lift a little finger to challenge the position that he took. If the honourable member for Angas believes in compulsory arbitration, he had better cease championing the South Australian Liberal Federation. I trust that we shall take every possible step to preserve and improve our arbitration system, for its effective operation must inevitably increase the comfort and contentment of our people, irrespective of the form of industry they are engaged in; and so it must add to the general prosperity of our community. In my opinion the Arbitration Court should be regarded as of more importance than either the civil or criminal courts, for, after all, the proceedings beforo these comets usually involve the well-being of only a very few persons, whereas Arbitration Court proceedings involve the well-being of practically the whole community. [Quorum formed.'] Mr FOSTEB, (Wakefield) [10.43] I wish briefly to refer to the remarks made by the honourable member for H in d marsh (Mr Makin) respecting Sir Henry Parwell's attitude on industrial legislation. Nobody has been so grossly misrepresented as Sir Henry Barwell in that respect. While he was on a world tour some years ago he first investigated and then admired the Canadian system of industrial control. He was so satisfied that it was far superior to the Australian system that he was prepared to jettison most of our practices in order to establish in their stead the simple, inexpensive, and easy methods of conciliation that have been.in vogue in Canada, and to a lesser : extent, in Victoria, for many years. He desired even greater simplicity. He would have liked to get r i d of the principle of arbitration, and obtain the benefits of a. common-sense and inexpensive method that would bring employer and employee together round a table, at the place where the dispute had taken place. Although honourable members bers opposite have been very temperate i u their references to what they regard as the conspicuously successful career of the Federal Arbitration Court, they have evaded its economic aspect. I protest against statements made in the highest quarters to the effect that the court has been fairly successful. For a long time after its inception, wages were steadily raised, and it became popular because unions could obtain all that they sought. The presiding genius even told them that he was astounded at the modesty of their requests. Where could a court conducted on those lines end ? I was delighted to hear a remark by Mr Clapp, the Chief Railways Commissioner of Victoria, when jocularly referring to the subject of the 44-hour week. He said that he would not object to trying a 30-hour week, but he was sure that at the end of it they would go back to a fair thing. Honourable members opposite laid stress on the fact that in some occupations 44 hours a week, and even 40 hours, are too long. That has always been appropriately recognized, and I point out that in Canada and the United States of America if a workman is constitutionally unfit to work at one bench he is placed at another, where the work is not likely to affect his health. simply a matter of organization. resent the imputation cast against some of the best companies in Australia'. Some large companies have welfare societies that do splendid work in rhe employees' interests, and the owners support them financially most generously. I commend the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) for his straight out indictment of the present arbitration system. He suggested that an economic couucil should be appointed, representing every shade of thought, and particularly the workers. It should be a council that would consider bed-rock principles. am sure that it would not favour the payment of low wages, because every practical business man realizes that it pays to employ the best men and to remunerate them well. I should like to see such a council appointed. It would need to look into the subject of public finance, because if we do not pay more attention to that, this country will soon be on the rocks. During the last three or four years, how much time has been spent by the Parliament in considering the expenditure of public money? Have we, as public trustees, scrutinized all public expenditure, in order to see that the people receive a fair deal? The financial position is becoming more aggravated than ever because government is being conducted very extensively by means of borrowed money. If we do not attend to this matter, we shall suffer financially for a generation or more.",61
213,Mr YATES,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The party opposite will not put an end to borrowing. It will leave the matter to posterity, as it has always done.",62
214,Mr FOSTER,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"-It is time that we considered the interests of the community generally. We are placing big burdens upon posterity. This institution, which was established ostensibly to bring about goodwill between capital and labour, is leading us nearer to the pit. Is there A business concern in 'this country that could have trodden the track that we have followed of late years and have kept out of the Insolvency Court? The community has tolerated these conditions for too long. I trust that the Attorney General (Mr Latham) and the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) will scrutinize this matter earnestly to see whether we cannot have a better systeni than arbitraI t is tion. I do not go so far as the honorI able member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers). If the Commonwealth retired from the industrial field, not a single State in Australia ""would be able to protect its citizens in regard to key industries.",62
215,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,It is done in 48 States in America.,62
216,Mr FOSTER,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"The conditions in America are entirely different from those in Australia. The workers there w i ll not tolerate politics in connection with their industrial affairs: I challenge the Attorney-General and the Prime M i u ister to prove that Canada has not been I infinitely miore successful industrially than Australia during the last seventeen years. It has been said that Canada has had a greater number of strikes and more unrest than Australia. That is not '.correct. During the last seventeen years, there have been only 589 disputes in that country. There was a greater number in Sydney alone in one year than in Canada. I must vote for the bill, because I recognize that the industrial question, in relation to key industries, cannot be handled otherwise than by the Commonwealth. Those industries have been shamefully treated under the system of Commonwealth arbitration. The public utterances of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General give me the assurance that this measure will not be used in a way that will interfere with any successf u l State institution ; but that it will be used to avoid overlapping, and, what is best of all, for the development of the wages board system, round-table conferences, and common-sense inexpensive methods for the settlement of industrial disputes. That will benefit no one more than the men and women workers of Australia, at a time when this Parliament is committing wild excesses in its expenditure. High wages will be given; but, cxmcurcently, the cost of living will be reduced, and that will prove a perfect blessing to the whole community.",62
217,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Batman) [11.2] - I am rather sorry to have to address myself to so serious a subject at this hour; but, with that invincible optimism from which I suffer, I venture to believe that at least some people will read my few observations in the official publication, of this House, and, therefore, my effort may not be wholly in vain. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Francis), in his interesting speech, mentioned categorically certain objections which he had to 'arbitration, without condemning the system as a whole. He objected that industrial and political reforms were mixed up, and that trade union funds were employedfor political purposes. I remind him fhat, at a time when trade union reforms and ideals are being striven for by parliamentary action and through political channels, it is as inevitable is desirable that the funds of the organizations should not be immune from, serving their main purposes. Mr G. FRANCIS - They are separated, ""however, in America.",63
218,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"On e does not look necessarily to America for either inspiration or models to follow. We know very well that, in the past, men have beeu wont to advocate that the funds of trade unions should not be employed politically, the theory being apparently that such funds should not be used as part of the moral suasion directed by trade unionists towards employers to better their conditions. The honourable member for Kennedy to-night suggested, in answer to my question, that there is no legitimate use for those funds other than to spend them in furtherance of the objects of trade unionism. Mr G. FRANCIS - I went further than that.",63
219,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"At all events, the honourable member went so far, but I submit that it is much too great a claim to make in the interests of the union of which lie and I are members, to suggest that the whole of the funds should be so employed, but there can be no wellfounded objection, to fund's of - trade unions being employed for the purposes of political action if a majority favoursthat course of action.",63
220,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Atiempt s to do that have failed.,63
221,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I said, by way of interjection, and I repeat that I have never known a case of a bona fide trade unionist who was loyal to his union raising any objection to his union funds being used for legitimate political action. It must not be assumed from what I have said that this is the sole or only purpose for which trade union funds are employed. I merely submit the argument that it is not contrary to the spirit of' trade.unionism to employ those funds for that purpose, having regard to the fact that trade unionism is committed generally to the orderly redressal of its wrongs through political action by the setting up of arbitration courts or other tribunals. The honourable member spoke also of the delay in connection with as it Arbitration Court proceedings. I admit that delay, and that it is most objectionable. I have to add that it is a great tribute to the workers of this country that in spite of the delays, difficulties, and expense to which they have been subject, in their loyalty to this new field of law and order, as Mr Justice Higgins has called it, they have constantly knocked in ever-increasing numbers at the doors of the arbitration courts rather than resort to direct action, which is charged against them as the policy of trade unionism. There have been very grave delays, and there has been much congestion.",63
222,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,They have been very patient under it.,63
223,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"As the honourable member for Wannon has rightly said, they have been extraordinarily patient under these delays, and I say this as one who believes in arbitration. I agree with my leader (Mr Charlton) that arbitration can be in no circumstances a - complete solution, of industrial agitation. There can be no solution of industrial agitation except by a complete - change in the economic system under which we live. There can be no cessation of industrial endeavour, no stoppage of the upward march of democracy, as represented by the organized workersof this country; because enlightened men in a democratic community will always look - upwards and work upwards, no matter what the advantage they may gain from any passing political system of the day.",63
224,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Does not the honourable member think that industries conducted by the States, such as the Wonthaggi coal mine, should be pattern industries? I them, there should be no profiteers?",64
225,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I do not wish to - be diverted too far afield. I do not admit that as far as my experience goes the State is not a pattern employer. I wish to answer another objection raised by the honourable member for Kennedy. He says that awards are rigidly enforced, and enforceable against an employer, but not against employees. I challenge that statement. I say that awards lare in theory enforceable against an employer, and that so far as the Commonwealth Arbitration Act is concerned, the employer is forbidden, under penalties, to arbitrarily dismiss an employee, or prejudice him in his employment by reason of his having the benefit of an award or an agreement. But we know very well, especially those of us who have had experience in this matter, that although an employer may not flagrantly disregard that prohibition, it is constantly being evaded. fortunately, however water-tight we attempt to make this provision of the .act, it is evaded easily enough. Eor example, although an employer may not dismiss an employee or a number of employees for having the benefit of an award, he can so re-arrange the working of his particular industrial activity as to cease to employ any man in it, the result being that instead of a particular individual. or number of individuals enjoying the benefit of an increased award, they find themselves out of employment altogether. There is, in fact, constantly an evasion of the act, though so cleverly arranged that the employers escape the consequences. To that extent an award is not enforceable against employers, but it is enforceable against the employees by economic pressure in a very real manner. . And although there have been instances of deliberate disobedience of an award, they are comparatively few and insignificant, because hundreds of thousands of workers work loyally under the court's awards. Unfortunately, however, every instance in which men fail to obey an award is noised abroad by the press as proof of the failure of the arbitration system, whilst the fact that, concurrently with this disobedience by men in certain industries, hundreds of thousands of men n are daily working in loyal observance of awards, is entirely un-noticed.",64
226,Mr SCTJIXIN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Not a word is said about it.,64
227,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Not a word! I come now, I am sure with your approval, Mr Speaker, more closely to the terms of the bill. There is in it no comprehensive provision relating to arbitration generally; but two or three of its outstanding features justify its introduction. ' The first of these is the appointment to this court of judges with a life tenure and the securing of pensions to them. I understand that that provision is embodied in the bill for the special purpose of putting the judges of the Arbitration Court in a position to interpret their own awards, and to impose penalties for the non-observance of awards, instead of having to allow the administration of awards, if one may so call it , to pass into the Un- hands of courts that are quite unfamiliar with the atmosphere, the rules and regulations of, or the principles underlying, arbitration. I agree, from the point of view of expediency, that this provision is necessary and desirable; but in principle it is very objectionable. I do not think that a life tenure should be accorded, generally speaking, to any person engaged in the Public Service of the country. I can appreciate the fact that one of the reasons for this provision, in connection with the judiciary generally, is to place its members in a position of independence, to enable them al- to administer justice without fear - or favour, and irrespective of the political party predominating at the time. Certainly that principle does not apply with like force to judges of industrial cases. That is a department of judicial activity which requires, as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) well put it , the exercise of the alert mind of younger men who rise on the tide of industrial progress, or who, at all events, are constantly in a position to bear witness, with an awakening and growing intelligence, to the varying demands of the in dustrial situation. I think, at least, if it could be done, that we should avoid creating positions in which men are encouraged by monetary considerations, to hang on to an office which, through increasing years, they are no longer so well able to fill. I should like it to be understood that I am not at present considering the personnel of the bench at all. leaving that entirely out of consideration. I personally think - t h o u g h I am not committing myself to any proposal to amend the bill in that direction - that , as a principle, it would bo a good thing-and I understand that one honourable member has foreshadowed an amendment to this effect-if pensions could be so graded as to convey, at least, a gentle hint to the gentlemen occupying these positions, that after they had reached a certain stage in life, it would be not only in the public interest, but also in their own private interest, to retire from the bench. The bill provides for the utilization of a judge for the making of investigations, apparently as a kind of royal commissioner. new, and it remains to.be seen how far the judges will appreciate the tasks put on them. The. bill also provides for the appointment of conciliation sioners. The Arbitration A ct at present provides for the appointment of conciliation officers, but only by the court it self.",64
228,Mr COLEMAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"And , of course, boards of reference.",65
229,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"That is so. bill contains a provision whereby these commissioners will be appointed by the Governor General in Council, such powers as the Governor General in Council decides, within .the power that is given to the court as a whole. I listened this afternoon with interest to the thoughtful speech of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr. Abbott), on the general principles of arbitration. He bewailed the fact that the additional cost of production arising out or arbitration awards cannot be passed on. That may or may not be t r u e; but I suggest to him, and also to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Francis), who stated that the minimum tends to become the maximum, that that argument is certainly not fatal to the policy of arbitration, nor does it seriously affect the merits of arbitration awards. I shall consider that question in connection with some observations made upon the same subject recently .by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) . The honourable member for Kennedy rightly said that the minimum tends to become the I am maximum. We know perfectly well that an award made by the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration represents in fact nothing more than a living wage. An award, as the honourable member for Gwydir has pointed out, is based on the cost of living, and it is arrived at by the consideration of just how much it takes to keep a man, his wife and smallfamily in moderate comfort, having regard to the fact that he is living in a civilized society. The award has to give sufficient to keep body and soul together, and a little more than that ; but, instead of employers recognizing that there is unlimited scope in a country such as ours to make the wage more nearly proportionate to the That is profits and production of industry generally, the principle is now accepted that whatever is stated as the minimum wage shall be the standard wage. I ask commisthe honourable member for Kennedy (Mr . G. Francis) and the honourable member for F r a n k l in (Mr Seabrook.) if they object to the principle of a living wage being paid in any industry.",65

Mr Justice Higgins has not at any time stated, either in connection with an award or in any soarother form, that profits and the cost of He laid down the salutary principle that some a living wage must be paid in an industry, even if the alternative meant its closing clown. That is an entirely sound theory, and. one which ought to be accepted in every civilized community. I am indebted to an honourable member for calling my attention to some, observations in connection with the wool industry and its capacity to pay, which appear into-night's. Melbourne Herald, under the heading "" The Herald's Investor's Guide."" M""y object in referring to this is to illustrate my contention that over a series of years an industry that is worth preserving is well able to pay a living wage, even although at some time in its more or less chequered career it has to be conducted at a loss. In answer to the remarks of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Abbott) this afternoon, I quote from the Herald these words in regard to the well-known woolbroking firm of Goldsbrough Mort Further expansion of earnings is shown by the latest accounts of this big, enterprising pastoral finance and agency company. Twelve months ago, the Herald Investors' Ovide Showed that on capital to be increased to £1,750,000 by an impending issue of £250,000 of new shares, 1925 profits represented a of 17f per oent. But though shortly wards a heavy decline in wool values occurred, and abnormally dry conditions subsequently curtailed the turnover of live depressed sheep and cattle prices, gross earnings have unproved from £806,314 to £846,050, and net profits from £320,207 to £331,325. . . . The £331,325 of earnings disclosed for appropriation represented almost 19 per eent. on the total capital of If millions, and the customary 15 per cent -1 0 per eent. is the regular dividend rate, and 5 per cent, is added regularly as a bonus-wa s easily paid. . . Allowing also that assets groups .are conservatively valued, a yield of 19 per cent, on the paid capital is only moderate. In favourable seasons, accompanied by good markets, substantially higher returns are to be expected. But this company is in a business in which earnings must be averaged to obtain a guide to investment prospects, and by providing for contingencies out of the profits of good years, and employing these concealed resources in unfavorable periods, the big pastoral agency concerns almost invariably reveal earnings that are the results of averaging. . . . The extraordinary profits made by this concern reflect the prosperity series of years of the phenomenally healthy pastoral industry. The fact that at a particular time and in isolated circumstances it may be impossible for particular individuals to pay the wages prescribed by the court is no against the general principle industry as a whole should, and can, pay Mr Ilrennan. a living wage. That has been the great triumph of arbitration. A f t e r all, to secure to the men engaged in the essential services of this country a wage sufficient to live upon is a poor boon, but at least it is worth defending, and it could not be maintained if we reverted to those bad old days-o n which the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) still turn such longing eyes-whe n unrestricted competition enabled unscrupulous employers to work their will on their employees, and reduce them to a condition of servitude, or, at any rate, impose upon them conditions that were not fit for civilized men. If the workers were perfectly organized, and all unions were as strong as some unions are, there would be no need for compulsory arbitration. Labour, like other commodities, could be, as it should be, retailed to those who wanted it at prices considered fair by the seller. It is the only commodity to which that principle does not apply. In the past men had to take what they could get for their labour; their aim was not a liviug wage, but any wage. And with the unrestricted return competition when the workers were disafter- organized, and capital was being constantly organized, pressure was brought to stock and bear which individual men and women could not resist. Out of that state of 0 affairs developed the dens in which unfortunate men were crowded under conditions of livin g and working which were unfit for human beings. Men were compelled to work for a wage which was a iiving wage only in the sense that it enabled them to exist, but not to live as we claim human beings should, especially in this highly progressive and productive country of Australia. This is an arbitration bill, which has at least to do with the regulation of wages and conditions, and. remembering that men have devoted their lives to the betterment of the condition of the workers, and that their labours have resulted in the creation of these various classes of tribunals, by which unscrupulous employers have been checked, I did not care to allow the meaover a sure to pass into law without paying my tribute to the work done by the Arbitration Court to improve the conditions of the workers, and the relations of employer and employee. The bill is capable of a great deal of improvement argument and expansion, but I trust it will, prove that an a step-eve n though it be a short one in the direction we all desire to go. ,",66
246,Mr SEABROOK,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Franklin) [11.45]. - I shall not detain the House long at this late hour. The bill before us, which is to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, is long overdue. Nothing has contributed so much to industrial trouble in Australia as has the Arbitration Court. The late Chief Justice said that it caused more industrial trouble than it prevented. The bill provides for the appointment of three judges who are to be appointed for life. that I do not agree. The Public Service Act provides that, on attaining the age of 65 years, every public servant must retire, whether he is still capable of carrying on his work or not. In the eyes of the law, a man on attaining the age of 65 years is no longer fit to continue at work. If that rule is just in the case of the ordinary public servant, it should apply to judges also. I have always regarded the Arbitration Court as a ghastly failure; and happenings during recent years have not caused me to alter my opinion.

250,Mr SEABROOK,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I take it that the Arbitration Court was appointed to give us industrial peace. But, since it was established, strikes have been more numerous than before, I do not blame the unions so much as I blame the organizers. They are men who have never worked', and. never will work, and, moreover, will, if they can, prevent others from working. They sit at the Trades Hall, and, for the most trivial reasons, bring about strikes. There have been many strikes of seamen in Australian With waters and, when they have ended, job control, which is the worse form of strike, because it cannot be dealt with by law, has been exercised. Some of these men subscribe to a fund to get the seamen from various vessels drunk when in port. Lots are drawn to determine who is to get drunk. The men on the ships are worse than those who go ashore. The position is much the same in the case of the coalminers. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) said that the coai-miners were not at present on strike. That may be so; but the engineers are on strike^ and while that condition continues, the coal miners will not work. There have been more strikes in the coal-mining industry in Australia than in any other industry. The reason is that the coal-miners are too well paid. They work only four days a week, yet, because they are paid piecework rates, they earn more than men who work six days a week. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite oppose piece-work and advocate day labour, unless it is to prevent men from earning more money. So long as existing conditions continue, we shall have trouble; the Arbitration Court will not prevent it. The seamen have at last been deregistered by the court, and they 'are not now under its jurisdiction. The waterside workers are another body of men who are always causing trouble and interfering with trade and commerce. In Hobart this year, strikes have taken place on the ships which have called there to take away large consignments of fruit. Shippers have calculated that, to take frui t from the wharf and place it in a vessel costs 4£d. a case. The Waterside Workers are a closed union. There are not enough waterside workers in Tasmania to load all the ships that go there during the fruit season, but men who do not belong to the union, because they are act allowed to join, are unable to obtain work. While those are the conditions in Tasmania, members of the union are brought from the mainland to load the ships. Nearly 100 men have been brought from other parts of the mainland to Hobart this year to assist in loading ships. That practice is likely to cause trouble, and I am not satisfied that the Arbitration Oourt can remedy it. The seamen are threatening to ruin the shipowners and Australia. During the war the waterside workers refused to load foodstuffs for the soldiers. The Government paid loyal men to go on to the wharfs, and had to pay thousands of pounds of compensation to them later to get them off the wharfs so that a lot of lazy humbugs, who do not work, could take their places. They are the laziest body of men in Australia, and' some of them do not do one-fourth of a. day's work in a day.",68

I have known them to work for 48 hours at a stretch, night and day, because they were paid 4s. 6d. an hour for overtime. At Hobart they will not load the Commonwealth Government ships without working overtime. Of the Commonwealth linera that have called at Hobart for frui t thi< year only one has sailed on a Saturday; and that was because she loaded only a small cargo. The other ships were delayed until Sunday morning, so that the waterside workers would be paid 6s. 6d an hour for loading on Saturday night and Sunday. British ships will not wait - the y would rather leave the fruit behind-and even a Commonwealth ship on one occasion left 6.000 cases behind. ThL* kind of thing is the principal cause of industrial trouble in this country. There are men who are engaged in nothing but inducing other men not to work. The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) spoke of the basic wage, which, in my opinion, is the most iniquitous thing ever adopted. It is based on the cpst of feeding a. man, his wife, and three children, and yet a single man receives the same amount. The workers should be paid for what they produce, not what they consume, because the more some of them eat the slower they work. The "" goslow "" policy is a great curse.",69

258,Mr SEABROOK,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I do not - I am not opposed to unionism, and I am not opposed to the payment of high wages: but when high wages are paid, there should be an equivalent return. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) said that high wages did not prejudicially affect industries. Evidently the honourable member does not know what he is talking about. The high wages and easy conditions awarded by the court are ruining the fruit industry. Most of the burdens placed upon industries generally are passed on to the man on the land. A pamphlet published by the Victorian Railways statea that the increase in wages under awards of the Arbitration Court was £585.000 from 1921-22 to 1924-25. . At the end of 1924-25 the Victorian Railway Department made a profit of £26,000, but the Arbitration Court has been responsible for a further rise in wages of £437,000. In order to make their railways pay the State Government must increase freights and fares, and thus pass the increased cost on to the man on the land. The people who use the railways have to provide £859,000 a year to enable the railways to carry on, A railway departmeut is able to pass ou the burden of increased wages, but the man' on the land cannot do so. The meat industry, which has been spoken of, has been almost crippled by the high cost of production. The trades halls of this country, 'as well as the trade union ganizers, are responsible for a lot trouble. I have received a letter, which I wish to place on record, from a plasterer whom I know well. He is a reliable tradesman, who l e ft Hobart, was no work there, to seek work at Canberra. The letter readsI am writing to you to let you know they do things at Canberra.

262,Mr YATES,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Adelaide) [12.17 a.m.]. This bill is designed to improve the methods of industrial arbitration that we have been developing in Australia for so many years: to provide that the differences between employers and employees shall be adjiisted ou a scientific basis; and to ensure a fair return from industry to all parties. It is proposed now to give the judges of the Arbitration Court plenary power to enforce their awards. In the debate on the measure honourable members have rambled over a very wide field, and some of them, notably, the honourable member for f r a n k l in (Mr . Seabrook), have expressed views on trades and callings of which they know very little. But that honourable member and I agree on one t h in g ; we are both against life tenure for judges. In my opinion, it is highly desirable that those who preside over our arbitration courts shall be young, virile men in close touch with the world, and not academic theorists. I say that with all due respect f o the gentlemen who may be appointed under the provisions of the bill. It cannot nied that, even though suitable men are appointed in the first place, the time will come when they will lose their keenness. It is of vital importance that the A r b i tration Court bench should be occupied by the ablest men available, for the affairs that come before it touch almost every part of our daily life. Industria l conditions, it must be remembered, change rapidly, and in order to deal with them satisfactorily a judge must be in close touch with them. A decade may totally alter the methods of production. We have not to go back very far to the time of the industrial revolution and the establishment of trade unionism ; and I suppose that we can all remember when the seeds from which the A r b i tration Court has grown were first, planted. To illustrate the changes that may occur in industry, I draw the attention of honourable members to the de48 velopment of motor transport. I can well remember when the first motor car appeared in Adelaide. I speak .1 of Adelaide, for I know it best. My only visit to Melbourne in my young days was when the Earl of Hopetoun, afterwards Lord Linlithgow, was Governor of Victoria. At that time very few people owned even bicycles, and there was much, talk about how long it would take for the horseless carriage, as the motor car was then known, to supersede horses. That time has almost come, for marvellous developments have occurred in motor transport. In order satisfactorily to determine industrial conditions the occupants of the Arbitration Court bench would need to take full cognizance of rhat revolution. Then, again, the introduction of labour-saving machinery and altered methods is continually changing the circumstances of a particular trade or calling. In all these circumstances it is imperative in my opinion that our arbitration court judges shall be in close touch with every-day affairs. I have seen judges who, although they might be able to assess facts and give sound judgments, appeared, when sitting on the bench with rugs over their knees,* as though they would be better at home playing bowls or croquet to keep themselves warm. I certainly think that the judges should retire on reaching a reasonable age. I agree with the honourable member on the Government side who suggested that the retiring age observed be de- in the Public Service generally should apply to them. I shall strenuously oppose the proposal for pensions for them. It is true that judges possibly give up opportunities of advancement in private practice; but the salary provided is known when they accept positions on the bench, and is calculated on a basis to meet any sacrifice they may make. are ordinarliy understood to be provided to meet the exigencies of illness aud old age, as does the Federal old-age and invalid pension. Derogatory statements such as those made regarding union organizers should not be heard in this chamber unless those making them can produce evidence in support. When I was an official in a labourers' union the men received 4s. 6d. a day. had to work in water up to their knees, and provide their own tools and tents out of their miserable pittance. Naturall y they resented such treatment. I remember a strike in connection with road reconstruction in Bundle-street, Adelaide. Instead of the executive of the union controlling the men, they simply met on the job, and .decided upon their own course of action, advising the executive afterwards as to what they proposed to do. The conduct pf the strike then devolved upon the union officials, who carry out the work that they are paid to do. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) stated that union organizers did no work and never desired to do it. I challenge hi m to mention one organizer who has not risen from the ranks of the unions. I suggest to some honourable members opposite that they should try to do hard work, and j o in a union. They would then discover that it is not easy to obtain a "" s of t "" job as a union official. The honourable member ior Franklin stated that arbitration had been a ghastly fail u r e: but he f u m no evidence in support of his argument. In my opinion, it has been of the greatest possible benefit to the community, and the ""golden r u l e "" has been observed more closely by employers and employees than it would have been under other circumstances. I cannot agree with those honourable members who contend that it would be advantageous to adopt the piecework system. I worked in a factory prior to the introduction of wages boards, and arbitration courts, and I have known young men work themselves to a standstill in order to get the maximum amount of wages; but the eventual result was a reduction in the rates paid for particular jobs. Men employed at piece-work rates in the making of buggy lamps for instance found that they were below the breadPensions line, because earlier in life they had exhausted their energy under that system, and as a result the price had been reduced. I have seen a man similarly wasting his strength, again on the piece-work system in the making of stoves. To ensure a greater output, one man was in the habit of using a small sledge-hammer to clinch his rivets. Other men using ordinary hamThey mers were unable to equal his output. As a result of the operation of this system, piece-work rates were lowered and the men were shamefully exploited, u n t i l finally there was not a sufficient margin to enable them to earn a decent living. The Arbitration Court has brought about uniformity in working conditions, and whilst in some instances the minimum . award has become the maximum, at all events that gives the worker a' living wage. The late Judge Gordon, a most estimable gentleman, who died full of honours, made one of the first awards of the Arbitration Court in ' South Australia. That was in connection with an application by brushmakers. Ou that occasion the wives of workers had to givG evidence as to the amounts spent weekly on meat, groceries, and other household commodities, as well as state the amount allowed the husband for persona] expenses. As I have said on another occasion, they had practically to strip themselves naked before the court to justify the rate asked by their union. In making an award of 7s. 3d. a day, the judge stated that it was the irreducible minii lied mum, and that it was only equivalent to the amount allowed for the maintenance of prisoners in the stockade. Criticisms of the awards are an affront to the judge, suggesting that he does not understand his business. The union organizations are put to great expenditure to present their claims, but invariably they convince the judge of the justice of their cause. The honourable member for F r a n k l in (Mr Seabrook) ' this evening mentioned a number of anomalies, especially directing attention to the fact that awards are made on the basis that a worker has a wife and three children - Many years ago Mr. Piddington was appointed by the Commonwealth Government to collect data to determine what would be a fair basic wage in industry. It is true that whilst some young men, and possibly young women also, benefit from the application of the basic-wage principle, ether men with families of more than three children are, to that extent, penalized. Parliament might very well be employed in adjusting this anomaly. I .am in complete accord with the system of arbitration. I am satisfied that, if it is properly applied, it will be for the .lasting benefit of the people. It is perhaps too much to expect that it will lead to the millennium, but, at all events, it confers substantial benefits on the workers. Many misstatements have been made by honourable members opposite. They have complained that the awards of the Arbitration Court have adversely affected /he wool and wheat-growing industries. I suggest to them that they should examine the statistics of production, which show that, notwithstanding what has been said - o the contrary, the wealth of Australia is accumulating in the banks and other public institutions. ""We see everywhere indications of affluence. The only conclusion that I can come to is that the wool and wheat-growers are far too wealthy.",71
263,Mr GIBSON,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,It is all right while the prices remain as they are.,73
264,Mr YATES,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Then while they remain high I ask honourable members behind the Government not to squeal. They have formed the habit of squealing Avhether prices are up or down. The following paragraph appeared in the Register of the 6th February, 1925:BENEREMBA H SOLD. £340,000 REALIZED. -' It is not a station, it is a principality declared the auctioneer, in offering for sale, at Scott's Hotel this afternoon the renowned Riverina sheep station known as Benerembah. The station, which as offered comprises 90,830 acres (about 142 square miles) ' of leasehold, about halfway between Hay and Narrandera, with a frontage on the Murrumbidgee River, was first taken up - about 50 years ago by the late Mr Thomas Baillie. Since Mr Baillie died, 32 years ago, the estate has been worked by the trustees, who desired to wind it up; but because of an embargo by the New South Wales Ministry, arrangements for the sale could not be completed until last year. The first bid received today was £250,000; and in rapid succession the amounts offered rose to £325,000, at which figure bidding ceased. Later the property was sold privately for £340,000 to the Millandra Pastoral Company, Limited, of Sydney, the firm which had bid £325,000 at the  the runner-up at the auction, his bid being £320,000. For that pastoral lease £340,000 was paid, and yet the Treasurer says that we cannot assess the value of pastoral leases. If the Treasurer or the Taxation Department is in doubt about the value of that leasehold, they should ask the auctioneer for particulars of the sale. When speaking on the tariff, 1 examined the statistics relating to the pastoral industry, and notwithstanding the statements of honourable members on that side respecting the baneful influence and effect of the Arbitration Court's awards upon that industry and the consequent increased cost of production, the records show that the wool produced in Australia has increased both in value and in quantity. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) spoke of union organizers, the trades hall, and the go-slow policy. I would remind him that when the pastoralists receive higher returns for their wool, it is only right that the workers, through their unions should enforce their claim t j higher wages. Honourable members supporting the Government are too steeped in prejudice to discuss the arbitration system on its merits. I suppose that the honourable member for Franklin thought that the letter which he read was a severe indictment against union organizers in Sydney, because a man could not get a job at Canberra without first approaching the union. He forgets that the unions police the arbitration awards and pay for them. There are a lot of men in industry, as in commerce, Melbourne, Thursday. who are willing to reap the bene!"" fits of arbitration without subscribing one penny to the union funds to meet the cost of approaching the Arbitration Court. Union fees impose no burden on the worker. They are a pittance compared with the actual benefits received from trade unionism-reall y an investment for the workers. The mere fact that the man in question had to anoroach the Sydney union be-, fore he could get a job is no new departure.

Should upon the increased powers, which are. being sought by referendum be conceded, it will be possible for this Parliament toestablish such agencies as it thinks proper, with such powers as it confers, and i th a personnel having such tenure of office as it thinks fit, subject only to this condition, that, if it is deNo sired to confer judicial power upon any authority, it will be necessary to observeindustry. the conditions of the Constitution regarding the life tenure of the judiciary. Most of the work of industrial authorities can be done perfectly well by men who will not be appointed for life. The work of conciliation commissioners and wages boards is distinct altogether from the 'exercise of judicial functions. Even honmembers who object to the prinof l if e tenure have recognized the the need for it in regard to the Arbitration honCourt judges, in order that the court effectively interpret its awards and against either side. Act Various honourable members have addressed themselves to the uisrits of theproarbitration system, and some have spoken of its effect upon the rural industries. These are big subjects, but I suggest others to .those honourable members who have made interesting and useful contribuby tions to the discussion that they do arise in connection with this bill, and that whatever the views of any member may be as to the general merits of arbitration, or the effect of the system upon rural industries, provision of the nature proposed in this bill must be made immediately. We all recognize that - an arbitration award, although not applying directly to a particular industry, has an effect upon it by influencing the general cost of living, and in other ways, Even if awards are not directly applied to the rural industries those engaged in them are profoundly interested in the conditions which applied to the secondary industries. Accordingly, all sectious of the people are concerned in making the arbitration system as efficient as possible, and to the supplying of that need this bill is directed. honourable members who object to the Commonwealth arbitration system would, if they had direct and personal responsibility, hesitate before they swept it aside. If that fact be recognized, the main ' objective is to get the best men available to handle this important work, to put them in a position to dischargo their functions thoroughly, and, particularly, to make them independent of the various exigencies of political changes. In order to obtain good men for the arbitration courts, wo must bear in mind the difficult and responsible nature of their work, and the extent to which it subjects them to criticism, sometimes in harsh or, at least, unfortunate language. Those who are worthy of these appointments are men whose services are required in other branches of public work, wh'ere the rewards are frequently greater than are offered to occupants of the arbitration bench. That applies particularly to men suited for the judicial bench, for which there are pensions and comfortable conditions of working that do not obtain in the Federal Arbitration Court. This Parliament must be prepared to make the positions reasonably attractive in comparison with other positions that are open to men of character and capacity. That cannot be done unless they are given full security of tenure, and under the Constitution they must, to exercise judicial power, be appointed for life. It is necessary, too, that the position of a Commonwealth arbitration judge should be at least as attractive as judicial positions in .the States.",75
272,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,Has the Government considered the result 1,76
273,Mr LATHAM,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"I can assure the honourable member that that has not been overlooked. Reasons for every provision contained in this bill have been submitted to the House. Unless this Parliament abolishes the Arbitration Court altogether - whie h I venture to suggest would not be favoured by honourable members or by the community generally, despite the fact that each of us has some criticism to offer concerning the present system-the provisions of the bill must be adopted. The Government is not prepared to abolish the court. Even - Mr MANN - Not yet.",76
274,Mr LATHAM,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,I understand the honourable member's position. It is intended to make the court as effective as it can be under the Constitution as it stands.

275,Mr BEUCE,QUEENSLANDER SAYS HIGH WAGES DESTROY,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs)' [1.20 a.m.] - In moving- ' That the House do now adjourn, I desire to acquaint honourable members with the names of the gentlemen chosen to represent Australia at the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, which is held every year on the first Monday in September. The meeting this year is of the greatest i m portance. Honourable members will recollect that, during the present year, a special meeting of the Assembly was held to consider the admission of Germany to the League, with a permanent seat on the Council. That matter, and the. composition of the Council generally, and, in particular, the number of permanent seats, are questions that were full y discussed, and created grave differences of opinion, so that the Assembly arrived at no decision regarding them. These matters will, therefore, be again taken into consideration at the September meeting. It is imperative that the Commonwealth sliould have .the best and fullest representation possible in the Assembly, and it has heen suggested that the Prime Minister should attend; but that is impossible. It is, however, regarded as essential that a Minister should be present, and the Government, therefore, proposes that the Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) shall be the principal representative of the Couunonwealth, and that the other two representatives shall be the High Commissioner (Sir Joseph Cook) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning), who is leaving for England in the near future, and will be on the other side of the world when the Assembly meets. The substitute delegates whom the Government has selected are Sir Arthur Rickard, of Sydney, and Miss Freda Bage, who is the principal of the Women's College in the University of Queensland. Honourable members will agree that the representation which the Commonwealth will have at the Assembly is such as to inspire the confidence of the people of Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 1.23 a.m. (Friday).",76
