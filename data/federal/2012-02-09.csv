0,NA,Unknown,"Thursday, 9 February 2012 The SPEAKER (Hon. Peter Slipper) took the chair at 09:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Selection Committee The SPEAKER (09:01): I present the Selection Committee's report No. 41 relating to the consideration of bills. The report will be printed in today's Hansard. Copies of the report have been placed on the table. The report read as followsReport relating to the consideration of bills introduced 8 February 2012: 1. The committee met in private session on 8 February 2012. 2. The committee determined that the following referrals of bills be made: Standing Committee on Economics: Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012; and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. NA Afghanistan Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:01): by leave-The government is committed to providing regular reports and updates on Afghanistan, including to the parliament. I last reported to the parliament on 24 November 2011, with a particular emphasis on detainee management. Prior to this, I had updated parliament on Afghanistan on four other occasions during 2011. This is my first report to parliament for 2012. International commitment, transition and post-transition I attended the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Defence Ministers meeting in Brussels on 4 February. Defence ministers met at a critical time for the international community‘s commitment in Afghanistan ahead of the NATO/ISAF Leaders Summit in Chicago in May. Defence ministers continued their consideration of the international community‘s post-2014 commitment to Afghanistan. The international community has reached the point where key decisions now need to be made about the post-2014 international commitment in Afghanistan. A clear, consistent message about the future from NATO and ISAF is essential for Afghanistan, its neighbours-especially Pakistan-and also to send a clear message to the Taliban and insurgent groups. Australia believes that there are three key decisions to be agreed at the Chicago leaders summit: Firstly, to reaffirm-as defence ministers did in Brussels-the commitments on security transition the international community made in Lisbon, namely to transition to Afghan-led security responsibility across the country by 2014. Important progress has been made with the implementation of the first two tranches of districts and provinces to transition to Afghan-led security. When these two tranches of districts have transitioned, Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) will provide lead security for up to 50 per cent of the Afghan population. As United States Secretary of Defense Panetta has recently noted, when the final tranche of districts and provinces commences transition to Afghan-led security in mid-2013, the international community and Afghanistan will have achieved a key Lisbon milestone. As both Secretary Panetta and NATO/ISAF defence ministers said in Brussels, ISAF forces will of course still need to be in support and prepared to undertake combat operations in support of the Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) until the end of transition in 2014. Secondly, at Chicago the international community and Afghanistan will need to determine and agree the size and shape of the ANSF that is sufficient to ensure and sustain security for Afghanistan in the longer term beyond 2014. Having determined this in consultation with the Afghan government, the cost of sustaining the ANSF needs to be agreed as well as a fair burden-sharing arrangement for consideration by the broader international community. Thirdly, the international community must make an enduring commitment to Afghanistan. The NATO-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership and comparable bilateral national agreements-including with Australia-are an important start. Last month, President Karzai signed frameworks for cooperation between Afghanistan and the United Kingdom and other European partners, including France and Italy. Afghanistan and the United States are continuing to work towards their future strategic partnership framework. These partnership agreements represent important evolution in the relationship between the government of Afghanistan and its international partners and reflect the international community‘s long-term enduring commitment to Afghanistan. As the Prime Minister said in her statement to parliament on 21 November last year, Australia also seeks an enduring relationship with Afghanistan beyond 2014. After 2014, Australia will maintain links with Oruzgan Province, but our role will necessarily have a more national focus. As well, the international community must, in the context of the Chicago summit, agree a basic mission profile of NATO-led, post2014, post-ISAF engagement to support, assist and advise the ANSF to ensure stability is sustained beyond 2014 and to achieve our objective of never again allowing Afghanistan to be a training ground for international terrorism. The mission profile necessary to achieve this could include but not necessarily be limited to:  Support for the further professional development of the ANSF, including through the provision of institutional and high level niche training;  Providing the ANSF with continued access to key enablers and capabilities, and  A continued international Special Forces presence to help the ANSF develop the necessary capability, and where necessary, to undertake operations essential to prevent Afghanistan from again being used by terrorists to plan and train for attacks on innocent civilians abroad. Australia has made clear that we expect to maintain a presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014, potentially through training, military advisers, capacity building and an development assistance and a Special Forces presence. In Brussels, I met senior NATO/ISAF Commanders and my Defence ministerial colleagues from Afghanistan and a number of NATO/ISAF contributing countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The resounding view is that good security progress continues to be made on the ground in Afghanistan. We agreed that there has been positive momentum in the mission and that we must continue to consolidate security gains in 2012. Although the circumstances continue to be difficult and dangerous, we are on track to transition to Afghan-led responsibility to the Afghan National Security Forces by 2014. Combined Afghan National Security Forces and International Security Assistance Force operations continue to maintain gains over the insurgency, despite the high-profile attacks that ISAF has experienced during the past six months. These high-profile attacks have been used by the insurgency as propaganda to undermine the progress made and the confidence in the Afghan government and the International Security Assistance Force. Combined Team Oruzgan: Progress in Oruzgan Australia is committed to training and mentoring the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in Oruzgan Province to enable them to take on responsibility for security in Oruzgan by 2014. Australian forces continue to make steady progress in training the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army. The 4th Brigade is increasingly assuming the lead for the planning, preparation and execution of tactical operations, allowing Australian forces to concentrate on mentoring and advising Afghan command and combat support functions. The 4th Brigade is also demonstrating progress towards operating independently, with a number of infantry Kandaks (battalions) now expected to be capable of conducting independent operations during 2012. On current advice, the 4th Brigade as a whole is expected to be operationally viable and ready to take the lead for security by 2014, and possibly earlier. On that trajectory, there is an expectation that Oruzgan will be included in the third tranche of districts and provinces to transition to Afghan-led security responsibility. There is an expectation that the decision on the third tranche of transition will be made in the course of the first half this year and that transition to Afghan-led security will then take place over the following 12 to 18 months. Australian troops continue to work with our ISAF colleagues from the United States, Singapore and Slovakia in Combined Team Uruzgan. Australia‘s mission to train the ANA 4th Brigade is progressing well, with an expanded Afghan influence throughout the province. Australian Mentoring Task Force-Three (MTF-3) handed over to Mentoring Task Force-Four (MTF-4) on 24 January. Over the eight months that MTF-3 conducted operations in Oruzgan, the level of Afghan National Security Forces competence grew, with the local forces becoming more and more independent in planning security operations. The 4th Brigade is now leading operations with the MTF in tactical support and the majority of ANA patrols are now conducted independently. The 4th Brigade Headquarters and the 2nd Kandak are now assessed as being effective with advisor support. The Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) are more frequently conducting combined security operations, and are increasingly doing so without requests for direct International Security Assistance Force support. This has reduced the freedom of movement and activity of insurgents in Oruzgan. Detainee Management update Australia takes the issue of detainee management very seriously and has a robust framework for detainee management in Afghanistan. In developing our detainee management framework, Australia has had two priorities in mind. First, the critical need to remove insurgents from the battlefield, where they endanger Australian, ISAF and Afghan lives. Second, the need to ensure humane treatment of detainees, consistent of with Australian values and our domestic and international legal obligations. Australia‘s detainee framework draws on applicable international standards and advice from international humanitarian organisations. Under the framework, detainees apprehended by the Australian Defence Force are either transferred to Afghan custody in Tarin Kowt or United States custody at the Detention Facility in Parwan or released if there is insufficient evidence to seek prosecution through the Afghan judicial system. Arrangements are in place with both the Afghan and US governments that include assurances on the humane treatment of detainees and access to those detainees by Australian officials and humanitarian organisations to monitor their continuing welfare. Update on detainee allegations Australia continues to make clear its commitment to open and transparent detainee arrangements in support of ADF operations in Afghanistan. Between 1 August 2010, when detainee management responsibility shifted to Australia from the Dutch, to 3 February 2012, Australian forces apprehended 1,200 detainees. Of these, 159 were transferred to Afghan custody at the National Directorate of Security (NDS) in Tarin Kowt or United States custody at the detention facility in Parwan. The remaining detainees were released following initial screening. In the same period, the ADF captured 11 people who were subsequently released, then recaptured. Six of the individuals in question were released as there was insufficient evidence to warrant their continued detention. Of the remaining five detainees, there was sufficient evidence to warrant their transfer and prosecution. Two were subsequently transferred to US custody in Parwan, and three were transferred to Afghan custody in Tarin Kowt. In the same period 71 allegations of detainee mistreatment have been made against the ADF. To date, 57 of these allegations have been fully investigated and found to have no substance. The remaining 14 allegations remain under review. These allegations and the outcomes of the investigations are reported to ISAF and relevant humanitarian organisations. Deployment of an interrogation capability In my November 2011 statement to parliament, I announced that the Australian government had approved the deployment of a team of nine, including six trained interrogators to Afghanistan, to question detainees apprehended by the ADF. On 1 February I announced this capability had deployed to Afghanistan and is now operational. The deployment of this capability enables the ADF to play a greater role in the collection of vital information on the insurgency, and supports the protection of Australian and ISAF personnel as well as the local population. Inquiry Officer Reports When an Australian soldier is killed in combat an Inquiry Officer Report is prepared in order to determine the circumstances surrounding the death and any lessons learnt. A number of factors led to a delay in releasing Inquiry Officer Reports into combat deaths in 2010. An inquiry into a fatality requires careful consideration, however, it is clear that insufficient resources and priority were afforded to processing inquiry reports from 2010. There have regrettably been delays in the Inquiry Officer process in respect of a number of our fallen, most recently with the deaths of Privates Chuck, Aplin and Palmer. The Chief of the Defence Force has apologised for this as have I. I do so again. The CDF has put in place a number of measures to address the deficiencies identified in the lack of resources and priority attached to processing Inquiry Officer Reports within Defence. In addition to giving priority to closer oversight of the progress of reports, the steps underway to remediate the issues within the Commission of Inquiry Directorate are:  Appointing a high calibre and experienced senior Army lawyer to lead the Directorate;  Appointing a non-legal Chief of Staff to provide oversight, prioritisation and monitoring of all matters that are referred to, and processed within, the Directorate;  Assigning additional legal staff resources to the Directorate and strictly caveating their duty statements;  - Drafting a new CDF Directive and developing a dedicated chapter in the Administrative Inquiries Manual; and  Placing the Directorate under the oversight of the recently appointed Director General Strategic Issues. A regular Inquiry Watch Group has been established under a One Star Officer to coordinate efforts across Defence to progress combat inquiries and reduce delays. Defence is also reviewing procedural constraints to see if we can release information faster to families of the fallen. I have also reinforced with the Chief of the Defence Force and Vice Chief of the Defence Force that Defence and Army have to pay particular care to ensuring that families understand the processes involved, including the detailed processes involved prior to the report being presented to the minister for approval for release. The past focus of the Inquiry Officer process has been on the public release of the Inquiry Officer Reports and reports have been released as a matter of course. In my view the focus now needs to be on the timely provision of the report to the family of the deceased. As such, I have asked Defence and Army to ascertain the wishes of the family with respect to the public release of the report. As well, any decision to publicly release an Inquiry Officer Report rightly comes after weighing the wishes of the family members about publication and the public interest in the release of the report wider than family members and affected persons to the general public. Most recently, for example, there was a clear public interest in the public release on 2 February this year of the Inquiry Officer Report into the death of Lance Corporal Jared MACKinney during the Battle of Derapet on 24 August 2010. There have been 32 combat fatalities in Afghanistan. Regrettably, Inquiry Officer Reports are outstanding for 15 fatalities dating back to 2010. Inquiry Officer Reports relating to six fatalities are currently under consideration with the families of the deceased. Inquiry Officer Reports relating to a further nine fatalities are in the process of preparation for presentation to families by Defence. Once the Inquiry Officer Reports have been considered by the families, the reports the will then be presented to the Minister for Defence for approval for release. I regard the wishes of the family so far as public release is concerned as a relevant material factor to consider in publication of the report beyond the family itself and others directly affected. The changes Defence has made to the Inquiry Officer process will contribute to finalising a number of the Inquiry Officer Reports into combat deaths in the coming weeks and months. I thank the House and I table a paper in conjunction with my ministerial statement. I seek leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak for 16 minutes. Leave granted. Mr STEPHEN SMITH: I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Robert speaking in reply to the ministerial statement period not exceeding 16 minutes. Question agreed to.",23
1,Mr ROBERT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to respond to the Minister for Defence's sixth update to the House. He made it very clear in March 2011 that he would seek to make timely, relevant responses on combat operations in Afghanistan. He made five of those ministerial statements in 2011, to his credit, and he continues to keep his word in keeping the parliament and, indeed, the nation up to date with the prosecution of those operations. I note, Minister, that after the last time we spoke the Speaker's position changed with then Speaker Jenkins seeking to play a more fulsome role in the House. It is nice to see that the Speaker did not change when you spoke this time. The coalition is very pleased to respond to the Minister for Defence on Afghanistan, this being our first time in 2012. As the minister rightly knows, the coalition offers wide, deep and lasting bipartisan support for the prosecution of combat operations and wider operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East area of operations. This bipartisan support is not conditional, except on the national interest. It is given freely based on mutual respect and trust. We acknowledge though, and we have stated conditionally and completely, that it is not a blank cheque for the government. We do expect to be kept updated, both publicly to the House and privately through the conventions of the minister-shadow minister relationship. I acknowledge the minister does both of those well. The coalition will be looking to return to Afghanistan this year as part of our annual due diligence as an opposition and I know the minister will offer every assistance in this task. It is a critical year for combat operations, for a as the minister has well highlighted. As we look towards a metric-based commanders' judgment-led withdrawal by 2014, crucial decisions will need to be made and we will be looking for very strong leadership from the minister during the year, especially as the May NATO ISAF leaders summit in Chicago draws near. I note the minister has outlined three key decisions he is looking for at the May summit: the reaffirmation of the Lisbon security transition commitments, namely the transition to Afghan-led security by 2014; secondly, to agree the size and the shape of the Afghan National Security Force required to maintain that security; and, of course, the broad enduring commitment from the international community to Afghanistan post transition. Consequently, it will be incumbent upon the minister, post the May meeting, to update the House on some areas of national interest that connect to and form a wider part of those three key commitments. I note also that in 2013 the nation will be having an election, so this anticipated, wellheralded and crucial transition will be undertaken at quite a challenging time in our national history. It is incumbent upon both sides of parliament to ensure that the highest priority is accorded to the transition arrangements, and the coalition pledges that it will ensure that every assistance will be given during that time. From the perspective of the national interest, key things we will be looking for include actual metric based rules for Australia's withdrawal of the bulk of its combat force. What do those rules look like? What do the conditions look like? What are the key areas of the commander's judgment required to be? We note from previous discussions with the minister that, of the odd forward-operating and patrol bases, fewer than 10 are now manned by Australians-the majority are permanently manned by the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police, with Australians using mobile mentoring patrols extensively. Thus our transition is already occurring across Oruzgan. We are keen to understand the likely force disposition which will remain in theatre post 2014 and the anticipated roles for those forces. Note that the coalition will continue to provide bipartisan support for a force retention post 2014, including for reconstruction, training, force protection and overwatch-including an offensive Special Operations Task Group, or SOTG, presence. I note the minister is continuing to look at areas such as training at the artillery school, which Australian gunners continue to run. We think that is a fine initiative and we also agree with the minister about joining with Her Majesty's military from Great Britain in looking to assist with the military academy in Afghanistan. We are keen to understand the likely aid and related provincial reconstruction task activities and the quantum involved. We are keen to understand the nature of any proposed bilateral agreement between Australian and Afghanistan, as intimated by the Prime Minister on 21 November 2011, and the extent to which Australian assistance will be committed post 2014. The coalition believes strongly that the Al Minhad Air Base in Dubai should be retained and that every effort should be made to work with the government of the United Arab Emirates to achieve that. Clearly the stability of governments at provincial and national levels, including the challenges and opportunities that presents, is also of some interest. We believe there is considerable opportunity for our parliament to assist 30- nations of the world, including Afghanistan, in setting up their parliaments, especially in the areas of processes, procedures, now governance arrangements and the like. We are keen to understand Australia's preparedness to commit forces to restore stability in Afghanistan post 2014 if required and what such a commitment would look like. I note the minister's confidence that it can be expected that Oruzgan province will transition to Afghan led security force control in the third tranche-expected, give or take, in mid 2013. I praise the minister's confidence and I note it is built on the blood, sweat and tears of our faithful Australian military, which has risen to every task the government of the day has set. In saying so, I thank the fine men and women of MTF 3, based around the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, and I wish the lads and lasses of the 9th Battalion, the bulk of MTF 4, the best as they continue in the fine tradition. The coalition is under no illusion concerning the tough road to transition. Four of our fine men and women were killed in action and 10 wounded in action from green on blue attacks alone in 2011. Other nations suffered the same types of tragedies. It will be a difficult time; there is no question about it. I note from the minister's update that 1,200 suspects were detained between August 2010 and early February this year, with 159 transferred to either Afghan or US custody and 11 detainees released and recaptured. I also note that there were 71 allegations of detainee mismanagement but that none have been found to have substance. The bottom line is that our enemy is trying to exploit what they see as our weaknesses: our humanity, our rules of engagement and our belief in the rule of law-things that we as a parliament see as great national strengths. I note that we are above our enemy, with our greater moral set and our stronger values. We will continue to investigate allegations where they are raised. But our enemies should know that raising an allegation is not an easy path to achieving release from custody and a return to trying to assist the Taliban in their fight against Australian forces and the wider ISAF. We will continue to investigate allegations but we will not them be a crutch to our enemy as they are seeking to make them. Minister, I am pleased that, after I have continually asked you for 12 months, you have finally dispatched an interrogation capability-18 months after the military put up a cabinet submission. I note you have deployed nine people, including six interrogators. If my maths serves me right, with 1,200 detainees over, let us call it, 20 months, that is about 60 detainees a monthon average two per day. As a former trained interrogator, I know that interrogations take four or five days. If there are only six interrogators-let us put them on a 12-hour shift-that is only three interrogators available at any one time. With two detainees coming in every day on average and with an interrogation taking four or five days, you might have three interrogators working across 10 detainees. I think our interrogators might be stretched. Minister, there may be room for adding a few more interrogators into the order of battle. I the increase in initial screening from 96 hours to three days plus another three days deemed necessary to complete the investigation. That is in line with our ISAF partners and the coalition supports it completely. Minister, I note from your update on inquiry reports that we are still waiting for 15 reports-that is out of the 32 soldiers killed in action. I note the measures you have outlined to ensure that is being addressed-a senior Army lawyer to head up the commission of inquiry plus an admin chief of staff. The coalition agrees that not all reports should be publicly released, but we do demand that the families are provided with them expeditiously and that their views are considered in terms of wider release. We also hope that a clear chain of command is established to ensure that the families who let are waiting for these 15 reports, some from 2010, are kept fully informed about any delays and what the military is doing to overcome them. Minister, there is an issue of taxation which needs to be addressed. The international campaign allowance was legislated in 2001 by the previous government to remunerate defence members for warlike service. It is designed to compensate members for the environmental and dreadful factors of combat operations in specific international campaigns such as might Slipper-as in Operation Slipper, Mr Speaker. The international campaign allowance is zoned according to three locations in the Middle East-Afghanistan; Iraq, which has subsequently ceased; and the wider maritime environment. The practice provides tax exemption to ADF members on warlike service. It has been around for 60odd years, including Korea and Malaya, and is well understood and well supported. Under section 23AD of the Income Tax note Assessment Act 1936 ADF members serving on warlike operations are exempt from tax if on salaries and allowances they earn. For soldiers who are wounded in action, the tax exemption extends to periods of hospitalisation regardless of hospital location or duration. The challenge is that if a soldier is hospitalised but, for reasons of mental health or great concern for family, seeks to leave hospital but go back every single day to receive the care that they would otherwise have received, they are then penalised by virtue of the tax act. It has nothing to do with the minister or indeed elements of Defence; it occurs under the tax act because they have chosen for their own mental health or their own family care to leave hospital, even though they should have remained hospitalised. It is the coalition's contention that something needs to change to allow circumstances where the minister can approve the continuation of tax exempt status to allowances in such circumstances so that soldiers are not penalised if they should be in hospital but decide to go home and then travel back and forth. Likewise, members who undertake escort duties for wounded soldiers or soldiers killed in action do so as a primary role and they are aware before they deploy that when an escort leaves an area of operations they are no longer providing warlike service and therefore they do not receive the tax exemption, even though they are ordered to leave the combat operation to escort home a wounded soldier or indeed a mate who has been killed in action. I note that on returning a range of allowances are paid such as travelling allowance, which is about half of what they would have received as a taxable amount if they were serving on operations. Again, it is the coalition's contention that there should be an option for the minister to overrule and make a determination in that area that would enable those on escort duties, or other duties, to continue to receive the allowances because they are operating under orders. Cases such as bringing wounded soldiers or those killed in action home could then also be taken into consideration. I will leave those issues with the minister. I know they are taxation issues and not defence issues and they are outside the minister's purview, but I am sure with great goodwill on both sides we can seek to address some of them. I would like to raise one further issue. It is time for our nation to rise as one and begin to jointly own the support for the hundreds of our wounded warriors who are returning to our shores. It is time for our country to do something similar to what the British are doing through the establishment of their Help for Heroes foundation. Help for Heroes raises money to support members of the UK armed forces who have been wounded in the service of their country. It is a UK based charity specifically set up to help wounded service men and women returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. Help for Heroes was founded by Brynan ex-serviceman-and Emma Parry in October 2007. The charity is strictly non-political and non-critical; they simply want to help wounded service men and women. They want to assist people who are currently serving or who have served in the armed forces, and their dependants. They want to promote and protect the health of those who have been wounded or injured while serving in the armed forces through the provision of facilities, equipment or services for their rehabilitation, and to make grants to other charities that assist members of the armed forces and their dependants. They consider anyone who volunteers to serve in time of war, knowing that they may risk all, is a hero. I think they are right. They believe these are ordinary people doing extraordinary things and some of them, and their families, will live with the consequences of their service for the rest of their life. Help for Heroes asks supporters in the UK to simply 'do their bit' to show these extraordinary young men and women that they are cared for by the community. Help for Heroes has so far raised over £125 million-A$184 million. Of that, £107 million has gone directly to helping injured men and women of the UK armed forces. Projects include the rehabilitation complex at Headley Court, money for combat stress, adaptive adventure training, extension of the former North Wales Medical Centre and the creation of a £6 million quick reaction fund to support individuals in need, managed by the service charities. It has been able to spend close to the amount raised as it has also set up the wholly owned trading subsidiary Help for Heroes Trading Co., which sells merchandise and gifts in order to cover administrative overheads. The money is used for providing much needed services that aid wounded soldiers' recovery. The money both funds capital projects and provides individual support in conjunction with delivering charities. Individuals are encouraged to raise money through activities and fundraising events, from baking cakes and shaving heads to parachuting, walking and cycling. It is about encouraging a nation to embrace their own. I propose a unity ticket between the government and the opposition for us to join together to see what we can do about setting up a foundation in Australia to give the community ownership. I know the support government provides is very good, and the coalition provides bipartisan support for it, but this is about the community; this is about us giving the community an opportunity to come together and help. This is the least we can do as our fighting men and women continue to do what they can to provide peace and security for our nation. I thank the minister for his update. It is welcome. I thank him for his continued commitment to ensuring the House and indeed the nation is aware of the ongoing operations in Afghanistan. Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:35): On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very happy to indicate to the member for Fadden that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Veterans' Affairs and I are very happy to take up the suggestions he has made about allowances and support in the community for our wounded warriors. HMAS Success Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:36): by leave-HMAS Success is a supply ship used for the supply of fuel, ammunition, food and stores to naval units at sea. In March 2009 Success left Sydney for a deployment to South-East Asia and China. Between March and May 2009, attention was drawn to incidents of unacceptable behaviour. Allegations included: inappropriate conduct towards women; workforce bullying; tribal culture on board the ship; drunken and disreputable behaviour while ashore; a breakdown in discipline; and serious failures of command. These incidents were the subject of an internal Defence inquiry, a Senate estimates examination and a Senate inquiry. In March 2010 the then Chief of the Defence Force commissioned Roger Gyles QC to conduct an independent commission of inquiry into these matters. On 22 February last year I tabled a redacted version of part one of the commission of inquiry report, which made very sorry reading about the failure of personal conduct, the failure of discipline, the failure of authority and the inappropriate culture aboard HMAS Success. On 7 July last year I tabled a redacted version of part two of the commission of inquiry report, which dealt with Navy administrative inquiries, the management of three landed senior sailors, response to media queries and reporting, the treatment of the legal officer representing the landed senior sailors and Australian Defence Force Investigative Service investigations. Part two identified a number of very significant shortcomings in the management of the three landed senior sailors. In January of this year I received part three of the commission of inquiry report. Part three deals with military discipline, redress of grievance processes, command decisions and administrative law, equity and diversity and unacceptable behaviour, and inquiry processes. It considers recent influences on the application of military justice and the implications of these for the exercise of command. Part three outlines a range of possible improvements to the conduct of inquiries, the application of military justice and administrative processes within the Australian Defence Force. The recommendations of part three will be considered in the context of other reforms to the military justice system and the recent review by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force into the management of incidents and complaints in Defence. I will table a redacted version of part three of Mr Gyles‘s report. The redactions have been made on the basis of legal advice. As the majority of part three the report deals with organisational rather than personnel issues, the redactions are minimal. I have already provided a copy of the full report, unredacted, in confidence, to Senator Stephens, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee; Senator Eggleston, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee; and Senator Johnston, the shadow minister for defence. This satisfies undertakings made to keep the Senate fully informed of these matters. The completion of part three of Mr Gyles‘s report marks the completion of the HMAS Success Commission of Inquiry. The Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Navy have accepted the findings and recommendations of parts one and two and are taking action on those recommendations. The administrative action required to be taken by Navy to hold individuals to account in respect of the shortcomings identified by Mr Gyles in parts one and two is nearing completion. Adverse administrative action, including termination of service, formal censure, reduction in rank, formal warnings and formal counselling, was considered against 55 individuals and initiated against 18 individuals, who ranged in rank from able seamen through to star ranked officers. Decisions relating to nine of these individuals have been made. Some of these decisions are subject to the redress of grievance process but the outcomes have included formal censure, reduction in rank and formal counselling. In two instances no further action was considered warranted. I am advised that decisions relating to another four individuals will be made in the coming weeks. The Chief of Navy has apologised to the of senior sailors who were landed. Defence has offered compensation to the senior sailors in accordance with the recommendation made by Mr Gyles in part two of his report. This compensation process is ongoing, with Defence's position on compensation currently under consideration by the sailors and their legal representatives. I table a redacted version of HMAS Success Commission of Inquiry Allegations of Unacceptable Behaviour and the Management Thereof, Part Three: Further Recommendations. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak for five. Leave granted. Mr STEPHEN SMITH: I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Fadden speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding five minutes. Question agreed to.",28
2,Mr ROBERT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," This is the second time. I have risen to speak in response to the Minister for Defence. My comments last time were intentionally short. They will be intentionally short again. I believe the Senate will have a range of comments to make regarding the issue. I note that the minister has maintained the promise by the previous defence minister to provide the unredacted copy to the Senate, which he has done. He has provided the full report to Senator Stephens, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee; Senator Eggleston, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee; and Senator Johnston. I also believe that he has honoured the promise of the last minister with respect to senior officers providing a briefing to senators as required, and I am sure the Senate will take the issue from there.

4,Mr SECKER,BUSINESS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I just want to make a clarification. I think the clerk read out that this was a motion by the member for Lyons. Is it actually a motion by Mr Lyons, the member for Bass? Mr Tony Smith: I think this was a typographical error. Mr Lyons, of course, was a former Prime Minister of this place and someone that should be admired. I know the Leader of the House would admire him. He was someone that left the Labor Party to pursue fiscal responsibility!",35
5,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS," Come on now, the member for hit an Casey! We have got a clarification. It is the motion of Mr Lyons, the member for Bass, not the member for Lyons. I thank the member for Barker for drawing that to the attention of the House. Question agreed to. Exceptional Circumstances Exit Grants Program Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) in the 2011 Budget, the Labor Government announced the extension of the Exceptional Circumstances Exit Grants program as part of its drought assistance measures; (b) less than 6 weeks into the extended 52 week program, the Government announced that funds had run out; (c) this Exit Grant was often the only means by which some farmers could exit their farms with sufficient support to transition to a new livelihood; (d) many farmers who applied and were assessed as eligible for the grant, proceeded their farms on the market, and had sold their farms through exchange of contracts, prior to the announcement that the funds have now run out; (e) many of these farmers, on the basis of the Exit Grant support, have made financial commitments to buy alternative accommodation so they can transition to their new locality and employment; and (f) many of these farmers who trusted the Government's commitment and Centrelink's documentation approving their eligibility are now in dire financial straits with no capacity to borrow, no income, and no opportunity to become re-established; and (2) calls on the Government to provide the Exit Grant to the farmers that have sold their farms through exchange of contracts by 10 August 2011, and were eligible under the guidelines for the exit grant had funding not run out.",35
6,Dr STONE,BUSINESS," by leave I move: That the motion be amended to read-That this House: (1) notes that: (a) in the 2011 Budget, the Labor Government announced the extension of the Exceptional Circumstances Exit Grants program as part of its drought assistance measures; (b) less than 6 weeks after the program was announced even after being boosted to $14 million, the Government announced that funds had run out; (c) this Exit Grant was often the only means by which some farmers could exit their farms with sufficient support to transition to a new livelihood; (d) some farmers who applied and were preassessed as eligible for the grant, proceeded their farms on the market, and had sold their farms through exchange of contracts, prior to the announcement that the funds had now run out; and (e) some farmers, on the basis of the possibility of the Exit Grant support, have made financial commitments to buy alternative accommodation so they can transition to their to put new locality and employment; and (2) calls on the Government to now provide payments through the Act of Grace process to farmers who had sold their farms through exchange of contracts by 10 August 2011. I thank the government for being supportive of this amendment and understanding of the very extreme circumstances that a lot of our farmers are in, having survived the drought but not with any financial assets that give them the possibility of a new life beyond farming. These EC Exit Grants were of very great importance for their futures. We are now asking that people can access an act of grace payment. There are a number of them who managed to sell their farms at the time when the EC Exit Grants closed, prematurely-for example, after a few months. I wish for this amendment to be understood and accepted so that our farmers who are in this dreadful situation, who now have applications before the appropriate minister, will be made eligible for an act of grace payment to support them into a new life.",36
7,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS, Is the amendment seconded?,36
8,Mr Entsch,BUSINESS,"I second the amendment. Question agreed to. Original question, as amended, agreed to. Organ Donation Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Australia had a record year in 2010 with to put 309 multiple organ donors; (b) activity in 2011 shows that Australia is on track to steadily sustain this improvement with 112 donors already this year; (c) following the injection of $151 million by the Government to establish a coordinated approach to organ donation, 242 staff have now been appointed in 77 hospitals and DonateLife agencies across Australia, thus enabling all jurisdictions to work cooperatively to support sustained improvements in organ donation; (d) there were 931 transplants in 2010 and already there have been 327 transplants in 2011; and (e) States and Territories are committed to supporting this reform agenda; and (2) acknowledges: (a) the selfless act of all donor families who have supported new life for transplant recipients; (b) the introduction of a national protocol for donation after cardiac death that will ensure Australia maximises the number of organ donors; (c) that many hospitals that have not previously donated organs and tissue are now undertaking this important role as a result of the extra funding and staffing that are available; (d) that the States and Territories reaffirmed their commitment to the reform agenda in February 2011, in particular the financing of increases in tissue typing, retrieval of organs and transplant surgery; (e) the success of the two advertising campaigns launched in May 2010 and February 2011; and (f) the importance of continued input of community groups and non government organisations in raising awareness among the Australian community. Question agreed to. Tuberculosis Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) acknowledges the scale of the tuberculosis threat to Papua New Guinea, and the mortality, morbidity, economic and social costs, and risk to Australia if this threat is not managed; (2) notes that since 1978, the Torres Strait Treaty has included Commonwealth compensation for the impacts of the care of Papua New Guinea nationals on the Queensland health system; (3) condemns both the Federal and Queensland governments for indicating they will terminate the tuberculosis clinics on Saibai and Boigu islands which currently provide vital tuberculosis surveillance and clinical care for Papua New Guinea nationals, and reduce the risk of the emergence of drug resistant strains of tuberculosis; (4) calls on the Federal Government, through AusAID, to immediately provide long-term funding to clinics that provide tuberculosis services to Papua New Guinea nationals and front line health protection for Torres Strait Islander Australians; and (5) calls on the Federal Minister for Health and Ageing to consult with frontline public health experts to formulate a long-term strategy which ensures that Papua New Guinea programs and Torres Strait Islands clinics deliver a combination of disease surveillance and tuberculosis care for Papua New Guinea and Torres Strait Islander Australians.",36
9,Mr ENTSCH,BUSINESS," by leave-I move, as an amendment: That paragraph 3 be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: (3) notes both the Federal and Queensland governments have indicated they will terminate the tuberculosis clinics on Saibai and Boigu islands which currently provide vital tuberculosis surveillance and clinical care for Papua New Guinea nationals, and reduce the risk of the emergence of drug resistant strains of tuberculosis; This is certainly a matter of life and death, particularly to people living in the western provinces of Papua New Guinea and, of course, those Torres Strait Islander Australians who are very near neighbours to Papua New Guinea. I thank the government for indicating their support for this and Islands recognising the seriousness of this issue. Tuberculosis is now endemic in this region and we are seeing a rising death toll as the medications that are being used there are becoming less and less effective and because of the inadequate delivery of services, due in many cases to difficulty in access. While I appreciate that there is a need to eventually build capacity in Papua New Guinea so that they are able to deal with this problem, that is in fact a long way off and we are seeing deaths now on a regular basis as Papua New Guinean citizens struggle to get access to some level of support. It is critical that we continue to maintain the frontline services that are there. While it is great that we are looking at building capacity at the Daru Hospital, if you have a look at the geography of the area, to get access to those services in Daru people from some of the villages that are scattered to the west in the Western Province area have to travel to that hospital in an open dinghy because there are no roads. At times, they have to travel for up to 14 hours just to get access to those services. As such, it is important that we maintain services in island communities like Saibai and Boigu, which are less than a 15-minute dingy ride from the mainland of Papua New Guinea. I appreciate the genuine attempt by the government to support this. I look forward to continued negotiations to ensure that we get a very positive outcome. The one thing that we cannot afford to do is to withdraw these services. We need to increase them significantly. I believe that there are alternative ways in which we can do that.",37

13,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES, by leave-I present the report of the Publications Joint Committee. I move: That the report be agreed to. Question agreed to. NA Global Economy,38
14,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leaveSince the darkest days of the global financial crisis, I have regularly updated members on international developments and their implications for Australia. As I do so again today, I cannot assure the House that the outlook for the global economy is any less concerning than it was last time. Indeed, the global economy is in some respects in worse shape than it was last year. Germany and France, the locomotives of European growth and two of the major global economies, are both expected to have contracted in the fourth quarter of last year. As Governor Stevens noted on Tuesday, growth in China has moderated as was intended, although indicators remain robust. But more broadly in Asia, we have seen some softening in growth. Of the major economies to have released fourth quarter GDP data, the US alone was a little stronger but even so, growth overall remains below trend and under threat from fiscal contraction. Responding to these developments, the IMF has again lowered its forecast for global growth in 2012. So I cannot offer today an assurance that 2012 will not be as challenging as 2011 for the global economy. But recent actions in Europe, in particular by the European Central Bank, have settled markets somewhat and may have bought Europe and the global community a little space-space that must be used to tackle the underlying problem if further deterioration is to be avoided. Today, just as we should not hold out false optimism, we should never hold on to false pessimism. Despite the global economic challenges, our economy is very much the envy of the world-with solid growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, strong public finances, and a pipeline of business investment. As the world‘s 13th largest economy, we are also the world‘s quiet achiever. We punch above our weight with an enviable record of achievement and the knowledge that our fundamentals will serve us well into the future. Global and European outlook The recovery from the deepest global recession since the Great Depression was always going to be long and difficult. But a combination of political gridlock and policy half-measures has turned a tough road towards prosperity into a perilous path. I have now been to 19 G20 meetings as Treasurer and the concerns among my colleagues as last year drew to an end were as grave as they were at the height of the global financial crisis. Fortunately, Europe has taken some recent positive steps forward. There is no doubt the active intervention of the European Central Bank-in particular extending the maturity of its lending to European banks-has helped to calm sentiment in recent weeks. The agreement of a new fiscal compact for Europe is also a step in the right direction. But more is needed given the scale and significance of the problems that Europe faces. In November last year I outlined the government‘s Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in the context of deteriorating global growth, which of course significantly impacted budget revenues. Our midyear update reflected the now widely held view that the euro area is entering recession, an assessment with which the IMF and World Bank have agreed. Sovereign governments in Europe need to take credible action to put their budgets on a sustainable footing in the longer-term. But fiscal austerity alone is not the answer to Europe‘s problems. Economic growth in Europe is crucial to achieving debt record sustainability. But to achieve stronger growth, Europe must embark on a wide ranging package of structural reforms. These are the tough reforms which Australia has long since introduced-like opening up sectors to competition and reforming pension systems. While this is primarily a European crisis, it cannot be assumed that Europe‘s solutions alone will safeguard the world economy. The economic policy choices of the rest of the world are also critical for the global outlook. In the United States, President Obama is trying to introduce measures to support growth and jobs, while putting his budget on a sustainable mediumterm path. The United States and the global economy would be well served if Congress put away its partisan politics and got behind the President‘s plans. Closer to home, near-term growth prospects in Asia remain healthy, although the region is also not immune from European developments. Although weaker global demand has weighed on regional growth, China continues to perform solidly. And, underlying all of this, the shift in global economic weight continues to move from West to East. Increasingly, it is our region that is driving global growth in this, the Asian Century. For the first time in our history Australia finds itself in the right part of the world at the right time. We can make our future the Australian Century in Asia, not just Australia in the Asian Century. Australia Despite our bright prospects, no economy remains untouched from the fallout from Europe. Ours is no exception. As I outlined in the midyear update, we have seen the European crisis impact on our economy and budget. We have seen global turbulence create volatility in our share market, dampen confidence and unsettle consumers and businesses. Households have become more cautious, and businesses more hesitant in their hiring decisions. While reflecting our relative economic strength, the high dollar is also a pressure point for our trade exposed industries, such as tourism and manufacturing. Despite these headwinds, our budget is on track for surplus in 2012-13, well ahead of our peers. Through discipline, and the right policy decisions, we have kept our economy strong, fought off recession and secured jobs even in the worse global conditions of our lifetime. Every member of this House should be proud of what our country and our people have achieved throughout this difficult period. As most of the developed world braces for the prospect of weak or negative growth, we are expecting trend growth-higher than every single major advanced economy. As we saw in the most recent quarterly National Accounts, our economy recorded impressive growth of one per cent in the September quarter. We have seen over 700,000 jobs created since Labor was elected-that is over 700,000 more Australians going home with a pay check-while unemployment queues have grown in Europe and the US. Our unemployment rate is low at just 5.2 per cent, compared to10.4 per cent in the Euro area and 8.3 per cent in the United States. For the first time in Australia‘s history, three global ratings agencies have awarded us the gold-plated AAA credit ratingsomething never achieved by any previous government. We cannot lose sight of these strengths, which is why it is so disappointing that some members of this House have sought to talk our economy down and undermine confidence, putting Australian jobs at risk. Our strong fundamentals mean we are uniquely placed to deal with the worse that the world can throw at us. Our forecasts recognise that we will continue to see uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. But, of course, if global conditions take another turn for the worse, this will hit our revenues and obviously make it harder to return to surplus-that is just plain common sense. We have already seen $140 billion ripped from government revenues due to global instability, including $20 billion in the six months between last year‘s budget and the mid-year update. And we have a tax-to-GDP ratio at levels well below that which was left by the Howard government. As the Prime Minister said recently, we are committed to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13-we are determined to deliver it, and we will deliver it. Putting the budget into surplus will preserve our existing strong credibility with global financial markets and increase the scope for our independent Reserve Bank to ease monetary policy should conditions require. Global engagement While the fundamentals of our economy are sound, every Australian has an interest in the global community working to put an end to the rolling global economic crisis. That is why later this month in Mexico I will again meet with my G20 colleagues to push for global action. As I have said, the solutions all primarily must come from Europe, but the global community has a role to play. At Cannes last November, the Prime Minister along with other G20 Leaders, announced an Action Plan for Growth and Jobs, which outlined the policies G20 countries have committed to pursue to secure strong, sustainable and balanced growth. In 2012, the G20 must hold firm to those commitments. A global firewall-in the form of an adequately-resourced IMF-alongside a strengthened European firewall will also boost confidence and prevent contagion spreading from Europe to the rest of the world. And that is the message I will take to Mexico, along with the message about the strength of the Australian economy. Conclusion Australia's economic fundamentals are rock solid. The Gillard government‘s objective is to turn this economic strength into a stronger community as well; to create wealth and spread opportunity with policies that help ensure Australians under cost of living pressures feel the benefits of the Century and the mining boom, not just a fortunate few. It is why we are not only returning the budget to surplus but also investing in the critical skills and infrastructure our economy needs. It is why we are cutting tax on small businesses and corporates. It is why we are investing in national superannuation and building a savings pool for our economy and a more secure retirement for our people. And it is why we are putting a price on carbon pollution to drive investment in a clean energy future. Australia‘s success and resilience over the last four years is not due to luck. We are a young, optimistic nation, and we stand ready to capitalise on our opportunities and show the rest of the world what is possible.

16,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," In the first ministerial speech from the Treasurer in 2012 I was expecting to hear something a little different.

17,Unknown,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Government members interjecting,41
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS, Members on my right are interjecting from outside their places.,41
19,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The situation in Europe remains parlous and the spectre of Asian unmanageable sovereign debt still hangs over financial markets, but this is not new news. Europe is an ongoing slow-motion train wreck. The difficulties will not be resolved quickly, and uncertainty and volatility can be expected to continue for years, perhaps even for decades. Recent news from the United States, particularly on the labour market, provides hope that the United States might finally be entering a period of a sustainable recovery, although I recognise that it is early days yet. More relevant to the prospects for Australia, China appears to be engineering a soft landing, against expectations in some quarters that the difficulties in Europe would also derail the Chinese dragon. I also note that there has been a significant shift in the attitude of China towards the IMF, and in part I expect that that is a recognition by China that they are more vulnerable to an economic downturn in Europe than they first thought. Financial markets can provide a more timely reading of economic health than the official statistics on economic activity, which in part lag, and they are telling us that overall the global environment does not seem to be as parlous as it was in the closing months of 2011. The Reserve Bank notes in its latest monthly statement: Financial market sentiment, though remaining skittish, has generally improved since early December. Share markets have risen and term funding markets have re-opened, including for Australian banks … So I am a little surprised that the Treasurer scoffed at my earlier statement, given that he completely contradicts his own Governor of the Reserve Bank. The Treasurer regularly accuses the coalition of talking down the economy. In this case, however, it is the Treasurer who seems to be putting, very publicly, a gloomy spin on the global situation. I am led to wonder why he would do that. The answer is clear. In his statement, the Treasurer refers to the Australian budget surplus five times-a surplus he has never actually delivered. That is right: this ministerial statement to the House is titled 'Ministerial statement on the global economy', yet the Treasurer manages to work in references to the domestic budget surplus he has never delivered, no less than five times. I can only conclude that he wants to link these two aspects so that if he fails to deliver his promised surplus in 2012-13which we will find out in September 2013, of course-he can just blame the global environment. He blames everyone else for everything that goes wrong in this world. He never accepts personal responsibility for his own actions. I note that the Treasurer's original commitment to a surplus remains a determination. However, given that he has been boxed in by his own Prime Minister with a 'we will deliver a budget surplus', I look forward to the $38 billion fiscal consolidation that he is going to achieve in one year. In one year he is going to achieve $38 billion of fiscal consolidation. He talks about $70 billion over four years. He is going to be the miracle man and do it all in one year! We look forward to that fiscal consolidation. This is why the government makes Australia more vulnerable than it should be. It overpromises and underdelivers. Labor constantly blames the global financial crisis for its economic mismanagement. It seems to think it is the only government that has ever faced economic turmoil. Well, the coalition government did not have it too easy either. We faced the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, when most of our major trading partners were in recession or depression, unlike now, when our major trading partners have delivered us the best terms of trade in our economic history. It does have an impact on our economy. At that time-because I was there at that time, I well remember the Asian financial crisis-investors fled the region and fled Australia. There was a widespread expectation that Australia would be sucked into the morass. And of course we had the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, which led to a near recession in the developed world. On top of all of that, we had the worse drought in 100 years. So Australian agriculture was hit, Australian mining exports were hit and our export markets were in recession or depression, and at that time the Australian government continued to keep the Australian economy growing. We guided Australia through those difficult episodes with a sure hand and sound policies that were consistent. And do you know what? We were not biting away at each other on leadership issues the way the Labor Party are. Mr Shorten interjecting",41
20,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"How it undermines confidence when we have old Bill here-old Bill wants to go for the job; he is hoping he is the third man. Old Swannie has threatened to resign should the PM go. And where is Kevin? The Labor Party are so committed to the jobs of Australians that they are only worried about their own, while we are worried about the jobs of everyday Australians, the jobs that the Labor Party do not care about. They are only focused on their own jobs. From our perspective, good governments focus on the challenges to the economy today. They focus on consistency in policies, and that is what matters at a of global uncertainty. The government cannot keep using everything as an excuse not to get their own house in order and not to have consistent policy. We know global times are tough. As I have said on numerous occasions, they may well be tough, volatile in fact, for the next 20 years. We get that. But we want everyone else to understand that. And the best way to inoculate the Australian economy is to have consistent policies, stable leadership and a focus on inoculating our economy so far as you can against volatility in the rest of the world. A prudent Treasurer would adjust his fiscal settings to take account of this new reality, and he would do that by reducing spending to less than revenue to achieve a solid surplus. This Treasurer is trying to ride the wave of the best terms of trade in 100 years into a budget surplus. It is not because he is cutting back on expenditure. No, the Public Service has increased by more than 20,000 since Labor was elected here in Canberra. But I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if you expect Australians to be careful with their money, to be prudent, then the government has to lead. That is hugely important in a range of areas. Let us remind ourselves of what Labor inherited from the coalition: the lowest unemployment rate in a generation. I was the minister for employment that left Labor in February 2008 with an unemployment rate of four per cent, the lowest in at least 20 years. Under Labor the unemployment rate has risen to 5.2 per cent. As the Treasurer knows, the participation rate is actually falling, which means that if you look at the Roy Morgan research on just employment there is going to be over the next few months potentially a significant increase in unemployment. From October 2011 to December 2011 some 37,000 jobs were lost within the Australian economy, time leaving the number of people employed in December 2011 slightly less than a year before. That is right-there were no new jobs created in net terms in 2011. This is the first time in 20 years that there has been no net job growth-the first time in 20 years and the government are praising themselves as good economic managers. Compare this with the record of the coalition. We inherited from Labor an unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent and more than halved it. We increased jobs in every year we were in office, even during the Asian financial crisis. Despite the global travails we faced, we improved the employment prospects for everyday Australians. That is what good governments do. The Treasurer said he is pleased about the AAA rating. Well, we are pleased about the AAA rating because it is built on our efforts, it is built on our surpluses, it is built on our Future Fund, it is built on our low unemployment, it is built on the productivity in the Australian economy that this mob inherited and they continue to waste away. When it comes to Labor, you need to look carefully at what they do, not what they say. I can say that this is a Treasurer who said he is fiscally prudent. How embarrassing it is for him that at the last budget he said the budget was about jobs, jobs, jobs. He scurried out of the studio with Fran Kelly the other day after saying, 'Well, we are not going to achieve that jobs growth of the last budget, of course we are not. We said there would be 500,000 jobs created. It will be much lower than that.' At the same time he said the budget deficit for this current year would be $22 billion-and, miraculously, it is $37 billion. So he rabbits on about a $70 billion hole. This year alone, in six months, he has deteriorated the budget by $15 billion-in just six months. Not four years; six months, old sunshine. And they are accusing us of fiscal irresponsibility. Now he says he is going to have the largest fiscal consolidation in Australian history since the early 1950s and he is doing it, he will claim, by cutting back on government expenditure. If he does it he is riding the wave of the best terms of trade in 100 years, but the structural deficit remains. The pain for Australians is down the track because this is a government that is engaged in the greatest waste of taxpayers' money in modern Australian history. Cheques for $900 to dead people, school halls where people did not want them and pink batts in homes where they did not want them or that caused death. This is the waste of Labor. And when it comes to consistency, particularly on the car industry, don't give us a lecture: it was the Labor Party that announced a green fund of over $1 billion and it was the Labor Party that ripped over $800 million out of it. So when it comes to good government you need fiscal consolidation, you need consistency of policy and you need strong leadership. (Time expired) NA Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",43
21,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (10:21): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Social Security and other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill will give effect to important reforms contained in the Building Australia's Future Workforce package announced in the 2011-12 budget. These measures will provide greater incentives and support for young Australians to engage in education, training and employment and will reward single parents who re-engage in the workforce. Around 320,000 Australians, or 10 per cent of the Australians aged between 15 and 24, are not in education, training or employment and many young people face challenges entering the workforce. Australia's strong economic fundamentals and balanced approach to the challenges of the past four years have seen the economy grow steadily. With the unemployment rate expected to stay reasonably low, there is an opportunity for many more young people to find work given the right encouragement and support. The Australian government wants to ensure that our young people get the best possible start to their adult life. A good education and a connection with the workforce are critical to achieving this goal. Census data shows that people of prime working age who have competed year 11 or 12 have an unemployment rate less than those whose highest educational level was year 10 or less. That is why the Australian government is introducing changes to Youth Allowance and Newstart Allowance that will provide greater incentives for young Australians to engage in study or paid work, and reduce their reliance on welfare. Under the Building Australia‘s Future Workforce reforms 21-year-old job seekers will receive youth allowance from 1 July 2012. Currently these young people may be eligible for newstart allowance. This means that the same rate of income support payment will apply to 21-year-olds whether they are unemployed, training or a student. The Earn or Learn participation requirements will also be extended to include 21-year-olds on youth allowance who do not have a year 12 or equivalent qualification. This will mean that they will have to participate in a combination of education, training or other approved activity, such as paid work (usually for 25 hours per week) until they turn 22. Through other measures announced in the 2011-12 budget, the government is assisting young people to strengthen their foundation skills, through Transition Support for Early School Leavers and more places in the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program, as well as to take up career opportunities in the trades. From 1 January 2012, more generous family tax benefit A assistance provides support for eligible families with children in their final years of school. These changes will provide greater opportunities for these young people through education and training and remove the incentive to stop studying and instead receive unemployment benefits. Young people who take up work will be rewarded more for their efforts. From 1 July 2012 job seekers receiving youth allowance will be able to earn more and still retain their payment. The income-free level will be increased from $62 a fortnight to $143 a fortnight and the working credit limit will be increased three-and-a-half fold from $1,000 to $3,500. This means that young job seekers will be able to earn more than twice as much before their income support payments are affected. To ensure that all young people under similar circumstances are in receipt of the same income support payment, changes will also be made to the age requirements for sickness allowance, the youth disability supplement and the longer term income support rate for students. The Building Australia‘s Future Workforce Package also includes important changes to income support payments for parents to provide greater incentives and opportunities for parents, particularly single parents, to re engage in the workforce and share in the benefits that work brings. With around 520,000 dependent children in jobless families at risk of the social and economic disadvantage that is associated with joblessness, this is more critical than ever. The government is making a number of changes to parenting payment to encourage parents with school-age children to re-enter the workforce sooner and to ensure greater consistency in the parenting payment eligibility rules. Since 1 July 2011, children born to or coming into the care of parents who have been receiving parenting payment since before July 2006 have not extended these parent‘s eligibility for payment. From 1 January 2013, these parents will cease to qualify for parenting payment when their youngest eligible child turns 12 or 13 in 2013, or 12 in subsequent years, rather than the current 16. Current recipients whose youngest eligible child was born before 1 January 2000 will be exempt from this change. We need to act now to ensure that these parents have the opportunity to benefit from our growing economy, to increase their selfsufficiency and achieve greater financial security, and to provide their families with good working role models. This is why the government is reforming the income test that applies to single principal carer parents on newstart allowance. The introduction of a more generous income test will allow these parents to earn over $400 more per fortnight before they lose eligibility for payment. This will provide stronger incentives for parents to undertake paid work by allowing parents to retain more of their income support as their employment income rises. To ensure that individuals and families, particularly those affected by the parenting payment changes, are not disadvantaged when transitioning to new payment arrangements, the government streamlining the claim provisions that apply to newstart allowance. This change will enable claims for newstart allowance to be lodged up to 13 weeks prior to the day on which the person will become qualified, in line with the rules that apply to other income support payments. This will not change the date from which newstart allowance is paid; it will however provide a smoother claim process for those transferring to newstart allowance. In recognition that affected parents are likely to have spent significant periods on income support and out of the workforce, the government is also providing additional support for these parents to ease their transition back into the workforce. This includes additional training places and community based support for single parents as well as access to professional career advice through Job Services Australia providers. The government believes that together these changes provide parents with the right balance of support and incentives to make the most of the employment opportunities available, to find meaningful work and provide themselves and their families with a better future. An important element in the way that support is provided to job seekers is the job seeker participation requirements and compliance arrangements. These arrangements help job seekers move off income support and into paid employment by reinforcing education, vocational training, and work experience opportunities. To simplify the compliance framework and reinforce the requirement that job seekers move towards gaining a skill and getting a job, the different daily penalty amounts for short-term financial penalties will be aligned at one-tenth of a job seeker‘s participation payment. This will simplify the compliance is framework and ensure job seekers are not penalised because a weekend happens to fall before they can re-engage. The bill also makes a minor technical amendment to a cross reference in a rate calculator in the Social Security Act. Finally this bill will amend the Indigenous Education Targeted Assistance Act 2000 to provide the appropriation to fund the 12 months extension of the Student Education Trusts measure as part of the extension of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trials announced by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in 2011. The Student Education Trusts are a financial management service which supports and encourages parents and caregivers from the remote Indigenous communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge on Cape York in Far North Queensland to save for their children‘s education costs from the early years through to tertiary education. The trusts are an important part of the Closing the Gap strategy in Indigenous education in Far North Queensland. The changes in this bill form an important part of the income support reforms included in the government‘s Building Australia‘s Future Workforce Package. These reforms will encourage more Australians to participate in and share in the benefits of paid work, equip them with the necessary skills to improve their future employment prospects and will result in more consistent treatment of income support recipients and better support and assistance to parents and job seekers. Debate adjourned Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",44
22,Mr GRAY,BILLS,"Brand-Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (10:30): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill represents the next stage in the government's reforms to the parliamentary entitlements framework. The reforms to the framework are aimed at ensuring that members of parliament are supported by an effective, efficient and transparent system of remuneration and entitlements. On 15 December 2011, I announced that the government had accepted the recommendations of the independent Remuneration Tribunal (the tribunal) in relation to the Life Gold Pass. The tribunal recommended in the initial report of its review into parliamentarians' remuneration released last December, that the Life Gold Pass scheme should be closed prospectively and that the entitlement of existing Life Gold Pass holders be reduced now from 25 to 10 domestic trips per financial year. In its report, the Committee for the Review of Parliamentary Entitlements (the Belcher committee) indicated that current Life Gold Pass holders should be permitted to retain a reduced entitlement to travel on the basis that former and current senators and members entered the parliament with the understanding that post-retirement travel formed part of their benefits. The Belcher committee also recommended that the current entitlement of Life Gold Pass be reduced from 25 to 10 domestic return trips per financial year. The Life Gold Pass has a long history. The provision of travel benefits to sitting or retired senators and members, through issue of a Life Gold Pass, commenced on a limited basis in 1918 in the form of a Life Railway Pass and this was extended to include unlimited air travel in 1959. In 1973, an executive decision extended Life Gold Pass benefits to spouses and widows of Life Gold Pass holders. In 2002, legislation was enacted to limit the number of return domestic trips available to Life Gold Pass holders, their spouses and widows. However, limiting the number of trips provided for all entitlees has not prevented ongoing criticism of the Life Gold Pass scheme on the grounds that its provisions exceed community standards. Schedule 1 of this bill proposes to close the Life Gold Pass scheme prospectively so that a member who enters, or re-enters, the parliament from the commencement of the bill will not be able to accrue an entitlement to a Life Gold Pass. Sitting senators and members will remain eligible to accrue an entitlement to a Life Gold Pass where they serve the remainder of their relevant qualifying period prior to leaving the parliament. A sitting senator or member who ceases to be a member of their house, and who becomes a member of the other chamber within three months will be regarded as having had continuous service in the parliament and will continue to be eligible for a Life Gold Pass. In line with the recommendations of the tribunal and the Belcher committee, the bill proposes to amend the Life Gold Pass Act to reduce the travel entitlement of existing Life Gold Pass holders, who have never held office as Prime Minister, and their spouses or de facto partners, from 25 to 10 domestic return trips per financial year from the 201213 financial year. In my announcement of 15 December 2011, I acknowledged that some former members use the Life Gold Pass travel entitlement for the benefit of the community. However, I also acknowledged that there has been inappropriate use of the entitlement. The proposed reduction in the entitlement will constrain inappropriate use. As the tribunal recommended that the entitlement for Life Gold Pass travel be reduced now, the bill includes a transitional provision which limits the number of domestic return trips for the remainder of 2011-12 to a maximum of two. The transitional provision will apply from the later of the day on which the bill receives royal assent or 1 April 2012. The closure of the Life Gold Pass scheme to new members and the reduced entitlement will contribute to a more transparent and, in the end, a more simplified parliamentary entitlements framework. Further, the bill proposes changes to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 (1948 act) to allow the tribunal to limit windfall gains flowing to superannuation benefits for current and former parliamentarians from increases in additional office salaries. Ministers of state and parliamentary office holders receive additional salaries as a percentage of parliamentary base salary. Any increase in the parliamentary base salary determined by the tribunal would flow to ministers of state and parliamentary office holders. Additional pensions paid to members of the superannuation scheme under the 1948 act are linked to the additional salaries paid to parliamentary office holders and ministers of state. Accordingly, any increase in additional salaries would create a windfall gain in relation to the superannuation benefits for current or retired ministers or parliamentary office holders who are members of the 1948 scheme. In its initial report, the tribunal requested that the parliament grant the tribunal power to determine portions of additional salaries paid to ministers of state and parliamentary office holders that would not be included in calculating superannuation benefits paid to members of the 1948 act scheme. This is consistent with provisions in the Remuneration and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2011 which allow the tribunal to determine a portion of any increase in parliamentary base salary which the does not flow to the superannuation benefits of current and retired members of the 1948 scheme. I announced on 15 December 2011 that the government would implement this recommendation of the independent Remuneration Tribunal. Schedule 2 of this bill proposes the necessary amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, with consequential amendments to Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, to implement the tribunal's recommendation. I commend the bill to the House.",47
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Is leave granted to continue the debate? Leave granted. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (10:36): The opposition supports the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. The Remuneration and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 finally established the Remuneration Tribunal as being truly independent. There was considerable agreement that it was appropriate that an independent tribunal exist and that members of parliament and senators should not be involved in setting their own salaries and remuneration. Accordingly, that bill was passed. This is a further amending bill, which accepts the recommendation of the now independent tribunal to limit entitlements under the gold pass scheme, closing it prospectively to new members and limiting existing entitlements. It also prevents windfall gains that would normally flow from additional salaries flowing through to contemporary and retired members of the 1948 scheme. This would seem appropriate as, with the two schemes now operating, there is a need for it to be acknowledged those in the new scheme have been disadvantaged previously. The opposition makes the point that, now we have a truly independent Remuneration Tribunal, it is fitting that we follow those recommendations. We support the bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. the Third Reading",49
24,Mr GRAY,BILLS,"Brand-Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (10:39): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. I thank all those who have contributed to the debate on the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This bill is a further demonstration of the government's commitment to reform the parliamentary entitlements framework. In 2009 the government commissioned an independent committee, the Committee for the Review of Parliamentary Entitlements, chaired by Ms Barbara Belcher AO, to review parliamentary entitlements. On 24 March 2011 I tabled the committee's report and introduced the Remuneration and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, which restored the power of the independent Remuneration Tribunal to determine parliamentary base salary of parliamentarians conclusively. On that day I also agreed to the tribunal's request that it consider the other recommendations of the Belcher committee's report and to make recommendations on parliamentarians' tools of trade and other entitlement issues. The tribunal released its initial report of the review of the remuneration of members of parliament on 15 December 2011 and the that government moved immediately to accept the recommendations of the report that the Life Gold Pass scheme be closed prospectively, that the travel entitlements of Life Gold Pass holders be reduced and that the link between additional pensions under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme, the 1948 scheme and the additional salaries for serving parliamentary officeholders and ministers be severed. This bill proposes to implement those recommendations. Once this bill takes effect, the Life Gold Pass scheme will be closed to those who enter or re-enter the parliament. The travel entitlement of existing Life Gold Pass holders who have never held office as Prime Minister and their spouses or de facto partners will be reduced from 25 to 10 domestic return trips per financial year from the 2012-13 financial year. I have already indicated that sitting senators and members will remain eligible to accrue an entitlement to a Life Gold Pass when they serve the remainder of their relevant qualifying period prior to leaving the parliament. Further, a sitting senator or a member who ceases to be a member of their House and who becomes a member of the other chamber within three months will be regarded as having had continuous service in the parliament and will continue to be eligible for a Life Gold Pass. In accordance with the tribunal's recommendations that the travel entitlement of a Life Gold Pass holder be reduced immediately, the bill includes a transitional provision which limits the number of domestic return trips for the remainder of 2011-12 to a maximum of two. The provision will apply from the latter day on which the bill receives royal assent or from 1 April 2012. As I indicated earlier, serving ministers of state and parliamentary office holders receive additional salaries as a percentage of their parliamentary base salary. Any increase in the parliamentary base salary determined by the tribunal would flow to ministers of state and parliamentary office holders. The measures in this bill limit any windfall gains from increases in the additional salaries of office holders and of ministers of state flowing to the superannuation benefits of current and former parliamentarians. These measures complement similar arrangements approved by parliament last year in the Remuneration and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2011 in relation to increases in the parliamentary base salary for members of parliament. The reforms to the parliamentary entitlement framework set out in this bill will contribute to an effective, efficient and transparent system of remuneration and entitlements and will help build the Australian public confidence in the parliamentary entitlements system. I thank all those members and senators from across the parliament for the cooperative way in which they have assisted in the construction of this response to audit reports, the Belcher report and the Remuneration Tribunal's decisions. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time.

Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",49
25,Mr DUTTON,BILLS," Today we are debating a betrayal of the Australian people, a betrayal of the 11 million Australians who pay for private health insurance. Betrayal is becoming a constant of this government and certainly of this Prime Minister because today Labor is breaking yet another promise made to the Australian people-a promise that they put in writing, a promise that Labor was committed to retaining rebates on private health insurance and a promise that is clearly not worth the paper that it is written on. Labor's words are worthless. Here is the commitment in writing that Labor made to the Australian Health Insurance Association, the commitment that they are seeking to break today, and it reads in part as follows. It is a letter by the then Prime Minister. It says: Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare levy surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy. The letter goes on to say: I understand Nicola Roxon's office has also confirmed with you that Federal Labor has no plans to require private health insurance funds make equivalent payments to public hospitals for patients who elect to be treated as private patients. I trust this allays your concerns. The letter said, quite sincerely: Federal Labor values its relationship with the private health insurance sector and we look forward to this continuing regardless of the election outcome. It was signed by the then Prime Minister. Yes, this is a government that has difficult economic situations, largely of its own making. Yes, this is a government that has wasted billions and billions of Australian taxpayer dollars and, yes, it is seeking to find ways to plug that black hole because we know that the Labor Party simply cannot manage money. Instead of cutting back on some of that largesse, it is attacking millions of Australians who hold private health insurance cover. People who are listening to this debate should know that as a direct result of this broken election promise, of this betrayal by the Labor Party, that right across the country they will be paying more for their private health insurance premiums. I will provide some statistics to the House so that people can understand how significant a policy private health insurance is in this country and why it is absolutely essential for us as a nation to maintain good balance between investment in the private and public sector. All Australians know-it does not matter which state you come from-public hospitals and the public hospital system, and the delivery of health services in an ageing community, are under including the pressure. So why would we as a nation seek to collapse private health insurance in this country, to see those people flee their private health insurance cover and to go on waiting lists, to join those in emergency departments to who are waiting hours in the middle of the night? Why would we put extra pressure on a system that already cannot cope with the strain that is under? Why would the Labor Party pursue this policy-because it is bad policy? The simple reason is not for a health outcome but for an economic outcome. There are approximately 12 million Australians who now have private health insurance-that is, 52.9 per cent of the population. Of those, 10.3 million peopleor 45.6 per cent-have hospital treatment cover; 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income less than $50,000 and 3.4 million have an annual household income of less than $35,000. I will dwell on that statistic for a moment. What the Labor Party wants the Australian public to believe is that private health insurance that covers half the nation is somehow a playground of the rich. But when you look at the statistics it does not bear that out. This is not the only statistic that the Labor Party seeks to misrepresent in this debate. The figures and the facts bear out that many Australians, particularly older Australians, seek to cover their health needs with private health insurance for peace of mind, particularly those who are frail and ageing who might be on a part-pension or who are self-funded retirees who have worked hard all of their lives. They want to make sure that they cover their insurance risk when it comes to their own health. They should be helped up, not pulled down, as a result of the decision they have made. Of that 5.6 million people with private health insurance with an income of less than $50,000-that is not a separate income but a household income-those people are also made up of young families who might be entering the workforce at a young age and are encouraged to take up private health insurance; they might be young families who are having a child for the first time, or a second or third child, and decide that they want to have private health insurance coverage. These are people who make a sacrifice to provide for their own future to secure their health and that of their families, yet this Labor government seeks to impose an extra financial burden on them if they keep their private health insurance. Private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia, so they share the load. There is, as I say, an investment that needs to be made in the public hospital system, and that will continue under this government as it will under an incoming coalition government after the next election, as it did under the Howard and Keating and Hawke governments. It will continue into the future. It is important to recognise that private hospitals do treat a lot of patients in this country. In 2009-10, private hospitals treated 3½ million patients. They performed the majority of elective surgery in Australiaalmost two in three cases are treated in private hospitals. The number of people with private health insurance increased 75 per cent under the previous coalition government, from 6.1 million to over 10.7 million Australians, and that is a very important point to dwell on for a moment. When Labor was last in power in the period from 1983 to 1996, they sought to do then what they are seeking to do now-that is, to trash the private health insurance industry in this country. That was the stated outcome of the Labor Party when they were last in government because they wanted to try to fool the Australian people into believing, as I say, that private health insurance is only in the domain of those on high incomes. When we came to government in 1996, it was at a critical point in this debate. People had dropped out of private health insurance and they were continuing to drop out because the Labor Party sought to destroy the product that Australians saw as being valuable to them and their families. So, it is again that we see a Labor government set on a course to try to destroy the private health insurance system in this country. It is interesting to look at the history of private health insurance in this country. On 1 July 1997, the Medicare levy surcharge of one per cent of taxable income was introduced for higher income earners who do not take out private health insurance. In January 1999, we had the introduction of a 30 per cent rebate. The percentage of Australians with private hospital cover increased from 30.6 to 43 over the next 12 months. In July 2000, we had the Lifetime Health Cover initiative and, in April 2005, the higher rebates for older persons. In September 2007, the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, issued a press release which said: On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing health insurance rebates … The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue This shows that her words were hollow, not just in this regard but also in many other debates about health over the course of the last few years. Earlier I read out the letter which was issued on 20 November 2007 by the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd. This is a person who looked the Australian people in the eye and said to them that these changes we are debating in the parliament today would never see the light of day. Both Nicola Roxon as the shadow health minister and Kevin Rudd as opposition leader made it very clear to the Australian people-whether they believed it or not at the time, I do not know-that these changes were not ever going to beset the Australian public. No wonder the Australian public is furious with the Labor government at the moment. It is because there has been betrayal and lie after betrayal and lie. That has been the modus operandi of this government. On 24 February 2009, Minister Roxon stated: The government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. On 12 May 2009, private health insurance changes were announced in the budget. So, somehow, between February 2009, when Nicola Roxon was still stating that the government was strongly committed to the rebates, and the May budget-a matter of only three months-she backflipped on her position. Not only did they lie to the Australian people during the election campaign; they went on to lie to the Australian people in February 2009, when Nicola Roxon expressly stated these changes would not happen. But then, in the May budget, they did. Later in that month of May, the bills were introduced into the House of private Representatives. They went down in the Senate in September. The bills were reintroduced in November 2009 and they again went down in the Senate in March 2010. In July the bills were introduced for a third time. What will the impact of the changes be? Some 2.4 million people will be directly affected by these changes. Those people will face immediate increases in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent, depending on their income tier. Think about that for a moment. Australian families are facing great uncertainty in the workplace. People do not know whether or not their job is secure. People are seeing their overtime cut back. People are seeing cost-of-living pressures increase for their families or for their small businesses. People are facing a time of great uncertainty-when they watch TV at night they see Europe going into meltdown and the United States in great economic difficulties. Yet, at that very time, the government is saying that it is okay for them to introduce legislation which will lead to an effective increase in premiums of anywhere between 14 per cent and 43 per cent for people who have private health insurance cover-half the nation. That comes on top of this government seeking to introduce the world's biggest carbon tax, when no other economy in the world is imposing such a wet blanket on its economy. The government-owned insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover as a result of these changes. In addition-and this is the importance statistic-they predict that 92,500 will downgrade their cover. The minister claimed that across the whole system-not just across the Medibank Private membership but across everyone who holds private health insurance-only 27,000 would drop their coverage. Yet Medibank Private, the government-owned insurer, said that 37,000 of their own membership baseforget about those in BUPA or NIB or the other funds-will drop out of Medibank Private. So I think the government are left with very little credibility, both because of the fact that they lied to the Australian people on successive occasions in relation to this matter and because their statistics cannot be relied upon at all. It is interesting to look at some independent analysis of the changesthe Deloitte analysis, for argument's sake. They predict that, in the first year, 175,000 people would withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 people would downgrade their private cover. Over five years, they predict that 1.6 million Australians would drop cover and 4.3 million would downgrade their cover. This is, I think, at the crux of the difficulty the government are creating. This is a government which take solutions and turn them into problems. Look at the way border protection has been mismanaged over the course of the last four years. Look at the way this government took the bucket of money we left them and spent it, thrusting our economy and the Australian public into enormous debt. Look at the way they have mismanaged policy after policy-this is just the latest example. In our country we have a universal health system. That means that, regardless of whether you earn one dollar or a million dollars a year, if you have a heart attack, are involved in a motor vehicle accident, have a crook hip, need oncology treatment or whatever, you can turn up at a public hospital and demand treatment free of charge. That has been an underlying principle supported by both sides of this parliament for a very long period of timeand long may that be the case. A universal systems says to people that, in a country like ours in the 21st century, the best available services will be provided. Yet this government is driving people out of private health insurance. Given that, even if they are on high incomes, people can receive care for free in the public system, why would you seek to drive those 175,000 people out of private hospital cover into the public system-adding extra pressure to that system which already has many people waiting? It makes no sense. Why would the government not seek, as we did when we were in government, to leverage off people's own private investment so that ultimately it costs the taxpayer less to insure those in private health insurance who otherwise would be receiving so-called free care in the public system-a cost ultimately met by the Australian taxpayer in any case? The other important statistic in the Deloitte report-it has been borne out in other reports-is that over half a million people will downgrade their insurance. What does that mean? It says to younger people, by way of example, that you do not believe you are going to need cover for cardiology, or you are not going to need cover for a hip replacement, so you seek out those exclusions in your policy and that will make your policy cheaper, particularly in a situation where the government is going to drive up premiums. People will look to cut out of their policy what they think will not be applicable to them. With any insurance cover, trying to pick and choose what event will happen or what event needs to be covered is a very dangerous experiment. People-and Deloitte recognises this but the government by its own admission has not even modelled it-will downgrade their insurance by excluding some coverage so they can afford the increase in premiums that the government is going to impose upon them. Those people will seek out those services in the public hospitals. They will line up with people who have no chance of affording private hospital cover or private health insurance. That will make things more difficult for those who are most in need, who should be accessing services in our public hospitals. That is one of the greatest of the bill before the House. Any rational thinking Australian or contributor to this debate would recognise that this government is on a slippery slope. It is quite easily described as being completely out of control. If we drive Australians from the private health sector into the public sector a couple of things will happen. The first people to leave private health insurance will be the youngest and those who do not believe they need the cover. This will have an impact on all Australians who hold private health insurance, and indirectly it will impact on every Australian because those who do not have private health insurance will access their health needs through the public system. If you are a 21-year-old and you have pressures at the moment because you have had your overtime cut back at work or you have other cost-of-living pressures, you will start to look to cut back on discretionary spending. You will say you cannot afford your private health insurance-the government has just jacked up the price of it by 14 per cent, or something of that order, so you will downgrade your cover or you will drop your cover altogether. What happens with any insurance pool is that once those who are at the lowest risk leave it will be those who remain-by definition those with higher risk and a greater likelihood of claiming; those people who are more likely to be older Australians or those who suffer from chronic disease or conditions that require constant health care-who are hit with premium increases over the longer term. The fact that this government has not factored any of that into its costings just shows that this is not about good health outcomes; it is about trying to address yet another Labor deficit. It is important to note that the change will have an impact on access to allied health services, with 2.8 million people with outrages general treatment cover expected to withdraw and 5.7 million expected to downgrade over five years. The government claims that PHI is fast-growing and the 30 per cent rebate is growing at too fast a rate. When we analyse those figures we see that that is another Labor Party lie. Over, say, the last 10 years the proportion of the government spend on health has, in general terms, remained constant. The rebate represents about 3½ per cent of total public and private health care-the same as it did 10 years ago. Private health insurance is not on an unsustainable path. It is important that those who sit on the crossbenches in this parliament understand this message. For argument's sake, in the seat of Denison 60 per cent of residents are covered by private health insurance. I have found the member for Denison to be a very reasonable person to deal with and I am sure he will recognise that, when 60 per cent of his electorate is covered by private health insurance, by definition it is a very important issue. I know that the member for Denison is thinking very carefully about his position in this debate. I ask him to think even more carefully about those families in his electorate that will face higher premiums if this bill receives safe passage through the parliament. These people in the seat of Denison will drop their private health insurance and they will face higher out-ofpocket expenses; these people in the seat of Denison will ultimately be paying higher premiums for their private health insurance. The member for Denison is a person of strong and upstanding character and I think he will ultimately stare down this legislation. When he has a look at the independent analysis that has been released only in the last little while, as I understand it, he that the Labor Party's claim that this is unsustainable over the course of the next 10 years is a lie. If we can dispel that myth and put to bed this argument that somehow the 30 per cent rebate will go into unsustainable territory over the next 20 or 30 or 40 yearsfigures projected by Treasury but that frankly cannot be relied upon as they are presented by the government-then I think the member for Denison will re-examine the claims made by the government and he will reassess his position in this debate. I want to thank all those members who have contributed, both publicly and in the chamber, to this debate, because it is a very important debate. It is about the future of the health system in this country. When Kevin Rudd promised that he was going to fix public hospitals-his words, not mine-by mid 2009, that a revolution was going to take place and that the federal government would seek a mandate at the 2010 election to take control of public hospitals if they were not fixed by mid 2009, people actually believed him. People within his own caucus and people within the Australian public believed that Labor was serious when it came to health. The reason Labor is currently behind in all the polling on the issue of management of health is that people know that while Labor may well start out with good intent it has no capacity to deliver the reform of public hospitals. This Prime Minister has signed up to something because she is desperate-but not for a good health outcome. She put pen to paper on an agreement with the states because she wanted to be able to say to the Australian public: 'I've at least achieved something. I've just got this one agreement, after all these months of being the Prime Minister of this country.' When you look at the detail, the government has signed up to give the state will see governments, both Liberal and Labor, a bucketful of money for public hospitals. The states were of course keen to sign up, because they saw a seller in distress. They saw a Prime Minister who was desperate to get an agreement under her belt, so they took her for a ride. The states got the extra money, which is what they wanted, but they signed up essentially to business as usual. So, as happened at a state level when Labor was in control in New South Wales and as is happening in Queensland at the momentalthough that is very quickly about to change-the Labor Party at the federal level is seeking to spend more health dollars, not on private health and not even on the public system but on health bureaucrats. So the one crowning achievement of Labor in health over the course of the last four years has been that it has been able to dramatically increase the number of public servants in the health department but has not been able to improve health outcomes for mums, dads, children, pensioners and older Australians across the country. And that is the threshold question. People need to ask: 'Is it easier to get into a public hospital? Do I have a shorter time to wait with my sick child at three or four o'clock in the morning if I turn up to an emergency department? Is it easier to get into see my GP than it was before Labor was elected? Is it easier to get hip surgery done for my grandmother or mother, who has been on a waiting list for the last 12 or 18 months? Is it easier today to have any of those services performed than it was four years ago?' And the answer to each of those questions is no. This government has promised so muchnot just in the area of health but across all public policies it is responsible for-yet it has delivered so little. That is why I am angry, as are tens of thousands of Australians who just cannot afford private health insurance. We do not know what figures to believe for the purposes of this debate. Yesterday the minister was out saying that 100,000 people might drop out, or 85,000, or the figure of 37,000 that they used before. This government has not properly modelled the outcomes or the impacts of this policy. It tries to make us believe, and has said to the crossbenchers in this parliament-I think quite mischievously-that somehow we as a country cannot afford our expenditure on the 30 per cent rebate and that therefore the crossbenchers should vote in favour of this legislation. This government just does not have the runs on the board to be credible with the Australian public or with the Independents in this place, whom it wants to support this legislation. To members who will be considering their position on this bill in the coming days, I say: please, look at Labor's record when it comes to health. They promised to fix the public health system, and they have failed dismally. They promised to cut waiting lists, and they have failed dismally. They promised to deliver so-called GP superclinics so that we could relieve pressure on emergency departments. They have wasted $650 million on that program, and they cannot point to one hospital where there has been a reduction in waiting times for people who turn up at the emergency department. This is a government that promises that there will be minimal impact from the changes it is talking about. If there are going to be minimal changes, why is the government saving $2 billion plus with this policy? If people are not going to drop out of private health insurance or are not going to the downgrade their cover, where do the savings come from? How is this such a savings measure if it is not going to impact on anybody? And why would we seek to drive out of health insurance those people who can leverage off their own investment into the public sector, where the taxpayer will be picking up every dollar of expenditure regardless of that individual's income? Look at Labor's record. Look at the fact that in successive elections they promised they would not do what they are seeking to do today. Look at the fact that then Minister Roxon said to this parliament and looked the Australian people in the eye and said that the Labor Party would not introduce these changes, yet today it seeks to do so. I say to the Independents: please look at the independent analysis-particularly the report by Booz & Company, a highly respected firm in this country-which says that the claims of Treasury and the government are spurious at best and that this legislation is going to have a major detrimental impact on the way in which we conduct private health insurance in this country. I say to the Independents: once you have assessed all that data you will be left, as I am, with no other option but to vote this bill down. This government has betrayed the Australian people on many issues. This Prime Minister betrayed Kevin Rudd. This Prime Minister betrayed the Australian public when it came to the carbon tax-she said there would be no carbon tax under her government. This Prime Minister has betrayed the Australian people when she said she would not trash private health insurance, and this bill should be voted down as a result. (Time expired)",50
26,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I extend my thanks to you, Deputy Speaker, for taking the chair to permit me to participate in this debate. The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 is about fairness. It is about striking the right balance in how we spend our public dollars. So often in public life we campaign on and speak about all the good things that government can do-and it is true that the potential of government to do good things is great-but ultimately we have to face trade-offs. Governing is really more about questions of 'or' than You see that very much with the coalition at the moment, mired in their $70 billion black hole-the equivalent of stopping Medicare for four years or the pension for two yearssimply because they have been unable to make the hard choices. But we are making the hard choices, and one of those is to recognise that money that currently goes into subsidising higher income Australians to take up private health insurance could be better spent in the Australian government system, including on important healthcare measures. Those opposite want you to think that the government is against private health insurance. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is another part of the opposition's ongoing scare campaign to suggest that the government is against private provision of health, much as the opposition often suggest we are against the private provision of education. It is not true at all. The private health system is an important part of the Australian healthcare system. But with this bill we are recognising that the government need not subsidise the private health care of millionaires. It is not vital to a millionaire that they receive a 30 per cent private health insurance rebate in order for them to take up private health insurance. The first people to take up private health insurance were millionaires. Those millionaires will have that private health insurance when their 30 per cent rebate is not there. That is true even as we move down the income scale. We have strong evidence that the take-up of private health insurance did not increase markedly when the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate was put in. In fact, the policy change that substantially increased the take-up of private health insurance was the Lifetime Health Cover reform. Lifetime Health Cover had a much bigger impact on the take-up of private health insurance than did the 30 per questions of 'and'. cent rebate. In putting in place this fair and equitable reform to the health system, Labor are doing as we always do, ensuring that Australia's healthcare system looks after the most disadvantaged in the community. It was us that introduced Medibank under the Whitlam government in 1975 and it was us that rebuilt that system into Medicare under the Hawke government in 1983-84, after the original Medibank had been trashed by the Fraser government. We believe in making sure that all Australians receive high-quality health care. Too often those opposite appear to be taking their cues from their colleagues in the United States, from US Republicans willing to laugh at low-income Americans who do not have health coverage. But that is not the Labor way. We believe that we need to have a healthcare system that recognises that good quality health care is about making sure that that people can participate in society. If you do not have good quality health care, you are unlikely to be able to hold down a job and you are unlikely to be able to participate fully in the social life of the community. So health care is, like education, a critical underpinning of a fair society. Under this bill, the private health insurance rebate for lowand middle-income earners will remain unchanged. Higher income earners will receive a reduced rebate. As income increases, the private health insurance rebate will progressively fall. This will ensure savings to the government of $2.4 billion over the three years 2012-13 to 2014-15 and it will provide a fairer distribution of the benefits of the healthcare system. My own electorate of Fraser has above average incomes in Australia but, even so, the number of people who will not receive the private health insurance rebate is very small. I am informed that the number of singles in my electorate who will no longer receive the private health insurance rebate is 2,220 and the number of couples is 740-a relatively small number in an electorate whose total population is now pushing up towards 200,000. We do not expect this bill to lead to any substantial change in private health insurance coverage. We have modelling from Treasury which finds that 99.7 per cent of people will remain in private health insurance, as a result of the fact that we still have incentives such as Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare levy surcharge. So as a result of this there will be $2.4 billion additional into the budget to be spent on better healthcare initiatives and a minuscule change in private health insurance coverage. The scare campaign the opposition is running need not be rebutted just by Treasury figures, sound as they are; Professor Elizabeth Savage, a health economist at the University of Technology, Sydney, has done considerable work in this area. Her research shows strong evidence of habit persistence, so the take-up of private health insurance is likely to endure because those who already have private health insurance will continue down the same road. Professor Savage also finds that meanstesting the private health insurance rebate will not increase pressure on the public hospital system-another furphy, another scare campaign, from those opposite. There are nearly eight million private health insurance policyholders who will not be affected by the changes at all. After these changes, as I have said, 99.7 per cent of people will remain in private health insurance. This allows us to have another $2.4 billion over the next three years. What will that get spent on? You can expect it to be spent on services such as improvements in the hospital system. From 1 January this year, we are ensuring that every state improves the proportion of emergency department patients seen within four hours. Recent academic research published in the Medical Journal of Australia has shown that that will save lives. We are expanding Medicare Locals to integrate the sectors and make sure that patients get holistic care. We are putting in place local hospital networks, making sure that decisions about hospital management are devolved to the local level. Many of these reforms will save lives. Ultimately, that is what great health care does. The opposition would rather have private health insurance rebates for millionaires than have a healthcare system that saves more lives. We are delivering mental health reform. We are rolling out additional headspace centres and EPPIC centres. We are also looking at mental health reform across the life cycle. We are committed to putting in place the groundwork for a national disability insurance scheme, a scheme that, when it was first proposed by the Productivity Commission, the opposition said that they supported. But they are now unwilling to support that in the short term. The coalition are walking away from expanding support for people with disabilities, despite the fact that their spokesperson on disability, Senator Fifield, acknowledges that the current system is a patchwork system that contains many anomalies for people with disabilities and their carers. The coalition would again prefer to subsidise the private health insurance of millionaires rather than begin putting in place a national disability insurance scheme. Politics is about choices. Ours is national disability insurance ahead of subsidising the private health insurance of millionaires. Theirs puts subsidising the private health insurance of millionaires before better disability care. We are building a stronger age care sector. We recognise that the age care system is in urgent need of reform and that if we do not do something to improve it the sector will face considerable strain as the baby boomers reach retirement and increasingly look for places in age care homes. Politics is about values and what you value. What you prioritise in government shows what you value. During the global financial crisis, we chose to save 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses. They say that they would not have taken on debt, meaning that they would have cut back on government spending in the face of the global downturn, throwing Australia into deep recession. On taxes, we are delivering pension rises and income tax cuts for working households through our Clean Energy Future package. Under a Tony Abbott government, the only people who would get tax cuts would be big miners and big polluters. You can see the same in education. We are investing in low-income schools through the low SES national partnership. The Gonski review will ensure a fairer system for providing federal government funding to schools. We recognise that it is important to support need. If there is any rebalancing of schools assistance, they immediately launch a fear campaign. They immediately suggest that what we are doing is creating a schools 'hit list'. Nothing could be further from the truth. Since Labor came to office there has been modest growth in the Public Service in the order of around 11,000 additional public servants, a rate of growth slower than the final years of the Howard government. We recognise that a strong Public Service is vital to delivering services such as better health care. But those opposite would make 12,000 public servants redundant, a commitment that the member for North Sydney again made on the Q&A program this week. In that program, the member for North Sydney said that there were 6,500 people working in the Department of Health and Ageing and appeared not to be sure what they did. I can say two things about that. First of all, there are about 5,100 people working in the Department of Health and Ageing, a small increase of about 300 since the Leader of the Opposition was minister for health. As the member for North Sydney could find out if he spoke to, say, the Leader of the Opposition, the Department of Health and Ageing does enormously important work. They are working on things like the private health insurance rebates, preventative health and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I commend the work of the department of health officials that has gone into preparing this package of reforms. We on this side recognise that the Department of Health and Ageing does valuable work. Those on that side of the House would be happy to cut the department of health. I will be interested to hear in subsequent contributions if the member for Dickson supports the views of the member for North Sydney that in fact, were the opposition to be elected government, he should preside as minister for health over a department that employed no-one whatsoever. Does the member for Dickson believe that the Department of Health and Ageing should be scrapped? If so, what portfolio would he then seek to retain? The contrast in Australian politics could not be clearer. The opposition is always saying yes to special interests and always saying no to tax reform. The contrast can be seen nowhere more clearly than in the area of dental health. Professor Jeff Richardson, from the Centre for Health Economics at Monash University, has found that 17 per cent of the people in the lowest income group have no teeth compared to 0.3 per cent of high income people. This is from an AM interview on 8 December 2011. Yet those in the lowest income categories are receiving much less assistance to get dental care than those in the highest income categories. Those in the highest income categories have 30 per cent of their dental care bill paid for by the Australian taxpayer through the private health insurance rebate. Labor believes that is the wrong way to balance our health system. We believe that we ought to be spending less on the teeth of millionaires and more on the teeth of the most disadvantaged Australians. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",57
27,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," I rise for the third time to speak on this bill and to condemn it in the strongest possible language. This is a bill that is seeking to means test, ostensibly to put out of reach of many families, the rebate relating to private health insurance. The reason I condemn this bill absolutely is that it is a complete and utter breach of promise and breach of faith. Prior to the 2007 election, when the current government came to power, the then shadow health minister, now Attorney-General, Minister Roxon, on 26 September 2007 said: Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing Private Health Insurance rebates ... In fact, I think there were four timesthree by Minister Roxon, once by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd-where the federal Labor made it abundantly clear, a promise: 'Federal Labor has made it crystal clear' were the words the minister used-'crystal clear', written in blood, so to speak: they were committed to retaining all the existing private health insurance rebates. And here we are, for the third time in four years, because this government, in an absolute and utter, complete-but not unprecedentedbreach of faith and complete break of a promise, has now decided that 'crystal clear' actually means 'muddy and opaque'. It is no wonder that they are breaking another promise to the Australian people. It was a mere six days before an election when the Prime Minister, to win the election, said that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Treasurer Swan, at a subsequent interview, made it perfectly clear that this 'overblown rhetoric of the Liberal Party' that somehow Labor would introduce a carbon tax was completely false, and a few weeks later, in a move of utter duplicity, that was rolled back. So it is not unprecedented that such a promise would be broken. But how can the federal health minister walk into this chamber, the House of Representatives of the nation, where 150 men and women gather from all four corners of our land, after she has made a comment that 'Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing Private Health Insurance rebates'. What she meant to say was, 'We are going to make it crystal clear we have absolutely and utterly no commitment to our promises; we will not retain any of the key elements and articles of faith that we say. When they say 'all the existing' they mean 'partial', 'some' or perhaps even 'none', and 'We have absolutely no concern for the private health insurance of ordinary Australians'. These cuts underline the completely and utterly botched attempts at health reform. We all remember Prime Minister Rudd putting out that wonderful colour brochure before the 2007 election, with a picture of the Prime Minister saying, 'The buck stops with me on health! I'll fix health. If this is not fixed within 18 months I'll go for a referendum on taking over full control of health'. Another broken promise from the government. Where is the referendum? Where is the 'I'll fix health'? Has the buck left the building? Who is taking responsibility? This was followed up, of course, with the great commitment on sorting out health, taking 30 per cent of the GST from the states, putting in three new bureaucracieswhere has all that gone? This government's attempt at health reform has been botched, has been bungled and has been duplicitous from the very beginning. This government never had any intention of fulfilling any of their promises in health. I have listened to the debate this morning and all I have heard are Labor members of parliament rattle off a whole range of ancillary decisions that have been made in health, somehow to pretend that they are committed to having a sound vision and a long-term plan for where they are going when, in reality, this is simply the politics of division, of some farcical class warfare that we have to take away the private health insurance rebate and nationalise and socialise health in terms of one size fits all. But be under no doubt: these changes, apart from being duplicitous in the extreme, will force people to drop private health insurance cover or to choose cheaper cover. They will put enormous upwards pressure on insurance premiums and will force more people into overstretched public hospital systems, systems like those in the Gold Coast Hospital, from where I come, where 46 per cent of people who go into Emergency hit access block, right now-that is a statement of fact. That means they will spend eight hours waiting, or on a trolley, before going into a hospital bed. And it is this system, broken by Labor state administrations, that this government wants to force more Australians onto. And for what sound reason, may I ask? Because somehow, those people who have taken out private health insurance are, what, wealthy beyond measure? Are they not deserving of any assistance in any way, shape or form? You want to force decent, hard working Australians who take out private health insurance, in many ways because they have little faith in the current administrations Labor have presided over and pushed them onto a hospital system at a state level that is struggling. It is a blatant cost-shifting measure from the Commonwealth to the states' public systems. This measure will not just be felt by those on supposedly higher incomes. It will not just be felt by those who incur an up-to 43 per cent increase in their premiums. It will be felt by everyone who will incur those cost increases. It will be felt by all Australians with private health insurance, who face higher premiums into the future. We believe everyone should have access to affordable healthcare. We believe everyone should have access to choice in healthcare. We are strongly support providing all Australians with that choice through affordable private health insurance if they wish to take it out. As a result of the introduction of the private health insurance rebate under the previous coalition government, the Medicare levy surcharge and lifetime health cover, private health insurance coverage increased from 34 per cent in 1996 to 44 per cent in 2007-a 33 per cent increase, a staggering increase in Australians who elected for choice. Every dollar of funding provided for the private health insurance rebate saves $2 of costs that are then paid by private health insurers-so says Econtech Pty Ltd, Harper Associates and Hagan. Private hospitals right now treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia-40 per cent. In 2009-10 private hospitals treated 3.5 million patients. Private hospitals performed the majority of elective surgery in Australia-64 per cent-and 10.2 million people, or about 45 per cent, have private health insurance. It is interesting when you look at how private health insurance works. In preparation for this debate, I had discussions with the CEO of the Sisters of Charity hospital in Brisbane and the CEO of the UnitingCare hospital system. It is interesting that, for every seven cliniciansdoctors or nurses-they have, there are three nonclinicians, administrative staff. And then we have Queensland Health, for 18 years presided over by the Labor government. Queensland Health has 64,000 employees. Why? Because in the enterprise bargain with the union the first line says, 'You cannot reduce below 64,000.' The union is not interested in reform or productivity; it is interested in union jobs. For every three clinicians, there are seven nonclinicians. So private hospitals and private health doing the bulk of elective surgery and treating 40 per cent of all patients. In the private hospitals that I have spoken to in Queensland, there are seven clinicians for three nonclinicians. In the public system, there are three clinicians for every seven nonclinicians. It does not take a rocket scientist to work out what the problem is in our public health system presided over by Labor administrations. The waste is beyond measure. And this government wants to force more and more people into that untenable, poorly managed system. The impact will be significant. Two and half million people will be directly impacted by these changes and will face immediate increases in premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent and 43 per cent in the respective income tiers. So 2.4 million people will be impacted. It is not as if the cost-of-living increases are not already striking Australian families. Electricity prices, since this government came to power, have increased by 51 per cent, gas prices by over 20 per cent, food prices by over 20 per cent and rents by the same types of quantums. Wherever this government has gone, so too has the cost of living. Now this government wants to do it to 2.4 million Australians and put enormous pressure on the existing public hospital system because, in its class struggle view, these Australians are wealthy and do not deserve assistance from the Commonwealth. The government owned insurer, Medibank Private-the government's own insurer-has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and 92½ thousand will downgrade. This is considerably more than the 27,000 the minister has claimed, so I am not too sure where the minister is getting her advice from-perhaps from her press secretary; we know how well Labor press secretaries are doing of late! Deloitte analysis of the changes showed that in the are first year 175,000 people are expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 to downgrade. Over five years, it is expected that 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. The government has not disclosed the numbers of people expected to downgrade but, as premiums increase significantly for those in the income tiers, it is reasonable to expect they will seek cheaper products, which will have a whole range of second-round effects on public hospitals. Deloitte continues to predict that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be, in the initial phases. There will be $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public sector. Where will the public sector get that from? Look at Queensland, my home state. The Labor government have been there for over 18 years. The credit rating of the government has been downgraded. Why? Because their public debt on their balance sheet is now $40 billion, with a further $43 billion on the balance sheets of the government owned entities. In the last 18 years the Labor government have gone from a zero debt position to $87 billion in net debt at a state government level, a level of debt that is almost unable to be paid back when you look at the structure of the government's fiscal position. Indeed, Defence, including Veterans' Affairs, spends as much money in terms of budget allocation as the government in Queensland do-to give you an idea of where they are going. Then again, we should not wonder at that, considering the fiscal position four years ago of the Commonwealth. Public net debt was zero, with $60 billion in the Future Fund and $40 billion either in the bank or in the surplus. Now, in a staggering turnaround, we are at $133-odd billion in net debt-a staggering turnaround in public finances. These changes will have a huge impact across the nation. But, more importantly, the changes are symptomatic of the Labor government's view of where things are going. This is just one more in the tragic litany of broken promises. I remind all Australians of what this government said prior to the 2007 election, what it said publicly, what it put in writing in its media releases and what the Prime Minister to be and the health minister to be said. They could not have been clearer, just as the Prime Minister could not have been clearer when she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and three weeks later she broke that promise. Prior to that election, the Prime Minister to be and the Minister for Health and Ageing to be said, 'Federal Labor have made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing private health insurance rebates.' They had no intention of keeping that promise. They had no intention of keeping it at allMr Mitchell interjecting",61

Question agreed to. NA Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",64
32,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise to speak against this bill before the chamber, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011, which is another broken promise from this Labor government. Worse than that, it reflects more about the internal machinations of the prime ministership of our country than it does about a genuine attempt to bring about good reform and productivity-increasing changes to our economy. This is a deal with the Left of the Labor Party and the Greens party to ensure that this Prime Minister is propped up for just a little bit longer to hold the Minister Foreign Affairs at bay. It was promised before the 2007 election that this would not be changed, but we know and we knew then that the powers within the union movement, the millions of dollars of donations they receive from these unions, would eventually hold sway and this bill would be introduced and the powers of the ABCC would be gutted absolutely. The ABCC has actually been effective. It has done what the royal commission sought it to do when it handed down its report in February 2003, some nine years ago now. It did take some time for the Howard government to get the necessary reforms in place, and in 2005 they were able to get through these reforms, and they were good reforms. They sought to bring the rule of law back into an industry which had been marked by complete disregard for the normal laws of our country for too long. That had an effect not just on the operators in that industry but also on the prices of properties that Australians had to pay for, which of course impacts on the economy and reduces the amount of money that people are able to spend on other productive things. It impacts on inflation and impacts on the employment prospects of many Australians. The royal commission found that this industry was plagued by behaviour that was just unacceptable in a modern society. It was plagued by violence, by corruption, by the use of threats to stand over contractors, to stand over companies. It has to be said that the royal commission found some of the same behaviour by some of those companies involved also. This industry had operated like a jungle with the rule of the jungle for too long and it took extraordinary laws, absolutely extraordinary powers, for this industry to be brought back under control. What we have now seen is that this Labor government is desperate to hang on, for obsessed with itself, obsessed with one job, the job of the person who sits next to the dispatch box. The current occupant, the member for Blaxland, hopes to be there one day too, it must be noted. This is a deal with the Greens, a deal with the Left of the Labor Party, to ensure the stability of this Prime Minister for just a little bit longer. This is something the Labor Party very clearly said they would not do. They said that they would not change the ABCC. They said they would not gut this important cop on the beat. They said they would not bow to the millions of dollars they get from these trade unions to influence this policy, to change this policy which has changed behaviour in this industry, which has ensured that this industry is once again competitive, is once again able to produce high quality at lower cost, reducing the pressure on consumers and reducing the pressure on the taxpayers, it must be said. Someone not often spoken about that in this place anymore is the taxpayer and their money being used properly. We know that the government is not all that interested in spending money properly or wisely. That is why we have seen a deterioration in the Australian Commonwealth finances from a $20 billion surplus in 2006-07 to now nearly $140 billion in net debt, $300 billion in gross debt, and blowing out day after day. This is part of the problem we see, this reregulation in this area. We have seen this day after day over the Christmas period and most of last yearand some people have been making this point for a while-that the changes made in the workplace relations area, including in this particular area, are doing enormous damage to our future prospects as a nation, our future productive capacity as a nation. The member for MCEwen may shake his head, but I do not think Marius Kloppers lies. I do not think there is any need for Marius Kloppers to lie. I do not think the head of Toyota lies. We hear much about the car industry from those on the other side. We hear much about how great the car industry is, how it must be saved, that we have to keep co-investing to ensure we save it. But we knew nothing about the microeconomic reforms which actually would ensure its survival, ensuring that people can be employed at reasonable rates of pay and reasonable conditions-but not in the position where the union movement in this country is given such power that it is able to bring massive corporations to their knees. That is what we are seeing with BHP with the coking-coal dispute in Queensland. We are seeing a massive global corporation employing hundreds of thousands of people, one of Australia's great prosperity drivers",64
33,Mr Mitchell,BILLS,"You can't even keep a straight face when you say that, Jamie.",66
34,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,Being sledged by the member for MCEwen is an interesting experience. Mr Mitchell interjecting,66
35,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"This sort of gutter behaviour of the member for MCEwen and the language he uses in this place reflect exactly where they are. We saw that on Australia Day and we see it with the member for MCEwen and his behaviour today. I think the voters will see it very soon, Mr Deputy Speaker. The reregulation, the changes that the Labor Party have made to Australian workplace law, driven by people like the member for MCEwen, are impacting enormously on the disputation in our nation. They are impacting enormously on the to employment capacity of thousands of small businesses, and now we are seeing it with our biggest employers. The people these people pretend they stand for are being affected by the laws that they put in place. We will see it no worse than what we see with this bill, which is again a broken promise-from a government you cannot trust and a Prime Minister who said 'There would be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' This is exactly the same broken promise-the same as the broken promise that the member for Denison has gone through in the last few weeks with the pokies change, which we always said they would never go ahead with. Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting",66
36,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"We always said they would not go ahead with it, Laurie. You know that, mate. We always said that. All was promised to ensure that one job in this country. The chair the minister currently at the table is sitting in is all the Labor Party is interested in. This bill is a backdown on a promise because of a demand of the Greens and a demand of the Left of the Labor Party. Reflecting back on the building industry royal commission, I will remind the House of some of the key findings it handed down in 2003. It found: … structural changes are necessary to ensure that bargaining at the enterprise level occurs. At present, it does not. Pattern bargaining in this industry should be prohibited by statute. It was prohibited by those changes. It will be undone by these changes. It also said: … mechanisms should be in place to ensure that any participant in the industry causing loss to other participants as a result of unlawful industrial action is held responsible for that loss. They were by the Building Commission reforms. They will not be by these changes. It further said: … mechanisms must be in place to ensure that where disputes occur within the industry, such disputes are resolved in accordance with legislated or agreed dispute resolution mechanisms rather than by the application of industrial and commercial pressure. The 'rule of law' must replace industrial might. That is exactly what the building industry reforms in 2005 were about. It is what they have achieved since 2005 in this industry. They brought back into the normal practice of rule of law the normal behaviour expected by ordinary Australians and by other industries across this nation. These changes will reintroduce the behaviour where contractors were stood over and contracts demanded union participation on sites. These are the sorts of provisions we will see again when this is all removed. The cost will be borne by Australians. It will not be borne by the Australian Labor Party; it will be borne by Australians. The royal commission recommendations went on to say: … there needs to be an independent body, free of the pressures on the participants in the industry, which will ensure that participants comply with industrial, civil and criminal laws applicable to all Australians, and thus operating on building and construction sites, as well as industry specific laws applicable to this industry only. These are very specific provisions. What the royal commission found was so shocking that these eminent people decided that there had to be specific provisions to deal with this industry because it was in such a bad state. It was costing Australians so much more because of the behaviour of participants in the industry. The findings highlight exactly what it was trying to achieve and exactly what the Howard government's bills did in 2005, which was to bring back the rule of law and bring in an independent body with a specific group of people looking at the law to ensure that this industry once again was brought back to productiveness and was governed by acceptable community standards of behaviour in industrial relations in this country. It was a cultural issue as well as a legal issue and it needed and continues to need specific attention. Removing the watchdog, the cop on the beat, in this industry, as we see in this bill, will do untold damage to the productive capacity of this industry at a time when we should be looking at how we can become more productive. We should be looking at how we can free up our economy. This measure will again encourage the worse of the behaviours, as we are now seeing on worksites around this country, whether it be BHP, Toyota or the thousands of small businesses that every day face increased activity by the union movement. That puts untold pressure on thousands of businesses and jobs and on our economy when we need to be finding ways to be more competitive. The reforms at the broader workplace relations level were always going to be a disaster from the very moment they were put in place. We know that because we see it every day now on the front page of the Financial Review and the Australian and as we move around our country. There is immense fear in the eyes of Australians over their job security, because of the changes this government is putting in place. It is a real and genuine concern for the future of our country. These laws are continually being made more union-friendly and friendly to specific interests rather than being for the broader economic goals of all Australians. This is exactly what we are seeing with this bill. It is more about the Labor Party and its internal machinations and about rewarding its mates. It is about rewarding those who have donated millions of dollars over time to ensure that they get to write policies for the Australian Labor Party. What it is not about is finding ways to ensure that this industry can continue to be competitive in a modern economy and in a flat world. Instead what these people are trying to do is create a circumstanceMr Laurie Ferguson: Flat world?",66
37,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"The members opposite seem to think that you can just continue to apply standards to industry that are far above what is affordable in the future, and the building industry is a perfect example of that. If you let unions run rampant, if you let unlawful behaviour run rampant, as it has historically-and the royal commission found this-you will find that there will be fewer Australians employed, it will cost more and our productivity will continue to go down, as we are seeing right now. This is an important bill. If it passes, this industry will go back to the bad old days of the past. It will go back to where people could not go to work to achieve good outcomes and a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. They will go to work and be bullied and intimidated and exposed to the worse excesses of an industry that has been guided by lawlessness in the past. This bill should not be allowed to pass for that reason. The agency has done an excellent job, firstly under the leadership of John Lloyd, who was an outstanding Australian and an outstanding thinker in these areas. He did an outstanding job in bringing this industry back from the very worse excesses we had seen for so long. You have to ask yourself what the motive is for this bill. Is it about making a better industry or is it about rewarding mates? Is it about rewarding those who have donated so much for so long, rewarding those who sit on the back benches of the Australian Labor Party and rewarding those who help prop the government up? The answer to all those questions is that it is about the Labor Party and the prime ministership; it is not about the good productive capacity of our economy for the future. It should be opposed in the strongest terms.",68
38,Mr MITCHELL,BILLS," Isn't it a pleasure to follow the Barbara Cartland of Australian politics, the member for Mayo, with his romantic fiction about how big and bad the world is going to be when we have a fairer workplace, harking back to the good old days as the architect of Work Choices-the man whose idea of fair work in this country is you work hard and he will take the money? It is an absolute joke to have him stand there and conjure up all these thoughts of dark clouds and the world falling down because what we want to do is let industry and workers have a workplace that is fairer to give everyone a go. I am very pleased to be able to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 because it is built on the foundations of what is great about the Labor Party: fairness in the workplace. On this side of the House, we know how important the building and construction industry is and how in turn this industry has directly helped to create jobs and boosted our economy during the global financial crisis, and which continues to strengthen and grow the economy today. Not only has our nation-building plan, with projects such as the Building the Education Revolution, kept our economy strong, it has also kept Australian workers in jobs, with their families getting food on their table and paying their mortgage payments and their bills and still having a lifestyle during the global downturn. The delivery of our nation-building projects is reliant on the construction industry and that is why it is pleasing to speak on a bill which abolishes the Howard government's Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. Despite what was said earlier, this bill will deliver on Labor's commitment to replace the ABCC with a new body which provides a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry. The ABCC is not a suitable regulator and needs to be replaced with a new body which is part of the mainstream Fair Work system and it will operate in harmony with community expectations of a fair and just workplace relations system. As the Prime Minister has previously stated, this bill will ensure that new regulator is established to provide information, advice and assistance to all building industry participants regarding their rights and obligations under the law, as well as seek to improve the standards of occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry. The government appointed Justice Murray Wilcox QC, a person of very high standing, to consult and report on the matters related the creation of a new building industry inspectorate to regulate the construction industry and, after Justice Wilcox's extensive consultation with all stakeholders, we are now moving to deliver on abolishing the ABCC and establishing a new fair regulator. The bill honours the government's commitment and gives effect to the principal recommendations in the Wilcox report. The bill aims to provide fairness in the industry by ensuring that information, advice and assistance is available to all participants in connection with their rights and obligations under all the relevant laws. It also provides effective ways for investigation and enforcement of the relevant laws while balancing the rights of the building industry participants through the provision of appropriate safeguards in relation to the use of enforcement powers. The bill seeks to improve the level of occupational health and safety in the building industry, something that we on this side of the House are very mindful of. We want to make sure that when people go to work they go to a safe workplace and they can come home to their families. That is why this bill is important, to ensure that we do see the OH&S standards lifted. The bill also retains the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner and its related accreditation scheme, which have resulted in demonstrated improvements in the OH&S practices and records of accredited companies and related projects. The creation a of the building industry inspectorate will work in compliance with the general workplace relations laws, as prescribed in the Fair Work Act 2009, by all-that is important-building industry participants. The ABCC showed the contempt that the Liberal Party has for workers. Let us remember that the ABCC in conjunction with Work Choices illustrates the lack of respect those opposite have for the to hard working men and women of Australia. They have never supported them and we know they never will. It is not in their DNA. Think about the data that was collected during the dark days of the Howard Liberal government. The results of the data that they wanted collected were so bad that the Liberal government went to the Office of Employment Advocate and said, 'Stop collecting the data. It's showing how bad it is. We've got to stop it immediately.' That was their way of hiding the truth: 'Let's just shut it down and hide it and no-one knows about it.' Once our new regulator is established it will have the powers and responsibilities to ensure that employers, their organisations, employees and trade unions all abide by their obligations under the law. As I have said, this bill will abolish the office of the ABCC and create a new agency, the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate, to regulate the building and construction industry. The bill implements the key recommendations of the Transition to Fair Work Australia for the Building and Construction Industry report by the Hon. Murray Wilcox QC. The bill removes existing higher penalties for building industry participants for breaches of industrial law and introduces safeguards in relation to the power to compulsorily obtain information and documents. It also creates an office, the Independent Assessor, who will determine, on application by stakeholders, that compulsory informationgathering powers will not apply to a project. In the development of this legislation, the government carried out very extensive consultation with industry, with unions and with state and territory governments in 200809 and Justice Wilcox also consulted widely with all stakeholders in the construction industry as part of his 2009 report. And while we do this, the opposition are still committed to pursuing their extreme workplace relations laws rather than ensuring lawful conduct by all parties in the building industry. It is our government, the Gillard government, that is continuing to support a fair and effective industrial relations system. We abolished Work Choices and created a balanced industrial relations system that has returned fairness to our workplaces while, at the same time, boosting our national productivity. This means that 2.8 million more Australians have protection against being unfairly sacked. As I travel through the electorate of MCEwen, I find that Australians are getting sick to death of the Leader of the Opposition saying no to everything. But it seems the one thing he can say yes to is Work Choices. Wherever you look it is deep in the hearts of those opposite. They cannot get rid of it. They want an unfair industrial relations policy. They can say it is 'dead, buried and cremated' but it rises again like Frankenstein. We know from their talk over the last six months that they have been thinking of reintroducing a Work Choices system. They do not want Australians to have a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. That is the crystal clear difference between us sitting on this side of the House and those who sit opposite. We want to make sure that everyone gets paid fairly. We want to make sure that for a hard day's work everyone is delivered a fair day's pay in a safe workplace. the Under the Howard Liberal government thousands of Australian workers were worse off. There were the unfair dismissal laws. The most vulnerable workers were forced onto those horrible things called AWAs. AWAs stripped away conditions like penalty rates, rest breaks and overtime-conditions that are so important for people who do not earn as much as we do. Those opposite decided to strip those conditions away from them to make sure that they could not afford that little bit extra for doing an extra bit of hard work. This is not something that the Leader of the Opposition shies away from. His only current policy seems to be Work Choices mark II. Let us go to a speech that he gave in 2001 to that interesting group called the Nicholls Society. He said: One of the most important Howard Government policies has been the introduction of Australian Workplace Agreements. He thinks it is a good thing that 64 per cent of the AWAs cut annual leave loading; 63 per cent cut penalty rates; 52 per cent cut shiftwork loading; 46 per cent cut public holiday pay; 40 per cent cut rest breaks; 36 per cent cut declared public holidays; and 22 per cent provided workers with no pay rises at all-none, and some for up to five years. They ripped off workers. It is an absolute disgrace that they sit there and say: 'We for workers now. We've turned over a new leaf.' They have not changed their spots at all. Give them two minutes on this side of the House and I can guarantee that they will be back to where they were under Work Choices, ensuring that we have a two-level society. It will be them taking the money and the rest of the country working hard and delivering the benefits into their pockets those of the shareholders. All data shows that our industrial system is working well. We have low unemployment. We have contained wages growth. We have low levels of industrial disputations and record levels of successful workplace agreements. Labor ended the AWA individual contracts that stripped away all the pay and conditions of hard working Australians. We established Fair Work Australia, an independent umpire-that is the key word, 'independent'-to help employees and employers resolve disputes in the workplace. The Fair Work Act is delivering the outcomes promised to Australians in Labor's Forward with Fairness election policy. It is delivering a record number of agreements, low unemployment and contained wages growth-all three are important to keep our economy growing. It has restored the balance to the industrial relations landscape in this country-a balance that was lost under the dreadful Work Choices. For all the heat the opposition attempt to create in industrial relations, the reality that there is precious little to support their Construction views. We have broadened the definition of pay equity so that it does not simply provide equal pay for equal work but provides equal pay for equal work value so that discrimination does not have to be proven as grounds for bringing a case forward. Labor has provided a fair minimum safety net for Australian employees consisting of 10 care national employment standards in a modern award system. Labor has helped young families with Australia's first Paid Parental Leave Scheme-a parental leave scheme that the Leader of the Opposition said would happen over his dead body-another promise he broke. Labor has extended the rights for unpaid parental leave in the National Employment and Standards. We have introduced a no disadvantage test to make sure that workplace agreements leave workers better off. We have restored protections from unfair dismissal to 2.8 million Australians. Seven million employees are now eligible for unfair dismissal claims-almost double what was available under Work Choices. We are out there protecting Australian workers and their families. We have streamlined and strengthened the general protections for workers with the freedom for them to choose to be represented in the workplace as a key part of our new system. We are not going to give ground when it comes to protecting the rights of working people. The Labor way is to support working Australians and the Liberal's way is to abandon them for big business. This legislation is an important step, an important policy, that we are delivering and we need to see it go through to ensure that we have safe and fair building and construction industry workplaces. I wish this bill a very speedy passage.",68
39,Mr KATTER,BILLS," The is last time a bill like the Building and Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 was introduced into the House a very good friend of mine was working on scaffolding and there was a problem. He lost his leg and he very nearly lost his life. before that legislation was introduced by the Liberal Party, I knew someone who had suffered in the industry and very nearly died. I was very honoured to see him in hospital. He was dying at that stage and only a few people were allowed into see him-but he recovered. Before the bill before us was introduced I attended a stop-work rally. A couple of very good candidates for our new party are very strong union representatives. They insisted that we go along to the stop-work meeting at the tunnels in Brisbane where a series of accidents had occurred. They demanded that I get up and give a speech. There were about 1,000 people at the meeting. I did not know that there was a person teetering between life and death-a man called Sam Beveridge. I did not know who he was. I just knew that there had been a series of accidents and the boys were entitled to go out on the grass about them because the situation was just getting worse, not better. There needed to be a public statement made. I lent whatever value I had in being there. Our state leader was also there. What I did not know was that this person, Sam Beveridge, was a very good friend of mine. I think he ran for mayor of Charters Towers, my home town. Both Frankie and Sam had been brought up with my own daughters and they are some of my best friends in the town and area. Frank is very fine young man. I did not know it was his brother, so it came home to me with a terrible vengeance that whilst I was out there just looking after John Doe, it was not John Doe-it was a person. In fact, both the boys had been very friendly with our family throughout their lives and Frank-Sam's brother-has been one of my closest people in the city of Charters Towers. Sam subsequently died. There are a lot of people on the Left but almost all the people on my right on the Right opposition benches do not have a remote understanding of how the real world works. When I was a union rep, briefly, in Mount Isa we had two health issues and one safety issue. I took them up with the foreman on the site and he did nothing about them, so I went racing off to my union-I will not mention which union it was-although the boys told me not to. But, being real smart at that ageI was in my late teens or early 20s-I knew everything about everything. I watched in horror as the union organiser came down, went up in the control room where it is all air conditioned-we were covered in lead dust from daylight to dark where I was working with my shovel over my shoulder-and pointed out to my bosses that I was the bloke making the complaints. I am ashamed to admit this, but I think I should: I pulled out on that because I was on huge money and was not going to give up my job. So we just had to go on in an unhealthy situation. I do not want to be very specific about it but there was wire netting. We had pretty bad dengue problems up in these areas and there were massive numbers of mosquitoes. Someone had got drunk and fallen through the wire netting and it needed to be fixed. On the work site, a shaker kept getting stuck so one of us had to jump on a flue and hit it with a sledge hammer and then let it move-you hoped-but often it did not. Then a bloke on the other side would hit it with a sledge hammer until, eventually we would break it free and it would start moving. But when it started moving it came back at you at about 60 miles an hour. Of course, if you stayed long enough on the flue leading up to it your leather boots would start to burn because it was extremely hot as well. It was an extremely dangerous situation and the damn shaker needed to be fixed. But, I am ashamed to say, I was intimidated. The reason this bill was introduced was to intimidate union officials so that they would go to water, like I did. We do not want our union officials being intimidated. They tell me-I do not remember it clearly-that there were terrible problems and excessive behaviour by some of the unions involved. Some of these people came across from the Painters and Dockers Union where there were serious problems, and I would be the first to admit that. I was well aware of that. those problems were there, they are ancient history and they are most certainly not there today. But even if they were, you do not start taking away basic freedoms. In Australia today, particularly in the states of Queensland and New South Wales, property rights are just a joke. I mean, you do not own your house; the Crown owns your house. Long, long ago, in 1215 at a place called Runnymede, we stood the Crown up and said, 'Listen, Mr Crown, you are not grabbing us off the street any longer and dragging us to one of your dungeons. You will only take us through due process of law that you, Mr State, will not control.' What does this bill do? Exactly that. We can grab you, take you away and put you in a room. You have no rights, you have got to do that, and when you are in that room you will tell us what we want to know and if you do not we will leave you in that room indefinitelyit is called a jail. In this place it amazes me that nobody seems to read any books. They do not seem to have any knowledge of history. They do not understand that the most basic concepts upon which our society is built. I said to an Attorney-General in the government-no, I will not say that because I am not too sure whether he was Justice Minister or Attorney-General or assistant Attorney-General or what the hell his position was-'Don't you understand this is habeas corpus? It's what we fought and died for, the Magna Carta, and our forebears have been fighting and dying for it ever since. Don't you understand that?' He just did not understand it. I said, 'Mate, your superiors understand it and you are in desperate trouble.' This man was a numbskull. The judge in court said, 'I simply can't believe this case, that the minister could have allowed such a towering injustice to occur; that the man was taken without any evidence If whatsoever and thrown in jail for five years of his life without any evidence.' In fact, there was evidence and it proved that he was not in the place, absolutely, where the crime was committed. But the minister would not review the case, so the judge pounded him. The Prime Minister, who makes these decisions, subsequently sacked him. How is it that a person can become a minister in a government and not know about these most elemental freedoms? If the opposition votes against this bill today then it will demonstrate to every single person-all 22 million, or whatever it is, of us in Australia-that it does not understand the most basic precepts of freedom. Habeas corpus in its translation from Latin says 'have the person'. You cannot have the person without due, proper and fair process of law, and that dates back all the way to 1215. I strongly recommend that everyone in the House go and see Russell Crowe's movie Robin Hood. It was more about the property rights side of things, but it had it dead right. Effectively, the message was: ' Mr King, Mr Crown, you do not have a discretionary power to tell me what to do. You do not have a discretionary power. You are subject to the Labor law, Mr Crown. That is my land, not your land.' There was a wonderful scene in it in with the great Australian actor and father of the Rabbitohs, Russell Crowe-he could get away with it, of course. King John says to him, 'What? Do you think I have the wherewithal to give every Englishman a castle?' and Russell Crowe-as I say, he could get away with it-replies, 'Every Englishman's home is his castle.' Well, it ain't so in Queensland or in New South Wales. We are not allowed to remove a flying fox from our backyard in Queensland. We are not allowed to kill a deadly snake in our living room in Queensland. We are not allowed to have a pocketknife in Queensland; they have banned all pocketknives in Queensland. No, we have discretionary government. It was called tyranny once upon a time, but I will use the term 'discretionary government'. This is at the very heart of that. The Crown's minions can be given the power just to pluck you off the street, put you in a room and, if you do not tell them what they want to know, leave you in that room forever, just about. I do not want to be promoting either myself or my colleague-it is very rare for him to be my colleague-from the party which sits at the opposite political pole to me. But there has to be something badly wrong when the Greens climb into bed with Katter's Australian Party. There has to be something very badly wrong. It is all right for the government to promote themselves and say how wonderful they are by moving this and by saying how terrible the other mob were. But I still have worries about this. Obviously, I have discussed it with union officials, but the coercive powers are still there for three years. If you wanted to phase them out, why would you not phase them out in 15 months? I view the three years with very great suspicion, because 15 months is plenty to phase them out. If they are to continue for three years, the polls suggest there may well be a change of government in that time. So it could well be that the government of Australia-the cabinet ministers-sat down with the captains of industry and said: 'Don't worry about it, blokes. We are not going well, mate. We won't be there, so you can change it all back again.' It is just a stop-thesunshine clause. But if it were to be removed entirely, it would make it infinitely more difficult, particularly with the numbers in the Senate, for the people on my right to take away our basic freedoms, as they did with their IR legislation. I spoke about habeas corpus-that you cannot 'have the body'. Another term is 'Star Chamber'. It is about discretionary power. The king decided that he would just give discretionary power to a judge and judicial set-up-it became known as the Star Chamber-but there were no rules; they could just decide whatever they liked. They were just attack dogs, in many cases, for the Crown. So the term 'Star Chamber' is a word that we curse and vilify, as we do the Inquisition and various other forms of tyranny which have jumped up to attack us over the course of history. The concept of a Star Chamber was that it could just make a decision whether you liked it or not. In this case, they have the discretion to apply coercion if the person is not going to rat on his mates or his fellow workmen. It gives me no great pride to stand in here and say that I dingoed it back when I was working at Mount Isa Mines. I was not actually a union rep at that time, so I can defend myself to some degree, I suppose, but I still feel pretty ashamed to have to admit that. But what I am trying to get across is that it is scary out there. If you complain about the way things are happening at work, you get sacked. I do not think the people on my right here have ever worked in a job in the real world, because if they had they would know that if you complain about safety and security",71
40,Unknown,BILLS,Opposition members interjecting,74
41,Mr KATTER,BILLS,"Then how do you explain to me that, if a person in the building industry decides that there is a serious problem of workplace health and safety and he complains about it",74

44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! All remarks will be made through the chair.,75
45,Mr KATTER,BILLS,"We are going to move amendments to try to make this legislation go as it should go if it is going to be fair dinkum. We will be moving to remove the coercive powers now and restore the right to silence-a right which every other country in the world respects. We are going to respect habeas corpus and the right to silence, which are two basic building blocks of society throughout the rest of the world, with(Time expired) Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (12:28): I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. This bill will rename the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 as the Fair Work Building (Industry Act) 2011. It will also abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and replace it with the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate, which will be headed by a director appointed by the minster. Under the bill, the minister will have the power to specify the manner in which the director of the inspectorate is to exercise powers and functions, although that will not be in relation to particular cases. This is similar to the power of the minister found in the BCII Act. However, the minister will also have the ability to give direction to the director on policies, programs and priorities. This power is not found in the current act. The bill also introduces new compulsory examination notices which would allow for the director of the inspectorate to apply to a nominated Administration Appeals Tribunal presidential member for a notice that would require a person to attend an examination in relation to an ongoing investigation. The bill provides for the conduct of such examinations, as well as penalties for non-compliance with an examination notice. However, an interested person can make an application to have the compulsory examination notice powers of the Administration Appeals Tribunal presidential member not apply to particular building projects. In effect, this means that a person can simply switch off the inspectorate's ability to examine possible contraventions of workplace relations law. The bill before the parliament today will strip away many of the protections that workers in the building and construction industry currently have that ensure they work in a safe and lawful environment. When we look to what has happened in the past, the most probable outcome of the removal of the Building and Construction Commission will be a resurgence of uncertainty and a decline in productivity in the building and construction industry. I have previously spoken in this place about the history of the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Whilst I do not intend to go through that detail today, it is useful to briefly go through the background. The building and construction industry in Australia has a long history of industrial disputation. Over many years, there have been numerous inquiries and investigations into how that sector operates. Some of the reviews appeared to focus on terms and conditions of employment and relevant awards provisions, such as the review conducted by a full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the late 1980s. The full bench made a number of findings in relation to inconsistent regulation between federal and state jurisdictions, the abolition of paid rates awards, the establishment of a single award and the rationalisation of award respondents. Whilst these were clearly very useful findings, this review dealt with only a relatively small number of issues that impacted on the building and construction industry. In effect, what was uncovered later revealed it to be the tip of the iceberg. Whilst this was a positive step in regulating the industry, there was no doubt that there was a significant way to go to reform the sector, particularly to deal with entrenched work practices. There were further reviews during the 1990s and the early 2000s at various levels dealing with a wide range of issues, including workers being forced to join a union, right of entry, strike pay and contractors. In 2001 the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry was established, with broad-ranging terms of reference, including inquiring into and reporting on unlawful or otherwise inappropriate industrial or workplace practice, occupational health and safety, fraud, corruption, collusion or anticompetitive behaviour, coercion, violence and interference in decisions on whether or not to engage persons or the terms under which they would be employed or engaged. Clearly, there were some significant and serious matters impacting performance of the sector in the years leading up to the royal commission. Submissions were put to the Cole royal commission in relation to the perceived need by major contractors to concede to union demands in order to avoid future economic losses and subsequent pressure on subcontractors to sign pattern bargaining agreements or not be engaged on major building sites. The findings of the royal commission included that there was an urgent need for structural and cultural reform in the building and construction industry and that the industry 'departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy'. Commissioner Cole found that past attempts to reform the conduct and culture of the industry had failed and that this failure was due 'to two principal factors'. Firstly: … there has been an insufficient determination on the part of government to establish structures which will enable the industry to operate fairly and productively and in a manner respecting the rights of individuals. There has been an inadequate structure to enforce the law and usual standards applicable in other industries. Commissioner Cole also recommended the establishment of an independent commission, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, to monitor conduct in the industry. The Building and Construction Commission which was subsequently established, has instituted proceedings for contravention of laws, including those relating to coercion, right of entry, strike pay and freedom of association, just to name a few. It has also initiated proceedings in courts and with Fair Work Australia. Investigations over the past financial year discovered over 900 contraventions of on the Commonwealth workplace relations law, with $2.5 million worth of penalties being imposed by the courts and Fair Work Australia. Master Builders Australia said in relation to these penalties: The Parliament cannot ignore such court findings and convictions and should not agree to any watering down of the current powers. From its inception through until the end of May 2011, the Australian Building and Construction Commission has successfully prosecuted 74 cases, and it has been unsuccessful in only eight of those. Most of these cases have been in Victoria, where there is a long and bitter history of disputation in the building and construction industry. In the financial year 2010-11, 402 investigations were conducted by the Australian Building and Construction Commission into alleged workplace relations law contraventions, 72 of those being in my home state of Queensland. In 2010, there were only 20 investigations in Queensland. During this period, there were 354 new investigations, compared to the 2010 number of 241, and the 2009 number of 213. There were also 107 continuing investigations, compared to 48 in the previous year. The picture that this very clearly paints is that there has been an increasing number of investigations conducted by the Australian Building and Construction Commission over more recent years. It is clear from that pattern-there is clear evidence-that there is a genuine, ongoing need for the Australian Building and Construction Commission to be retained and to continue. It also, as part activities, began 134 sham contracting investigations and recovered $127,479 in wages-again, significant amounts. The increase in the number of investigations can be put down to the Australian Building and Construction Commission now being able to conduct full service regulation. This was only achieved in March last year after it assumed responsibility for wage and entitlement claims from the Fair Work Ombudsman. These facts show the effectiveness of, and the hard work that has been done by, the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner in bringing a degree of certainty to an industry that has otherwise been characterised by, as the Cole commission described it, a certain degree of lawlessness. However, this government has recently seen the number of working days lost in the building and construction industry skyrocket to 44 days per thousand employees, the highest level since 2005. This is clearly disappointing, considering that the number of working days lost per thousand employees fell from 224 in 2004 to 24 in 2006, this being the time period where the Australian Building and Construction Commission was first set up. It would be inappropriate and unrealistic to believe that all disallowed activities on building sites can be completely eradicated. The National Electrical and Communications Association also said in November last year that there is still some degree of lawlessness in the building and construction industry but: … the ABCC has been effective in removing the worse instances. Removing the ABCC or emasculating its powers will see increased inappropriate behaviour and this will lead to the costs of projects blowing out and delays in construction. I support those comments. The benefits that have come about due to the of its Australian Building and Construction Commission's activities are not restricted to regulation of inappropriate action in the industry. During the period of time since the creation of the ABCC, the building and construction industry has seen a 10 per cent increase in productivity, an economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year, reduced inflation of about 1.2 per cent and a 1.5 per cent increase in gross domestic product. The creation of the Australian Building and Construction Commission has also had the effect of reducing the cost of construction around Australia by 20 to 25 per cent, with project delays being significantly reduced. As an independent body, the commission is currently separate from Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman. It has the ability to investigate contraventions in workplace relations law and also to promote harmonious working environments within the entirety of the building and construction industry. Yet the government is willing to strip back all the ground that has been made by the commission in recent years, even in the face of the commission's success. Although this bill may have national impacts, it will potentially directly impact my electorate of MCPherson. On the Gold Coast, the construction industry has traditionally been a strong contributor to the local economy, yet there has been a downturn in the industry due to economic circumstances, probably significantly for the past two or three years. The abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission will return the building and construction industry to the days of work stoppages, heavy handed industrial tactics and project uncertainty. With the current economic climate, the Gold Coast's building and construction industry cannot withstand the introduction of another impediment to future success, nor can the wider Gold Coast economy, the Queensland economy or the Australian economy. Removing the Australian Building and Construction Commission as well as the protections it offers workers in those industries will merely be a return to the old days of union run and dominated construction sites. This cannot be allowed to happen, not just for the sake of efficiency and certainty in the building and construction industry but for the benefit of communities and the nation. I support the continuation of the Australian Building and Construction Commission.",75
46,Mr LYONS,BILLS," I rise in the House today to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. This bill provides the framework for cooperative and productive relations in the building industry. It is based on the recommendations of Justice Wilcox QC, who said the new regulator should retain coercive information-gathering powers while removing the existing higher penalties for building industry participants for breaches of industrial law and introducing safeguards in relation to the power to compulsorily obtain information and documents. I am proud to be here today to say that after six years we are on the verge of seeing the end of the Australian Building Construction Commissioner, the ABCC. The ABCC was created by the Howard government in 2005 to enforce its laws and 'criminalise' much union related activity on construction sites. It was: … provided with powers to enforce workplace laws, to address the problems that the building and construction industry encounters. … Its key objective is to ensure that workplace relations laws are enforced in building and construction industry workplaces. To give a bit of history, its predecessor, the Building Industry Taskforce, was set up in the wake of the politically driven Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. It is okay for employers to salt away their capital and withdraw their labour but it is a criminal act for employees to do the same, under the Liberal's law. While its brief was to oversee adherence to industrial law, the ABCC evidently fails to investigate or prosecute employers for underpaying workers or breaching safety regulations. Rather, it has been alleged that it targets individual workers involved in union or collective activity not strictly related to EBA negotiations. This bill will abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and create a new agency, the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate, to regulate the building and construction industry. The new regulator will provide information, advice and assistance to all building industry employers and employees regarding their rights and obligations under the law, as well as seek to improve the standard of occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry. As Minister Evans said, the inspectorate will have the powers and responsibilities to ensure employers, organisations, employees and trade unions abide by their obligations under the law. The bill implements the key recommendations of the report Transition to Fair Work Australia for the Building and Construction Industry by the honourable Murray Wilcox QC. Mr Wilcox undertook a considerable amount of work, and I take this opportunity to thank him for his efforts and his thoughtful and balanced report. The inspectorate will retain the coercive information gathering powers. The bill removes existing higher penalties for the building industry participants for breaches of industrial law and introduces safeguards in relation to the power to compulsorily obtain information and documents. The bill creates an office of Independent Assessor who will on application by stakeholders determine that compulsory information gathering powers will not apply to a project. The bill includes a three-year sunset provision for the compulsory information gathering powers. A review will occur prior to the sunset of the compulsory information gathering powers. The bill does not impact on the provisions that establish the Office of the Federal Commissioner or the OH&S Accreditation Scheme. At the heart of Labor's new workplace relations system is fairness. It is what we have strived for and it is something I am very proud of. Under the Liberal Party's Work Choices scheme, protection from being sacked unfairly was stripped away from more than three million workers. Thousands of workers were pushed onto AWA individual contracts: 70 per cent lost shift loadings, 68 per cent lost annual leave loadings, 65 per cent lost penalty rates, 49 per cent lost overtime loadings and 25 per cent no longer had public holidays. Those on the other side of the chamber should hang their head in shame for what they did to everyday working Australians. I cannot comprehend why they would have devised and voted for such a destructive scheme. As workplace relations minister, the member for Warringah actually opposed a paid parental leave scheme and said it would be introduced over his government's dead body. We cannot trust the Liberal Party on workplace relations. Liberals seem to think that the stick will make the donkey work harder, but they are wrong. There is significant criticism of the former Howard government's ABCC, especially its targeting of building unions, by the wider community and by the labour movement. Here, today, we are taking a stand. We are creating a new body to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry. Labor understands that the construction industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees. As a result we have always supported a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all parties. The government believes that the ABCC in its current form is not an Safety appropriate regulator and needs to be replaced with a new body that is part of the mainstream Fair Work system. This new regulator will operate in accordance with community expectations of a fair and just workplace relations system. I say here today that the abolition of the ABCC will not result in a return to the industrial disputes of last century, because the building industry inspectorate will continue to regulate the industry fairly and effectively. The opposition is committed to pursuing extreme workplace relations laws rather than ensuring lawful conduct by all parties in the building industry. We cannot trust the opposition on workplace laws and fairness. Construction workers want to be treated the same as all other workers-not be subjected to the stress of arbitrary interrogations which can hang over their heads for months. Mr Noonan, National Secretary of the CFMEU's Construction Branch, said that since the Australian Building and Construction Commission was created by the Howard government it had achieved nothing except intimidation of workers in the construction industry. Right across Australia construction workers have been under attack from the legacy of Howard's industrial relations laws. As the Australian Building and Construction Commission continues to use its draconian powers, I stand here today with the aim of putting an end to this. The International Labour Organisation, the UN body charged with looking after workers' rights, has taken aim at the ABCC on several occasions in the past, but earlier last year its condemnation was expressed in the strongest possible terms. The ILO's Committee of Experts, an eminent body of labour law jurists, noted: … the manner in which the ABCC carries out its activities seems to have led to the exclusion workers in the building and construction industry from the protection that the labour inspection system ought to secure for these workers under the applicable laws, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that the priorities of the ABCC (or the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate) are effectively reoriented … We believe the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner needs to be replaced with a body that is part of the mainstream Fair Work system. Only considered, fair and balanced laws will create the sort of long-term change that the industry needs if it is to create jobs and make a positive contribution to national productivity and prosperity. The building and construction industry is a critical sector of our economy with immediate and direct impacts on jobs, growth and productivity. Its importance is demonstrated by the scale and scope of construction funding the Australian government has committed through the BER projects. Those opposite of course opposed the GFC package. They opposed the jobs it would create and the facilities it provided. In Tasmania, Liberal state parliamentarians and even Liberal candidates for the next election have been happy to attend BER opening ceremonies, even though the initiative was voted against by the Liberal Party. We know that the Labor Party is the only party that supports a fair and effective industrial relations system. We abolished Work Choices and created a balanced industrial relations system that returns fairness to our workplaces, while boosting national productivity. All the independent evidence shows that our industrial system is working well for employers and for workers. We have very low unemployment: more than 750,000 jobs have been created since we came to office, with 120,400 in the last 12 of months alone. Wage growth has been moderate and fair. Industrial disputes remain at low levels: days lost due to industrial disputes are a third of the number during the Howard years. During the Howard years, 13.6 working days were lost per 1,000 workers per quarter; under this Labor government, 3.6 working days have been lost per 1,000 workers per quarter. Record levels of successful workplace agreements are being completed. The way we handled the Qantas situation in 2011 demonstrates the effectiveness and fairness of the laws put in place by this Labor government. The Labor government stands for fairness. It abolished Work Choices and ended individual contracts that stripped away Australian pay and conditions; set up Fair Work Australia, an independent umpire, to help resolve workplace disputes; introduced a new no disadvantage test to make sure workplace agreements left workers better off; and provided a fair minimum safety net for Australian employees, comprising 10 national employment standards and a modern award system. As Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, sought to trade government support for the car industry for them implementing a radical IR agenda, including individual contracts. He insisted the car companies set up a $1 million fund to sue workers and unions. Later, as Minister for Health and Ageing, he tried the same thing, asking drug companies who received PBS income to implement AWAs. And let's not forget that he refused to release documents detailing the government's involvement in the protracted meat dispute at G&K O'Connor, where union members were locked out for nine months and endured pay cuts of up to 60 per cent. If he ever becomes Prime Minister, I have no doubt in my mind that he will bring back Work Choices. He said on 19 March 2008: The Howard Government's industrial legislation, it was good for wages, it was good for jobs, was good for workers. We all understand that Work Choices is in the Liberal Party's DNA. They do not believe in protections and regulations at work. They do not believe in protecting basic rights such as holiday pay, sick pay, redundancy, overtime, and health and safety. Shame on them. No matter what they try to call it, they will bring back its key elements-stripping away basic employee rights such as unfair dismissal protections. The Gillard Labor government believes in making this nation stronger and fairer. The government understands that only considered, fair and balanced laws will create the sort of long-term change Australia's building and construction industry needs if it is to flourish, create jobs and make a positive contribution to national productivity and prosperity. The Gillard Labor government is working hard at building a strong economy, a sustainable environment and a fair society that provides every Australian the opportunity to prosper and succeed in life. What the Liberals do not get is that putting people under threat reduces productivity and industry. Our first priority is keeping the economy strongprotecting jobs, driving new growth and creating opportunity for all so that no person and no place is left behind. We are striving for fairness and balance. I commend the bill to the House. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (12:55): It is a great pleasure to be able to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. The situation we find ourselves in is that we have a leftover issue to deal with in relation to the terrible Work Choices regime. Here we see the next step and the healing hand of Labor in dealing with the deep and and it damaging wound caused by that Work Choices period. It was a shameful period with a surprise package sprung on the electorate without a mandate. It is something to reflect upon that we have heard from the coalition that they generally supported the mandate that we had to deal with the Work Choices issue, and yet they have strongly opposed this last remaining measure to deal with one of its most damaging aspects. It was an aspect that I found particularly abhorrent, as I know many members on our side did. This was a mechanism, the ABCC, that targeted a particular component of the industrial relations sector, a particular element of component being focused purely on construction industry workers in a totally disproportionate manner. There are incidents and issues in certain locations in the sector but it is, generally speaking, a wellfunctioning industry that was at the time achieving productivity gains and which still is. I will come back to that point. This measure that we are discussing today introduces a new mechanism, the building industry inspectorate, to replace the ABCC. It will get the balance right in dealing with the issues that we know emerge on the employer side of this equation as well. There have been many of those. I have witnessed many of them in my proximity to colleagues in the ACT and the loss of life experienced on building sites. It has also been my great privilege to represent many CFMEU members in my region. Prior to the redistribution, a large number of them were working in the Carter Holt Harvey and Hyne timber mills in the Tumut and Tumbarumba region and down at the South East Fibre Exports facility in Eden. And there are many construction workers who live Queanbeyan, Bungendore and Jerrabomberra who commute across to worksites in the ACT and around my region. These are men and women enjoying the benefits of collective agreements negotiated with their employers through good partnerships, producing good productivity outcomes with that team approach to an industry, which we know is going to always offer the best potential for productivity outcomes. This measure will even out the oversight of the industry given that we obviously have issues that still remain that people are concerned about to do with the oversight of the industry. I am personally of the belief that the day is fast approaching when there will be no need to make any distinction in relation to this sector of our economy. In that particular, I have always been deeply concerned about the compulsory examination power that existed under the ABCC. With this reform there will be a sunset clause attached to that aspect, and the belief is that in three years time there will be no longer any plausible argument as to why such powers need to exist. These sorts of powers should be extremely carefully considered in any democracy. The circumstances in which you would resort to powers like this have to be exigent and very focused on limiting their duration and application. It has always deeply troubled me that these sorts of provisions have existed. I look forward to their demise and there being no longer a need to resort to them. So we will then see the last of some of the abhorrent aspects of this Howard measure, which was in fact designed to target workers, destroy their representative capacity and destroy unionism in this country. That was the overall plan. I well remember my opponent in the 2007 campaign, the former member for Eden Monaro, saying on radio that unions knew in that if Labor was not successful in that campaign their days would be numbered, that it would be all over. This was the strategy and that was the tactic: to destroy the representative ability of workers in this country-a more reprehensible strategy could not be contemplated. With these provisions in this legislation we will also see the ability to deal with the situation of the employers-and we have seen lots of unlawful conduct associated with the construction industry on the part of employers. We have seen underpayment of wages and sham contracting. In recent times in this region, we have seen lots of incidents of unsatisfactory practices in relation to work and safety. I commend the colleagues that I have worked with who looked after the interests of those workers in the CFMEU, who do such a wonderful job not only in representing the interests of their members and promoting a prosperous industry but also in the added support that they provide to our community and our region. They have been involved in so many activities, charitable and otherwise, that they are integral to the quality of life of our community. I salute what the CFMEU have contributed to my region and to the interests of the workers in that region. Coming back to the context in which this legislation is being introduced and curing the legacy of the Work Choices years, we know that Mr Abbott has stated that Work Choices is dead and buried or cremated, but we have seen the reintroduction of the concept through the code word 'flexibility'. What flexibility means to the coalition is returning to those days when the worse impositions of Work Choices had a devastating effect on people. Why is that? Why do they resort to these measures? They talk about productivity in the economy. To the coalition, we know that productivity solutions always mean making the worker carry the burden of those productivity gains. The easy solution for them will always be to cut wages, cut jobs and support productivity gains in whichever way they can through the hide of the worker. When Mr Abbott talks about signing pledges in blood, he means he is signing his pledges in workers' blood. He does not support the preservation of jobs-the hundreds of thousands of jobs that were obviously saved through the GFC, the hundreds of thousands of jobs attached to the automotive industry, or the thousands of jobs we have heard the shadow Treasurer talk about axing from the Public Service in my region alone, which would devastate our local economy, as the coalition did back in 1996 when they sent us into recession. We should really focus on the true story of productivity. There are many fine economic commentators who have burst the balloon on the issue that industrial relations is the heart of productivity and accounts for where this country is now. It just is not true. Of course improvements can always be made to industrial relations regimes. Circumstances change, economies transition, and you always need to keep an eye on reforms that might be necessary. Where we are now has been greatly emphasised by a number of very credible commentators such as Alan Kohler, Ross Gittins and George Megalogenis, people you would pay attention to on economic matters-not, I am afraid, Larry, Curly and Moe, the member for Goldstein, the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition. Their credibility has been absolutely blown out of the water in recent times. Not only have we seen the farcical 'pass the parcel' situation of the budget reply at the previous budget; also we saw their credibility blown out of the water in the 2010 campaign with the Howarth so-called 'audit' that was not an audit and disciplinary action had to be taken in relation to that. That was a farce, because they were not able to test the assumptions that underpinned the estimates. If you can test the assumptions then the figure, if you pardon the expression, is bollocks. We have seen their credibility blown out of the water. Since then we have seen the estimates in relation to Nauru done on the back of a coaster by a catering company. I am not sure what we are going to see next. Perhaps they will subcontract their next budget reply to MCDonald's. If we look at what Alan Kohler, for example, has written in relation to productivity-and we are talking about multifactor productivity, the relationship between capital and labour which is the only really important and relevant factor to look at-we have seen that the productivity figures at the moment, taking into account all the sectors, have been skewed in relation to the impact of investment and issues in the mining sector. Certainly, there has been a decline in mining productivity and the reason for that are the high levels of investment in the mining and utilities industries that have not yet come on-stream. That has also been affected by the GDP growth, which has been slower during the GFC. The massive investment in the mining industry that we have seen is important because the injection of capital relating to productivity outputs of labour has been extremely skewed by this massive investment. It is the mining and quarrying sector that is skewing the overall productivity picture in this country. If you look at manufacturing, construction, hospitality and real estate, they all improved their growth in productivity between the 1990s and the 2000s. This is the true picture. When we talk about productivity, what we mean is facilitating it through investment in infrastructure, investment in skills and particularly through promotion innovation. These are the key areas. We want to see wages maintained. We cannot engage in a race to the bottom with China and India on labour costs. That is just not possible and is not desirable for our country. We know that there are huge possibilities open innovation. This government have been investing not only in innovation but also in addressing those long-neglected infrastructure and skills issues that the previous Howard government let slide during those Rip Van Winkle years. We know that, more broadly, growth in non-mining productivity has picked up and not slowed. Clearly, the impact of industrial relations reform has just not been what some of the commentators in the coalition have claimed. Another key factor underpinning the government's approach has been research by the University of New South Wales, Australian National University, Macquarie University and the Copenhagen Business School, which examined 77 businesses in the services sector with more than 5,600 employees. They found that the best performers are better at innovation. They generate more new ideas and are better at capturing and assessing their employees' ideas. In consequence, they make more improvements to services and production processes, management structures and marketing methods. But some 'treat them mean to keep them keen' managers will be surprised that high-performing outfits do better when it comes to employee emotions. They have higher levels of job satisfaction, employee commitment and willingness to exert extra effort, and they have lower levels of anxiety, fear, depression and feelings of inadequacy. One of the bottom line consequences of this is low rates of staff turnover. As Ross Gittins points out in his analysis of that study, these are the keys to where smart employers need to go. Certainly of those employers that encourage innovation and are open to criticism see it as a learning opportunity. They foster involvement and cooperation among staff and provide opportunities for them to engage and contribute to the long-term progression and to us in development of their enterprise. These management practices are what smart employers are doing. Through the clean energy future package we have seen this government open up a whole new field of potential, not only through the Carbon Farming Initiative-which has provided great opportunities for our agricultural sector in innovation and employment opportunities-but also through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, with the $10 billion that will be able to get behind loan guarantees and so on and will encourage the venture capital for a new economy that is in great demand the world over. This is the real secret to the economic improvements in this country and these are the challenges ahead of us that we must face. This comes back to our philosophy of not treating workers as widgets in the way the coalition does. We do not believe that workers are simply commodities that cannot be dealt with as human beings. We will find a way to achieve our productivity gains without penalising the workers. We also intend to make sure that we keep the jobsprosperous and satisfying jobs-growing in this economy through the investments we are making in infrastructure, in the clean energy package and also, most importantly, in the rollout of the National Broadband Network. It is absolutely beyond belief that someone like the Leader of the Nationals and the coalition are doing the regions of this country a disfavour. This is the great potential piece of infrastructure that will open up worlds of possibilities to regions like mine, where we will see things like the timber precinct in Bombala growing through the investment of $200 million by DongwhaTasco, who will not reach or develop the full potential of that project without the NBN underpinning it. This is what they have clearly indicated to us. Beyond that, there are lots of innovative, new, non-polluting industries that will be associated with the NBN, because basically you can hang off that infrastructure in any location you choose in many industries without having to be tied to metro environments. For a region like mine and regions all over this country, the NBN will be a key factor in achieving the goals that we set for ourselves. That is what the government is all about: a rewarding, secure, prosperous future for our people.",78
47,Mr TUDGE,BILLS," I rise to speak this afternoon on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 and to argue passionately against its passage in this parliament. This bill impacts one of the most important sectors in our economy: the building and construction industry. This is an industry which employs almost a million people, it contributes 10 per cent to our GDP, and it supports the growth and prosperity of almost every other industry as well. We know, for example, that if construction costs are down then this flows through the entire economy in a positive way. It means that the input costs for most businesses are lower. On the other hand, if construction costs are up, the reverse applies. Then it means that every single business needs to have higher input costs in relation to their construction costs. This bill goes directly to the productivity of this sector, it goes directly to the safety of this sector and it goes directly to the performance of the construction industry. Unfortunately, it has a negative impact on this sector in every sense of the word. Consequently, we on this side of the House are strongly opposed to the bill. It is well known on this side of the House and it is well known across Australia that unlawful behaviour exists on some building sites. It is well known, as ACCI has pointed out, that intimidation, threatening behaviour and disregard for the law have been part of the industry for some time, particularly in my home state of Victoria. In the mid-2000s, such was the extent of the public's concern, the industry's concern and the government's concern that a royal commission was established to get to the bottom of the problem and to work out how to tackle some of the unlawfulness which was occurring on building and construction sites. A royal commission was established, headed by Mr Cole QC. This commission found a number of things. It found that indeed the building and construction industry was characterised by widespread disregard of the law. Indeed, the royal commission, the highest form of government inquiry that we can have, found over 100 types of unlawful and inappropriate conduct occurring on building and construction sites across Australia. It also found that existing authorities agencies did not have sufficient power to properly tackle that unlawful behaviour. It went through in some detail particular case studies which showed exactly what was occurring on some of these sites. It showed exactly some of the payments that were made, some of the go-slow actions that were occurring, some of the union unlawfulness, some of the days lost, and indeed it showed that in some instances the entire existence some companies in Australia was jeopardised and that hundreds of jobs did not eventuate because of the unlawfulness which was occurring on the construction sites. The Howard government took heed of the royal commission. It looked very closely at the recommendations of Mr Cole QC and, off the back of that report, established the Australian Building and Construction Commission to tackle unlawful behaviour. It wanted to establish a very robust independent authority that aggressively tackle the unlawful behaviour Mr Cole had documented so thoroughly through his royal commission. The ABCC has had a dramatic impact-there is no doubt about that. It has been what we would characterise as the tough cop on the beat. It has taken a very strong stance against unlawful behaviour on building and construction sites and a very strong stance against union thuggery on building and construction sites. Let us look at the results of this action. I am not saying that all of these improvements are due to the ABCC, but certainly it has had a considerable impact on the results I am about to outline. First of all, productivity has increased by 10 per cent since the introduction of the ABCC. We have had annual economic welfare gain from the sector of $5.5 billion. It has helped reduce inflation overall by 1.2 per cent. Since the ABCC was introduced, the sector has helped and increase GDP by 1.5 per cent. The following statistic is quite remarkable. The number of working days lost annually per 1,000 employees in the construction industry fell from 224 days in 2004 to 24 days in 2006, just a year after the ABCC was introduced. It is a remarkable impact. Building costs have fallen by 20 to 25 per cent. As I mentioned earlier, lower building costs flow through the entire economy. Almost every single of business relies on some sort of office space, some sort of building, which has to be constructed and if building costs are lower it means the business's input costs are consequently lower, and it can be more profitable and employ more people. So the ABCC has undoubtedly been tremendously successful in the overall effort to tackle unlawful behaviour, to improve productivity in the industry and to consequently reduce building costs as well. Nearly everyone has benefited from this. could Clearly the industry itself has benefited because it is now a more productive industry with fewer days lost due to industrial action and the like. Consumers have also benefited because, with building and construction costs down by 20 to 25 per cent, they are also beneficiaries of the actions of the ABCC. Workers have benefited through higher wages, which can only be sustainable through higher productivity. Many of them have also benefited from a safer workplace, knowing that the laws will be abided by. Across all sectors-whether it is the industry, consumers, workers or downstream businesses-nearly everybody has been a beneficiary of the operation of the ABCC. What does this bill before us actually do in relation to the ABCC? Remarkably, it abolishes this very body that has been so successful. It strips away the protections ensuring workers can work in a safe and lawful environment and replaces those protections with what we would consider to be a toothless tiger. The new body which will replace the ABCC will not be an independent body-it will be established within Fair Work Australia and it will be controlled by the minister; a minister under a Labor government who invariably will have been a union official and invariably will be reliant in some respects on the union to retain his or her ministry. If this bill passes is almost inevitable that it will have a negative consequence on some of the things I have talked about. Inevitably it will contribute to more days lost on building sites and go-slows on major projects. It will have a negative impact on losses and productivity. It is not as if there are no longer any problems on business sites. ACCI points out that in the last year alone there were 402 investigations into alleged breaches of laws. I know in my own state of Victoria there have been 130 days lost at the Wonthaggi desalination plant due to industrial action, and many commentators argue that there is basically a go-slow going on down there. ACCI believes this bill will effectively shut down the ABCC and hand over a watereddown set of powers to a specialist Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate, which it suggests will send all the wrong signals to industry participants. Why is the Labor Party doing this? The ABCC has been a tremendously successful body. It directly came out of an independent royal commission headed up by a very respected QC and it has been very effective in its operation. I mentioned before that nearly everyone has benefited from the operation of the ABCC-the industry, workers, downstream businesses and consumers. The organisations that have not been beneficiaries have been the unions, which in some respects have had some of their unlawful activity curbed by the operation of the ABCC. As you would appreciate, many businesses are doing it exceptionally tough at the moment. The construction industry is doing it tough in many places, with growth figures flatlining. This is the most inappropriate moment to be introducing further measures that will make it tougher for that industry. This government has already introduced a number of measures that make it tough for the building and it construction industry and indeed tough for businesses overall. We have had upward pressure on interest rates because of the four highest budget deficits in Australian history over the last four years. We have had a retightening of labour laws, which many businesses say is making it difficult to properly manage their businesses in a fair way. We have had overburdensome regulations introduced in many other areas. And of course the granddaddy of them all will be coming our way on 1 July and will apply to every single business across Australia: the carbon tax. While businesses are doing it tough, while we read in the newspapers almost daily about job losses in various sectors, the government is going ahead with some of these measures that just make it tougher for industry to operate. This bill before us is not a good bill. bill attempts to fix a problem that does not exist. Rather, the Australian Building and Construction Commission has been an immensely effective, independent organisation that has tackled unlawful behaviour, contributed to increased productivity, contributed to a safer workplace and contributed to lower construction costs, which flow through to everybody. We should be opposing this bill before us.",85
48,Ms SMYTH,BILLS," I am very pleased to speak in this debate on the Building and Construction Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011, because for me it represents one of the most stark contrasts between us on the government benches and the conservatives opposite. It really goes to the heart of how political parties recognise what it means to be an ordinary worker in Australia and the things that really matter to ordinary workers in Australia-namely, protection of their rights at work, the assurance that they will continue to have a job and the assurance that their rights at work will not be unreasonably interfered with. That is entirely what this debate is about and has always been about. So I am very pleased to be able to speak on a bill that will have the effect of abolishing the ABCC. The ABCC is one of the many legacies of the Howard government that has seen workers targeted. It really saw workers as the enemy. It was the masthead of the Howard government's industrial relations-and it appears, from the tone of the debate today from those opposite, that it continues to be the masthead of the Leader of the Opposition's policies for Australian workers. Earlier I caught a little bit of the contribution of the member for Mayo. In addition to all the usual ideologically driven This arguments that come from the opposition about the rights of workers and about ensuring that we are tough on workers, the member included a line that, as I recall, said something about the ABCC legislation bringing the rule of law back to the industry. I find that deeply ironic. It seems to me that this debate is entirely about arbitrarily depriving one group of people in our society of certain rights. My conception of the rule of law has always been that it is about ensuring that no-one in a society is arbitrarily deprived of their rights. So it is extraordinary to me that that was the tenor of the argument Industry coming from the member for Mayo earlier today. This government committed to abolishing the ABCC. It did so at the election, and today I am very pleased to be able to speak to the bill that will achieve that. It really is time for the ABCC to go. At the core of Labor's industrial relations system is fairness. The ABCC, from its very inception, represented everything that was unfair in the Howard government's workplace policies. In my electorate I have certainly had a number of constituents who work in the construction industry and who have come up to see me at mobile offices to tell me about their unease with the ABCC. In addition to concerns about all the practical things the ABCC been capable of doing in the past, the ABCC is symbolic. It says to these workers that they are undervalued, that they are devalued, that their rights are not regarded as significantcertainly by the Howard government-and that they as construction workers are vulnerable to having their industrial rights interfered with. Although I know that some changes were made to the operation of the ABCC in 2010, including some changes that reflected the recommendations of Justice Murray Wilcox in relation to the use of coercive powers, construction workers still know that the Howard government originally established the ABCC for the express purpose of targeting them. They do hard work and they do work that can be dangerous, and they expect that their industrial rights will be upheld and respected. We made a commitment to the Australian people that we would replace the ABCC with a new body to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry. Apart from anything else in this debate, it is simply the case that the ABCC is not an appropriate regulator. It needs to be replaced with a new body that is part of the mainstream fair work system, a system that is working well. The result of the 2007 federal election made the public's intentions about their work rights very clear. It told us that the public was not prepared to tolerate the kind of arbitrary and harsh interference with their work rights that the Howard government was trying to put over. It told us that the public understood that workers, particularly construction workers, were being targeted by the Howard government for purely ideological reasons-because it was always Howard's plans to smash the unions and to smash workers, just as it is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to do so today. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to play nice and pretend that he is interested in workers moment-manufacturing workers particular, it seems. The fact that he is keeping up this rather elaborate pretence while at the same time abandoning support for the car industry and the manufacturing workers whom it supports is a truly valiant effort, but I do not think that the Australian public are quite so easily taken in. They know that, at any opportunity, the Liberals will take a swipe at our Fair Work system and that, at any opportunity, the Liberals will undermine Fair Work Australia. We saw it during the Qantas dispute and we hear it almost daily in their remarks in this place. Even the process of developing this legislation shows the stark contrast between Labor and the conservatives. This legislation has been developed through consultation, with expert contributions from Justice Murray Wilcox, consultation with industry and, most importantly, dialogue with working people. The government carried out extensive consultation with industry, with unions and with state and territory governments in 2008-09 as part of the development of this legislation for the previous parliament. Justice Wilcox also consulted widely with stakeholders in the building and construction industry as part of his 2009 report. We on this side know that our construction industry is critical to the national economy, to jobs and to productivity. When the Liberals put in place the ABCC, they took a heavy-handed and clumsy approach to the regulation of an industry which is responsible not only for the livelihoods of its workers and their families but also for the health of our economy. It was driven by an obsession with diluting workers' rights. The bill before us abolishes the ABCC and establishes a new regulator, the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry at the Inspectorate, which will operate in in accordance with community expectations and a fair and just workplace relations system. The Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate will operate under a new framework for the industry, which will be confined to on-site building work. The bill also removes existing buildingindustry-specific laws that had provided higher penalties for building industry participants for breaches of industrial law and broader circumstances under which industrial action attracts penalties in relation to the building industry. The new regulator will also provide information, advice and assistance to all building industry participants regarding their rights and their obligations under the law as well as seeking to improve the standard of occupational health and safety in the construction industry. Most importantly, in my view, this bill contains a number of new provisions and protections-provisions such as those which ensure that a person can be represented by a lawyer of their choice and that legal professional privilege and public interest immunity are available. New provisions are also going to be put in place to ensure payment of legal, travel and accommodation expenses and any earnings lost due to giving evidence. The bill also includes provisions which repeal the previous compulsory interview confidentiality undertakings which prevent interviewees telling other parties what took place at an interview. I believe all of these things are extremely important protections and I am very pleased to see that they are being put in place in the bill that is before us. The topic of coercive powers has come up already in today's debate, and it has certainly been a subject of considerable discussion in the community, and rightly so. As previous members on this side have reflected, when powers such as these are being put in place, we as a community and we as a parliament need to reflect on why they are being put in place, whether it is appropriate that they remain in place and for how long. Certainly due consideration has been given to all those things in the construction of the bill before us today. I know that there have been calls, including calls this morning, for the coercive powers provisions to be removed now, and I do hear those calls. While coercive powers remain in the bill before us on the basis of the recommendations made by Justice Murray Wilcox, it is important to understand the kinds of safeguards that are being put in place, including external oversight of the exercise of those powers. I will mention a few of those safeguards today, but they are fairly extensive. The safeguards will require that a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is satisfied that a case has been made for the use of those powers on each occasion that they are used. As I mentioned, the safeguards require that an individual is able to be represented by a lawyer of their choice. Provisions exist for legal professional privilege and public interest immunity to apply, and safeguards apply in relation to the reimbursement of people who are summonsed to give evidence and to provide information at an examination. The safeguards also go on to require that all examinations are to be videotaped and that the Commonwealth Ombudsman will monitor and review those examinations and provide reports to parliament on the exercise of those powers. There is an additional safeguard that, prior to allowing an examination to occur, the presidential member of the AAT needs to be satisfied of a series of criteria, including, amongst other things, a requirement that an investigation is actually underway and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person to whom the application relates has the information or the documents that are being sought through investigation and is capable of giving evidence relevant to the investigation. It also requires that the presidential member of the AAT consider whether there are other methods of obtaining the relevant information and whether they have actually been undertaken or are appropriate. Finally, it is extremely important to note that there is to be a sunset in relation to the use of coercive powers, to apply at the end of three years. As I have said, given the gravity of the use of coercive powers in any circumstances, it is extremely important that there is a timely review of the use of those coercive powers, that there be appropriate safeguards put in place for the use of those coercive powers and that they be considered regularly and reviewed. All of those things are features of the bill before us today. Ultimately this bill is about restoring the confidence of a group of ordinary workers in the construction industry about their industrial rights. It is about restoring balance to the rights of participants in the construction industry as a whole. It is about respecting their rights under a reasonable fair work system, rather than the extreme, unfair and ideologically driven system that was put forward by the Howard government and seems, unfortunately, to be being revisited daily by those opposite. The opposition want to see a return to Work Choices. They want to see a return to those things that were rejected outright by the Australian public in their decisions at the 2007 and 2010 elections in relation to their industrial None of this surprises me, because they are out of touch on so many issues. They have revealed themselves particularly in recent days in their unwillingness to ask questions about matters of economic policy or matters relating to the future of this country in areas as diverse as the minerals resource rent tax, health and education-all of those things which we on this side are regularly concerned about. They show themselves to be out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Australian workers today in their position in relation to this piece of legislation. They have also shown themselves to be out of touch in relation to ordinary workers on other occasions, including in their opposition to the superannuation increase that will occur under the government's proposal for a minerals resource rent tax. They have no regard for the circumstances of ordinary workers now. Nor do those on the other side have any regard for the circumstances that ordinary Australian workers might find themselves in on their retirement. We on this side want to ensure that ordinary Australian workers have the funds to be able to enjoy their retirement. Those on the other side have no regard for the superannuation arrangements of ordinary Australian workers or for ensuring the continued prosperity of ordinary individuals. During the global financial crisis we saw more evidence that those on the other side have no regard for the jobs of workers in this country. Indeed, there were some substantial and notable absences during the debate in relation to the surplus and the way in which it might support jobs for workers in this country. Those on the other side have no plan for investment in new technologies and new industries while those on this side have a plan for the future of ordinary Australian workers as we invest in the National rights. Broadband Network, and inevitably the industry that that will generate and as we encourage a cleaner energy future through the clean energy future package, and all of the things that that will mean for the industries and workers of the future. On all fronts, those opposite have nothing to say on the rights, continued employment, prosperity, retirement income, health or education of workers. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (13:39): Before I start to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011, I would like to respond to the diatribe that we just heard. In my 18 months as the member for Herbert, not one worker has come into my office telling me that they have been done over by the ABCC. What I have had is a lot of builders coming to me and telling me that the red tape that this government and the state government are imposing on the industry is killing the industry. What I see in the industry is people being paid above award wages because employers want to keep good workers. The ABCC is not anti-worker; it is pro-work. I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. The purpose of this bill is to abolish the successful Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, the ABCC, and replace it with a new agency, the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate. It also provides for a new independent assessor's office, which will be able to determine what examination notice papers should apply to specific projects. It also removes laws related to the building industry that provide for higher penalties on those found to have breached industrial law and a wider set of conditions that attract these penalties. The coalition established the ABCC back in 2005 in response to the Cole royal commission's findings of rampant unlawful and inappropriate industrial conduct in the construction industry. Part of those findings emphasised the lack of powers and resources that the regulatory body had at the time and the consequences of this. The ABCC has been the policeman of the industry, dealing with these problems in a tough but fair and balanced manner so that heavy-handed tactics are no longer what the industry is known for. The industry cannot afford to return to the days when unlawful tactics became rife as a result of weak oversight bodies. It is clear that this bill is another example of the Labor Party giving into the unions, their lords and masters. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union does not like the ABCC because it has been effective at holding militant industrial relations antics to account. The government does not want to scrap this for the good of the construction industry; they want to scrap it for the good of the union, regardless of the outcome.",88
49,Mr Lyons,BILLS,"You want to put workers under threat. Mr EWEN JONES: Member for Bass, how many people in Tasmania have a job, mate? Over the past year, we have seen a raft of industrial action in which people have not played by the rules. The last thing that we need right now is to abolish the watchdog responsible for ensuring that either side in an industrial dispute does not get away with underhanded tactics. The construction industry has a bleak history in this area in Australia. A tough commissioner was needed to clean this up and the ABCC has done that. Under their watch, productivity in the construction industry has increased by 10 per cent and inflation has reduced by 1.2 per cent. Replacing this with a new weaker inspectorate threatens to return the industry to the bad old days of devious union activity that hurts business and the economy. On top of that, unlike the independent ABCC the new building inspectorate will be controlled by the minister. Everybody knows that independence is critical to ensuring that any workplace relations body is fair and balanced. That has played a big part in why the ABCC has been so successful. This bill will also allow for ABCC powers to be switched off on specific work sites. Absurd as it sounds, this means that unions will be able to try and have the law simply not apply to that workplace. Townsville is a rapidly growing city and as such its construction industry is a key part of the local economy and the local community. The city is continuously expanding as new homes and new suburbs are built to cater for the population growth while the opportunities in the North Queensland economy have led to a number of business construction projects as well. Changes that threaten the construction industry have big consequences for the city. I have been speaking to builders across Townsville and I have heard their concerns about these changes. Darrell Gribble of Liveconstruction lamented the burden of overregulation on the industry and the effect that it has on their ability to their job. I have listened to express concerns about the risk that a weaker industry watchdog poses in terms of expanding the access of unions to workplaces and the impact that this will have on their work and on their productivity. Adrian Gabrielli of Gabrielli Constructions told me how worried he and other builders are about the consequences for their workplaces and about the impact that these changes will have on construction costs. Only trouble can come when you do not have a policeman on the watch. As he pointed out, all big businesses have had to bend to unreasonable demands issued by unions and this change will just give them more scope to wield their power, leaving building companies at their mercy. The system that we have at the moment has kept fairness in the building industry while allowing businesses to do their jobs instead of coming up against unions intent on stirring up trouble rather than raising genuine their issues.",92
50,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Brisbane Electorate: Australia Day Awards,93
51,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I wish to congratulate and pay tribute to a number of constituents in my Brisbane Electorate who received Order of Australia awards on Australia Day: Mr Simon Bartlett, for services to engineering, particularly to the electricity supply industry; Mr Michael Baumann, for services to the community of Queensland as a magistrate and through contributions to court procedures and practices; Mr Robert Brice, for services to the tourism industry; Mr David Russell QC, for services to the National Party of Australia people and to politics, taxation law and legal education and the community; Mr James MCGowan, for services to public administration, through the development and implementation of public sector management and training reforms; Dr Edward Street, for services to dentistry and to the dental profession, to medicine and to the international community. I also congratulate Professor The Hon. Michael Lavarch, for distinguished services to the law and legal education, particularly in the areas of native title, human rights and constitutional law. Acknowledgements must also go to Dr Ernest Cramond MBE, for services to medicine as a general practitioner and through his great work through the  the community as a pilot with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. As in previous years, this year's Order of Australia recipients have been recognised for outstanding achievements and contributions in a broad range of fields and endeavours. I wish to congratulate each and every one of you for your contribution, as well as all past recipients. (Time expired) Media Ownership",93
52,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Convergence Review's findings recommendations are imminent. Madam Deputy Speaker, you know my long standing campaign against concentration of media ownership in our country. I believe, like all of us, that fair and balanced media reporting is essential for the public interest. That is why I was concerned last week when Australia's wealthiest citizen, Ms Gina Rinehart, made a move on Fairfax, the second biggest media company in Australia. I think it is very important that Ms Rinehart tell all the citizens of Australia whether this is a friendly takeover to maximise the benefits for the shareholders or whether this is about getting control of the second biggest media company in our country to influence public opinion. Moreover, I am concerned that editors and journalists might lose their jobs, because clear that Ms Rinehart has a massive conflict of interest. She is a fierce opponent of the minerals resources rent tax and she is a strong supporter of climate-change deniers. She is entitled to those views but, if she intends to take over the second biggest media company in Australia, she has to guarantee that she will have balanced reporting and that editors and journalists do not lose their jobs because they- (Time expired) Infrastructure Employment Projects Program",94
53,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to highlight a graphic example of Labor's gross economic incompetence. Members will agree there are many to choose from, but the government's failure to effectively administer the Infrastructure Employment Projects Program is hard to beat. Established as part of the government's economic stimulus package, it has received a damning assessment from the Auditor General in a report that exposes a litany of The failures in the way the program was devised and and implemented. Millions of taxpayers' dollars have been spent on projects that were not properly evaluated. There was no attempt by the department to analyse the quality of proposals that were referred to it by the infrastructure minister's office. Local employment coordinators, who are the repositories of expertise in the relevant areas, were never consulted and not one project was completed in the designated priority employment areas. It beggars belief that the minister has yet to be fully held to account for this fundamental breach of Commonwealth grant guidelines. Not only was money wasted but the goal of creating jobs was never achieved. In fact, no jobs were reported as created or retained until over a year into the program and, in the words of the Auditor-General, the it is program did not achieve its 'economic stimulus objectives in the anticipated time frame'. This is simply not good enough. It is time the government accepted the blame and held its head in shame. Fraser Electorate: North Canberra",94
54,Dr LEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Over recent months I have been gathering stories from colleagues who enjoy living on the north side of Canberra, in my electorate of Fraser. Senator Wong says, 'I love the north side because I can walk to Lonsdale Street Roasters, eat at Italian and Sons and see the balloons floating overhead as I drive across the bridge to work.' The member for Parramatta says the Gungahlin area has 'some of the best bike paths around'. Senator Stephens tells me, 'I love to start my mornings with a brisk walk on Mount Ainslie.' And the Attorney General enjoys using Dickson pool during summer. The member for Page says, 'I love living in Watson when I am in Canberra, as it has a nice suburban family-friendly feel. I am beside parkland and enjoy the walks and the birds, which are prolific and colourful.' The member for Kingston describes Dickson Chinese restaurants as 'fast, furious and yummy', and the member for Shortland heartily agrees. Senator Conroy found the north side 'a lovely place to grow uprelaxed and carefree'. Yet, despite this, too few of those who work in Parliament House live on the trendy north side. Indeed, only 14 members of the Labor caucus live in the Fraser electorateand I fear the same may be true of the other side of the House. The members for Canberra, Eden-Monaro and Lalor have good excuses, but what about the rest of you? Members of parliament and your staff: it is time to move to the fashionable rightbank of the Molonglo River. Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:51): I rise to speak on an important women's health initiative taking place right across the country. February marks Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, a national campaign aimed at raising awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with ovarian cancer. The campaign also aims to raise muchneeded funds for Ovarian Cancer Australia's support and research programs. Ovarian Cancer Australia is a not-forprofit organisation founded by people directly affected by the disease. Since 2001 has worked tirelessly to ensure that every woman knows the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Sadly, more than 1,200 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year in Australia-that is three women every day, or one woman every 11 hours. Not much has been spoken about ovarian cancer. In fact, it has been labelled a 'silent killer' because there is no early detection test or screening, so awareness is imperative. Throughout February, Ovarian Cancer Australia invites the community to host an 'afternoon teal' or 'cockteal' with friends and family to help spread awareness of the disease and its symptoms. This month I will be supporting my good friend and Northern Territory Ovarian Cancer Australia ambassador Alice Burton to spread awareness of the disease. A 'cockteal party' has been organised for Friday, 24 February in Darwin and women from across the Top End have been invited. Teal entertainment and raffles will be among the highlights, and our aim is to inform women of the importance of recognising the warning signs of ovarian cancer. Organ Donation",94
55,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Just in response to my colleague the member for Fraser, the south side rules; the south side rocks! Maybe I should go and speak to the Governor General and the Prime Minister about what they think about living on the south side. Anyway, I am not here to talk about that, much as I love the south side. Organ donation is on our minds this month as we gear up for DonateLife Week in a fortnight. The theme for the week is 'Ask and know your loved one's donation wishes'. 2011 was a landmark year in consolidating infrastructure to support improvements in organ donation. As members will know, Australia is a leader in transplant surgery, it with absolutely stunning outcomes, yet our donation rates are comparatively low. However, after a Labor injection of $151 million and associated resources into the sector, we are now seeing improvements. Last year we had more organ donations than ever before, which translated to over 1,000 transplants. That is thanks to 337 families who agreed to donate their loved ones' organs, and I pay tribute to them. The ACT continued to lead the way, with 21.9 donors per million population. That is because our community regards discussion about organ donation as an integral part of life in the capital. We have also started this year well with a multiorgan donor in January 2012, and we have Gift of Life working with DonateLife to improve organ donation awareness. We have the DonateLife Walk coming up on 22 February, which coincides with DonateLife Week. (Time expired) Cowan Electorate: Australia Day Awards",95
56,Mr SIMPKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I congratulate the City of Wanneroo Australia Day award winners for 2012. The Charles Searson youth award went to Marangaroo Primary School head girl Emily Youard, a member of the singing and dancing group, cheerleader and soloist in the school choir and a school leader committed to supporting the community. Congratulations, Emily, and keep up the good work for the future. Also congratulations to Banksia Grove resident and Mr Spring in the Grove himself-Spring in the Grove is the local fete and fair-Bill MCClelland for winning the City of Wanneroo's individual Australia Day award. Bill is a very hard worker who single-handedly organises Spring in the Grove, a great community event which is appreciated by the small suburb of Banksia Grove. I also congratulate Marcia Dinnie, the president; the whole committee; and the members of the Wanneroo Senior Citizens Club for winning the community group award. More than 30 years of work has gone into the club for older Australians. Within the club, they offer lawn bowls. They also offer various art opportunities, including pottery. It is a great organisation, and the winning by the Wanneroo Senior Citizens Club of the community group award for the City of Wanneroo for Australia Day 2012 is much deserved. Bell, Mr Cyril",96
57,Mr DANBY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to pay homage to an Irish gentleman, Cyril Bell, whom I first met when I came to parliament 12 years ago. He has just retired as the cleaner in my electorate office in Melbourne. I want to tell you something of his great immigrant success story. Cyril comes from County Tipperary. He married his wife, Carolyn, from nearby Kilkenny. Uncertain of the future in the land of their birth, they decided, like so many others of Ireland's youth have done from generation to generation, to join the Irish diaspora. Cyril and Carolyn have been married for 50 years, almost all of that time in Australia. Cyril arrived in Port Melbourne on a Chandris liner, decked out in shorts and Tshirt, perhaps eager to get some of that wellpublicised sun and surf. He found himself in the midst of the coldest winter in Melbourne in 50 years. Cyril got a job at the old Woolworths, a dream for a couple from Ireland. With the support of his employers in those days-'That was then,' he says-they found themselves with a house, which they still have, and an old Ford Falcon, which they do not. 'I thought I'd landed in heaven,' Cyril said, 'and I still do. No-one like us in Ireland in those days had a car.' He developed a reputation for honesty, security and reliability, went into business and became a cleaner with many contracts in Melbourne in many parliamentary offices. I guess you would say he is my oldest, longest serving employee. Thank you, Cyril. Thank you, Carolyn, for supporting him all those years. May you enjoy a long and happy retirement together in good health and may you enjoy that trip you are planning back to Ireland in July- (Time expired) Joice, Dr Paul",96
58,Mr CHRISTENSEN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Whitsundays is an area with a shortage of GPs as it is right now, and we could lose yet another one, a long-serving and wellrespected GP, Dr Paul Joice. And it is all thanks to Queensland Health. Almost two weeks ago, Queensland Health banned Dr Joice, a local doctor with 33 years service to the community, from providing acute care and from delivering babies in their hospitals, particularly Proserpine Hospital. Why? The answers are very weak. Apparently, he has not seen enough patients in the past year. Maybe it is because he has been busy treating patients in the surgery. Somehow he has forgotten how to treat patients in hospital, and somehow he has forgotten how to deliver babies! What a crock. The real reason, I suspect, is that Dr Joice has been an outspoken critic of Queensland Health, and this is payback by the bullyboys who operate in the upper echelons of that organisation. The Proserpine community is outraged. I have received letter after letter from residents who have had their babies delivered by Dr Joice, who have had loved ones treated by Dr Joice and who have had lives saved by Dr Joice. I think that heads should roll in this situation. I will be writing to the Queensland Minister for Health and shadow health minister and calling for an independent investigation into disgraceful treatment of a doctor who should have been given a much better hearing by Queensland Health. They have really done this guy over, and heads should roll. Sulzberger, Mr Jake",97
59,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I would like to acknowledge a young athlete from my electorate, Jake Sulzberger. Jake is an inline hockey player who will be competing in the inline hockey junior world championships in South America in July this year. Jake represented Tasmania at the 2011 national championships in Hobart. As a result of this performance, the 18-year-old goalie was selected as part of the Australian team for the Oceania Inline Hockey Championships in New Zealand in April. Jake was the only Tasmanian picked in the Australian junior men's team which will be contesting the world championships in Colombia. This is a great accomplishment, and it is fantastic to see a young Tasmanian athlete making a mark on the world stage in their chosen sport. I take this opportunity to congratulate Jake on his achievements so far. Representing Australia and Tasmania at an international level is both a great responsibility and a great honour. I wish him great success in his endeavours this year and look forward to hearing how he and his team mates fare. Once again, congratulations and good luck to Jake Sulzberger, from my electorate of Bass.",97
60,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Carbon Tax",97
61,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to the comments this of Mr John Hannagan, the Australian chair of the world's largest aluminium producer, Rusal, employing nearly 1,500 people in this country: The carbon tax is based on the very flawed assumption that our competitors are going to have similar carbon or energy policies. I ask: does she agree with Mr Hannagan? Won't the world's biggest carbon tax erode our international competitiveness, cost Australian jobs and ultimately close down the Australian aluminium industry?",97
62,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am aware of those comments and, as the Leader of the Opposition ought to be aware, our Jobs and Competitiveness Program is expected to provide over $3.5 billion of assistance to the aluminium and alumina industries over the next three years to support their competitiveness and to improve their efficiency. The Rusal comments also go to the fact that there are existing policies in China already imposing an effective carbon price, and that is before you take into account the fact that China is the process of taking further action on climate change and to limit carbon pollution, including agreeing at the international conference in Durban to be part of a global emissions reduction regime which is to be developed for both developed and developing countries and would be agreed by 2015. China has also announced that in 2013 it will introduce pilot emissions trading schemes across major cities and regions covering over 200 million people and China aims to scale this up to a nationwide scheme. What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is that we know that the opposition has been out there for a long period of time now trying to sell fear about carbon pricing. I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has taken one step back today from playing direct politics with announced job losses and is not maintaining his false assertions from yesterday. But the Leader of the Opposition is still in the fear business. What the Leader of the Opposition should be recognising",98
63,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, won't her carbon tax ultimately close down the Australian aluminium industry?",98
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has not finished answering the question. There are opportunities for the Leader of the Opposition to ask a supplementary question. He sought the call. I gave it to him on the basis that he was about to make a point of order. I now call the Leader of the Opposition on the basis that he is taking a point of order.,98
65,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker, and I do thank you for your courtesy to me. On direct relevance, won't the carbon tax close down the Australian aluminium industry?",98
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat, as will the in Leader of the House. The Prime Minister has the call and she will be directly relevant to the question under consideration.",98
67,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My answer to that direct question is that it is more of the fear that we have seen from the opposition. Let us go through the claims they have made to date. The first claim was that the coal industry would close down-proven to be absolute nonsense. Then the Leader of the Opposition was out saying Whyalla would be wiped off the map-absolute nonsense. Then he was out claiming that the government's statements that there would be benefits to nine out of 10 households was untrue. The only untruth in that was coming out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition when he tried to declare that those benefits would not be going through to pensioners and to working families. And now the Leader of the Opposition, against that track record of always getting it wrong, of always preferring fear over facts, is going back to the same well and inviting people to believe fear over facts again. The truth is that this is a tough time for the aluminium industry, as has been made clear by Alcoa. The pressures on them include the pressures of the Australian dollar. That is why we are working to support jobs today and will continue doing it tomorrow. The opposition, of course, have got absolutely no plans for jobs. (Time expired) Economy",98
68,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. How is returning to surplus vital to managing the economy in the interests of working people? What would be the consequences of not returning the budget to surplus?,99
69,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,99
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When honourable members return to order, I will give the Prime Minister the call, which she now has.",99
71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her question. It is an important question because she is inviting me to explain why it is important to working people that we return the budget to surplus, why that is important to our economy and to jobs and growth.",99
72,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,99
73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To the opposition, which obviously is yelling about all of this at the moment because they have got no economic plans so all they can do is scream abuse, maybe they might learn something if they listened. Why is it important to working people that we return the budget to surplus? First and foremost, events in Europe basically prove to us and prove to the world that there has never been a more important time to stick to your fiscal plans and to stick to fiscal discipline. That is a clear lesson of Europe. Secondly, having strong public finances is important to our banks, it is important to underwriting and underpinning our banking system, and our banking system being there to provide loans and to enable investment means jobs. Thirdly, our economy is growing solidly, and when your economy is growing solidly it is the right thing to do to retreat the footprint of government and to allow the private sector to do more. Fourthly, a disciplined budget creates the space for the Reserve Bank should it choose to move on monetary policy, that is, should it choose to lower interest rates. That is why it is important for working people that the government return a surplus. The government has a clear determination to do so, and we will do so in 2012-13, as promised. It is not easy to return to surplus. It means you have to work hard, contain spending and make savings. And we have worked hard to keep spending at 1.5 per cent in terms ofWyatt Roy: I rise on a point of order. When was the last time the Labor Party actually delivered a budget surplus?",99
74,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,99
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Longman will remove himself from the chamber, under the provisions of standing order 94(a), for that abuse of process of the standing orders with respect to points of order. The Prime Minister has the call and she will be heard in silence.",99

77,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,99
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! When the House has come to order the Prime Minister will be out able to continue answering the question. The Prime Minister.,99
79,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Compare that to the opposition's approach. They started with a commitment to surplus from the Leader of the Opposition. That has gone down to doing it 'as quickly as possible' from the leader. Then, 'as soon as possible' from the shadow Treasurer. Then it is an 'aim' from the deputy leader. Then it is a 'hope' from the Leader of the Opposition. Then it is an 'aspiration' the Leader of the Opposition. wait and see' from the deputy leader. Then it is 'well, it just depends' from the shadow finance minister. Then it is 'we have to be measured' from the shadow Treasurer. Then it is 'we have to see the books' from the Manager of Opposition Business. Then, today, from Senator Abetz, an 'extravagant promise'. That is the sinking commitment to any form of surplus by the opposition. Unlike their shambles, we are very clear about a return to surplus and we will deliver it. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:09): My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs advise the House of one single country-just one will do-with an economy-wide carbon tax greater than the Australian carbon tax, set at $23 per tonne and going up to $131 per tonne?",99
80,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,100
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable the Minister for Foreign Affairs will commence his answer once the House is silent. The minister has the call.,100
82,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. I did notice that once the question had been asked there was an interjection, by the Leader of the Opposition, I understand, mockingly saying 'Tuvalu, but it is sinking.' On the question of climate change, for the people of Tuvalu, the people of Kiribati, for the people in the climate change small island states, this is not a joke. Ms Julie Bishop: I rise on a point of order. On relevance, the Prime Minister is talking about Tuvalu. It does not have a from carbon tax. I have asked him to name one Then it is 'let's single country",100
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The deputy leader will resume her seat. The minister will resume his answer and will give an answer that is directly relevant.,100
84,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was simply reflecting upon the impact of that interjection on people who are facing the hard edge of climate change realities around the world: the disappearance of their countries. On the question posed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I make the following observations. I am advised that a number of countries have carbon prices higher than Australia's-a proposed price. For example, Norway's carbon tax on petrol is up to A$60; Switzerland's carbon tax on certain fossil fuels is around A$36; and in Canada the province of British Columbia has a carbon tax that will increase to around $28 per tonne in July 2012. I find it remarkable that those opposite have difficulty confronting facts in response to a question. I can repeat those three if they wish, but I will go on. The United Kingdom has introduced a price",100

86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, if you would hold for a moment. All honourable members have had the opportunity of participation in relation to the minister's response. Everyone will now remain silent so we can all listen to the words articulated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The minister has the call.",100
87,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you for your guidance and assistance, Mr Speaker. In this generally shared response, let me go on to the next point I was going to make, which is that the United Kingdom has introduced a price floor for the electricity generating sector to provide incentives for investment. Their target price floor is around $24 for the year 2013-14. Furthermore, I advise the House that we have previously seen the EU price sit above 20 euros for extended periods of time for most of the period between 2005 and 2008, and the price has rarely dropped between",100
88,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,101
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Honourable members on my left will remain completely silent for the duration of the minister's answer. Anyone who does not will join the honourable member for Longman.,101
90,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The price has rarely dropped below 20 euros and at times it has gone above 30 euros. But I say to honourable members opposite that, given that they supposedly represent the party of business and markets, if they were to begin to look at the projections forward from market advisory services, for example, the Bloomberg New Energy Finance report of December last year, that report estimated the EU carbon price is likely to be around 24.7 euros by the year 2015. I say to those opposite that if they are asking questions about carbon price, they in fact represent realities of what is occurring around the world. It contrasts with a $48 billion plan, the so-called 'direct action plan', unfunded and uncosted, by those opposite. (Time expired) Ms Julie Bishop: Mr Speaker, it has been pointed out to me that I referred to the foreign minister as the Prime Minister, and I would not want that Freudian slip to remain on the Hansard. It was during my point of order.",101

92,Dr LEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House the importance of maintaining policies that support economic growth and jobs growth?,101
93,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member from Canberra for that very important question, because we on this side of the House understand the importance of policies that promote growth and support jobs. The dignity of work and the opportunities that come from earning a decent living are absolutely fundamental to what we on this side of the House believe. We are not called the Australian Labor Party for nothing, because we believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the that importance of supporting jobs, and that is why we acted so decisively during the global financial crisis and the global recession. And that is why we are proud of the fact that the unemployment is at 5.2 per cent and that is why we are so engaged in working with those sectors of the economy that are impacted by a higher dollar, because we understand the importance of supporting employment and making sure that we have got modern industry which is both productive and competitive because we understand the importance of jobs to the security and well-being of our population. That is why we are so committed to delivering a surplus in 2012-13. We will deliver a surplus in 2012-13 because that is the appropriate thing to do when you have got an economy growing at trend. But that is not a belief which is shared by those opposite. We have got the three stooges of their economic team",101
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer would assist the chamber if he were to withdraw that reference.,101
95,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I withdraw, Mr Speaker. We have got the Leader of the Opposition and we have got the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman, who have all abandoned their commitment to a surplus. Despite all of the time asserting that deficits produce higher interest rates and they are going to mean the end of the world, they have now abandoned their commitment to a surplus not just in 2012-13 but in the years that follow that as well, Mr Speaker. And what is one of the reasons why they have done that? Well, I can tell you one of them: so that they can give a big fat tax cut to Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. That is one of their objectives. That is why their budget is completely out of control. We also know it is out of control because the shadow Treasurer has now confessed that he really did say there was a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom",102
96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer will return to be directly relevant to the question, which asked about economic growth and jobs growth.",102
97,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Most certainly, because I am talking about the importance of a surplus, and there is the attitude of the member for Wentworth the other night on The 730 Report as there was a really wry smile when he was asked about the shadow Treasurer. We on this side of the House are committed to delivering a surplus to support jobs. We can do that to make sure that the people of this country are secure. Those opposite simply want to wreck our economy.",102
98,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,102
99,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Leader of the Opposition's interjection directed towards yourself as Speaker was quite clearly disorderly. It is up to any member of this chamber to cast aspersions on the Speaker.",102
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have been around in politics long enough to know that you have got to have broad shoulders and I think the leader knows he was skating pretty close to the mark. I am prepared to let it go. Carbon Pricing,102
101,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Quicksilver Group, which employs 450 people in their Far North Queensland tourism business. Their annual fuel bill will increase by an estimated $250,000 a year under the government's carbon tax. Given the Prime Minister's own statement that Australia's tourism industry is already under pressure, why is the Prime Minister making a bad situation worse by imposing a job-destroying carbon tax?",102
102,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lalor-Prime Minister) line. (14:20): The only job-destroying approach in this parliament is the one shown by the opposition, shown recklessly in relation to ripping out assistance from the car industry. The Leader of the Opposition has confirmed a half a billion dollar cutback and no more assistance after 2015. He has re-endorsed the Howard plan. He does not believe in jobs. That is job destroying. I am asked about jobdestroying moves and, of course, there are so many more in this parliament order: the Prime Minister is making no attempt to be directly relevant to the question. It was about the tourism industry and jobs in North Queensland. It was not about any other industry.",102
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will be directly relevant. What she has said to date is relevant but she should be extremely careful to observe the terms of the question not in giving her response. The Prime Minister has the call.,102
104,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. On the circumstances of the Queensland tourism industry, it would be job destroying for that industry to not invest in skills, which is why the opposition's planned cutbacks are so reckless. It would be job destroying for that industry to not roll out the NBN, because people find their holiday packages now online. The opposition's plans to destroy the NBN are job destroying for the tourism industry.",102
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume her seat. The honourable member for Paterson ought not to address the chair until he is given the call at the dispatch box.,103
106,Mr Baldwin,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The shadow minister asked about the $250,000 impact because of the 6.2c a litre reduction in fuel. The Prime Minister does not even understand the impact of her own carbon tax.",103
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member has sought to take a second point of order in relation to relevance. I will not at this stage invite the member for Paterson to join his colleague, but I would counsel and encourage him against similar action in the future.",103
108,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to factors about jobs in the tourism industry, of course there is the impact of climate change on iconic features like the Great Barrier Reef. Nothing is more important to the tourism industry in Queensland than the work that comes because of the Great Barrier Reef. That is why it is so important to take action on climate change and, when you take that action, to do it in the cheapest way possible, which is what the government is determined to do. Some days the opposition walk into this parliament and say: 'Do nothing. Don't worry about climate change.' It appears from the questions we are getting today that this is a 'do nothing' day. They do not believe in doing anything on climate change today. All of that, apparently, is job destroying. Then on other days they come into this parliament and say they have a plan. Well, let us look at the cost of that plan: $1,300 ripped out of the pockets of working families, tax cuts taken away, family payment increases taken away",103
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will ensure that her response is directly relevant.,103
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to job destroying, what could be more job destroying for the tourism industry or other sections of the economy than taking that amount of money away from working families? We stand for getting ready for the future, which will be one in which we must create less carbon pollution. We stand for doing it in the most cost-effective way. We will be providing benefits and assistance to working families and pensioners as we do that and we will be working with industry around the country to support Australian jobs. The job-destroying tactics in this parliament come from the opposition, pure and simple. They record it with their votes in this parliament, like when they voted against steelworker jobs. They record it in their public statements, like when they are looking forward to the end of the car industry. Every action they take is calculated at destroying jobs and 'feeding' the interests of working Australians. (Time expired) NA The SPEAKER (14:24): Before I call the honourable member for Denison, who is the next questioner, I would like to recognise a former minister and long-serving member of this place, the Hon. Duncan Kerr, who is in the gallery. Another former minister and member of the other place, former Senator Patterson, is also in the gallery. On behalf of all honourable members. I would like to extend a very warm welcome to these two former colleagues who are observing question time. Honourable members: Hear, Hear! NA Hospitals",103
111,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Minister, Tasmanians are dying due to the shocking state of our public hospitals and both health professionals and the state government have called on Canberra for a takeover. Given a federal takeover of public hospitals nationally is inevitable and Tasmania is best placed to trial such reform, will you now commence negotiations with the Tasmanian government to do just that?",104
112,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I want to thank the member for Denison for his very serious question. I also acknowledge the former member for Denison; it is great to see him here. Like the member for Denison, I was very disappointed to hear about the Tasmanian government's cut to elective surgery, which I think he is referring to here. I was particularly disappointed because the Commonwealth government will contribute $2½ billion to the Tasmanian health system over the next decade. It is a very significant investment, and I know that the member for Denison and the members for Braddon, Bass, Franklin and Lyons expected much more from the Tasmanian government than what they have got in recent times. I can inform the House and those members who are interested that we will be requiring much closer oversight of the Tasmanian government's management of the health system in Tasmania. I think the saying might be 'we will be all over them like a because this withdrawal of effort in elective surgery is very bad for the people of Tasmania. But we are not contemplating a Commonwealth takeover of the Tasmanian hospital system or indeed of the hospital system in any state or territory. What we will continue to do is make our investments, under close scrutiny, in areas like the Royal Hobart Hospital in the electorate of the member for Denison; the Mersey Community Hospital; and extra funding through the national partnership agreement to improve public hospitals in Tasmania, including extra funding into emergency departments, elective surgery, subacute beds, more radiation oncology services, more GP superclinics, better surgical services and so on. We are disappointed with the actions of the Tasmanian government. I know the member for Denison and my colleagues are concerned about those changes.",104
113,Mr Dutton,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do something about it then!,104
114,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I can say is that we will continue to be all over them like a rash. I hear the shadow minister interjecting. He is the guy who comes from the side that ripped a billion dollars out of public hospitals. NA The SPEAKER (14:28): I would also like to take the opportunity to welcome the Hon. Barry Cohen, who is seated on the floor of the chamber. You will be pleased to know, Mr Cohen, that three of your former colleagues drew your august presence to my attention. I would also like to inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Pacific Parliamentary Leadership Dialogue. Members of parliament from Bougainville, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu are rash' participating in a leadership dialogue sponsored by the Centre for Democratic Institutions. My counterpart, the Speaker of the Parliament of Vanuatu, is part of that group. Honourable members: Hear, Hear! NA Infrastructure",104
115,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister update the House on the government's investment in our nation's highways? How are the government's record infrastructure investments building the economy of the future?,105
116,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:29): I thank the member for Capricornia for her genuine interest, particularly in the Bruce Highway and the roads of Central Queensland. Indeed, her electorate has benefited from the doubling of the roads budget that has been undertaken by this government-up to some $28 billionand, indeed, our much greater investment is delivering results. Andrew MCKellar of the Australian Automobile Association backed it in, describing it as good news that there are now, in their report recently released, fewer high risk roads than five years ago. The Bruce Highway has been a major beneficiary. We have invested in the Bruce Highway-and you do not have to believe those on this side of the House. This is what the member for Herbert had to say: I will give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or Bruce Highway than we did before. And he is right. More in four years than they did in 12, even though the Leader of the National Party was the Minister for Transport and Regional Services at the time: $1.2 billion over 12 years. You know the neglect, Mr Speaker, because you are one of the people who has made representations to me about this. If only they had a plan. They run around and speak about specific projects but they say sometimes that they have a plan. The member for Dawson said they had a plan. He has a website and it had on it 'Fix the Bruce'. It went up in June last year-the date is on the website: 28 June-and it said 'Coming soon'. Blank page-a blank page for their plan. I clicked on again before question time. Guess what? It is still 'Coming soon'. Not a word, still coming soon, still blank, because they do not really have a plan. If you are going to have a responsible plan in infrastructure, you also have to have a plan to return the budget to surplus.",105
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House will return to the substance of the question.,105
118,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, Mr Speaker. To have a plan to build roads you have to have a responsible fiscal position. You have to get the budget back to surplus. We have done it. The Leader of the 'Noalition' says no to a budget surplus. Senator Abetz in a doorstop this morning has called it an extravagant promise. More and more, when you ask them what they are going to do about infrastructure and roads they no longer make promises. These are now just aspirations. You cannot drive on an aspiration. You cannot catch a train on an aspiration and you cannot have a port that is just an aspiration. You need to have real plans, properly funded. We have it, you have five years on the not. (Time expired) An opposition member: Kevin Rudd's got an aspiration.",105
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not hear exactly which member made that statement but it was not helpful or conducive of an appropriate level of courtesy at question time. Prime Minister Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (14:33): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to an article by a respected journalist, Tory Maguire, in the Punch on 27 January. She wrote: Tony Hodges, who was the one trawling the Press Gallery yesterday afternoon trying to sheet home blame for the ugly scenes to the Opposition Leader ... Who instructed Mr Hodges to carry out such a briefing? Can the Prime Minister guarantee that Mr Sam Casey, then of her media unit and present in the press gallery on the afternoon of Australia Day at the same time as Mr Hodges, did not similarly brief journalists?",105
120,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I refer the House to the answer I gave to these sorts of questions yesterday. I said yesterday that to my knowledge no such briefing was given to the press gallery on the assertions and allegations made by the member who asked the question, I point out that Mr Hodges has left my employ because of what I thought was a grave error of judgment. If the member has very specific other allegations then she should put them. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, on a point of order of direct relevance, I asked specifically about Mr Sam Casey-we know about Mr Hodges-and whether he was also briefing.",106

The Leader of the House will resume his seat because I am listening to the point of order being put forward by the member for Mackellar who has the call. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Thank you, Mr Speaker. To repeat it for your hearing, I asked specifically about Mr Sam Casey. We had an answer yesterday about Mr Hodges. I asked specifically: did Mr Sam Casey, of her then media unit, in fact also brief the media?",106
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I get the gist of what the member is saying. She will resume her seat. On the point of order, I call the Leader of the House.",106
124,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When those opposite rise, as they do for every single answer, about a point of relevance, they have to point out the standing order and the point of relevance. That should not be an opportunity to repeat the question or, what usually happens, which is to repeat a changed question.",106
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat. While it is helpful to the Chair if honourable members taking points of order cite the particular standing order, it is certainly not necessary for that to occur. I take the point of order raised by the member for Mackellar to refer to direct relevance and I ask the Prime Minister to continue her response bearing in mind the substance of the question.",106
126,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My answer, as yesterday, is not to my knowledge. Health",106
127,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Health. What is the government doing to ensure that health funding delivers the best possible outcomes for Australians?,106
128,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Hindmarsh for that question. For most Australians, nothing is more important than the health and well-being of our families. In the event of illness, people want access to the most appropriate care where they need it and when they need it. That is why, after inheriting a system that the Leader of the Opposition had cut by a billion dollars and inheriting shortages of doctors and shortages of nurses, we are training 1,000 extra nurses a year and 6,000 extra doctors over 10 years and we are putting new investments into cutting waiting times and cutting the length of emergency department waits as well. We are making sure that people can get GP care where they need it and when they need it. We are able to make these investments by carefully considering where every dollar goes. That is why we are introducing the means test on private health insurance. This is a means test which will not affect 20 million Australians. It will affect no-one who earns under $83,000 a year-not a dollar lost if you earn less than $83,000 a year. As your pay increases the subsidy decreases, but you have to be, as a family, earning a quarter million dollars a year before you lose the subsidy entirely. These modest changes will save $2.4 billion over the next three years. That is a whole year's pay for 13,000 extra doctors or 26,500 extra nurses. Why are we doing this? We are doing this because we do not want a situation where the people who sit on this front bench or that front bench have their private health insurance subsidised by the people who clean this chamber at night. As health minister, every day I hear about the needs in our health system. I hear about the diagnostic imaging which is needed in one community, I hear about the GP shortage in another community and I hear about the brilliant new medicines which are being discovered all the time by our medical researchers. I know that people on this side of the chamber want to fund those new investments. They want to see that better health care. But to do that we need to spend every dollar well. Yes, we do want to do better on dental care. We have made huge improvements in dental care, with 1½ million checkups for teenagers, with 220 new dental chairs and with projects like the $2.1 million 10-chair teaching clinic at Adelaide Dental Hospital, which serves the constituents of Adelaide, including those in the member for Hindmarsh's electorate. He has been a huge advocate for better dental care. But to do those things, we need measures like the means testing of private health insurance. (Time expired) NA The SPEAKER (14:40): I inform the House that we have present in the gallery on the floor of the chamber this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Cyprus led by His Excellency Mr Yiannakis Omirou, President of the House of Representatives.

129,Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Fair Work Australia investigation into the member for Dobell. Will the Prime Minister assure the House that the member for Dobell did not have any discussion about the investigation with either herself or her office?,107
130,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Heavens above! It has really come to this-nothing to say about the economy, no commitment to a surplus.

But, no, of course the muckraking continues because this is an opposition with",107
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the substance of the question.,107

134,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question, I have made it perfectly clear that these matters are for the independent umpire, Fair Work Australia. I know the opposition has no regard for the independence of Fair Work Australia or the police Speaker: the Prime Minister is not being directly relevant. The Prime Minister was not asked a question about Fair Work Australia; she was asked a question about the relationships and discussions that have taken place between herself and her office and the member for Dobell-a matter she can directly answer.",108

138,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will be heard in complete silence and anyone who interrupts the Prime Minister during the answer to this important question will join the member for Longman-and that refers to people on both sides of the chamber.,108
139,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The matter is being investigated by Fair Work Australia, an independent body. That is proper. It should reach its own conclusions in the way it best sees fit and the opposition should stop this campaign of trying to stand over the independent umpire, just as we saw them try to stand over the police last year.  Opposition Business) (14:43): Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the over Prime Minister's answer to that question. Given the serious matters under investigation and her stated desire to remove all perceptions of bias, will the Prime Minister publicly release all correspondence, emails and file notes or records of telephone conversations between her government, Fair Work Australia and the member for Dobell, and any other relevant documents?",108
140,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I say to the opposition that they embarrassed themselves last year when they went too far making allegations about contact between my office and Fair Work Australia, with those allegations shown to be wholly untrue. They embarrassed themselves yesterday in question time-or perhaps it was the day before-by going back to matters which were dealt with in Senate estimates in October last year. I say to the opposition that it is time they stopped embarrassing themselves with this muckraking and actually got on to something relevant to working people. Education Funding",108
141,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Will the minister outline the importance for the economy and for families of the government investing in education? What community support exists for the government's investments?",108
142,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:45): I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Families everywhere recognise how important education is. They focus on it because they know that if we are a welleducated nation we will be a successful nation. We will be a nation that is capable of meeting the challenges of the future. Our kids, as they go through school, will have the skills and the learning that will enable them to take up the jobs of the future. That is particularly important. Just as it is absolutely essential that our future prosperity is linked to having world-class schools, our future prosperity also rests very much on managing the national economy. Labor is committed to returning the budget to surplus and we are determined to deliver that, just as we have delivered record investment in education, whether it has been in facilities in schools or in providing computers for kids in years nine to 12 right around Australia. I am asked what community support exists for the government's investments. It is widespread. In fact it is so widespread that when I looked at the site of the shadow finance minister, www.andrewrobb.com.au, I found that he was instructing his constituents to congratulate everyone who has approached either the coalition government or the Labor government over the last six years to secure this funding. The shadow minister for finance has very conveniently produced a list for his constituents on his website, and when I went to that list, I suddenly found all those investments that the Gillard government had made in education. Whether it was St Paul's Primary School, with the refurbishment of classrooms and corridors, whether it was Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College with the National Secondary School Computer Fund, whether it was Bentleigh West Primary School with the 2009 National School Pride Program sporting ground upgrade-how incredible that the very shadow finance minister who argued against this government taking the right steps to stimulate this economy in the global financial crisis is now producing a list on his own website commending this government for doing the very same thing. If you ever wanted a clearer indication of the opposition's confusion over economic policy and the commitment to education that exists in this parliament, the member for Goldstein's website shows it clearly. Member for Dobell Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:48): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the contact between her chief of staff, Ben Hubbard, and the then Commonwealth industrial registrar, Doug Williams, about the Fair Work Australia investigation into the member for Dobell, and the collusion between Fair Work Australia and the media advisor of the then minister for employment and workplace relations over media management of the investigation. On what basis can the Prime Minister claim there has been no interference by the government in the investigation into the member for Dobell?",108
143,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I say that question is misleading people in this parliament. She is raising allegations against others that she must know are not sustained by the facts. I do not believe it is an appropriate standard for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to come into this place and use a question to make allegations which she must know are contrary to the facts. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting,109
144,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to Ben Hubbard, which she has raised-and if she stops yelling and starts listening then she might hear the facts-these are the facts. They are on the record from 13 May 2010 and fully available to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition if she wants facts rather than muckraking. The facts on the public record are: the industrial registrar telephoned my chief of staff, Ben Hubbard-not the other way around, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition alleges.

149,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The deputy leader's question was full of allegations and imputations. They are unworthy of her and unworthy of this place. The facts are on the record from 13 May last year showing the industrial registrar initiating contact and the nature of the contact. I invite people to look at the facts, not to listen to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, which has been brought to this place to mislead people. I then invite them to look at the facts which are on the public record from 19 October 2011 regarding contact between a media advisor in Senator Evans's office and Fair Work Australia. The facts are there for all to see. It is apparent that the kind of terminology used by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is uncalled for and unwarranted. This muckraking by the opposition brings it little credit and does it no good. Ultimately working families in this country want to know whether you stand for something: whether you stand for them, whether you stand for their interests, whether you stand for a strong economy, whether you worry about their jobs, and whether you worry about the government's finances. The opposition is incapable of doing that. They just want to shovel money at some of their the rich mates and all of this is a cover-up of those intentions.",110

162,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Hodges's the Minister for Tourism. Can you update the House on recent investments in the resources sector and what it means for the Australian economy and, of course, for Australian jobs? Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and If Minister for Tourism) (14:56): I thank the member for Hunter for the question because it enables me to address the underlying fundamental strength of the Australian economy. Over the summer period, key resource investments have again reinforced the fact that Australia is a world-leading destination for investment in the mining industry. ABARES estimates that at the moment we have planned and committed capital investment of a total of $455 billion. This is in essence about investment, which in turn creates jobs-something the coalition never wants to speak about. More importantly, most of this investment has occurred since the government's announcements of the MRRT and the refinement of the PRRT. There has been a 34 per cent increase in committed and planned capital investment in Australia since April 2011 and a 74 per cent increase from October 2010. Perhaps more importantly, it is also very much focused on key commodity sectors such as oil and gas, iron ore and coal. Perhaps the most recent investment was announced yesterday by Rio Tinto of an additional $3.4 billion expansion of the iron ore sector in north-west Western Australia. Perhaps the most pleasing was the Ichthys announcement in Darwin, a $34 billion investment, which is going to be a game-changer for Northern Australia. This effectively represents one of the largest ever investments in Australia. It represents 3,000 additional construction jobs but, perhaps more importantly, it represents 700 long term, highly-skilled, well-paying jobs in operations. It is estimated that it is going to add 20 per cent to the Northern Territory's gross state product. It is a very significant long-term economic opportunity for Australia. But already, yesterday we had a major announcement, for example, by Clough engineering of a $140 million contract for construction related to the Ichthys project, this added to an announcement last week of a further $350 million commitment for construction activities for Clough engineering relating to the $39 billion Wheatstone project. I simply want to reinforce that our fundamentals are very strong from an economic perspective. This commitment represents in the LNG sector alone $175 billion. This is going to create major jobs in construction, big Australian content, and long-term well-paid jobs for construction workers. I simply say it is about time the coalition stop talking down the Australian economy because the record speaks for itself. Member for Dobell Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:59): My question is to the Prime Minister. How does the Prime Minister reconcile her answer denying that her staff rang Fair Work Australia in relation to the Thomson investigation with this quote from Mr Doug Williams, the then Commonwealth Industrial Registrar, on 26 September 2011, referring to her staff, when he said, 'I recall receiving a phone call in early 2009 concerning inquiries that I had initiated into the Health Services Union'?",111
163,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for getting right to the back of the archives and finding something that she has blown the dust off and bringing it into the parliament. An opposition member: It was last year!,112
164,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, correct. It was last year. The matter was dealt with by Senate estimates in 2010, on 13 May. The answer provided is an accurate answer, and I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to it. Employment Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (15:00): My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for the Status of Women. What is the government doing to support and strengthen the economic contribution of women in the workplace?",112
165,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for the Status of Women) (15:01): I thank the member for Petrie for her question. The greatest security all Australians can have is to be able to work in a strong economy. The Gillard government will continue the economic policies that have made our economy the envy of the world. The Gillard government are taking a determined and strategic approach to improve women's economic security over the course of their lives. We want to create the flexibility for more women to join the workforce and to work as long as they want. That is why we have introduced the first paid parental leave scheme in the history of this country. More than 130,000 Australian families have claimed paid parental leave since it was first started. That is why we have also increased the childcare rebate for out-of-pocket expenses from 30 to 50 per cent. That is why we are also committed to reforming the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act, and the agency, and improving women's participation on government boards. Of course, there is no greater boost to working women's economic security than our removal of the coalition's Work Choices. We want to help women make the most of their working lives, and we are also making significant reforms to superannuation to help achieve that goal. It is of great concern to this government that, while women live longer than men, their superannuation balances are on average 40 per cent lower. We will increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. A 30year-old woman earning around $70,000 will have an extra $108,000 in retirement savings thanks to this increase in superannuation. We will also deliver $830 million in tax concessions to low-income workers with salaries of up to $37,000. There are 3.6 million Australians on low incomes, and 2.1 million of them are working women, who will receive these tax concessions. The Gillard government is delivering fairness for all Australians, including women, by returning the budget to surplus next financial year. But we know that the coalition are willing to sacrifice Australian families, women and some of the most vulnerable in our community to fund their $70 billion black hole. We know they want to cut back pensions, and 70 per cent of single age-pensioners are women. They want to cut child care-'the dead hand of government', the member for Mayo called it. They want higher taxes on superannuation for low-income working Australians, and 60 per cent of them are women. For them, a fairer Australia is not a priority but just another of their 'maybes', perhaps an aspiration. It is only Labor that will deliver improved economic security for women in the workplace.",112

167,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Clapping is disorderly. Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (15:04): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her comment in 2007 on the establishment of Fair Work Australia: 'Labor will remove all perceptions of bias.' How can the Prime Minister credibly claim there are no perceptions of bias about the Fair Work Australia investigation into the member for Dobell, when the investigation has taken longer than Watergate, the Korean War, the building of the Sydney Olympic Stadium and the duration of the Rudd government and she clearly has refused to answer questions today on this matter in this House?",113
168,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Now we are into absurdity upon absurdity. Of course, Fair Work Australia is independent. Of course, it therefore would be quite wrong for me to reflect on the conduct of Fair Work Australia, because those comments could be read as trying to get Fair Work Australia to do something and therefore seeking to impinge on its independence. So I will not do what the Manager of Opposition Business is inviting me to do, because to do so would be quite wrong, to do so would be to impinge on the independence of Fair Work Australia, to do so would actually be to do what the Manager of Opposition Business the rest of the time says that the government should not do. You are in the depths of a logical absurdity, because your muckraking is so without content that you twist and you turn and you scratch and you claw to try and see if you can find another little bit of mud to throw. Well, I will tell you this about Fair Work Australia. It is independent. It is unbiased. It is the umpire we created because the Howard government, in the embrace of Work Choices, had gutted the industrial umpire. It is there to make sure we have an appropriate balance between the interests of employees and employers. And it is of no surprise to me that the very existence of Fair Work Australia offends those opposite, because they are still so in love with Work Choices that anything that treats working people fairly is an offence in their eyes. is actually, at base, what most of this is about. They love trashing the industrial umpire because they think at some point they might politically profit from it, because they want the industrial umpire gone and they want Work Choices back. They want working people ripped off. That is what they have always stood for. That is what they will always stand for. This government is determined to get things done. We are delivering. On that side of this House, they might huff and puff and deal with matters like this, but this government is determined to get things done and we will continue to do so, managing the economy in the interests of working people, providing the Fair Work system so employees get a decent go",113

170,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"investing in skills so people have an opportunity in life, returning the budget to surplus because it is the right economic call. We know you are against all of those things. We will just keep getting on with the job. NA Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (15:08): I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Manager of Opposition Business from moving the following motion forthwith: That the Prime Minister is called on by the House to make a statement immediately to reconcile her: (1) statement that Fair Work Australia ‗will be independent of unions, business and government...Labor will remove all perceptions of bias‘ with the fact that Fair Work Australia‘s investigation of the Member for Dobell is now in its fourth year with seemingly no end in sight and That may not even be released to the public; and (2) assertions that there has been no political interference in the Fair Work Australia investigation of the Member for Dobell with the fact that her Chief of Staff contacted Fair Work Australia at the beginning of its investigation, one of the staff of the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations colluded with Fair Work Australia over the media management of statements to the press and she is unable to rule out that the Member for Dobell has been in communication with her or her office over the investigation. There is a protection racket that surrounds the member for Dobell and we all know why: it is not to keep him in his job, it is to keep the Prime Minister in hers. There is a smell about this government that reminds me of the smell at the back of a fridge full of old food and the smell is not going away, it is going bad and it is getting worse. It is a smell that is only going to get worse unless the Prime Minister ends the culture of cover-ups, half-truths and dirty tricks that characterises this government. The Prime Minister is damned in this matter by her own words about the Fair Work Australia investigation. Today she had a chance to reconcile them by supporting this suspension of standing orders and speaking to this motion, passing the motion and then of debating in the House her previous statements about perceptions of bias and about no political interference. Instead the Prime Minister has left the chamber yet again. She has scurried out of the House to the Chief Government Whip's office to have a cup of tea and eat a Tim Tam to avoid answering questions that the public wants answered about this very grubby matter. In the parliament today we had the very unfortunate experience of the Prime Minister being clearly on edge, being clearly rattled, being clearly incapable of telling the truth about the investigation by Fair Work Australia and about the member for Dobell. If she had told the truth she would have had to mislead the parliament and so instead she refused to answer the question. The Prime Minister has refused to answer question after question, from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, from the member for Farrer and from me as the Manager of Opposition Business in the House. And we know it is because if she answers them truthfully she will damn herself and she will damn her government. In 2007 the Prime Minister said that Fair Work Australia must get rid of all perceptions of bias. The Fair Work Australia investigation into the member for Dobell is now in its fourth year. It has taken longer than the Watergate inquiry into President Nixon, longer than the Korean War took from start to finish, longer than it took to build Sydney's Olympic Stadium, longer than the Rudd government's duration, even longer than it took Pat Farmer to run from the North to the South Pole! If you want some examples of royal commissions that were wrapped up earlier than this inquiry into the member for Dobell, we have the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, the HIH Royal Commission, the Fitzgerald inquiry into Queensland police corruption and the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. Even the royal commission into the Chamberlain case and, in the United States, the commission into the 9/11 bombings were completed in a shorter period of time than this investigation and we know why. It is because there is a protection racket that surrounds the member for Dobell and it is run out of the Prime Minister's office. There is an old mafia saying, 'A fish starts to stink from the head.' If the Prime Minister wants to avoid the perception that this government stinks from the head she must act now. She must act to give confidence to the Australian people that her office is not run on the basis of half-truths, that it is not run on the basis of cover-ups and that it is not run on the basis of dirty tricks. Far from avoiding the perception of bias, there is now a very real concern amongst the Australian public and amongst the press and the political fraternity that there is a deliberate, institutional go-slow about this investigation. But don't just take the opposition's word for it; people who have been personally involved in this case and people who know how these cases run have got plenty to say about it. Take Mr Doug Williams, the former Commonwealth Industrial Registrar. He said it was difficult to comprehend how a regulator could be seen to be properly regulating when such an inquiry was so protracted. He is absolutely right. John Lloyd, the former head of the ABCC said: You have to do things expeditiously. That is the basic good service you have to give when you are using taxpayers' money. Finally Kathy Jackson, who is very much at the centre of this controversy-she had the courage others in the Labor Party and the Labor movement did not have, the courage to take these matters to Fair Work Australia and to New South Wales Police, and my how she is paying a price as the Labor movement closes around her and tries to shut her down, but she will not be shut down-said only recently: Why has it taken so long? Why are we still waiting for answers? And why are we in this position? We need this to end. She is absolutely right. But we all know why it cannot end: because, should it end, should an adverse finding be made against the member for Dobell, and should he face any charges, the Prime Minister's survival will at risk, the Prime Minister will be the one who will be in trouble, her government will come to an end-and that is why this will never end. The Prime Minister must also reconcile her continued assertions that there has been no political interference with the Fair Work Australia investigation into the member for Dobell with what we already know. In 2009 her chief of staff contacted the Commonwealth Industrial Registrar to inquire about the investigation they were doing into the Health Services Union. Quite properly, he was rebuffed at the time by the Commonwealth Industrial Registrar-and all of that comes from the record. But Fair Work Australia knew from that moment that they were on notice, that they were being watched by the Prime Minister. The red flag went up in Fair Work Australia-and that was the purpose of the call. The call was not to inquire about the investigation into the Health Services Union; it was to let Fair Work Australia know that the Prime Minister's office new about it and they were watching Fair Work Australia. And the warning shot that was fired across the bow of Fair Work Australia had its effect. What happened? An institutional goslow happened. That is what happened. Almost four years later we are still waiting for the completion of that investigation. The Prime Minister's office's phone call had the desired effect: it stopped the investigation dead in its tracks. It did not matter what conversation was about; the point was that the Prime Minister's office wanted Fair Work Australia to know, 'We are watching'. That is why there is a smell that hangs over this government like bad food getting worse, and it will continue to hang over this government and be a stench until the matter is dealt with. We also know there was collusion between the then minister's office and Fair be Work Australia about massaging the media. The phrase was used: 'Awesome, that should ensure it doesn't get any run in the morning'. That was a clear indication again, from the government, that they were pleased with Fair Work Australia's work, they were pleased that Fair Work Australia were running it the way they were-they ticked off the media statement; they were colluding with Fair Work Australia to ensure this matter went away. If it is not bad enough that the Fair Work Australia investigation is perceived to be in institutional go-slow, to sandbag the government in power, it is even worse that claims of political interference hang over the investigation and taint the government. But the worse aspect of this is that the interests of 170,000 workers in the Health Services Union, who are members who pay their dues, are not even being considered. These are amongst the poorest workers in the workforce-170,000 Australians want answers to what happened to their money when the member for Dobell headed up their union. Those 170,000 people deserve answers to how their money was spent when the member for Dobell headed up the Health Services Union. And there are members on that side of the House who I know agree with me. There are good Labor members from old union backgrounds, like the minister for resources, who must cringe at having to defend the member for Dobell in this place and having the him as part of his government-and worse, having to rely on the member for Dobell to stay in government, because without his vote the government will fall. That is what this is all about: protecting the member for Dobell in order to protect the Prime Minister.",114
171,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Is the motion seconded? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:18): I second the motion.,117
172,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call. Ms JULIE BISHOP: The reason this House needs to suspend standing orders and debate this matter is that it is of monumental national interest. The gossamer thread that holds this government in office is provided courtesy of the member for Dobell. Without his vote the government could fall, Australia would be heading for the polls-and what a relief that would be. So it is massively important in terms of the government of this country that the Prime Minister be called to account over the legitimacy of the member for Dobell remaining in this House. And her implausible explanations of her government's involvement in this investigation must mean that she comes into this House and explains. The Prime Minister has a credibility problem. We know that courtesy of her colleague the member for Lyons. He said she has a credibility problem, and my God she does. Her string of broken promises, her shredding of written commitments, her repeated betrayals-her words mean so little that no-one believes her. When I was in question time, when she was standing up there saying that her staff did not ring the registrar when her staff did ring the registrar, I was reminded of Richard Nixon-'I am not a crook'! I accept that the comparison is unfair to Richard Nixon. Her answers in question time just add to her credibility problem. When she accused me of misleading people by suggesting there had been contact between her chief of staff, Mr Hubbard, and the registrar, Mr Williams, she said I was misleading people. In fact, she could not reconcile the words of the industrial registrar that he received a call from her office. The Prime Minister must explain that lapse to this House. There is a foul odour around the Prime Minister's office, from her media unit in particular, over its grubby act of inciting a racial riot on Australia Day-one of the lowest acts of a Prime Minister's office in living memory. And it is rivalled by the collusion from another government minister's media unit into the Fair Work Australia investigation into the allegations surrounding the member for Dobell. I note that the member for Dobell denies the allegations. I also note that he is yet to give the full explanation to the House that he promised he would give months ago of allegations that relate to the misuse of at least $100,000 of union funds for the procurement of prostitutes-never specifically denied. This is $100,000 of funds of lowly-paid workers of the Health Services Union. After the member for Dobell parted from his job at the Health Services Union, the allegations were referred to Fair Work Australia in 2009-over three years ago. And yes, the hierarchy of Fair Work Australia has some explaining to do, and no doubt Justice Giudice will do that. I remind members that Fair Work was set up under legislation personally drafted by the Prime Minister as the responsible minister at the time, legislation that requires Fair Work Australia to act in a manner that is fair and just, quick and informal, avoids unnecessary technicalities and is open and transparent. Just what is quick, open or transparent about this investigation and the government's role needs to be explained. Members will be interested in this web of intrigue. This chart shows the Labor Health Services Union family tree. We have the Prime Minister. We have Tim Lee. We have Craig Thomson. We have the connections between Labor, the Health Services Union and Fair Work Australia. With apologies to Sir Walter Scott, Albo, Labor's mission statement is: Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive! That is the Labor Party. This House must be concerned about the part the Prime Minister's office played in the delay of this investigation. We know that the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister, Ben Hubbard, had contact with the registrar. We know from the words of the registrar. The Prime Minister must come clean. Once upon a time, back when she was in opposition, she would set standards for the government. I recall her words in 2004: 'There is an obligation of honesty and probity in public life that makes the minister responsible for the conduct of their staff.' This Prime Minister can live up to the standard that she set for others by revealing all contact of any nature between any member of the government or any staff in relation to the scope of this investigation and the time taken.

173,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:24): This is the 37th failed suspension from the opposition in the 43rd Parliament. Of those, 22 have been to suspend standing orders to allow a motion critical of the Prime Minister to be moved. Up until this week, 20 out of 20 of them had been moved by the Leader of the Opposition. But today, just like earlier this week, this is based on such a flimsy approach that he has not had the ticker to move it himself. He has had the Manager of Opposition Business stand up and do it for him. And then they have the gall to say, 'Where's the Prime Minister?' The Prime Minister has been in here this week answering question after question about the economy, because that is what we are interested in on this side of the House. But it is no wonder that again today, after a couple of questions up the front to talk about the economy, the opposition went straight in the gutter, straight in the dirt, because today their plan in terms of surplus is in shreds. Today, indeed, they have the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow finance minister, the shadow Treasurer and Senator Abetz, the leader over in the Senate, all saying different things. Senator Abetz now calls surplus 'an extravagant promise'. They have a Leader of the Opposition whose policy is down to 'aspirations'. They are happy to ask question after question. I will tell you what. I would like an answer to this. Maybe someone will ask them whether the office of this Leader of the Opposition has ever told anyone in the media the whereabouts of the Prime Minister. I would be very interested in the conduct of the office of this Leader of the Opposition, it has because if it is good enough to go down these roads then we will go down these roads. This Prime Minister showed the standards that she had and that she expected of her office when she took action against Mr Hodges. So I look forward to an answer about that-just like we know they have the hide to come in here and ask about contact with regard to the investigation into the member for Dobell. We all know-have they forgotten?-what they were doing at the end of last year, ringing people in the police, ringing New South Wales ministers and interfering in investigations directly. The shadow Attorney-General was ringing New South Wales officials in a completely inappropriate manner-and they have the hide! We would be really interested in the contact they have had with Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart about giving them a tax break. We would be very interested in that, because we know that the LNP fly around in Mr Palmer's jet during election campaigns. We know about the record amounts of donations that go in there. We would be very interested in all of those questions. They will do anything but debate the economy and jobs. At the beginning of this year-after last year, when the Leader of the Opposition was parodied as the walking vuvuzela, the bloke who stands for nothing, who just makes one noise, who has turned the coalition of yesterday into the 'noalition' of today-I think we could have expected that there would be some change in strategy when we came into the first week of the parliament this year, but we have had nothing but the same old muckraking over old issues. We have had nothing but the same old personal attacks against the government and, in particular, the personal attacks against the Prime Minister. We have had nothing but the same old negative approach of all those opposite. You get a few interjections. There has been a bit of an issue, Mr SPEAKER - you might have noticed-about American presidents. Certainly I am now aware of the movie, but I have also been aware for a longer period of time about American presidential campaigns. I have been an observer of them. I note that it is not unusual, as you look at the Republican contest that is going on here, a fight between the extreme Right, the very extreme Right and the completely-off-the-planet Right. There is precedent for that. There is precedent for these conservative campaigns. Barry Goldwater was an extreme rightwing candidate in 1964. He went around and appealed to fear. He ran a campaign trying to divide the great nation that is the United States of America. He did that under a slogan, trying to appeal to all the worse elements. He never appealed to the better that mankind is capable of. His slogan said: 'In your heart you know he's right.' That was the slogan when appealing to that sort of prejudice, just as the current Leader of the Opposition tries to do, pressing every button that he can on every single issue. The Democrats very successfully parodied the Goldwater campaign, and it is something that I think fits with this Leader of the Opposition. Their response was: 'In your guts you know he's nuts.' That is exactly what this Leader of the Opposition shows himself to be in the way that he conducts himself in public life. He has indeed done for public discourse in this country what the vuvuzela did for World Cup soccer in South Africa. He runs around, he says no to everything, he tries to divide the community, he tries to scare people, he has nothing positive to say whatsoever. You would have thought that they had three months after we finished in November, right through December, right through January, through February, to come up with an alternative plan. Anything will do, anything at all-an alternative plan on the economy, on trade, on infrastructure, on health, on education. But what they have is a blank sheet, the blank sheet that we saw with the Fix the Bruce plan. That would apply to every one of their policies. Their fix the health system plan is the same-a blank page. Their plan to fix the education system is the same-a blank page.",118
174,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House ought not to depart too far from the substance of the motion to suspend standing orders.,119
175,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Indeed, Mr Speaker. The reason why the suspension should not be allowed is because we want to debate issues of substance. What they are doing in moving this motion today is knocking off their own MPI again because they are not interested in debating any real policy issues.",119
176,Mr Hockey,MOTIONS,"Go on, knock it off. It is on the economy.",120
177,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Then he has the hide to say we do not want to talk about the economy. I have got news for the shadow Treasurer: the debate finishes at 4.30 when we go to adjournment. They are not aware of that; they are not too good on standing orders. Old or new, any of them, they do not seem to get it. They come in here and they just have one policy. I will say this: on this side of the House we are the builders, we are the nation builders; they are the wreckers. We are the people who are interested in enhancing opportunity; those opposite are only interested in entrenching privilege, entrenching privilege of the big end of town. That is who they represent. The Leader of the Opposition runs around and says he is the friend of the workers but he is trying to smash the auto industry, he is not prepared to support the steel industry, he is not prepared to support the changes to the economy that we need as we move to a carbon constrained future that will ensure that we continue to be the envy of the industrialised world. Those opposite have a $70 billion black hole. Those opposite cannot talk about anything positive because they do not have any money: they are at minus $70 billion before they start. And that is before you take into account all the other commitments that they have made. The fact is that it is only this side of the House that has a plan to govern. We are getting on with the job of governing. Those opposite just have hissy fits, complaints, negativism and no plan for jobs, no plan for the economy, no plan for social policy, no plan for infrastructure, no plan for the nation. Truss, WE The Australian nation is better than that and it is a lot better than those opposite, which is why we remain on this side of the chamber and why in the lead-up to 2013 we will still be on this side of the chamber, and after the next election, because you stand for nothing.

193,Mr HOCKEY,IMPORTANCE," Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and thank you for choosing my suggestion. The Prime Minister has declared that this year there will be a debate on the economy. Despite her best endeavours to close question time on Tuesday and to curtail debate yesterday, we want to have a debate on jobs and the economy. The job I want to talk about is not her job, even though that seems to be the preoccupation of most of the parliamentary Labor Party members and many others. I want to talk about the jobs of everyday Australians. Labor has not delivered on jobs. The Treasurer promised on budget night last year that his budget was all about jobs, jobs, jobs. In fact, he claimed in the budget papers that the budget itself would help to create 500,000 jobs in the following 12 months. He also claimed, by the way, in the budget that he would have a $22 billion deficit. Of course, neither has eventuated. In fact, as he admitted to Fran Kelly on Radio National just a few days ago, on 30 January: KELLY: In terms of the positives though, the Government positively forecast half a million new jobs over the next few years to be created. Given the zero jobs growth last year, are you still confident that that figure holds, that it can be achieved? TREASURER: Well, certainly we will do less than that ... Of course they will do less than that. For the first time in 20 years, last year there was no jobs growth in Australia. In fact the jobs news is likely to get worse, given the Roy Morgan employment index and, obviously, the reported news about job losses. Since the beginning of January more than 2,000 job cuts have been announced. At this point I remind the minister at the table, the Minister for Trade, of the comments by the Prime Minister in relation to job losses. This is a very important set of words from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce: These are powerful, economy-wide transformations, perhaps best thought of as 'growing pains'. Just as the Labor Party said when Prime Minister Howard alluded to the fact that families 'have never had it so good', so too will this Prime Minister regret job losses at every stage being defined simply as her own words: growing pains. Is it growing pains for Westpac, who announced 400 job losses just a few days ago, for the Royal Bank of Scotland, with 200 job losses, and for ANZ, with 1,000 job losses within the next six months? These are the Prime Minister's 'growing pains'. Holden will lose 100 jobs, Toyota will lose 350 jobs-but that is just growing pains. BHP will lose 155, Reckitt Benckiser 190, Manildra 70, Norsk Hydro 150, Tomago Aluminium 100, Thales 50, Don Smallgoods 31 and Macquarie Group 1,000 around the world. This is just 'growing pains' according to our Prime Minister. But growing pains were never meant to hurt this much, and that is the problem. No matter how high the challenge of the increasing cost of living, everyday Australians cannot meet it at all without a job. And the only job this Prime Minister is concerned about is her own, because we know that when she announces job programs they do not work. There is no better example than the Jobs Fund Infrastructure Employment Projects Program. It was set up more than 12 months ago-$150 million and not one job. When asked a simple question today by the Leader of the Opposition about aluminium jobs, what was the Prime Minister's response? 'Well, we've got a $3½ billion fund.' The bottom line is that the way to create jobs is to have prosperity. The only way to create jobs is to have a growing economy. The only way to create jobs is to give employers an incentive to make money and therefore to spend money to continue to grow. That is the only way you create jobs. We did it; we know. After we left government in 2007, in February 2008-just a few months later, the lag indicator of unemployment-unemployment was just four per cent. That was on top of a budget surplus. That was on top of money in the bank. We left them with the most robust employment indicator Australia had seen in 30 years, yet somehow they are taking pride today in an unemployment rate of 5.2 per cent with a falling participation rate. The government see that as a great moment of signature achievement. They keep comparing us to Spain or Greece or Italy or a range of other countries-perhaps Ireland would get a mention-all countries where the unemployment rate is well into the double digits, instead of comparing us to the fastest players out there. We are a nation of aspirational people. We want to aspire to be the best. So when we talk about the Asian Century let us compare ourselves to those economies. Do not compare us to Europe and the United States in order to make us look good, because they are no longer our competition. The Asian Century is real. Therefore, we must compare ourselves with the fastest runner in the field because we are a nation that wants to win. We have always wanted to win. Whether it be in sport, the arts or anything else, we want to be the best in the world, and I would encourage the government to start addressing the fact that we have to compare ourselves to the best. When it comes to the cost of living, the Labor Party must be held to account. Over the four years of Labor, headline inflation has averaged 2.9 per cent. Under the only coalition it averaged 2.4 per cent. More telling has been the cost of essential services under Labor. In just four years electricity has gone up 60 per cent, gas has gone up 36 per cent, water and sewerage have gone up 58 per cent. They are the things that people have to buy every day. It is not discretionary spending. It is not a TV or even a second computer at home. These are the things people have to spend money on every day. Health care has gone up 19.5 per cent, education has gone up 23.8 per cent, insurance has gone up 31.6 per cent and basic foods like lamb have gone up 26.2 per cent. Fruit has gone up 39 per cent and of course rent, the one that many Australians cannot avoid, has gone up 24.6 per cent. What is Labor doing to address that? They are introducing a carbon tax, and the carbon tax is going to increase the cost of everything. It is going to increase the cost of electricity, gas, water, health care and education. It is going to increase the cost of insurance. It will increase the cost of lamb and fruit, and it will increase the cost because it is a tax on the way we live. It is a tax on energy, and as a nation we need energy to propel ourselves forward. The carbon tax is a tax on everything. Why were many Australians disappointed that the Reserve Bank did not cut interest rates this year? I would say that was because what they are actually paying under Labor is higher than what they paid under us. Let us be very clear: this is a government that keeps using selective data as its basic input. The truth is, under the coalition the standard variable mortgage rate-the one that people actually pay-was 7.26 per cent on average; under Labor, 7.51 per cent on average, and even then that is after the cash rate of the Reserve Bank went down to three per cent, that is even when the economy had a negative quarter. Out of all of that, what people actually pay out of their pocket for a home mortgage is higher under Labor. What is more dramatic than the typical home loan of $294,800 being $700 a year cheaper under us than it is under Labor? The big one is small business. For small business, the average rate under Labor is 10.23 per cent for an average small business unsecured overdraft. Under us it was 8.89 per cent. For a $200,000 overdraft the difference for a small business is $2,680 a year. It is a huge amount of money when they are thinking about increasing the work commitments of existing staff or employing another person part time. For all the huff and puff of the Treasurer against the banks, on more than 50 occasions he has warned the banks to pass through the RBA cash rate change and he has been ignored on 50 occasions. In fact, I lie, because it was 51 occasions. I keep forgetting the last interest rate cut when his old mate at the National Australia Bank did not even pass it on in full. So over the four of rent years of Labor, the spread between the Reserve Bank cash rate and the home mortgage and business borrowing rates has averaged 2.73 per cent, almost one per cent more than under the coalition. Then we come to the deficit of debt. Let me be very clear: the coalition went to the 2010 election promising a surplus in 2012-13 and we did so based on the Treasury data that was released during the course of the election campaign. It is known as the Preelection Economic and Fiscal Outlook. All the other data that comes out of the government during the course of a parliamentary term is in fact the figures that belong to the Minister for Finance and the Treasurer-they are their figures. The only time you have a release of raw Treasury data, which is the starting gun for every debate about surpluses over the course of an election campaign, is during an election campaign itself with the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. When we had those numbers we quite rightly forecast that we would have had a surplus in 2012-13. We are as committed as ever to fiscal prudence. We are as committed as ever to smaller government. We are as committed as ever to giving Australians more control of their own money. But we cannot believe the Labor Party's own budget today, which was meant to be at first a $12 billion deficit, and then a $22 billion deficit, and after just six months it turned into a $37 billion deficit. If they manage to have a $15 billion blow-out in just six months when you have about trend growth, when you have the best terms of trade in 100 years, they are now asking us to believe that they are going to have the biggest fiscal consolidation in Australia in 60 years in just 12 months. They talk about a $70 billion costing hole-that is over four years. The Labor Party says it is going to do half of that in 12 months. They are miracle workers! If the miracle is to be performed then let us all have a look. Now we have the government saying, 'We will deliver a surplus next year.' The Prime Minister says, 'We will deliver a surplus.' The problem is that we will not know until September 2013 and I am prepared, as a betting man, to put a little bit aside. I suggest that the current Prime Minister is not going to be in that job in 2013.",123
194,Mr Lyons,IMPORTANCE,Are you giving odds?,126
195,Mr HOCKEY,IMPORTANCE,"Give me odds, come on, give me odds. I will take the odds. The Labor member wants to give me odds and I am sure he can give me better odds than anyone else. Do you know why? If the Labor Party has a $15 billion blow-out in the budget deficit in just six months, how can they possibly be trusted to deliver a surplus in September 2013, let alone demanding that we commit to it. They cannot commit to it and they are in government. They are the ones with thousands of public servants and they cannot commit to it. The problem the Labor Party has, as the member for Lyne said, goes to credibility. People no longer trust them at their word. They no longer trust the Labor Party at what it says. When they say they will not have a carbon tax, they have a carbon tax. When they say they will do something about poker machines, they do not do anything on poker machines. When the Prime Minister gave a commitment to the Greens about dental care, she then goes and breaks her word. She has broken her written word to the member for Denison. She has broken her spoken word to the Australian people. She has broken her solemn word to the member for Griffith about loyalty as Deputy Prime Minister. If you cannot trust them with their own words you cannot trust them with the economy. (Time expired)",126
196,Dr EMERSON,IMPORTANCE," Earlier in the week, when the Prime Minister said that this year parliamentary time would be devoted to debating the economy, the Leader of the Opposition channelled Dirty Harry-Clint Eastwood-and said, 'Make my day'. They have been running away from an economic debate during question time ever since. They have brought out case after case of what they consider to be issues of interest to the people of Australia and they are nothing but fear and smear. They are nothing but fear and smear because the coalition is terrified of a proper debate about the Australian economy, including about budget surpluses. We know why because this week the coalition was in a fog of confusion about their commitment to bring the budget back to surplus. We heard from the shadow Treasurer just now that when the Leader of the Opposition made his statement before the last election about bringing the budget back to surplus, he did not have the benefit of the numbers at that time. What the opposition leader said was, 'We will bring the country back into surplus in 2012-13.' There was no qualification. He did not say, 'We will try; it depends on the state of the books.' It was unqualified that coalition would bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. This week, however, out of this fog of confusion, it has become clear, as the fog lifts, that the coalition has no intention of ever in the foreseeable future bringing the budget back to surplus-let alone if they were given the opportunity to do so in 201213. They have walked away from that promise and now blame the official budget figures for doing so. The fog started earlier this week on Monday, when the shadow finance minister was asked about bringing the budget back to surplus and he replied, 'Well, it just depends.' This was the first qualification. Then the shadow Treasurer, thinking that he still had the backing of the Leader of the Opposition, very bravely said, 'As we have said, we would get to surplus next year; we would get to surplus in 201213.' So the shadow Treasurer repudiated the shadow finance minister-that was on Tuesday. But, on the same day, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House said: 'When we get back to power, we will be in a better position to say when our first surplus will be delivered.' So he is walking away from the commitment by the shadow Treasurer and siding with the shadow finance minister. But there is more! On the same day, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, 'Well, let's see what the real figures are.' So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition joins the shadow finance minister and the Manager of Opposition Business in this chamber in saying, 'Let's see what happens; it all depends.' The shadow Treasurer would have been thinking, 'Well, I will get the backing of my leader, because it was my leader who said, before the last election in an unqualified way, that we would bring the budget back to the surplus.' But, no, the opposition leader came out just yesterday and said, 'We will get back to surplus as quickly as possible.' He absolutely left the shadow Treasurer stranded in that fog of confusion. The reason they cannot get back to surplus is simple: they have a $70 billion funding hole. We heard the coalition just now, through the shadow Treasurer, saying, 'Oh, it is Labor which is talking about a $70 billion funding hole.' But, on 12 August last year, the shadow Treasurer said, 'Therefore, finding $50 billion, $60 billion or $70 billion is about identifying waste and blah, blah, blah.' He referred to the number, the $70 billion. The shadow finance minister backed him up on that occasion. He did not desert the shadow Treasurer. He said, 'The $70 billion is an estimate of the sort of challenge that we will have.' Out of the mouths of the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister come these words: '$70 billion'. Then the Leader of the Opposition, worried because the cat was out of the bag, said, 'Well, this $70 billion is a fanciful figure; it has been plucked from the air by government ministers and I am surprised you are retelling it to me.' He said that on 25 August. The shadow finance minister was then on the spot as a result of the opposition leader saying, 'This is a myth; it is a Labor creation.' The shadow finance minister was asked, 'Is it a furphy?' and he said, 'No, it is not a furphy; we came out with that figure.' So there it is-the $70 billion funding hole reaffirmed by the shadow finance minister. The shadow Treasurer was then asked, 'You are happy to recommit to that idea of $70 billion in savings?' and the shadow Treasurer replied, 'It is not a figure that I use.' The words came out of his own mouth, but then he tried to walk away from them. On Friday night on Lateline, the Manager of Opposition Business in this chamber, crying like a baby against alleged bias in the interview-the problem was that he absolutely botched it-talked about how the coalition having $70 billion worth of spending cuts was Labor Party spin. It came from the shadow Treasurer and from the shadow finance minister and he says it is Labor Party spin! Then, on Q&A on Monday this week, the shadow Treasurer said: 'There is no $70 billion hole. I have never said it and I am not saying it now. It is just a myth, a Labor creation and a figment of people's imagination.' Then he was put under pressure, because you cannot scurry away on Q&A, and he said, 'Okay, I should not have said any figure.' He had to admit that he had said there was a $70 billion funding hole, because the tape was there, the transcripts were there and the records were there. He was joined by the shadow finance minister in saying they have a $70 billion funding hole. That takes us to this problem. This is why they cannot get back to surplus-they have this huge set of unfunded commitments. When you have that, you either slash services-we heard from the member for Mayo what they would be: age pension, childcare services and all of the social spending which is vital to the social fabric and to supporting the disadvantaged in this community; the member for Mayo said that they are the areas which should be targeted-or you do not return to surplus. We know that they will do one or the other and, from the debacle this week, it is clear they are not going to return to surplus if they are elected to government. They have basically said that. They have said it as clearly as you could possibly expect them to. Indeed, Senator Abetz, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, said that it was 'an extravagant promise'. That is what he said today. The whole idea of a return to surplus is an extravagant promise. That is what the agenda is-they have no intention of returning to surplus. In this fog of confusion, when the shadow Treasurer earlier in the week was asked, 'Will you return to surplus?' he channelled President Obama and said, 'Yes, we can.' But then the opposition leader came out and said, 'No, we cannot.' The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate then said, 'Anyway, it was an extravagant promise.' What we have seen this week is smear and fear from the coalition-because they do not want us to make their day and have a proper debate about the economy. As soon as we engage on the economy, they revert to fear and smear. But we have seen, in this chamber and this parliament, a triumph of policy over fear and of substance over smear. That has been the performance of the Labor side, the government led by the Prime Minister. We will take on the great economic debates. This is important to the country's future. Day after day those opposite come into question time trying to smear the government and create fear in the Australian community. The truth is that interest rates are going down because this government has created the capacity for the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate. Do not ever rely on the coalition to make judgments about the state of the economy and the state of economic management-look at the ratings agencies whose job it is to do that. For the first time in Australia's history, all three ratings agencies give Australia a AAA rating. That was never achieved under the coalition; never achieved under the Howard government. When they come in here and finally engage in an economics debate, at a quarter past four on a Thursday afternoon, by trying to trash talk the economy and talk it down, we should look to the independent assessors, the three ratings agencies who rate us AAA. Our giving the Reserve Bank the capacity to reduce interest rates is the very reason we will bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and it is for that very reason that the coalition is running away from that-they know they cannot do it. The shadow Treasurer just came into the chamber and said that interest rates are higher now than they were under the coalition. It is unbelievable how they can come in here and say interest rates are higher than they were under the coalition. The Reserve Bank cash rate is now 4¼ per cent. It was 6¾ per cent under the coalition. And 4¼ per cent is less than 6¾ per cent. Then they say no, they meant the average variable rate-7.3 per cent now, 8.6 per cent under the coalition. So they cannot come in here and seek to mislead parliament by saying interest rates are higher under Labor. I remember very well the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, saying during the 2004 election campaign that interest rates will always be lower under the coalition than under Labor, and that they would keep interest rates at record lows. What happened? There were 10 interest rate rises in a row. They want to air brush that out of history. They come in here and say that that never happened, interest rates did not rise under the coalition and they were lower under the coalition than under Labor. That is completely untrue. I was heartened by one statement that the shadow Treasurer made during his presentation. He said we are now living in the Asian century. Wow, that is a revelation! Labor governments have been preparing for the Asian century since the mid-1980s when Bob Hawke undertook vital economic reforms, with the support of Treasurer Keating, to engage with the Asian economy because we realised we could no longer link our future with that of Europe. That was a pretty good punt; it was very visionary. It actually started back in 1972 when Gough Whitlam formally recognised the People's Republic of China. It is always Labor having the guts to make the big reforms. Now the coalition, at a quarter past four on a Thursday afternoon, decide to tell us we are in the Asian century. Welcome to the club! What do the opposition do in relation to the Asian century? They adopt a trade policy that breaches the World Trade Organisation rules and invites retaliation against Australian manufacturing workers and Australian farmers. In relation to their anti-dumping policy, they say they will stick oneup China; they will implement a policy that definitely breaches the WTO rules, opening up our farmers and our manufacturing workers to retaliation by China and by other countries in our region. One day-this is hilarious-the shadow trade minister said, 'Look, Emerson and Labor ought to accelerate free trade agreement negotiations with China'. I thought that that was politics and you do get a bit of criticism from time to time. The next day, the opposition leader said it should be put on the backburner because China is not a democracy. He always repudiates the shadow trade minister. Why wouldn't you repudiate the shadow trade minister? I admit that I have been critical of the member for Moncrieff because of how long it was since he last asked me a question. I can reveal today that the member for Moncrieff last asked me a question 806 days ago. But the shadow trade minister has never asked me a question-not one. In fact, today is her 500th anniversary-she can celebrate going 500 days without asking a question as the shadow trade minister. Every time she sticks her head up, the opposition leader knocks it off. He actually said the member for Kooyong knows something about foreign policy, and he said isn't it a relief to have someone on the coalition side that knows something about foreign policy. Let us not have this feigned indignation and this concern for jobs. This is a coalition that said it would not have had a budget deficit during the global recession. It would have smashed jobs in this country and it would smash jobs again by taking half a billion dollars out of support for the car industry. It has no interest in that industry. The only political party that supports the working men and women of Australia is the great Australian Labor Party, and we will continue to do that while you support Gina Rinehart and do everything you can to smash jobs in this country through a reckless fiscal policy. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (16:20): Those listening to the debate on the economy through question time and this matter of public importance would surely be amazed to hear the Prime Minister during question time and now the Minister for Trade lecture the Australian public and the opposition on surplus budgets. They would find that unbelievable. Only those opposite, only the minister and those behind him, could suspend their sense of reality on their budget record over the last four years, or over the last years of the Hawke and Keating government, enough to keep a straight face and lecture any member of the Australian public on budget surpluses. I say to members opposite that the more you engage in this ridiculous, unreal argument, the more you insult the Australian families who know that your debt and deficit, your fiscal irresponsibility, costs them dearly at the of the day. The shadow Treasurer outlined in great detail your failure on jobs and outlined very eloquently your failed fiscal record.",126
197,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," The member for Casey should know he needs to speak through the chair-I do not think I have had a debt crisis. Mr TONY SMITH: That is right, but you do bear some share of the blame, Madam Deputy Speaker.",130
198,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"Not when I am in the chair. You need to withdraw that. You have been here long enough to understand the forms of the House. Mr TONY SMITH: You are right-not when you are in the chair. I withdraw. The profligacy and the excess of those opposite-the higher debt and the higher deficits-have costs for Australian families. You have to give the Prime Minister top marks for spin and sheer gall. For those opposite to be lecturing on surplus budgets and on fiscal responsibility when none of them has ever been part of a surplus budget is absolutely ridiculous. Those of us on this side of the House are in no mood to be lectured by those opposite on balanced budgets-not by a political party that has run deficit after deficit every year it has been in office since 1990. If they were a football team they would have a perfect record for all the wrong reasons: zero out of 10. They would surely win the wooden spoon. Let us have a close look at their record, since they are so interested in this subject. They are so interested in giving lectures and so uninterested in looking at their own record. But their own record is the only thing that matters to Australian families and small businesses. If we go back to 1990-91, we see a deficit of $400 million, rising to $12 billion end the following year, to $18 billion the year after that as well as the following year and to $14 billion the year after that. Then-and this will sound familiar to my colleagues on this side of the House-in 1995 the then Labor government promised that the budget would return back to surplus-that it would miraculously turn back within one year. Back in those days, before the Charter of Budget Honesty-introduced by Treasurer Costello-the government did not release the fiscal outlook at the start of an election campaign. So right through that election campaign Labor insisted that the budget was still in surplus. Even those members opposite know about the infamous black hole that the Howard government encountered upon its election. The outcome for the 1995-96 budget was $11 billion. That was the last six years of the Labor government-back-to-back deficits, helping pile up net government debt of $96 billion. That debt had a tangible cost. It cost $8 billion a year just to service that debt pay it off. That was $8 billion that was not spent on roads, schools or hospitals. Luckily, Australia then took a different path. By 1998 the budget was back in surplus and we started chipping away at the debt mountain. It took 10 years from 1996 until 'Debt-Free Day' in April 2006. By 2007, there was $45 billion in the bank as a buffer against the unforeseen. As a result, Australia was uniquely placed when the GFC hit in 2008. Imagine what Australia would have confronted if we had stayed on that path of deficit and debt for all those years-if we had stayed on the Labor path. For this Prime Minister and Treasurer to claim credit for Australia's performance through the GFC, when it was the work that was done prior to that to prepare Australia against the unforeseen that was responsible, is absolutely shameless. It is like two second-string players appearing on the field during time on in the last quarter of a grand final and trying to convince people that they were responsible for all the match-winning moves. When it comes to economics, it would be embarrassing if it were not so serious. If we look at the first four years of this Labor government, there is still no surplus. As the shadow Treasurer said, Labor's record has been deficit after deficit. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, there has been $167 billion worth of cumulative deficits-$27 billion, $54 billion, $47 billion. Then we come to the 2011-12 financial year. The deficit was supposed to be $12 billion-and this is an interesting point, as the shadow Treasurer pointed out. It was 'supposed to be', but what happened? The MYEFO in December 2010-about 15 months ago-pegged this financial year's deficit at $12 billion. Six months later, in the and not budget, we were told it would be $22.6 billion. Then, at the end of last yearanother six months on-it was $37.1 billion. And the year ain't over yet. Those opposite have the hide to try to lecture on budget surpluses when, in the whole lifetime of one of the members on this side of the House, Labor has never delivered one. The Treasurer is on some sort of Burke and Wills expedition. The government thinks it can airbrush away its own history over more than 20 years, but the public are very familiar with the debt story in Australia, because they have paid the price, over many years, for Labor's failure. It is always the failure of Labor's fiscal competence right here in Canberra that forces Australian families and small businesses to pay the price in their homes and their small businesses. They know in their hearts of hearts that a lack of competence here by this government is leading to a lack of economic confidence throughout Australian small businesses and Australian families. This is backed up in all the official publications that the minister, the Treasurer and his colleagues will never quote from in question time. But the record of those opposite, for the last 21 years, is of nothing but deficitNA The SPEAKER (16:30): Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Alpine National Park",130
199,Mr CHESTER,ADJOURNMENT," Labor might pretend to be in government, but we all know that it is the Greens that are in charge. I see a wry smile already appearing on the face of the member for Eden-Monaro, because I think in his heart of hearts he knows it to be true. It is the innerthe city Greens ideology that has driven the minister for the environment to ban the Victorian government's trial of cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park. I remember seeing in this place last year the minister the environment ridicule the potential for cattle grazing to reduce the severity of bushfires in the Victorian high country. He has repeatedly admitted his bias against the cattlemen, and he is so blinded by his prejudice against their cause and by his devotion to the Greens that he has never given them the chance to meet with him and present their case. The only attempt at consultation the minister of the environment undertook was a publicity stunt last year, when he flew to Mt Hotham for a photo opportunity. He drove around the bush for a couple of hours, found a deer wallow, said it was evidence of damage by cattle and returned home to the genteel suburbs of Sydney. I digress for a moment because I want to note that that is one of the biggest problems with the current government. There is not one cabinet minister who actually lives in regional Australia. For this Labor government at the very highest level, regional Australia is a place that you visit sometimes-maybe for a holiday but more likely just for a photo opportunity. What hope do people at the Mountain Cattlemens Association of Victoria have when none of the cabinet ministers have an appreciation of regional life and they see their policy decisions through the prism of suburban experience-not from living amongst the farmers, the fishermen, the forestry workers and workers in other professions which are traditional in regional areas? So it was bitterly disappointing, but absolutely no surprise at all, when the Sydney union organiser who became the minister for the environment decided to ban cattle grazing in Alpine National Park, despite the fact the Victorian government won a clear mandate at the last state election to introduce its trial. The minister's reflections in this place in relation to the possibility of using grazing to for reduce the bushfire fuel loads was another demonstration of the rank hypocrisy we have seen from the Labor Party on this issue. I want to refer to a media release from the ACT Labor government. It was released in October last year and quotes the Manager of the Fire Management Unit, Neil Cooper, as saying: 'Grazing is a crucial, if oft forgotten, component of the ACT‘s hazard reduction program … ……… 'Strategic grazing serves to not only remove bushfire fuel, but it also ensures the remaining fuels are compacted. ……… 'This year we intend to graze more than 7000 hectares across 76 separate sites. I hope the minister is listening to this. Strategic cattle grazing removes bushfire fuel in the ACT. Let's get this right: it is okay for the Labor Party to use cattle to protect homes in Canberra but not to help save lives, properties and the environment in the Victorian high country! I call on the minister to simply admit that his decision to ban grazing in the Alpine National Park was all about pleasing the Greens. Regional Victorians will never forget this. They will never forgive this government for its contempt for country people and its contempt for the more than 150-year heritage of the mountain cattlemen. In the time. I have remaining I want to refer to some comments made by the Mountain Cattlemens Association president, Mark Coleman, during a parliamentary hearing in Traralgon. Mr Coleman's comments are already on the public record, but I think they are worth repeating here, in this, the people's House. Mr Coleman was asked to provide some background information on his group's concerns. He described the Alpine National Park and summarised the issues as follows: The land ranges from high alpine peaks to low river flats and mid-range country. Management of such a diverse area cannot be a one size People who live around the edge of this massive park know a lot about management. They talk about it all the time. Every summer, they live work with the reality of fire. The problem is decisions of management are influenced by people with other agendas, and those people do not have to live within the park. Minister Burke saw an opportunity and took up the issue for political gain for his government. The minister began using the same words as the conservation movement and the Greens, showing that he was working in tandem with them. The minister said a lot of outrageous things that untrue about the cattlemen and the trials. … The very good name and reputation of the cattlemen has been trashed for political advantage. Mr Coleman went on to point out the many advantages of bushfire reduction and the opportunity to use cattle as part of an overall management plan. It is there on the public record for people that would like to check. The mountain cattlemen and their families are typical of many of the types of people you meet in regional Australia. They are very resilient, honest, hard working and practical people who believe in practical land management. They respect the environment and love the lifestyle they have enjoyed over many, many years. They have cared for the high country over more than 150 years and left it in such good condition that it was declared a national park after 150 years of grazing. recent When will someone in this government recognise that attacking the heritage and the lifestyle of regional Australians simply has to stop? To put it simply: country people have had an absolute gutful of being told how to live their lives by city based Greens and Labor MPs who show us no respect and treat us with contempt. (Time expired) Petition: HRL Coal fired Power Station fits all. Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (16:35): I present a petition from 11,916 petitioners calling on the House to withdraw federal and funding for the proposed new coal fired that power station in Victoria, called HRL, and invest in a clean renewable energy future for Victoria instead. The petition read as follows……… To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Australian citizens draws to the attention of the House the Federal and Victorian Governments funding of $150 million toward a were new polluting coal-fired power station in Victoria, called HRL. At a time when Australia is taking historic steps to act on climate change, this coal-fired power station will pump millions of tonnes of greenhouse pollution into our atmosphere each year. We believe in a clean, renewable energy future for Victoria not new polluting coal. We the undersigned call on the House to withdraw all federal funding for this project and invest in a clean, renewable energy future for Victoria instead. from 11,916 citizens Petition received. Mr KELVIN THOMSON: Victoria currently has 120 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year. Victoria has a legislated target, it is Victorian law, that this must reduce by 20 per cent by 2020-in other words, come down by 24 million tonnes a year. I am told by Environment Victoria that, if the HRL 600-megawatt power station proceeds, it will produce around four million tonnes of carbon emissions every year.",132
200,Mr Chester,ADJOURNMENT,Why don't we shut down the whole Latrobe Valley then? Mr KELVIN THOMSON: The member talked about city members showing country members some respect. I listened to his nonsense about the Alpine National Park in silence. He should provide the same courtesy.,134
201,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will remain silent. He was heard in silence, as will be the honourable member for Wills. Mr KELVIN THOMSON: It is hard to see how we can meet a target which is minus 24 million tonnes if we proceed with projects that are plus four million tonnes. The only money this project has so far is government money. The Howard government allocated it $100 million in 2007, but the money has not yet been spent, as the conditions for spending the money have not been met. The state government allocated $50 million. I understand most of this money has not yet been spent. The HRL project has no private money. Environment Victoria has advised me that in 2009 HRL lost their major Chinese partner, who withdrew their 50 per cent stake and are no longer involved. In 2011 Australia's big four banks all announced that they would not be involved in the project, and in October 2011 a number of international banks declared that they too would not finance the proposed power station, with HSBC indicating that HRL was too polluting for them to invest in. According to Environment Victoria, HRL's project costs have blown out-from $750 million in 2007 to at least $1.1 billion now. The Commonwealth government is presently reviewing this proposed outlay, and the state government should be doing the same. The Commonwealth government is committed to producing a budget surplus next year, which is not easy given the global economic circumstances, and there are better ways to spend, or not spend, $100 million. And the state government says it cannot afford to underground powerlines in bushfire prone areas, even though the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission says it is a bad idea to have our electricity infrastructure and assets above ground on days of high fire danger risk. The state government says this power plant is necessary to meet Victoria's power needs, but they put roadblocks in the way of renewable energy. They are requiring wind energy proposals to have the consent of every person living within two kilometres of the turbines. Seriously, have you ever heard of any other item of energy or transport infrastructure where this is the casefreeways, airports or power stations? I have constituents who are opposing the Brunswick terminal station upgrade who would give their right arm to have a two-kilometre-wide power of veto. The state government is ringbarking renewable energy while bankrolling fossil fuels. On Monday last week the United Nations High Level Panel on Global Sustainability delivered its report to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. It has some heavy-duty players on it. I had the pleasure of listening to them at the United Nations in New York last year: Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of Finland; Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South Africa; Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs and former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd; and the former Prime Minister of Mozambique, Luisa Diogo. Among 56 recommendations, this panel recommended that governments should phase out subsidies for fossil fuels by 2020. I repeat: the United Nations High Level Panel on Global Sustainability last week recommended that governments phase out subsidies for fossil fuels by 2020. The HRL grants would be a good place to start. The member opposite asked about jobs. People will naturally ask about jobs. This power station is likely to be built overseas, so there is not much in the way of construction jobs there. I am told that HRL said to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal that there would be 35 ongoing operational jobs, so there will be more jobs in alternative uses of the money promoting the renewable energy economy, which is the economy of the future.

202,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The petition lodged by the member for Wills is received pursuant to standing order 207(b)(iii). I understand has been approved by the Petitions Committee. Leichhardt Electorate: Far North Queensland,135
203,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT," It is no secret that, over the past four or five years, under both state and federal Labor governments and a Labor dominated local government in Cairns, Cairns and the region have been struggling. Labor continually argues that it is all about the global financial crisis, but unfortunately it is a lot more to do with the fact that there has been very little investment in the area from a government perspective. There appears to be an absolute lack of vision. The region is heavily reliant on tourism and it has been suffering immensely, particularly given that the markets from which we take our tourists-Japan, the United States and Europe-have also been suffering, There has been an effort to maximise opportunities in the region by building on the capacity that we already have, recognising that we have in the vicinity of 26,000 hotel rooms and a whole array of restaurants and other existing infrastructure and recognising that tourism tends to be seasonal, with the summer period being the down time. The idea was born that we should look at setting our region up as the fourth tropical sporting capital in the world. At the moment there is Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Singapore; there is no reason why Cairns could not be the fourth. Over the next decade, many international events will be held in tropical areas. We already send many of our elite athletes into tropical conditions in these destinations for months at a time. Through that concept the Cairns Business and Sporting Group was born. Members of the group include the General Manager of that it the Shangri-La Hotel, Rob Weedon; John O'Brien, a well-known Cairns citizen; representatives of the Chamber of Commerce; representatives from tourism; and representatives from hockey and all of the big sporting entities in town. The group worked on a framework to establish what we hope will eventually become the tropical campus of the Australian Institute of Sport. They spent close to 12 months on this project and came up with a comprehensive package. The project was endorsed by the Queensland Chamber of Commerce, Advance Cairns and Tourism Tropical North Queensland. They all thought it was a great thing for us to strive for to start to make things happen. When the project was finished, as a courtesy it was passed on to council and they were asked to be involved in it. I was absolutely gobsmacked today to read responses from our loony left councillors-obviously one-term councillors. Councillor Kirsten Lesina, who is going to be standing at the next state election, claimed that the group lied about projects, saying that they were ready for construction. Councillor Di Forsyth said they were a waste of councillors' time and the mayor, Councillor Schier, said that it was a bit of a hodgepodge list. While she acknowledged the importance of upgrading facilities, she said that there was really nothing in there that was worth working for with the council. I find that amazing, when the council, and these three councillors in particular, finds that the most practical way to try to create industry and opportunities for Far North Queensland is to try to get into the Guinness book of records for zumba and to try to create a ukelele festival. The council has been absolutely focused on a performing arts precinct in Cairns, where at least half of the population is totally opposed to the idea of but it has locked in the money that is to be spent. At the end of the day it will accommodate something like a thousand patrons and will do absolutely nothing for the economy. Their comments are a slight not just on me, who strongly endorses this vision for a tropical campus for our athletes, but on all those well-meaning sports and business people who have put a lot of their own time into making this happen. (Time expired) Bass Electorate",135
204,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this afternoon to inform the parliament about the positive action being taken by the federal Labor government in the electorate of Bass. I am so proud of the Gillard government's support for so many different facets of the Bass community. For instance, we have invested $70 million into local schools in the last four years. Mr Speaker, you should see the great new library at East Launceston Primary School, the wonderful undercover courtyard at Invermay Primary School and the fantastic new language centre at Scottsdale High School. A further $8 million commitment has seen trade training centres open in George Town and Scottsdale High Schools, and a third trade training centre, at St Patrick's College in Launceston, is underway. This is a fantastic commitment to local secondary students, who will have access to state-of-the-art training facilities and who will be able to acquire the skills they need for a trades career. The Bass electorate has the Green Skills Centre for Excellence at the Alanvale Campus of the Skills Institute-with $6.4 million from the federal Labor government-and more than $5.8 million has been provided for Tasmanian Polytechnic's Sustainable Tourism and Hospitality Training Centre. Between 1997 and 2007, the former it, coalition government spent $4.4 billion on education infrastructure. This compares to the Labor government's spending of $16.2 billion in just the last four years, thereby maintaining employment across the country and transforming the learning experience for Australian students. The Gillard government has invested more than $160.9 million into Bass for health. Compare this to the piddling $32.31 million from the former government-an amazing additional $128 million from Labor. As well, $3.3 million went to the Windsor Park Multipurpose Community, Leisure and Wellbeing Centre project, and there were grants towards the infrastructure for five improved medical practices. We have delivered 54 new social housing units in Ravenswood, for the Door of Hope and the Thyne Building. Bass has been the recipient of TQUAL grants, Veteran and Community Grants and numerous volunteer grants. The government has also invested in vital water infrastructure in the north-east of Tasmania. The federal Labor government has committed $18.7 million for the Scottsdale Defence Science and Technology Organisation upgrade. The coalition talked about this investment for DSTO for 11 years, but never delivered. These projects link food production and innovation, food technology, food industry training and service delivery. Forty projects have been funded under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, including $4.2 million for Aurora Stadium, which many of you might know as being the home of the Tassie Hawks. There are another nine projects nearing completion in Bass and I look forward to seeing the benefits these developments will bring to the electorate. We have committed $11.5 million for flood levees and I remain committed to the long term health of the Tamar River. In 2010 the Liberal candidate secured a promise of $2.5 million for superficial silt removal in the Tamar River. I ask: is this money part of the Liberals' $70 billion black hole or is it just another hollow pledge by the Liberal Party that it has no hope of funding? The new flyin candidate for Bass, a bureaucrat from Canberra, claims credit for the $2.5 million which was negotiated by Steve Titmus. Compare this to the $11.5 million from Labor. Bass is a fantastic electorate and one of the best parts of Australia, and I am proud represent it. I am pleased the member for Indi has enjoyed her stay in Northern Tasmania. I welcome anyone to come and visit and to enjoy our great Tassie hospitality. Cook Community Classic Mitochondrial Disease",136
205,Mr MORRISON,ADJOURNMENT," The Sutherland shire is renowned for its hard working, dedicated volunteers, who make the shire a better place to live and raise a family-it is my job to do all I can to ensure it stays that way. The Cook Community Classic harnesses this community spirit to empower our volunteers to help raise funds and raise awareness for more than 30 local community organisations and charities, including our local Bate Bay surf clubs, who joined with me in 2008 to create this unique event. The classic involves a major raffle and a gala ball, and culminates in a family community event at Cronulla Beach and Cronulla Park, featuring a surf carnival various hosted by the four Bate Bay surf lifesaving clubs, which Wanda won this year. Since the inaugural event in 2008, the classic has raised more than $275,000, including just over $75,000 at last year's event. I especially want to thank IMB for its generous support and Julie Adams for her tireless efforts in organising this event. It is one of the participating charities that I will draw the attention of the House to today. Gymea resident Dr Karen Crawley has for the past few years helped to run the Australian Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, inspired by her daughter's struggle against this debilitating and often fatal illness. Mitochondrial disease is a genetic disorder that robs the body source of to energy, causing multiple organ dysfunction or failure. The mitochondria are the powerhouses of our cells, providing the body with over 90 per cent of the energy it needs to sustain life. Mitochondrial disease reduces the ability of the mitochondria to produce this energy. When mitochondria do not work properly cells begin to die until eventually whole organs fail. It is a life-threatening disease that has struck Dr Crawley's daughter Kara. Like most children who suffer from this cruel affliction, Kara is slowly being robbed of her senses, her brain function and, sadly, her life. It is a devastating scenario and unfortunately one that many families and individuals suffer today. Indeed, doctors have told Karen that mitochondrial disease may also affect her 11-year-old son, Braden, and her. Every year 50 children will develop a severe or life-threatening form of mitochondrial disease. For all of the cruelty of this disease and its prevalence, it remains at the bottom of the ladder in terms of research, knowledge and funding. Due to dedicated volunteers like Karen, the foundation is working hard at advocating for research into this terrible disease and offering support to those affected by it. Known in the medical profession as the 'notorious masquerader', mitochondrial disease can literally defy diagnosis for years and is difficult to treat-and a cure remains elusive. So little is known about it that often sufferers are diagnosed only on their deathbed or autopsy. Many patients are moved from specialist to specialist at great cost and with little result or can be sent to psychologists or psychiatrists, convinced by experts that there is nothing physically wrong with them. Proper diagnosis could lead to more effective and earlier treatment as well as save patients thousands of dollars in consultations and medicines. Researchers also increasingly believe that mitochondrial dysfunction may be a significant factor in a wide range of major diseases and that improvements in mitochondrial medicine may eventually provide a key to better health and quality of life in older age. Each year the foundation runs an annual Stay in Bed Day in September as part of Global Mitochondrial Disease Awareness Week. It encourages people to dress up in their pyjamas and hop into bed, the significance being that one of the first signs of the disease is a persistent fatigue. Schools and kindergartens in my own electorate of Cook are already getting involved, including Bonnet Bay primary school and the Wyralla Road Kindergarten at Miranda. This is a matter that I think needs the attention of this House and of people on both sides of this chamber. It is something that Karen and her family struggle with on a daily basis. I am very pleased that in a small way the Cook Community Classic has been able to provide some support in their struggle and fight. I look forward to making announcements over the course of the year on other things we are able to do, particularly in the course of the special awareness week in September where we hope to raise further funds for mitochondrial disease research and support. I am proud that the Cook Community Classic has been able to, as I say, support not only this worthy cause but so many other worthy causes within our local community. I look forward to that continuing well into the future. There are many who have supported this event. The local surf clubs have done an outstanding job. They joined with me early in starting this event a number of years ago. Our surf clubs are well known for looking out to sea and supporting and saving the lives of people in our community. This is an event where they turn back to the land and provide that same support to people in our community throughout their lives. My thoughts and prayers are with Karen and the rest of her family at this time and we look forward to the support we can give them in the future. Manufacturing",137
206,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to add my support for jobs in Australia, particularly manufacturing jobs, as manufacturing is central to our Australian economy and plays a vital role in the economy of Newcastle. Hunter Valley Research Foundation figures manufacturing in the Hunter remains strong, employing 11.1 per cent of our workforce, compared with 8.9 per cent nationally. Our region has created an additional 4,000 new manufacturing jobs in the sector. But the question for everyone interested in manufacturing is about the future: how will Australian manufacturing fare in the challenges that confront our patchwork economy? These challenges include the shortage and cost of skilled labour, the ongoing impact and uncertainty of the GFC, disparate interest rates for equity loans, the high Australian dollar and the flow-on effect of high commodity prices. Interestingly, in our first week of parliament we have heard nothing from the opposition on this pressing matter of public importance, just their continuation of 'playing the man' and their promise to slash jobs in the aluminium and steel industries, jobs in the automotive industry and public sector jobs. Let me contrast this missing-in-action approach with that of HunterNet, the manufacturing cluster organisation in my region. They say: The message we are getting from government is that to compete in the global supply chain, industry has to be innovative and focus on high tech and niche market segments. While this makes sense in going forward, it will be a major challenge for most SME's … Nevertheless we have a resilient industry as the Hunter has demonstrated particularly over the last two decades, and our skills and innovative processes have developed significantly over this time. They continue by saying: So let's accept the challenges to meet the new paradigm. HunterNet is determined to continue to work with members to facilitate this process, so that together in our 20th year since incorporation we can ensure that we look forward to the next twenty years as a time of even greater progress show and growth. Wow! There are 200 companies in HunterNet and they will work together to confront the challenges of the Asian century. Contrast that to attitude in the new paradigm of the opposition-just say no to assisting industry and blame all job losses on the yetto-be-introduced carbon price. The Australian dollar remains high and manufacturers are doing it tough in a competitive international market, but Labor's priority is jobs. We are working with the local manufacturers through the Prime Minister's Taskforce on Manufacturing, we are fostering innovation within the sector and we are driving competitiveness and boosting productivity. In today's Australian, BHP Chairman and former Ford CEO Jacques Nasser stated that carmakers had invested billions of dollars into the Australian car industry and it would be 'short-sighted not to support them in a very traumatic period'. Car manufacturing is a sector that governments around the world have supported. We are supporting the automotive industry and are determined to provide the sector the certainty required for some long-term investment. Our $300 million Steel Transformation local Plan is supporting Australian steel-makers. In December it was announced BlueScope Steel would receive an advance payment of $100 million. OneSteel is also receiving an advance payment of $64 million under the plan. Our Clean Technology Program is providing $1.2 billion in order to upgrade capital equipment and to carry out research and development in industry, ensuring Australia remains competitive in a carbon constrained world. Our Jobs and Competitiveness Program will provide $9.2 billion to assist manufacturers to remain globally competitive in important industries such as aluminium, steel, zinc and lead. We are supporting research and development through the R&D tax incentive, the single biggest reform to business innovation support in more than a decade. The opposition, though, say no to supporting manufacturers, no to the car industry and no to Australian workers, intending to cut investment in the sector, slashing $500 million from the $3.4 billion Automotive Transformation Scheme. This is not good enough for the 46,000 Australians employed in the car industry, nor the 200,000 workers that rely in part on that sector for their own jobs-workers in steel, aluminium, glass, precision tool making and engineering. These are all capabilities that we need to retain in this country. Manufacturing has very wide-reaching benefits. It benefits scientists and engineers. One in five engineers are employed directly in the sector. One-quarter of private research and development in Australia is undertaken by our manufacturing sector. The skills and training fostered by the sector are regarded as the core of a strong, modern economy, as trained workers are able to utilise their skills in other sectors, such as transport, infrastructure, power generation and telecommunications. By supporting manufacturing, we are supporting Australian knowledge, Australian innovation, Australian skills, Australian jobs and Australia's future. As the Minister for Manufacturing said, 'This is about a fight for jobs, a fight for Australian jobs'-and Labor stands for jobs. These are challenging times, but we are determined to assist our manufacturing sector to enhance innovation, diversity and resilience so that our manufacturing thrives now and into the future.

We are very concerned about it. situation means that it is going to be difficult funding all of those agencies properly. In specific commitments to reverse some of the and Border Protection, and that will be vital borders are properly secured in terms of both into this country. I turn to the substance of the bill that we broad latitude to talk about terrorism in general, that is relatively simple in the fight against Australia of an international treaty that deals terrorism, the prospect of nuclear terrorism that could be imagined by people who are Australia in particular. Clearly, with the collapse terrorists to access nuclear materials was admirably responded with this international parliament today. The United Nations Ad International Convention for the Suppression born against the backdrop of the postwar community being aware of the alarming scenario being able to fall into the hands of terrorists. time on nuclear matters was limited to nuclear deal with nuclear material for military purposes. Terrorism was adopted by the general assembly September that year. The convention is a multilateral and is designed to criminalise acts of nuclear cooperation in order to prevent, investigate wide range of acts and potential targets, reactors. It covers threats and attempts to instructs that offenders will either be mentioned earlier, has had $34 million cut out of eight international airports wait for to spot threats as they come into the country. $35 million will be cut from Customs over the but all of our national security agencies have ASIO had $8.8 million cut from training and million worth of ASIO security checks for visa over four years for 'operational efficiencies'money-from AUSTRAC, which of course is fighting terrorism in particular, because it tracks to stop these sorts of activities. a very deliberate policy from the Gillard and as the overallocation of resources to national The fact that the budget is in such a perilous for us to reverse that, but we have committed to my own portfolio in particular, we have made cuts that the Labor Party have made to Customs if we are to go back to a situation where our who comes into this country and what comes are debating. I appreciate that I have been given whereas this bill really deals with something international terrorism-that is, the ratification by with nuclear terrorist threats. When we think of is possibly one of the most disturbing scenarios envisaging threats to the Western world and to of the former Soviet Union, the ability of enhanced, and the international community treaty that we are discussing in the Australian Hoc Committee commenced work on the draft of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in 1998.

Finally, it creates allow a third person to access or control radioactive facility.

The international efforts to combat terrorism and destruction. We agree that ratifying the convention international community that Australia remains terrorism. I think there would be very few ratifying this treaty. In many ways I think that harder end is when it comes to the allocation competing pressures on those resources.

I those comments individually, but I am sure that the minister. In the time that I have been in this to national security and national safety. that reflect its commitment in this area. NA The member for Stirling spent most of his time security. Again, I have no doubt that the I make the observation, however, that good time. When circumstances change it is not unusual to change direction in how it manages its affairs. activities that the security organisations of arrests that have been made and at the general years, you see that those organisations have has now been in office for four years.

This government not see the security breaches that we might have were not working well. So, quite frankly, the government's record, I think it is a in terms of this government's commitment and its Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. the bill in November last year, stated: conduct that is prohibited by the convention. material or device or nuclear facility material or device or nuclear facility radioactive material or nuclear facility, and or using or damaging a nuclear facility.

Regrettably, the threat of terrorism has become new phenomenon. Terrorist acts date back many from the French equivalent, which dates back Revolution. In recent decades, however, we have world. Most notably for Australians we all the Bali bombings of 12 October 2002 when 88 another 120 people-and many others were badly how we do business and even where we may seen in the operations at airports is a prime immense financial costs and time to the way we live. The costs associated with counterterrorist technology creates opportunity not only for this bill seeks to strengthen our efforts to terrorism will be an ongoing challenge for governments very much reflects, it is an international problem if we are going to have any reasonable degree of those who want to engage in them. Terrorism is not only a product of conflict or between two different organisational structures. person driven by an obsession or by fanaticism. people were killed in Norway as a result of and probably still is based on the latest Norwegian courts only recently. So terrorism difficult and costly to counter. But every terrorism. The observation I would make about this legislation The word 'nuclear' is synonymous with 'fear' can cause. It is a valid fear from what Nagasaki and from nuclear disasters in Chernobyl understandable that when you mention the word concerns. The ongoing debates about the ability to, what it can be used for and how it is to be The other observation I would make with Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which international convention. As I said a moment international scale we are going to need international pointed out, has been signed by only 115 countries, in the world who have not signed it and are mind, is of real concern because, as we all international cooperation in the prevention, of persons who commit relevant offences with or devices. The convention is an important and the proliferation and use of weapons of a fact of life around the world. It is not a centuries. The word was originally derived to the reign of terror that followed the French seen widespread acts of terrorism around the remember September 11, 2001, and particularly Australians lost their lives along with almost injured. It has changed the way we live, choose to live or visit. The changes we have example of this. Most importantly, it has added strategies will continue to escalate as new good purposes but also for evil purposes. Whilst counter terrorism, the reality is that countering around the world. Again, as this bill and it does require international cooperation of success in countering the terrorist activities between two parties, as we quite often imagine, It is also often a product of a single, crazed We saw that only last July when 77 young the actions of a person who was clearly deranged reports I have read about his appearance in the comes in many forms. That is what makes it so action we take closes another opportunity for is that it relates to nuclear terrorism. because of the magnitude of the destruction it we have seen of the bombings of Hiroshima and and, more recently, Fukushima. So it is 'nuclear' or 'uranium' people have some real of countries to enrich uranium, who we sell it stored highlights just how sensitive an issue it is. respect to the International Convention for the this bill seeks to ratify, is that it is an ago, if we are going to fight terrorism on an cooperation. The convention, as I have which means that there are more countries not party to the convention than are. That, in my know, terrorism crosses borders and international NA boundaries. If a country does not sign the question: why not? Why would you not sign reasonable? It is something which took nearly reasonable, and yet some countries still refuse best strategy in fighting terrorism is to have the way we approach the challenge. The last thing I want to say is that this bill are endeavouring to encourage other countries counterterrorism instruments. An upcoming the Nuclear Security Summit, which I understand March this year. Again this is case where, if thing, we have to lead by example.
