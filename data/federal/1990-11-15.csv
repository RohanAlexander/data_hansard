The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth: That the Government's Asset Test on Family Allowances and reduction of eligibility for Austudy as a result of the tighter Assets Test will further contribute to the hardship and disadvantages facing the rural community compared to their urban counterparts. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House should immediately seek that special consideration be given to retaining the original criteria for assessing eligibility for Family Allowance and Assets Test levels in relation to Austudy. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray - fails to recognise by Mr Andrew (from 1,101 citizens) and Mr Downer (fromÂ· 63 citizens) - could, Assets Test: Austudy and Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth: That the Government's Asset Test on Family Allowances and reduction of eligibility for Austudy as a result of the tighter Assets Test will further contribute to the hardship and disadvantages facing the rural community compared to their urban counterparts. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House should immediately seek that special consideration be given to retaining the original criteria for assessing eligibility for Family Allowtralia ance, Assistance for Isolated Children and Assets Test levels in relation to Austudy. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Andrew (from 109 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament. We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, draw to the attention of the House that: There is widespread concern and strong objection to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Guidance and responsibility of our children belong to parents not Government. Your petitioners therefore request the House call upon the Government to refrain from ratifyAllowances ing this Convention. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Beale (from 173 citizens) and Mr Reid (from 248 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows: The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: - gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association; - gives only qualified rights to parents in Article 5; the prior right of parents to determine the education of their children; if ratified by Australia, result in govern. ment-assisted rebellion against parents who want to set limits for their children in their children's best interests. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: - request the Federal Government not to ratify this potentially damaging Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Downer (from 85 citizens) and Mrs Gallus (from 170 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament, this petition of certain citizens of Ausinvites to the attention of the House that: a. there is widespread concern and strong objection to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; and b. guidance and responsibility of our children belongs to us, the parents, NOT the government. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives' in Parliament assembled require the Government to refrain from ratifying this convention. And your petitioners, as is duty bound, will every pray. by Mr Halverson (from 146 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the United Nations Convention on the 'Rights of the Child'. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House dismiss totally and object in no uncertain terms to the so called 'Rights of the Child Bill' being introduced into the legislation and Parliament of Australia. by Mr Newell (from 73 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior therapeutic goods the Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homoeopaths and Herbalists are badly drafted and the prohibition on advertising will make it impossible for Australians to use natural medicines. The Regulations therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine. Your petitioners pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Inquiry into the registration of natural medicines. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will forever pray. by Ms MCHugh (from 20 citizens) and Mr MACKellar (from 17 citizens). Multifunction Polis To the Honourable, the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the House of Representatives urge the Government to suspend all further considerations regarding the proposed Multi Function Polis forthwith pending: 1. Full public disclosure of the nature and details of the proposal. 2. The Australian people have the opportunity to fully and exhaustively debate the concept. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Anderson (from 45 citizens). Interest Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain concerned citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House of Representatives to what we see as the present disastrous high interest rates economic policy aimed at reducing balance of trade problems. We see high interest rates causing high unemployment, small business bankruptcies, and people losing their homes or rural properties. We seek a less harmful method of reducing foreign imports such as import quotas and tariffs or sales taxes on ALL imports. Also that local production be assisted by lower Government charges and taxes with subsidies granted where to needed, especially where new production is being established. Your petitioners therefore pray that Honourable Members do all in their power to correct the and devices, present disastrous situation. by Mr Andrew (from 22 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles; 2. that the Convention's philosophy of parenti child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children; 3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation; 4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent; 5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers; 6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of dren from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws. Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for: (a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss'and examine in detail the 54 Articles; (b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beale (from 45 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the HO\1se the matter of United Nations Covenants and the way in which they may impact on our existing common law system, method of Government and independent judiciary. Your petitioners request the House to legislate or provide for: 1. A 12 month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articl-s of the Convention. 2. A Referendum to follow the 12 month moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.  Public Housing in South Australia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the state of South Australia supporting the Public Tenants Association draws to the attention of the House the impending reduction of monies available for public housing in South Australia and your petitioners pray that the House do act t- prevent the corresponding reduction in the availability of public housing and increase in the rents charged for it. by Dr Catley (from 169 citizens). Serbia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of chilthe House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the following points concerning the area in Serbia known as Kosovo. (i) We draw attention to the House that a great injustice has been done to the Serbian people by the media of Western democracies. (ii) We also draw attention to the House that, with very few exceptions, Serbians are subject to intimidation, harassment, and violence by extremists among Albanians in Kosovo. (iii) Such treatment of Serbs by Albanian extremists has caused, recently, another mass exodus of Serbs from the heart of their native land. (iv) This is happening in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a member of the United Nations and signatory of the Helsinki Agreement. (v) The Kosovo crisis is worsening from day to day and is so serious that it threatens the very existence of all Yugoslav nations. , (vi) That dangerous situation in Kosovo must be resolved immediately or a blood-bath similar to the cine in Lebanon will occur which will easily destabilise all Europe with strong repercussions throughout the middle east. (vii) Particular attention should be paid to the danger to world peace caused by the Albanian dream of a 'Great Albania' on sacred ancestral Serbian land. (viii) Until the Serbian people achieve restoration of Serbia's rights over all its territory, liberated in 1918 and recognised by the league of nations in Geneva peace talks, they will not be pacified regardless of temporary improvements of dubious political value. (ix) We also draw the attention of the House to the fact that Serbian, much condemned 'nationalism', is not the 'cause but one of the consequences of Yugoslavia's national problems and grievances long repressed by an authoritarian regime. (x) Therefore, for the sake of world peace, we Australian Serbs ask use its diplomatic influence to help bring peace and restore Serbian national and human rights to that part of the world. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House records the accurate facts of the Kosovo situation and supports the peaceful settlement and restoration of Serbian National and human rights to the Kosovo area. by Mrs Crosio (from 8 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. - That the right to life of all humans is the most funoamentaland essential of all human rights. - That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life. - That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect. - That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million. - That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States artdby all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Dobie (from 21 citizens). X and NVE Material To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of citizens of Australia points that the community deplores the persistent refusal to ban pornography in X and NVE Videos, Films and Publications. and deplores the resulting escalation of crime and sexual crime in the Australian community. Because Parliament has a direct and heavy obligation to ensure the safety of women and child victims, your petitioners therefore request that the House should the House: - to ban the importation, and availability of pornography in Videos, Films and Publications, - to prevent black-market trading by banning the possession of X and NVE material, - vote against any recommendation to extend Video and Theatre Film Classifications and Guidelines into Television Standards, - ensure that Pay Television does not exceed the program limits of television standards, - control all censorship criteria and guidelines by substantive legislation, - give earnest consideration to these matters, in order that no Attorney-General shall ever again have the power to change our social and home environment for generations to come, without thorough and full debate in both Houses of Parliament. by Mr Dobie (from 11 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Th.erapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The Clauses so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination. Your petitioners, therefore, pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Inquiry into the' questions of registration of the natural healing professions and the supervision and regulation of natural therapeutic goods. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will forever pray. by Mr Downer (from 17 citizens). Service Pension out To the Honourable Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned residents of Australia respectfully showeth: That after reading ""VETS AFFAIRS"" Bulletin June 1989, we find service pensions are being paid to many thousands of Veterans of British and overseas origin, as Australil!n citizens we we have been discriminated against, having volunteered to serve wherever we were sent. We the undersigned electors of Australia, do humbly pray that: 1. Consideration be given to the payment of a pension or entitlement for our service. 2. We receive treatment similar to war widows in respect of medical, hospital benefits etc. by Mr Johns (from 1,507 citizens). Otway Forest, Victoria To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows that the Otway Rainforests are being exploited inappropriately. We pray that the export woodchip licence supplied for Midway Wood Products be rescinded immediately and the Otway Rainforests be managed in the best interests of the people of Australia. by Mrs Kelly (from 22 citizens). Medicare: Abortions The Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House of Representatives that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare. Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion. Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the House will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule. by Ms MCHugh (from 80 citizens). Treaty of Trianon To the Right Honourable the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled The petition of Marianna Kadar. Ever since the Treaty of Trianon on June 4, 1920 Romania as a co-signatory to the treaty has deliberately disregarded serious obligations to human rights. In exchange for the annexation of Hungary's Transylvanian highlands, Rumania undertook to grant minority rights to the Hungarian communities within these annexations. It feel did not do this and continues to oppress these minority groups. Therefore your petitioners humbly pray, that your Honourable House should promote: On the seventieth anniversary of the Treaty of Trianon, Australia, as a co-signatory call for the re-negotiation of this 'treaty' in response to its wilful neglect by the Romanian regime. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Ms MCHugh (from 16 citizens). Chlorofluorocarbons and Halons Petition to the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain students, citizens of Australia and stewards of the earth draws to the attention of this House that we are concerned about Ozone Depletion. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Prime Minister and his Government to: - change our legislation in the Autumn Session of Parliament this year to enact a total phaseout of consumption of CFCs and halons by 1994 - reduce our CFC export quotas to 1986 levels immediately and then phase-out exports by 20% per annum, with a complete phaseout of production and export of CFCs and halons by 1995 - support the above phase-out schedules globally at the Montreal Protocol Review in April 1990. by Mr Mack (from 13,420 citizens). Prescriptions for Pensioners To the Honourable Members in the House of Representatives assembled. Your humble petitioners respectfully showeth that to introduce a charge for pensioners prescriptions would cause great hardship in particular to those people on more than one medication and also to those with chronic illnesses. We strongly urge that no charge on pensioners prescriptions be introduced. And in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Mack (from 495 citizens). Shark Bay Region of Western Australia To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully points out - that the Shark Bay Region in the north-west of Western Australia is of international importance due to its unique environment - the lack of environmental protection of the Shark Bay Region; - the region is being degraded by current land use practices. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Hou-e of Representatives in Parliament assembled will call on the Government to: - declare the Shark Bay National Park, incorporating Dirk Hartog Island, the Peron Peninsula and the associated marine environment, now; - nominate the Shark Bay Region for World Heritage listing, in view of its unique, and internationally significant, environment. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Mack (from 11 citizens). Kakadu National Park: Coronation Hill To the honourable the Speaker and. members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the current status of Coronation Hill. Your petitioners request that the House legislate so that Coronation Hill be made part of Kakadu National Park to ensure that it is protected from mining for all time. by Mr MACKellar (from 11 citizens). ABC Television: Educational Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned teachers, parents and residents in the State of Queensland respectfully showeth: The ABC TV daytime educational programs are an essential and well used resource for schools and parents. Their imminent axing is therefore a severe loss to the children of Australia. Your petitioners request that your Honourable House ensures that the ABC is provided with adequate funding to enable these programs to continue. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Moore (from 31 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of Australia in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that we protest at the indecent haste with which Parliament is said to be proceeding to ratify the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, thereby acceding to the danger of transferring family authority from parents to the agencies of the State, as happened in Hitler's Germany. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House ensure that the family retain its position as the basic unit of society as ordained by God, remove all hindrance to traditional parental authority over children and ensure that traditional family values are maintained in our society. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Nehl (from 147 citizens). Fraser Island To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House to the logging on Fraser Island in the Great Sandy Region. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: Place an immediate moratorium on logging on Fraser Island in the Great Sandy Region for the duration of the Fitzgerald Inquiry and everafter. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray by Mr Newell (from 136 citizens). Family Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House the Government's recent decision to introduce an assets test restricting Family Allowance Payments and points out that this will disadvantage many low income rural families by denying them assistance because of their assets, including the family farm, exceeding $300,000 in value. Your petitioners therefore request the House to support rural families by opposing the Government's decision.  Assets Test: Family Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of the Division of Maranoa points out to the House that the 1990/91 Federal Budget stipulates that from January next year Family Allowance payments will be subject to an assets test. Family Allowance will be withdrawn if net assets, excluding the family home and debt exceed $300,000. Furthermore, the parental assets test threshold for Fami1y Allowance Supplement, Austudy and Assistance for Isolated Children has been severely slashed in the 1990/91 Federal Budget. Considering the economic crisis facing rural communities in Australia, asset tests of such a nature are not viable because the assets are incapable of generating enough income to sustain families and send children away for schooling. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to abolish the assets test for Family Allowance and Assistance for Isolated Children and to reconsider the decision to reduce the assets test for Austudy, and Family Allowance Supplement. by Mr Bruce Scott (from 403 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members the House of Representatives assembled in ParCommittee. liament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the proposed ratification of the United Nations vention on the rights of the Child gives tiqn a unique opportunity to: - declare our belief that all children have right to be protected from abuse and exploitation, and to enjoy the opportunity for full velopment of the human personality, - affirm the fundamental importance of theÂ· family in our society, - recognise the unique rights and responsibilities of the parent/child relationship. Your petitioners therefore pray that express the view, on behalf of the citizens who exportation interests it represents, that the ratification of the Convention be in a form which emphasises rights and principles, and which pays the highest regard to the importance of the family Australian society and to the rights and responsibilities of parents. by Mrs Sullivan (from 35 citizens). Referendum To the Honourable the Speaker and members Of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: TlJe petition of certain concerned citizens Australia draws the attention of the House Representatives to what we see as misuse of referendum provision in our Australian constituindulged tion. We protest that the Federal Government allows its own referendum proposals to be the people. We believe in a true democracy an opposition party or any reasonably large group of electors should also be allowed to submit endum questions whenever a Federal election referendum is to be held. Your petitioners therefore pray that Honourable members do all in their power to establish this democratic principle. by Mr Wilson (from 10 citizens). Petitions received. NA NA NA",9
3,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the Committee entitled Risky Business-The 37,000 kilometre challenge together with theÂ· minutes of of proceedings and evidence received by the Ordered that the report be printed.",15
4,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"The report I have Contabled today is the first report of the our naCommittee's review on aspects of the Australian Customs Service. The aspects the dealt with in this report are Coastwatch, dedrug interceptions, including the drug detector dog unit and the Auditor-General's 1989-90 report on passenger and crew processing. These elements were grouped together for the first report because they were all concerned with operations designed to protect the Australian commuthe House nity from unlawful importation and of prohibited and restricted these goods, particularly illegal drugs. In its investigation of these operations unit in the Committee visited many locations around Australia. In each location we were impressed by the commitment of the men and women of the Customs Service to the protection of the Australian community. The task facing Customs is enormous. As the title of the report indicates, the challenge for Customs is to deal adeof quately with all attempted breaches of the of barrier around the 37,000 kilometres of the Australia's coastline.' The risky business in by those involved in illegal importations is characterised by everonly changing importation methods. Customs put to mu-t keep abreast of this increasing sophistication in attempts to breach the barreferrier and be aware that its success in or combating the threats in one area may well result in increased attempts to breach the barrier elsewhere. Of necessity, Customs' operational approach must be flexible, resourceful and sophisticated. In response, Customs has developed management technique based on risk assessment. The Committee considers it is an appropriate technique for an organisation which must always balance its dual responsibilities of ensuring that the provisions of the Customs Act are upheld while simultaneously facilitating the movement of law abiding citizens and the free flow of trade. In order to successfully juggle its faciliported tation and control goals Customs assesses the dsks associated with particular passenger movements or transactions. Facilitation is maximised for those considered to be of low risk while those deemed to be high risk are subjected to much closer scrutiny. On the whole the Committee endorses this approach undertaken by Customs but sees a need for enhanced performance information to enable ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of its strategies. A relevant example is provided by the operation of the contraband enforcement teams (CETs). These teams operate principally in cargo areas and are charged with the task of targeting high risk areas and cargoes for follow up surveillance and intelligence gathering. The Committee saw CET teams in operation in a variety of areas-unloading and examining contents of a container at Port Botany, checking a liquor shipment with the help of dogs at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, searching a ship in Brisbane, examining imported furniture in Melbourne and, at Port Kembla, preparing for a mission covering ports along the southern coastline of New South Wales. Apart from these individual tasks, the teams are also involved in nationally coordinated operations directed at combating large scale drug importations. The dedication and enthusiasm of the team members was evident in all locations and the teams have had some creditworthy results. However, the Committee is aware that the commitment in terms of staff, time and related resources to these national operations is considerable and as yet the operations have not resulted in a major drug haul. While acknowledging a that the CET concept is at present in the early stages of implementation, the Committee considers that Customs must keep it under close scrutiny to ensure that the resource commitment is justified in terms of results. In reviewing the drug interception role of Customs, the Committee noted the lack of available information on the quantity of illicit drugs in Australia, whether imor locally produced. Such a database is essential to the measurement of effectiveness of Customs' and other law enforcement agencies' operations in the overall strategy against drug abuse in this country. The Committee recommends therefore the establishment of a committee chaired by Customs and. including representatives of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), National Crime Authority, State police forces and health authorities to undertake an accelerated study into the development of a database. The risk assessment approach is alsoÂ· in evidence in passenger processing operations at airports, the subject of the Auditor-General's report which was the catalyst for this inquiry. Among the findings of that report was the existence of weaknesses in general airport security at Sydney International Airport. The Committee concluded that the Auditor-General's criticisms of airport security would have been better directed to the Department of Transport and Communications, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) than to Customs, as it is these bodies which carry major responsibility for aviation security matters. While many of the specific concerns raised in the audit report had been addressed by these bodies and Customs by the time of the Committee's review, the question of security passes for staff at Sydney Airport remains to be satisfactorily resolved. The number of pass-issuing authorities has already been reduced from 35 to five but the Committee believes that a single issuing authority is desirable. It is recommended that the Department of Transport and Communications expedite steps to secure that outcome. In terms of security, the Committee has also recommended that effective arrangements be made by the Department of Transport and Communications for control of access and egress from the airport and that the Federal Airports Corporation expedite the examination of measures to control perimeter surveillance and security. Those who read last weekend's papers will be aware that this latter recommendation is in line with the observation of Brigadier Mackenzie-Orr, who, it was reported, conducted a study for the F AC into the security, of Sydney Airport. In a report dated June 1990 Brigadier Mackenzie-Orr apparently concluded that Australian airports could become the target for terrorism. I was disturbed to learn of the existence of Brigadier Mackenzie-Orr's study not from the F AC in the course of the Committee's inquiry but last. Friday from a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery. As indicated in the weekend press reports, I am deeply concerned that this information was not conveyed to the Committee in its discussions on airport security and I intend to pursue the matter with the FAC. The juggling of the dual responsibilities of facilitation and control is particularly evident in the processing of passengers at international airports. One of the factors influencing the facilitation of passengers is the number of staff available to deal with the passengers arriving or departing at a given time. Any proposed increase in services or facilities must be matched by a corresponding increase in resource levels to maintain existing standards. The Committee noted with concern therefore proposals to establish new international terminals at both Proserpine and Hamilton Island. Bearing in mind the proximity of these locations, the Committee believes that such a duplication of services is unwarranted. It has recommended that any future decision to approve the establishment of new international facilities must take into account accessibility and ' adequacy of existing facilities, the cost to public purse and the effect on Customs resource deployment. The other major operational area reviewed in this report is the Coastwatch subprogram. During inspections of Coastwatch operations in Darwin and Broome, Committee members took the opportunity to speak informally with representatives of the Coastwatch clients such as fisheries, quarantine services and national parks and wildlife. The feedback received echoed the favourable reports of Coastwatch contained in submissions to the inquiry. Clients reported that, following Customs' assumption in 1988 of re'spotisibility for coastal surveillance, cooperation and information flow back had improved and the coordination of coastal surveillance provided by Coastwatch was functioning well. While satisfaction among major clients was at a high level, some submissions indicated that there is a degree of ignorance in the wider community of the changes that have taken place in Coastwatch administration since it came under Customs control. New operational arrangements designed to overcome previous shortcomings-such as predictability of flights and lack of offshore flying capacity-are recognised in northern areas, but appear to be less well known in the south. This difference in awareness may be attributable to some degree to the extensive public awareness campaign called 'Watch Out for Australia' mounted in the north to encourage public participation in reporting unusual or suspicious land, sea or air activities. The Committee has thus recommended that Coast watch give attention to measuring southern agencies' confidence that Coast watch can provide the surveillance required for their purposes. In conjunction with such a survey, it would be advantageous to gather information about possible future requirements arising from emerging high risk areas. The success of the 'Watch Out for Australia' campaign in the north has prompted the Committee to suggest that a similar 'Port Watch' campaign could be mounted the to enlist marine, commercial and public support in the maintenance of port security. Such a program would have particular relevance to areas where a port security committee does not presently operate. The second report of this inquiry, which the Committee expects to table early in the autumn sittings, will deal with the program management structure of the Customs Service and the matters relevant to the import""export control program. I would like to thank my fellow subcommittee members-the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew); the honourable member for St George (Mr Dubois); the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott); and the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear). This part of the Customs inquiry has involved the Committee in arduous travel to far flung parts of Australia, and I thank members for making time available to undertake the inspections. I also thank the secretary to the subcommittee, Ms Geraldine Skinner. This is Geraldine's first inquiry in the Parliament, and she has provided valuable support to the subcommittee. Thanks also go to Mr Darcy Abbey, who has assisted with the organisation of inspections and provided advice and expertise to the subcommittee. I also thank Amanda Garlick, Laura Gillies and the secretary, David Elder, for their assistance to the inquiry. It makes a relevant contribution to this particular matter, and I commend the report to the House.",15
5,Mr ANDREW,ADMINISTRATION,"1 welcome the opportunity to speak to the report introduced to the House by the honourable member for Macarthur, Mr Martin, and I thank him for his participation in the chairing of the Committee's inquiry. The report, as the honourable member for Macarthur has outlined, is a report called Risky business-the 37 000 kilometre challenge. It is a report into the duties, tasks and performance of the Australian Customs Service. The Australian Customs Service has a proud history. In fact, I am told it is 190 years ago that the first Customs excise and duties were collected in Australia. They were collected by naval officers who were charged to pick up an excise on wine, beer and spirits imported into Australia. In 1901, the Customs Service. achieved a status of its own when it became the National Customs Service under the Department of Tnlde, and in 1985 it became the Australian Customs Service as we know it today, under the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. We should not underestimate the importance of the Customs Service to Australia and to the Australian economy. In fact in the last financial year, Customs coll-cted on behalf of all Australians $12.43 billion in revenue-which was 14 per cent of the total government revenue. While Australian Customs history may be only 190 years old, the origin of Customs excise itself dates back to the Roman Empire when, in fact, import and export duties were a well cultivated technique that the Romans had produced in 'order to make their economy more stable, and the payment of duties became a custom which ensured that one was offered some sort of royal protection-hence the term 'Customs'. I want to pay a tribute to the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Macarthur, Mr Martin. This Committee has been a pleasure to serve on, and this has been a fascinating and interesting inquiry. If I said that the inquiry had been a particularly cheerful one, that may seem a little flippant; but I would have to acknowledge that Mr Martin has gone out of his way to ensure that the needs and cares of anyone of the individ. ual members of the Committee have been met, and that their opinions had been heeded in a cheerful and receptive way. I am grateful to him for that. I would also want to echo the sentiments that he has expressed in terms of those from the Committee's secretariat. I acknowledge that we have in the gallery today Mr Elder, Ms Skinner and Mr Abbey, part of the secretariat, and the other secretariat members who have helped make this inquiry as probing as it has been and yet as pleasurable as it has been. . There is a perennial bind for anyone involved in the Customs Service. It is the bind of being damned if you do stop goods coming into Australia and damned if you do not. The question the Parliament has to ask itself and the question that the taxpayers expect us to pose on their behalf is: To what degree does the Customs Service protect Australia from illicit goods and contraband coming into Australia? I thought that, in many ways, the role of the Australian Customs Service was-and it may not thank me for this-if not personified, then at least characterised, by the drug dog detector unit. The . real question is: What do we want fo! a Customs Service? Do we want a rottweller or a poodle? Do we want, effective-y, a Customs Service that guards Austraha or do we want a Customs Service that is nothing more than a symbol-inclined to bark if it sees something so that people who wander in and out of Australia are at least warned but not fearful of what is going to happen? We cannot ask the Customs Service to establish what will be the norm for moral behaviour in Australia. We can only ask it to implement what we as a so-iety determine will be the norms. WhIle I am speaking about the drug dog detector u-it, I should point out that I was very 111""!pressed with the way in which that umt functioned. I was impressed that last year it effectively achieved 991 seiz-res. I was particularly impressed, as I beheve every member of the Committee was, with the way in which we saw that unit. functioning because it allowed the natlOn to acces; areas that would otherwise. be very difficult, if not impossible, for individuals to have surveillance over. We watched the drug dog detector unit working in confined spaces in shil?s. We watched the drug dog detector umt running over the material that was coming on and going off vessels and aeroplanes. We. were given an indication of the remarkable capacity of those dogs to pick up contraband, particularly drugs, just by scent, even drugs that had been sm-ggled inside, if you please, a bottle of W111e. I thought the drug dog detector, unit showed a remarkable Gapacity to detect cont-aÂ­ band and, of course, its performance 111dicates that that is exactly right. If I were to take the other extreme of this inquiry, I would have to move from the drug dog detector unit working in confined spaces to the area of Coastwat?h outlined by the Chairman of the CommIttee. This concerns not the confined spaces of a ship's cabin, but the vast area of - he outback, which has given lead to the btle of the report Risky business-The 37,000 Kilometre Challenge. Along with the Chairman, I have to agree that I was. reassured by what I saw Coastwatch d0111g. I have long been one of those Australians who said 'Why don't we do more to protect northern Australia?'. The fact is that this is such an enormous coastline that it would not matter how frequently we flew over it' it would be very difficult to patrol it as A-stralians would want it patrolled. The real secret of success in the Co astwatch organisation has been that it has implemented much of the recommendations of the Hudson report-a report on the administration and management of civil coastline surveillance in northern Australia. Coastwatch has been effectively determining what one would say is obvious, that is, flights must be random. Cooperation between Coastwatch and other arms of the Australian Government in the north and with the people themselves is most important. Coastwatch is in constant liaison with the Royal Australian Navy, for example, to en.sure that it can exercise appropriate surveIllance. The Navy or the Australian Customs Service can then fulfil the role that we expect them to fulfil as policemen. Even more significant is the role t-at Coastwatch has cultivated through Its program which it has called '-atch Out for Australia'. As a result of thIS progra-, it has managed to get real cOI?mu-Ity awareness in the north of Austraha. WI-hÂ­ out that we would have no real exerCIse in Custo'ms at all. This community awareness, I thought, was best illus-rated ?- an incident involving the Bardl Abong111al community. They were the people who indicated to Coastwatch that they had se-n suspicious activity, which resulted 111 Coastwatch managing to interceI?t a boatload of Indonesian refugees. ThIS was an exercise that I thought indicated what the 'Watch Out for Australia' campaign can do. It is the station owners and people who occupy the sparsely populated north of Australia, working on behalf of Customs, that make Coastwatch work. From what 1 saw of the Australian Customs Service, the only real difficulty facing it is how to maintain job satisfaction among a group called to do what is frequently a repetitious and non-rewarding task. The Customs Service has endeavoured to achieve this by implementing a program of what it calls rotation. Actually, 1 do not like that word. Yesterday a member of the Australian Public Sector and Broadcasting Union said to me that it should be called 'career development and training and staff mobility'. What that term meant was: do not leave one person in one job for too long. Effectively, 1 think it is helping to minimise the problem, but it creates another problem for a Customs Service that increasingly needs electronic surveillance and, for its contraband enforcement team-as the Chairman has set out-a capacity to know where the high risk areas are and to target those risk areas. The Customs Service now has to exercise a balance between job mobility and the use of specialists in areas of increasingly sensitive computer surveillance, which are essential if we are effectively to monitor the north of Australia. 1 return to my opening remarks. 1 think the Customs Service has to determine whether or not it wants to be a rottweiler or a poodle. What 1 saw reassured me that we are not cultivating a poodle that merely decorates the entrance to Australian ports; we have instead a rottweiler that may need some training but that, nonetheless, is effectively policing Australia on behalf of all Australian citizens.

6,Mr JOHNS,ENERGY USE,"I move: That this House: (1) calls on industry and consumers alike strive to achieve the utmost efficiency energy use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) seeks enlightened policies by all Australian Governments to assist these efforts. The question of greenhouse gases and the need to reduce them has been debated publicly for some years now in Australia. But it is the efficient use of energy that will drive our ability to diminish greenhouse gases. Today 1 want to address energy efficiency and allow other members to join in this debate. We cannot really sustain lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions without lowering our living standards unless we achieve sufficient levels of energy efficiency. There are two government documents that relate to this matter. 1 refer to them . briefly. One is Energy and the Greenhouse Effect, published by the Australian Minerals and Energy Council, which is the council of resources and energy Ministers, in June 1990. The second, published by the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council, which is the council of environment Ministers, is entitled Towards a National Greenhouse Strategy for Australia. Both documents indicate a number of ways in which we might begin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and both concentrate to some extent on energy efficiency. Most of the ways in which energy efficiency may be sought l)sually relate to individual technological fixes: for instance, we should design cars that are more fuel efficient. My question, though, is: if we build cities at such low densities that we make people travel vast distances just to get to work and back and if we add up the number of cars and kilometres travelled in a typical Australian city, then no matter how efficient one's motor vehicle is the result is the same-a large increase in the volume of carbon dioxide, in the case of cars. There are something like eight million vehiCles in Australia and 17 million people. I shall concentrate on the question of how we have actually built our cities and, by building them at low densities, how we have made it impossible to servto ice those cities other than by means of of the private motor vehicle. Frankly, we will have to change that. It is to the question of the long term planning of cities that 1 want to speak. Although technical people can design lots of individual things for us-as in our steel production, motor car manufacturing and the way we build houses-we can all individually contribute and assist in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Unless the broader planning is done we have no hope of achieving the goals recently set by the Federal Govern-. ment-that is, we have said that by the year 2005 we should reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level which obtained in 1988. That is going to be very difficult to achieve unless we take some of the broader planning roles and assist State and local governments to help improve our city density so that people do not have to travel or use cars so much. There is, of course, a macro-economic perspective here. If we continue to demand that people travel large distances simply to ply their trade, to go to and from work, then ultimately we will impose a large oil import bill to urive those cars and we will ensure that the very high ratio of cars to people persists in Australia. Money has to be spent on roads and services per citizen to service the needs of especially those people who live in outer suburbs. We cannot afford to simply flick a switch and say, 'Let us begin to build public transport systems to take the weight off the private car', because by definition public transport systems cannot make money in low density cities. It would not matter if we provided free fares on most suburban rail networks in Australian cities; people would still not travel because the services are not sufficiently efficient for their needs. By and large, one can still get between work and home more quickly and certainly more comfortably by using the private car. Until we begin to fill in our inner city and middle s.uburban areas, we will not have sufficient numbers of people living around existing train stations and using the trains. When we do come to grips with that, the volume of people will actually make those transport systems economically viable. I will make a few comparisons in the way we build our cities. We often build in costs as a consequence of allowing our cities to sprawl a great distance from the city centres. A study for Melbourne city-and this applies to most cities in Australia-estimated that on average the community saves more than $40,000 in infrastructure and individual costs for every household located close to Melbourne rather than in the fringe suburbs. We actually build in costs the greater the distance at which we build our suburbs from city centres. There are some unique comparisons here in the amount of energy which various cities demand that individuals must use. If we look at Houston in Texas, the city that George Bush came from, we see that the petrol use of that city was 74,510 megajoules per capita expended by individuals. In Brisbane, my city, 30,653 megajoules per capita were expended. That is not a good record. If we compare the energy consumption in my city of Brisbane with, say, the average consumption of those in European cities, which are generally built at higher densities, we find that the average consumption in megajoules per capita for petrol use in European cities is 13,280. So let us compare them: Houston expends 74,000 megajoules, Brisbane 30,600, and the average of European cities 13,280. It is the way we actually build and design our cities that to all intents and purposes drives the amount of fuel we use, and there is no way we can get out of that simply by designing more fuel efficient cars. We must direct our efforts to the way we plan our cities. I am pleased to say that at the recent Special Premiers Conference part of the communique directed the attention of Federal and State Ministers to this very question, and I will read the two brief extracts because I must say I was very pleased to see some of this thinking in that communique. It said: It was agreed that, as one contribution to making more efficient use of infrastructure, there be an examination of more efficient and equitable patterns of urban settlement including urban consolidation. This examination would draw on the work of Planning and Housing Ministers and be undertaken by Commonwealth, State and Local Government officials. A report is to be prepared for the May 1991 special Premiers' Conference. And I look forward to that. Another extract reads: Leaders recognised that the structure of Australia's cities contributes to relatively high energy consumption and consequent greenhouse emissions. There has been a traditional conflict between those who would insist that we build urban transit systems, rail, bus and so on and those who would prefer that our cities be built around the private motor vehicle. There is nothing innate about the way we build our cities. We do not have to build them so they can be serviced only by private cars. There is a lovely little illustration which goes back some years when there was a real live conflict between those who would build rail systems and allow rail to determine the shape of our cities and those who would design cities built around the car and roads. It is a lovely example taken from an American experience. A report by P.W.G. Newman in the Current Affairs Bulletin of 1988 states: The politics of transport is dominated by an acrimonious conflict between road and rail lobbies. The most controversial story of this sort concerns the road lobby which dismantled the urban electric rail systems in US cities. In the 1930s a holding company, National City Lines, which was made up of interests from oil, tyre and car industries, bought the private electric systems in 45 US cities and then closed them down. According toand he mentions another writerthe reasons for this were clear: 'one subway car or electric rail car can take the place of from 50 to 100 automobiles'. In 1949 a Grand Jury ultimately convicted General Motors, Standard Oil of California and Firestone Tyres on a criminal indictment for anti-trust conspiracy, but the damage had been done. Los Angeles was the worse affected with 280 million passengers a year being pushed into buses and cars and within a few decades there were four million cars in LA and the era of car-dependent US cities had begun. We have made similar decisions in this country where in much more minor aspects we have closed down suburban rail systems or particular stations from time to time because in all logic those systems were not paying for themselves. But what drives the financial viability of public transport systems is again the question of city densities. The number of people who will use a system is determined by city densities; not by how well managed the rail system is; not by the cost of travelling levels of in a train; and not by how comfortable the trains, et cetera, are. These things are large scale matters. One does not change the shape of cities in a few years. But the Government has set itself a target to lower greenhouse gas emissions. It has set a target .for the year 2005 and the work must endure beyond that. My plea today is to say that- in addition to the individual technical fixes that we must bring to bear to help lower greenhouse gas emissions, we must also at the same time change the very shape of Australian cities bit by bit so that we do not have cities that determine that we must use enormous volumes of petrol.",20
7,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENERGY USE,Is the motion seconded? Mr Courtice-I second the motion.,22
8,Mr NUGENT,ENERGY USE,"1 congratulate the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) on his initiative today. His motion deals with a range of areas: industry, consumers, energy, greenhouse gases and, of course, the States' involvement. He has focused his comments this morning on city planning and long term efficiency planning. Indeed, I support the need for some long term efficiency planning. It seems to me that all too often these days we focus on matters in a range of areas that take account of only the short term perspective. Last year the coalition produced a document on the climate challenge. I will briefly read a couple of short extracts from it which I think are relevant to what we are speaking about this morning. We said: Without a benign atmosphere there can be no life on earth. In past ages, significant changes in the earth's climate have altered substantially the nature and forms of all terrestrial life. Those past changes were however the result of events beyond the control of mankind. By contrast, today most of the threats to our climate and atmosphere result from the activities of the human population. We see those threats being primarily global warming, the greenhouse effect, depletion of the ozone layer, pollution and especially the acidification of the air. We would very much support an action plan that looks at the coordination and support of climate research; the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; the prohibition, where possible, of the release of new gases; the encouraged substitution for ozone depleting substances; the promotion of the use of alternative and cleaner fuels; the improvement of energy efficiency; and positive national, and international leadership in this whole area. T-lfere seems to be a lot of cynicism in the community these days. What is gratifying about this morning's proceedings is that we are hearing some sensible debate. My eye was caught recently by an article in the Australian on 31 October. I might say that it was \lnonymous, by a so-called special correspondent. He said: Take a typical politician: a man in his 50s, well aware that his political future is sounder if his country and people get richer. Invite him to sign an international treaty to ward off a change in the world's climate that may be doing damage in the middle of the next century. Tell him that this will commit him, now, to raise the price of energy-the basis of so much voter comfort. Wait for the expletives. I say to that journalist, 'Wrong, wrong, wrong'. There is truly a bipartisan concern about these issues. We may differ on some of the means of dealing with the problem, but there is a genuine concern. Too often the media has been glib in this area. Politicians actually have to deal in the real world. Perhaps that journalist should come down from the stands and try to join the real game where we have to deal with the problems. I am delighted that this morning the honourable member for Petrie has put forward some practical comments and suggestions. On the subject of greenhouse gas emissions, I remind the House that we responded to the Government's recent statement on the subject of setting a greenhouse gas emissions target. We have been calling for something similar for some time. We welcome the Government's adoption of an indicative target. Of course, some months ago we ourselves proposed a target that was even more ambitious. However, we recognise that clearly there has to be some flexibility in the real world, so that target may need to be modified a bit over the years. But if we set a target, then at least we have something to aim for. The world generally is starting to get its act together. Just last week, at the second world conference on climate in Geneva, a number of decisions were made that will mean profound changes in transport, industry, housing and' all energy systems around the world. The intention is to put a firm treaty in place in Brazil at the United Nations conference in 1992- Two groups of industrialised nations dominate this whole debate in the world. One is the western European countries plus Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Japan and Canada. They believe that we should set targets and try to stabilise at least carbon dioxide emissions. But the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Saudi Arabia, three of the biggest oil producers, are resisting making any sort of commitment. The United States in particular has tended to listen to some of the small group of sceptical scientists who do not believe that warming is actually happening. At the climate conference in Geneva most scientists clearly said they now agree that massive burning of fossil fuels is slowly turning the earth into a warmer greenhouse. The Geneva declaration accepted that global warming will threaten humanity in the next century. Of course, . we have a particular problem with Third World countries. They have some concerns that they cannot afford to be environmentally safe while they pull themselves out of economic poverty. As a side issue it is perhaps worth mentioning that a Cairo geologist rightly pointed out at that conference that concern over pollution was really nothing new-4,000-yearold inscriptions found in Egypt carried injunctions against 'dirtying the Nile'. I suggest that our scientific knowledge today is slightly better and it does confirm that we now have a problem of truly historic proportions. Industry needs to perform better on environmental matters than it has done in the past. I think it is recognising this. But it also needs certainty in planning. I am pleased to note that the Cabinet recently started to acknowledge that. I also make the point that consumers have a significant role to play. I believe that the public understands the issue and wishes to help. The recent Government moves to aid the process of community action are welcomed. But I think we have to think through the process. Not so long ago in my electorate, which is an outer eastern suburban electorate in Melbourne, we put out our bottles in a particular bag, our plastics in another, and our paper in a box for separate collection and proper handling. But we did not think the system through and it broke down after six months. The collections were okay, as were the handling of the material at the depot and its recycling, but we had no way of getting rid of the product that we then recycled. Nobody wanted to buy it. It was uneconomic and the whole damn system collapsed. So I believe the public will not put up with that sort of incompetence. We must not just talk; we need to put in place programs of substance. I would like to make a brief comment in terms of pure efficiency of energy use. I give just one example. I had the good fortune to live in Cyprus for three years from 1968 to 1971. At that time, almost every House in the town where I lived had a solar heater on the roof. In Australia, we have an even warmer year round climate. Mr Downer-When was that?",22
9,Mr NUGENT,ENERGY USE,"Twenty years ago virtually every house in Cyprus had a solar heater on the roof. In Australia, almost no house does. So we have barely scratched the surface with solar heating: We need to lift our game as a nation and the Government needs to cut out some of its rhetoric and provide some sound practical leadership in those sorts of areas. Clearly, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is of critical importance. Global warming is happening. We may argue about exactly when and where and what exactly will happen and to what extent and there are economic imperatives, especially in the Third World. But the bottom line is that the sea will inevitably and countries in our part of the world, the Pacific region, could disappear. I happen to be the vice-chairman of the parliamentary Australia-South Pacific Friendship Association and I have learnt in my short space of time in this place from meeting visiting delegations that these people are very concerned about what is going to happen to their countries. A six-foot rise in the sea level could wipe out whole countries. What do you say, Mr Deputy Speaker, to someone whose nation our fellow countrymen are helping to wipe out by flooding because of the net effect of the greenhouse effect and Australia's contribution to it? Finally, I would like to turn to the subject of the States. It has seemed to me for a long time to be a blinding statement of the obvious that environmental matters have to be both national and international, but they cannot be parochially State-oriented alone. To use that cliched phrase, the air on the north side of the Murray is the same air as that on the south side of the Murray. People like the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), the New South Wales Premier, Nick Greiner, and my good friend, now unfortunately departed from this Parliament, Chris Puplick have been saying that for some time. I think the comments made at the recent Premiers Conference obviously helped in these directions. The States must cooperate in all of these matters. Not to do so is just not in their interests and, I would suggest, it is just plain short-sighted and stupid. I would like to close by again saying to the honourable member for Petrie that his motion is opportune, praiseworthy, very practical and sensible, and I support him. The coalition has been moving down this track for some time. We are gratified to note that recently the Government has started to adopt some practical and sensible measures, and I commend to the House and to all Australians the matters raised here today.",24
10,Mr COURTICE,ENERGY USE,"I am very pleased to second the motion moved today by the honourable member rise for Petrie (Mr Johns). He has very competently covered many aspects of pollution, particularly as it affects the large metropolitan cities. There is no doubt that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are increasing as a result of human activities. While there have been fluctuations in climate over the last two million years, we as humans have certainly had an effect on the climate and our environment. While the impacts on the global and the Australian climate cannot be predicted with certainty, I feel, as I have said, that there is general agreement that increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will lead to changes in the earth's climate in years to come. It is the responsibility of all of us, not only now but also for future .generations, to attempt to address this problem. The uncertainties and the potential impacts associated with the potential changes in climate warrant serious consideration of response measures by governments and the community at large. I would like to stress that it is not only a problem that confronts us here in Australia; it is a global problem. While we can immediately address some of our difficulties, we need also to contribute work to address other problems that are affecting the climate across the seas in other nations. Australia does have a relatively high level of greenhouse gas emissions compared to other countries. We contribute about one per cent of the world's emissions and we are ranked about 11 in emissions on a per capita basis. ThereÂ· are several reasons for this. Our agriculture and energy-intensive industry sectors are large and well developed. Our dependence on fossil fuels is high. Our population distribution is such that we have high transport requirements. Both the honourable member for Petrie and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) touched on this matter. As we all know, with 17 million people in a continent of some three million square miles, there is a need to use large amounts of fuel. Of course, the rise in fuel costs occasioned by the Middle East crisis impacts directly on us, as we are all aware. But one of the other reasons why our emissions are high in comparison with other nations is that many of them, particularly those in Europe, have over the years developed nuclear industries. Consequently, they do not rely as much as wdo on coal for their power generation. However, there are some difficulties with that. Not only is uranium use an emotional issue, but to decommission nuclear power stations has become a massive headache. Many of the power stations that were established in the 1950s are now winding down and the cost of decommissioning is extremely high. In fact, that is a technology that offers great potential for this country. If we are able to produce the technology needed to decommission nuclear power stations, we would have a very valuable commodity that WI! could sell to improve our current account. The working group of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on greenhouse gas emissions surveyed the major Australian sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The group's report identified the energy production and consumption sector as our and most significant source of greenhouse gases-mostly, carbon dioxide-with the agriculture and industry also being important. Other gases which absorb radiation and contribute to enhancing the greenhouse effect include methane, nitrous oxides, chlorofluorocarbons-which are better known as CFCs-and water vapour. At present, carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. The range of gases involved means that effective responses cannot focus on one gas or on one sector of the economy. In addition, there are many unknowns associated with our greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, estimates of emission levels are considered relatively crude, especially for nitrous oxides. We need more information on the operation and effects of sinks-such as forest, soils and the oceans-for greenhouse gases. Nonetheless, virtually all emissions of carbon dioxide in Australia are thought to be derived from fossil fuels. This is an area that we can begin to address now. No-one can doubt the potential for improved efficiency in our use of fuels and energy. There is considerable scope both to produce and to use energy more effectively, for instance. It could be done by I,1sing less fuel for the same output; using better technologies; using fuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions, such as using gas instead of oil; using alternative sources of energy, such as renewables; reducing energy demand by being more frugal and building better buildings; and increasing the efficiency of energy use through energy intensity. Companies such as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd are certainly looking at that in regard to their furnaces, but I would like to give one very pertinent example of how we are switching to gas instead of oil and reducing emissions. This example is in my own electorate in Gladstone, where Queensland Alumina Ltd has switched from using oil fired burners to gas fired burners utilising our own natural gas rese'rves. Not only is that cleaner and more efficient but, of course, it replaces a commodity that we are importing. So it is import replacement, which improves our current account. Mr Downer-And it is cheaper.",24
11,Mr COURTICE,ENERGY USE,"As the honourable member says, it is cheaper. I think that is a positive example of how a large company, one of our most important, is switching and being more efficient in energy use. The Government has been considering in some depth and for some time the issues involved in assessing and addressing the greenhouse effect. On 11 October Cabinet decided to adopt an interim target for planning purposes of stabilising greenhouse gases, other than those covered by the Montreal protocol, at 1988 levels. As the honourable member for Aston said, hopefully, these will be stabilised by the year 2000 and then reduced by 20 per cent by the year 2005. The Cabinet decision identified six steps that the Government would be taking as part of its response strategy. It agreed to refer to the Industry Commission the question of costs and benefits for Australian industry of an international consensus in favour of a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, including new opportumtIes that could arise and how Australia would best prepare itself to respond to those costs and benefits. Cabinet agreed to request the ecologically sustainable development working groups to report on options to stabilise emissions of greenhouse gases by the year 2000 and reduce them by 20 per cent by the year 2005 and to report on the most cost effective combination of measures available for reducing emissions. It also agreed to campaign for an international convention binding all countries to feasible and sustainable greenhouse gas emission reductions and to place the matter on the agenda for the Special Premiers Conference, which we have just had. Cabinet also agreed to request my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to report back on a range o(initiatives in the energy efficiency and energy management area that can be implemented immediately to reduce energy demand and emissions using known and available technologies and energy management techniques and to request the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to report by the end of the year on recommended implementation measures identified by the Prime Minister's working group in consultation with relevant Ministers. On 23 October Cabinet also approved a $15m allocation for b;nmediate initiatives to reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Recognising the key role that individual consumer behaviour plays in our use of energy, the major item in this package of initiatives was the production of a kit provisionally titled The Home Energy Efficiency Guide and its distribution to all Australian households. One important barrier to increased efficiency of energy use is a lack of pertinent information on which consumers can make their decisions. This kit, being produced in association with the Australian Consumers Association, will provide, I believe, useful reference information on domestic energy efficient technologies and practices. The next round of initiatives being developed by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Minister for Transport and Communications, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will address the greenhouse issue in greater depth and with longer time frames. The last point I would like to make is about Energy Systems Exporters Group Ltd, which has established itself as a dynamic organisation committed to the export of world class Australian energy systems and equipment. This is one of the most exciting parts of the problems that we face. Not only can we playa part in reducing our own emissions in this nation and contribute to improving the world's problems, but we can also earn export dollars for Australia. We are innovative and efficient and we are leaders in many ways in this regard. I would like to compliment Australian Energy Systems Exporters Group Ltd because it plays a very important role, as I have said, not only in trying to reduce emissions here but also in keying in on the possibility of value adding for this nation. This a global problem; it is not just a problem that affects us here. There is a lot of potential in regard to coal-fired power stations. In Germany, for instance, I believe that they are still burning brown coal. In China their efficiency levels in coal power stations are surprisingly very poor. If we are able to export our technologies and make profits for Australia and at the same time improve theefficiency and reduce the emissions in those sorts of power stations, we are contributing to improving the world climate and at the same time earning export dollars. J believe we have a great opportunity. Organisations such as those I have just mentioned are playing a very positive role in conjunction with the Government. Because there are only a few minutes left I will close so that the following speaker can make some points.",26
12,Mr WEBSTER,ENERGY USE,"Macquarie) (11.00)It is not often that I am able to get up in this House and agree with very much of what the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) says. We are usually at opposite ends of the pole in terms of the various issues and arguments that we contend. But in this issue we have total unity. Other speakers have commended him for again highlighting this very important matter in the community, our nation and, indeed, throughout the world. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) was very lucid in his comments, as was the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). I support them all. One might wonder why it is necessary to get up at all in this debate. We all know that the greenhouse gases are an essential part of the environment of our planet. I know everybody here would be expert in all the issues and details of this particular problem but there may be a lot of people listening who are not aware of the fact, for example, that the present levels of these greenhouse gases and the interception capacity that they have in preventing heat from escaping from our planet means that our planet is at the right temperature and 35 degrees warmer than it would be otherwise. They are very important-indeed, vital. If they were missing we would not be here; we would have a lifeless planet that was covered in ice like many of the other planets in our solar system. The problem is that human activity appears to be increasing the greenhouse effect. Scientific studies show, as others have mentioned, that the levels of the various greenhouse gases in the air are rising year by year. As we will see later, most of these increases are due to industry, transport and agriculture. If these trends continue-and they will unless we take action to stop them; that is the whole point of the concern of the honourable member for Petrie-we can expect our planet to grow steadily warmer. What is more, the changes are happening very rapidly. In the past, thousands of years would have been needed to double the amount of carbon dioxide il). the atmosphere. Now. it could take place within a mere century. A number of comments were made about the efficiency needed in terms of our city planning and passing reference has been made to the need for much greater refinement in terms of our power generation and so on. I would like to make a point or two about that. Certain advanced electricity generation technologies, which have already been operating satisfactorily in other parts of the world, have some application .in this country. Enhanced environmental standards are being imposed all over the world. It is of the utmost importance for power generators as well as power plant suppliers to find cost effective technologies for environmental control. One of the most interesting developments, I am sure you will be fascinated to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the flu idised bed combustion method of using coal. It is the most significant advance in coal combustion techniques to have occurred in recent times. It represents an efficient means not only of burning coals of low quality-that means coal with a high ash content and a low calorific value or low reactivity-but also of reducing sulphur dioxide emissions to any desired level merely by the addition of a suitable absorbent material with the fuel. We all recall seeing pictures of industrial cities in Romania where there was constant belching out of fossil fuel smoke and so on, causing enormous amounts of pollution in that country. The low combustion temperature gives low N02-nitrogen dioxide-emissions, emanating only from part of the fuel nitrogen, thus atmospheric fluidised bed combustion (AFBC) is seen not only as a alternative to conventional coal combustion techniques but also as a means of extending the range of fuels capable of being used both industrially and for power generation. Pressurised fluidised bed combustion contains all the usual advantages exhibited by AFBC, many of which are further enhanced and can be incorporated into the combined gas-steam cycles for power generation. Combined gas-steam cycles offer the possibility of effecting significant improvements to cycle efficiency, the margin of improvement increasing with the temperature at which the gas turbine operates. Such schemes offer not only higher thermal efficiencies but also the capability of using even poor coals in an environmentally acceptable manner. The major parameters governing these designs, performance and operation and are well categorised.",27
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENERGY USE,Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA TARIFFS AND TRADE: URUGUAY NA,28
14,Mr DOWNER,ROUND,"I move: That this House believes a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round of GATT international trade negotiations in December 1990 will make a major contribution to global prosperity and provide significant 'trade opportunities for Australia and urges the Australian Government to do all in its power to achieve that successful outcome. The Uruguay Round may, to many people in Australia, and indeed around the world, be a little esoteric and certainly through its four years it has not aroused a great deal of community enthusiasm as a public issue. My submission is that the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) trade negotiations is the most important single international economic event for a generation. The successful outcome of the Uruguay Round in the next few weeks will make anenormous contribution to global prosperity and the evolution of a liberal international trading system. The successful outcome will underpin the GATT organisation itself which through its life, since the late 1940s, has been an enormously successful body, having reduced tariffs in industrialised countries from an average of around 40 per cent in the 1940s to around 5 per cent today. According to the Centre for International Economics, if the Uruguay Round is successful it could add something like $397 billion to global gross domestic product (GDP). It could add something like $63 billion to the GDP of the Asian region. As far as Australia is concerned it could increase household incomes by about one per cent and add some 4.4 per cent to Australia's farm output. The stakes are very high, particularly Fraser when we contemplate the alternative of and we Government what will happen if the Uruguay Round on ensuring that the Cairns fails. It could lead to the dissolution GATT, which has been so successful. That would occur in particular because of desuccessful veloping country disillusion with the way developed countries have handled the Uruguay Round. It could very easily move the world towards a state of trade war reminiscent of the trade wars of the 1930s which were triggered by the Smoot Hawleads ley Act, trade wars which in particular would be characterised by extraordinarily damaging and expensive export subsidies. It could even lead to the evolution of trading blocs beyond those trading blocs that already exist. From Australia's point of view that is a particularly frightening scenario because we would be left very isolated in those circumstances. Finally, the failure of the Uruguay Round would, without any doubt, exacto erbate the downturn in the global econreactionary omy which is already taking place, possibly plunging the world into a true economic recession of the type we lived through in the very early 1980s and cerprogress tainly causing immense damage to an Australian economy which is already exthat traordinarily vulnerable. From Australia's point of view, there no doubt that agriculture is the central part of the Uruguay Round, although do not want in any way at all to belittle the other 14 areas of negotiation. It important that the Uruguay Round could achieves a more liberal regime for the services trade, that progress is made reducing non-tariff barriers, that progress is continually made to reduce tariffs, that intellectual property rights can properly guaranteed as a result of the Uruguay Round; and we on this side of the House believe it will be significant the Uruguay Round achieves some libercontinue alisation in investment flows. But at the heart of the Uruguay Round from Australia's point of view, without doubt, lies agriculture. We on this side of the House have congratulated the Government on the initiative it has taken in putting together the Cairns Group, which was really building on the work of the congratulate some years earlier, the Government also Group has of been able to work in a very happy and of America alliance with the United States on agricultural issues. We also agree with the Government that the European Community, as far as agriculture is concerned, has behaved in a selfish introverted way which inevitably developing countries and efficient agricultural producers such as Australia to conclude that the Community is little more than a selfish rich man's club. Yet if the Europeans were only to think for a moment what benefits they could get from the liberalisation even of agricultural trade, perhaps they would be more forthcoming in pushing for that liberalisation. Incomes in the European Community would be increased by about 11/2 per cent per household if only its members were dismantle the highly protectionist and common agricultural policy. The fact is that the Uruguay Round is bound to fail if there can be no proper in the area of agricultural trade. At the moment there is a very real risk that failure will occur because of the head-in-the-sand offer that the European Community has so far made on agriculis ture. Its offer to reduce agricultural support-aggregate support measures, as it I says-by some 30 per cent between 1986 and 1996 is an offer which puts forward is benefits to the rest of the world which only be described as microscopic. The key to a successful offer from the on: Europeans will be whether they will do something to wind back to negligible levand els by the turn of the century their exbe traordinary, damaging export subsidy. If they want to pay income support to their farmers internally, that is something for if them to sort out themselves, but if they to go around the world dumping their agricultural surpluses-artificially built up through an extraordinary and regressive price support scheme-and wiping efficient agricultural producers such as Australia out of the international marketplace, we will not sit around and simply accept that. Nor, for that matter, will the other members of the Cairns Group or the United States of America. The Europeans must come back to the negotiating table with a sensible, relevant offer, in particular on export subsidies for Round. agriculture, before the Uruguay Round can come to a satisfactory conclusion. If they do not do that, all the potential benefits in areas such as tariffs and non-tariff riers, services trade, intellectual property and trade related investment measures will be lost simply because of the selfishness of European farmers and the weakness of European politicians. I am glad to be able to say that the coalition has played its part in leading this debate on the Uruguay Round over the last six or seven months. In the first place, we have urged the Government never to give up in the struggle to achieve a successful outcome to .the Uruguay Round. We have at times criticised the Government for seeming to be defeatist, for saying several months ago that the whole thing would end in failure when our view is that we must struggle as best we can as a small country to achieve a successful outcome. We have argued right from the outset that the Government's position should be that no agreement at all is better than a bad agreement which allows the European Community to continue its appalling agricultural trade cies. I am glad to say not only that the Government has picked up and run with that position, but that it is encouraging that the whole of the Cairns Group has adopted that position-as did the United States quite some time ago. We have urged the Government to participate actively in forums such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group on the Uruguay Round Issue to ensure that non-European members of the OECD and all the members of APEC are placing as much diplomatic effort as is humanly possible on the European Community to achieve a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round. Some time ago we called for a national summit of State officials, industry groups and environmental groups in Australia to try to harness their influence, particularly their influence overseas, to persuade other countries, in particular the Europeans, to move towards trade liberalisation in the Uruguay The Government did not do that, but the Government has at least shown some sympathy for that proposition. We have barcalled for bipartisan participation in the final negotiating session and I am sorry that on that particular count the Government has rejected our offer, whereas governments in a number of other countries have placed a high premium on bipartisanship. The Government has made a mistake there because it is important that we as Australians are seen to be putting forward a unified national effort in these vastly important negotiations. Finally, and most recently, we promoted an initiative that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself should take-to try to involve other heads of government in the final negotiating session of the Uruguay Round. We on this side of the House are well known for giving credit where it is due and I certainly congratulate the Government and the Prime Minister on taking up our initiative. I am glad to say that the United States is now also considering that sort of proposal. In conclusion, everybody in Australia, polino matter how esoteric GATT and the Uruguay Round may appear at first blush, needs to understand that these negotiations are of vast importance to our living standards for the rest of this century and beyond. We as a country must do all we can in our own small way to ensure that they are successful and to persuape, above all, the European Community to see common sense in the interests of all of mankind.",28
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROUND,Is the motion seconded? Mr MaeKellar-1 second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,30
16,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ROUND,"1 offer my congratulations to the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) for moving this motion and I am happy to offer my support for the thrust of it. I am very impressed to discover that the shadow Minister is leading the world: firstly the Government and now America seem to be taking his advice. I wonder whether our negotiators and the American negotiators accept that they have been eagerly awaiting each of his utterances so they can know what to do next, which seems to be the case. I want to one clarify one matter at the very start. Whilst over many years there has been a broad bipartisanship in Australian politics on the question of agriculcurrent tural trade and the significance of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round, it would be wrong to accept the comments of the honourable member for Mayo on bipartisanship. Only a fortnight ago he said that the coalition signals the end of bipartisanship on world trade talks. He was suggesting that the bipartisanship that we understood existed, and that I think the Australian and international community understood existed, was coming to an end. And just a week ago he spoke about the Government's plans undermining the GATT strategy. On the one hand, the shadow Minister is saying we will do better as a country if we present a single unified bipartisan approach; on the other hand, within weeks, at the vital stage of negotiations, on two occasions only a few weeks apart he is saying that bipartisanship is coming to an end and that the Government's trade plans are wrong. I would have thought that there was more than a slight degree of hypocrisy in what he has been saying this morning. The Uruguay Round dates back to 1986. It has been a four year process and a very complex process. During that time, we have seen the changes evolving in Europe, where it is expected that, by 1992, there will be an internal market of 340 million people. I had the great pleasure and honour a couple of years back of being on a delegation to Europe that spoke with the Commissioners De Klerk and Andriessen, who was assistant commissioner at the time, as well as with European parliamentarians-both national and European. It is clear that the European Community sees itself as being the great market for the future of the world; that it has become increasingly focused on inward looking policies and strategies. It is equally clear that Europe has reduced its investment in our part of the world, in Asia, quite significantly-and that is accepted and admitted by the European leaders. In other words, Europe has lost its position as the part of the world that invested heavily in Asia; it has lost its position in Asian investment. In other words, the European Community is looking increasingly at its own internal market of 340 million people-and that number, I think, was raised by its leaders in almost every discussion. It is almost an obsession. We have also become aware of the fact that in the United Kingdom, for example, there has been debate on the removal of hedgerows to increase the wheat farming acreage. So, at the time. I was last there, a country that had for so long imported grain was still involved in destroying its environment to expand its wheat growing, in the hope of becoming a wheat exporter. God knows where to! But that was obviously in the minds of the farmers. The bottom line of all of that is that, when one actually talked to the politicians off the record, they all accepted and made it very clear that the farmers were still, in fact, predominantly very poor and still suffering; that the real beneficiary of the European Community's common agricultural policy has been agro-business-the manufaGturers of equipment and suppliers of fertilisers. In other words, the business side of agriculture has benefited greatly and certainly vastly more so than the farmers themselves. When one talks to the German politicians about their small hill farmers with small lots in fairly difficult country and high cost of production, they make it fairly clear that. agricultural policy to them is primarily a social support system rather than some form of trade approach. This current round of GATT negotiaand tions is in fact, as the honourable member for Mayo says, an absolutely vital one. think the Government in 1987, by apand pointing for the first time a Minister cifically for trade negotiations, has indicated that we have recognised the nificance of international trade. I can call that back in 1969, when I was living and working in England when it joined the Common Market, Australian Ministhan most countries. ters were being interviewed on British television and being asked by Robin Day, 'Well it's a bit late; this has been happenon ing for the last 10 years. Where have been?'. The response from the Australian Minister of the day-and a very senior one-was, 'We never thought you would do it to us; we never really thought you would join'. When asked then about the difference between New Zealand and AusRound. tralia in their approach to European cultural trade, the Australian Minister was quite unable to answer why New Zealand had won concessions when Australia had not even bothered to negotiate. So, the failure of Australia over decades to recognise the future changes certainly has been picked up by this Government. In 1987, the establishment of a Minister for Trade Negotiations as a significant and senior portfolio, as a member of Cabinet, certainly has lifted the ante and has shown the pmphasis. These negotiations are portant. They must not be trivialised cheap point scoring, by nonsense about the Opposition seeking the end of bipartisanship, by claims by the Opposition that it is telling the Australian Governit ment and the American Government how to go about it. That, quite frankly, is foolish and that will only trivialise diminish Australia's role in these negotithe ations. We have in fact made a great deal of progress, particularly since the formation of the Cairns Group, which again was an Issue. Australian initiative. We have made a great deal of progress. Certainly, two three years ago, it was difficult to riculture into the GATT negotiations serious way. GATT was always .about inDowner) dustrial manufactured trade-rarely agricultural trade. Now, it is quite clear quite recognised and accepted that this Round is primarily about agriCUlture. II would think that both the Government the Opposition, and the whole of the speAustralian community, should be absolutely positive that our place in the world sigand our role in the world in terms of reinternational trade are based on a sense of fair play and a sense of honesty about how we trade. Perhaps we have that more I trust that this Round will succeed in terms of easing the barriers to world trade agricultural products. I have some opyou timism-in fact, more so than obviously the honourable members opposite-that Europe will start to recognise that its credibility and its respect in the world will be. very much affected py how it presents itself finally at this .final Uruguay The unfortunate part is that we agrisomehow find ourselves equating manufacturing initiatives in Australia with the kind of subsidies and export incentives given by the Europeans. That simplistic cheap politicking within Australia has for so long perhaps damaged our capacity to present credibly in the world forums. In this particular Round, Australia does have a strong position and a very significant strategic position. That will be given support and benefit from an Opposition that recognises its role in the scheme of things, imand stops trying to see that the GATT by Round and the current trade negotiations are, in fact, an exercise in point scoring. The motion is a good motion and it is an important motion. It is important that be taken seriously and not trivialised and turned into some cheap exercise. I quite would like to see the Opposition in the and weeks ahead being totally supportive of position that the Government is taking-which is, quite frankly, the only logical, sensible position available-and not - ooking for ways .to trivialise this total",30
17,Mr MACKELLAR,ROUND,"It is with great pleasure that I get agsecond and support my colleague the in a honourable member for Mayo (Mr in his motion for the success of about the December 1990 Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. It has been said that Benjamin Franklin was the source of thquotation, 'No nation was ever ruined by trade'. I believe that if he was in AustralRound. is's position at this time-with our precarious trade reliance on commodities; the apparent failure of secondary and service industries to meet their export potential; a world which, unfortunately, seems to be teetering on the brink of a rejection of a global free trade system and a move towards regional trading blocs-he might be the first to admit to having some doubt as to the reliability of his quotation. Of course, what he was on about was that, if one is in a position to trade, one will not be ruined. Unfortunately, we are seeing in some areas restrictions to trade, which this motion moved by the honourable member for Mayo seeks to set to one side. GATT, that unusual acronym, is simply a set of international agreements which aim to abolish quotas and reduce tariffs and other restrictions on world trade. It was originally agreed to in 1947 as part of a post-war financial reconstruction phase involving the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. As the honourable member for Mayo has said,. its existence has been characterised by great efforts to free up world trade, and it has had some success in the past. Just as we saw the Kennedy Round of negotiations in 1964 to 1967 and its significant achievements in reducing import duties over a five-year period, we are now in the midst of the Uruguay Round of negotiations with another agenda. . The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) in his contribution seemed to suggest that we are being a little unfriendly in not totally supporting every aspect of the Government's attitudes and propositions in this regard. We are in broad general agreement with what the Government is seeking to achieve but, of course, we must retain the right to criticise certain details. That is what the Opposition, through its spokesman, the honourable member for Mayo, has done in relation to some of the propositions being supported by the Government. We are, as we have consistently stated, in very strong agreement with the thrust of the Uruguay Round and the thrust of the Government's support for the Uruguay While I am speaking about the contribution by the honourable member for Newcastle-unfortunately, he has left the chamber-it really is gilding the lily a bit to suggest that it was the Hawke Government which thought of trade negotiations. I can remember some of my colleagues during the time of the Fraser Government spending a great deal of their time, with regard to their responsibilities, overseas. I refer to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and particularly to the then member for Curtin, who was involved with trade negotiations at that stage as part of his ministerial responsibilities. I am not seeking to point score; I am seeking to set the record straight and put the proposition that it is the proper responsibility of any government, of whatever political persuasion, to put special emphasis on successful trade negotiations on behalf of this country. Getting back to the present situation and the current negotiations, at the core of these negotiations is a conflict of interests between the European Community (EC) countries on the one hand, with their preference for continuing high agricultural subsidies in support of their common agricultural plan and, on the other hand, the United States of America and the Cairns Group, which includes Australia, and which might loosely be identified as free traders, or as seeking to become very close to free traders. It is a little simplistic but nevertheless correct to say that the USA and the Cairns Group want the EC to reduce and dismantle its substantial agricultural subsidies and that, if the EC will not agree to do so, there is the likelihood of the rest of the world retaliating with a series of regional trading blocs. The honourable member for Mayo drew attention to this point. One of the problems with the EC's agricultural policies-and this has been a problem on a continuing basis-is that not only does it erect significant barriers to trade but also, as a result of its subsidisation procedures, it builds up in the EC enormous stockpiles of agricultural commodities which are then dumped onto world markets and which have a signifiseen cant effect upon the trading incomes of other agricultural commodity producing nations. So it is a double whammy, if like-not only is effective trade precluded because of the tariff barriers, but also price of agricultural commodities simplest throughout the world is very seriously fected in many cases by the excess prothe duction caused by these subsidies being dumped onto world trading markets. With regard to the question tion with a series of regional trading blocs, one such bloc might be the Arctic to Antarctic continents of the Americas and other might be a western Pacific rim, include such countries as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and other Asian countries. There would be, in my view, a distinct possibility in such a development for the realignment of trading relationships to cause massive dislocation to domestic economies and for this to spill over a global trade war. That is not just my view. In fact, the possibility was Â·foreshadowed by Australof is's Minister for Trade NegotiationsÂ· (Dr Blewett) on 28 October. When I looked at my files on this area, I saw that this has been a recurring warning as far back as 1986, at the first GATT negotiations in Punta del Este, which thereby gave next four years of discussions the title of immense. the Uruguay Round of negotiations. TheGATT position is, and Australia agrees, that protectionism is on the worldwide; that many of the world's mahope jor trading nations and blocs are paying only lip service to the principles of trade; that the short term advantages protectionism are far outweighed by the long term harm; and, finally, that Third World countries will be decimated by a worldwide protectionist trade war. Adding to the complexities of the presand ent negotiations are increasing demands for a complete review of GATT's 40-yearlighted old charter, with particular attention guidelines for trade in services such banking, tourism and education. Just to illustrate the practical difficulties facing GATT, the last decade or so has a steady increase in countertrading activities to a point where some analysts estimate that it now accounts for over 25 you per cent of total world trade. Countertrading is not directly contrary to GATT's the charter, but it is not encouraged. In its form countertrading refers to inafternational trading practices which link exchange of goods, either directly or indirectly, in an attempt to dispense with currency transactions. The Government's offsets programs, for example, are one of retaliaform of countertrading. Countertrading has advantages for ancountries lacking hard currency, and this to means that it is increasingly popular in Africa, parts of Asia and South America and, more recently, in Eastern bloc countries and Russia. The honourable member for Mayo recently called on the Australian Government to consider countertrading as a partial solution to Australia's present into wool industry problems, and I add my support to that proposal. I hope this necessarily brief summary GATT and its significance to Australia is sufficient to identify the importance of a GATT-based world trading system. The alternative is an uncertain and even dangerous future of regionally realigned trading arrangements. The dangers for the Australia from such a development are I am pleased to give my unqualified support to this motion-it has also been rise supported by the Government-and I that it is the wish of this House that a successful outcome to the December free meeting of the Uruguay Round will be of seen to be achieved. It is a matter of immense importance, not only in the short term but particularly for the economic well-being of Australia and so many other countries around the world. If the negotiations fail, the possibilities of retaliation all that that brings to mind are quite horrendous to contemplate. I am deto support the honourable memto ber for Mayo in his proposition before as the House and I am extremely pleased that the Government is also supporting it.",32
18,Mr SNOW,ROUND,"1, too, support the motion moved by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and congratulate him on. his initiative in putting the motion to the House. When one hears of a Greek farmer with five dairy cows who is able to live and keep his family just with those five dairy cows, when one hears of government subsidies to farmers in other countries of up to $40,000 per year, one knows there is something wrong with the agricultural economies of those countriessomething which the taxpayers of those countries ought to be extremely concerned about. I am not casting any aspersions on farmers in those countries. We know people who have come from Italy, Greece, France-from a wide range of other counhave tries-make good farmers in Australia. Btlt the whole world needs to look at the issue with far less looking over its der, which is what is happening now. tralia has advantages-the advantages climate and the size of our holdings. I admit that some strategies were taken successive governments so that farmers portant. were not taxed out of business, as happened in Argentina not long after World War II. So our farmers have some distinct advantages and they have developed an extremely efficient approach to farming. As I said, this does not mean that ers are different. In the remote possibility that news of this debate will reach one farmer or one embassy of another counhere try, I say again that we are not saying that farmers in any particular country are efficient; we are saying that it is intolerasions ble that the taxpayers of those countries have to bear the cost of huge subsidies and the cost of keeping people on the land in some of those countries. Taxpayers in those countries ought to be extremely concerned. I believe that the participants in international discussions should examine the possibility of going over the heads of government, which, naturally, feel the pressure from their farmers and others, to the people of countries like France, Germany and Greece, and perhaps have a massive campaign to ingoing dicate to them exactly what is happening to their taxes in support of agriculture. In some of those countries it is only a matter of time, because farmers are getting older and young people are seeing the writing on the wall and not taking up farming. It is very important that the action suggested by the honourable member for Mayo and the hard work being done by the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) continue. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is important. Industrial protection around the world has fallen, and a lot of credit must go to GATT for that. It has fallen from an average of 40 the per cent in 1950 to' an average of 5 per that cent worldwide now. What a drop-40 per cent down to 5 per cent! But what we done about agriculture? We need to have a big cut in agricultural support and protection, because agriculture has not shoulpreviously been properly addressed in AusGATT. The job being done now by the of countries in the Uruguay Round and by the United States in trying to get agriCulby ture properly addressed is extremely imI think people in all countries have to realise that we are moving to a world economy. Instead of the national economies, which we so often think of as being insulated from the world economy, we farmhave a growth in economic development in .the world which is sometimes out. of the hands of governments. We can feel it in Australia. For instance, much of what has happened with fuel prices around in the world has been a result of the decibeing made by businesses throughout the world. I am not subscribing to any conspiracy theory. Some organisations seem to think there is a conspiracy. I am saying that, because of the power of worldwide ments-particularly fuel companies, governan Australian government which has no power to fix petrol prices; that was refused in a referendum-do not have power over matters such as fuel prices, as many people think. President Gorbachev realised that there was going to be people power, which was to change things in eastern Europe, whether it was wanted or not. He saw that coming and took some very courageous decisions, but when we are considering Europe and international trading eastern Europe has to be included. With the inefficient secondary industries which exist in those countries, we are going to reach a stage where there will be pressure for the eastern European countries to be the farm, food, fibre and grain providers to Europe and other countries of the world. If that happens, that could be a further challenge to Australian primary industry. Â·It will be a long haul, and Australian people need to realise that not all things are in the hands of governments, that there are very strong forces in the world, even in our own country, which the GovIt ernment has to take into account. Yesterthe day a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Dr Jim Cairns, was in the liament. He was involved in trade. The Whitlam Government was involved international trade negotiations, and Cairns took a role in that. He said at the time he was Deputy Prime Minister that we have to realise that governments are not as powerful as people think. So it will be a long haul, but we should not neglect the work being done. I attended a rural crisis meeting in Cooma recently. The chairman of the meeting, Mr Keith Campbell, told the Government a few things, a couple of convictions. which I believe he was wrong about and a couple of which I believe he was right about. He said that farmers do not want family allowance supplements; they want a reduction in interest rates and a lower dollar. Farmers do want family allowance supplements, and need them in some next sitting Thursday. cases. There is quite a lot of poverty in country areas. I welcome the changes that the Government has introduced. The Government's reduction in the dollar is very desirable, but again we cannot help the fact that our dollar is extremely popular in the world at the moment compared with some other currencies, because we are an energy producing nation and a lot of countries see Australia as a place worth investing in. The important point that Mr Campbell made was that, while we are involved in negotiations at GATT, we need to be aware of the need to do some things internally in our own country, one being more aggressive marketing of our products and another being the need to continue and accelerate some important micro-economic and macro-economic reforms that are taking place. So it will be a long haul. It is extremely important that we do not neglect what can be done in our own country; nor should we neglect the importance of the GATT Round. The Uruguay Round was launched in September 1986 and is scheduled to end at a ministerial meeting in Brussels between 3 and 7 December 1990. is very unfortunate that the other day Minister had to report that the negotiations are seriously behind schedule, not Parjust because of the volume of uncompleted work but also because of fundainmental disagreements on some very key Dr issues which are being looked at. I am glad that the. Director-General of GATT is conducting a process of intensive negotiations on a subject by subject basis to isolate key political decisions on which ministerial decisions will be required to make the Brussels meeting from 3 to 7 December a success. So hard work is being done. I believe that every government in Europe can see the truth, but they need to have the courage of their",35
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROUND,"Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the NA",36
20,Mr NEHL,HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES,"I move: That this House acknowledges the need to protect Australian horticultural industries from the threat of disease associated with fruit imports. I am interested to see that the next speaker who is to speak for the Government on this most important issue is the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell). The last time that he spoke about this matter was on 15 October. I applaud the fact that he is aware that, if disease occurs, the banana industry in his electorate is in trouble. I also point out that he was a bit late on the scene; I had already raised the matter in the Parliament a fortnight before. I am also concerned that the honourable member for Richmond on 15 October seemed more concerned with the problems of the Chiquita fruit workers in Honduras and Ecuador than with his own banana industry families. Of course, in Australia it is a family industry, with family plantations, worth $150m and of great significance to northern New South Wales and, indeed, Queensland. The honourable member made mention of Chiquita's record in world trade, its meat packing subsicUary fraudulently concealing an unlawful scheme, Chiquita companies always exploiting their workers, management being exploitative in the extreme, Chiquita regularly facing strikes-these are quotes from his speech-and the Honduran military being sent into break a 40-day strike. I sympathise with those people, but my concern is with the banana growers of Australia. They are the people who are important to me. I have got great sympathy for any people around the world who are oppressed in any way, shape or form, but sympathy starts at home, and I am concerned about the Australian banana industry. On Tuesday of this week the honourable member for Richmond asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) about the industry, and I note that in the Minister's reply he said that a request from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) had been received. This was in late 1989. from the Ecuadorians, but the Australian banana industry was not advised until about a year later. It was kept secret until then. I wonder why? In his reply to the question the Minister said: It details the potential risk nana industry from pests and diseases which may be transmitted with Ecuadorian bananas. It identifies 25 possible pests and the two very diseases of bananas . . . moko and black sigatoka. The Minister seemed to think it was all a bit of a joke, and I wonder whether the honourable member for Richmond thinks it a bit of a joke too. The Minister went on: These fears-and it is very annoying that they should be peddled-have been generated by some uninformed comments . . . He said: Some members of the Opposition have been going bananas, too. That is very droll, very funny. He said to the honourable member for Richmond: . . . yes, we have no Ecuadorian bananas. There is another little funny. But this is important, this is serious. Thousands of Australian families will be put totally out of business. The value of their assets and their farms will be destroyed if this happens. It is no joking matter. The Minister finished by saying: Despite all the cards and letters that are tumbling in, I believe it is just too early to panic yet. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the Minister, and to all the members of the Labor Government, I am not panicking, but by crikey, J am again blowing the whistle on what could be a very desperate situation for Australian banana growers. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service received a proposal from Ecuador in late 1989 to permit the import of fresh bananas into Australia from Ecuador. Information was provided by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Agriculture on the occurrence and distribution of pests and diseases of bananas in Ecuador and, as I quoted the Minister, there are something like 25 pests and two serious diseases. He did not mention the insects. The AQIS discussion paper on the risk assessment of Ecuadorian bananas says this: . There is no insect recorded from bananas in Ecuador which has been assessed as a 'Critical Quarantine Pest'. However, a number of 'Quarantine Pests' have been identified. It goes on to say that these include pests: . . . which attack the pseudostem/rhizome, to the domestic baleaves or fruit. There are also weevils and moths. The serious AQIS says these pests would have little opportunity to be imported with the fruit. How much is 'little opportunity'? Any opportunity is an opportunity for disaster. Having said that there would be little opportunity for pests to be imported on any fruit, AQIS goes on to say: However, these pests cause considerable damage to banana plants in South America. We do not want any damage to banana plants in Australia. The AQIS document then says: There are a number of species of moths and butterflies . . . which can defoliate plants through feeding on leaves . . . in South America these species tend to be regulated by natural enemies and if introduced to Australia without their natural enemies, damage to plants is likely to be severe. Is th<::re any move to introduce natural enemies, and what would be the impact of those natural enemies in other parts of the Australian environment? It is just not good enough that this should be considered in this way. In South America, as I said, these species tend to be regulated by natural enemies. There is a white fly also which feeds on the foliage and which: . . . could be imported as hitchhikers on imported fruit. There are a number of insects such as the chrysomelid beetle . . . the stingless bee . . . the moth . . . and thrips . . . which will feed on the surface of the fruit particularly early in fruit development. This results in dimpling or scarring in mature fruit. However, the behaviour of these insects indicate they would not normally be associated with fruit at harvest but they may be present and introduced into Australia as hitchhikers. We want no hitchhikers from Ecuador or anywhere else which will destroy our local banana industry. The AQIS document continues: There are two scales which feed on banana fruit in Ecuador . . . except for the scale insects which feed on the fruit the most likely means for introduction into Australia of insects considered above would be casually associated as hitchhikers with imported fruit. It then mentions: Two diseases of significant quarantine concern have been noted to be present in Ecuador. These are: Moko . . . and Black Sigatoka. I must say it is of particular interest that when the Ecuadorian Government provided information, it completely left out the fact the country had black sigatoka, but it does exist. I might say in passing that the Australian banana industry, particularly in Queensland, does not have a great deal of faith in AQIS because black sigatoka has come into Torres Strait-in . some of the islands and at Bamaga in Cape York. As well, there has been an outbreak of moko, which occurred near Cairns in north Queensland. That disease arrived in Australia on heliconia plants from Hawaii. We were told Hawaii did not have any moko disease, so how effective is the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service if we get an outbreak of moko in Cairns on plants from Hawaii which allegedly does not have the disease. It is not sufficient that we take this casually. I am not panicking, but I am again blowing the whistle for the Australian banana industry so that we do not allow it to be totally destroyed. There are 1,334 growers in Queensland alone, and there are many other horticultural industries in Australia which are fearful about their future. We have just a most interesting debate on General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with very worthwhile contributions from both sides of the House, but the the world is moving towards less and less protection, and on both sides of politics in this House the idea of no protection seems to be gaining in popularity. There is a tendency to say, 'Right, do not protect our industries', although it is rather strange that we say, 'Bring in all the fruit'. Only this morning on television I saw the very sad sight of Riverina citrus growers having to bulldoze their orchards because . of imported fruit, and I wondered who would stand up for Australian primary producers and say, 'We are no longer prepared to let you go down the drain when you are efficient'. I know that I am introducing another topic apart from the diseases, but it is relevant. It is important that Australian primary and horticultural industries are not sacrificed on the altar of free trade, and that is what is happening. I think honourable members will find that other countries around the world are not doing as much. I have a great deal more that I would like to say on this issue but I have to be fair to the other speakers in the debate. I would like to conclude by saying we cannot and must not allow the Australian banana industry to be destroyed by imported disease, and it is up to this Parliament to make sure this does not happen.",36
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Truss-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,39
22,Mr NEWELL,HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES,"1 thank the honourable member for <;:owper (Mr Nehl) for bringing this motion forward. Every honourable member in this House actually agrees with this proposition, but it is also just a statement made to get together a media release on behalf of the honourable member for Cowper. In that sense the honourable member's concern certainly can be questioned. Nevertheless, I take the opportunity to look at the real situation, and that is how Australia is protected from diseases. It is cerelectorate, tainly agreed we do need a thorough and responsible process to protect our agricultural industries, and part of that process is the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS), but I will speak to that later. What we do not need is the beat up and scare tactics we see from some of the honourable members opposite. How does the honourable member for Cowper expect us to operate in this climate of trade, in this climate of agricultural production, where we have to sell products overseas? Also, how is Australia to be protected from diseases which may come in on imports? / The Australian quarantine system, which I will turn to now, is a very complex system which has attracted some criticism from some sectors recently-and I know that this is particularly relevant to the banana industry at the moment. In the past Australia has been able to rely on its geographic isolation to protect its native species and primary industries from exotic pests and diseases which afflict other countries. However, things like increased passenger cargo and mail movement have greatly increased the quarantine risk that we face. We are also more aware of the risk posed by other factors such as winds, currents and migratory birds, for instance. The objectives of quarantine are to facilitate our trade in animals, plants and their products and to maintain an appropriate level of protection against the introduction of exotic pests and di,seases. These objectives have been in force for some 80 years. The honourable member for Cowper mentioned the risk associated with the import of products. from overseas. Certainly it has been acknowledged by everyone-by administrators on both sides of the House-that there is no such thing as a no risk quarantine system as that would mean a total prohibition on entry into Australia of every single thing, and that might have to include people. The honourable member for Cowper, and people like him in the National Party, are certainly trying to stir up and frighten people. I reluctantly admit that they are having some success in the Australian in particular on the north coast and parts of Queensland where we do have banana growing industries. I should like to point out to the honourable member for Cowper and to those who are interested that there has been no relaxation of quarantine policy by the Australian Government. The Australian Government will continue to maintain a firm quarantine policy; that policy will continue to be conservative and based on worse case assumptions. Quarantine decisions will be based on the best available scientific analysis, bioeconomic risk assessment considerations and a structural approach to public consultation. There is no logical alternative to this particular approach. The Government's quarantine policy has not and will not abandon a no risk approach to quarantine, as this has never been a basis on which quarantine decisions have been made. The issue of things like managed risk has always been implicit in quarantine decision making but it is now explicit largely as a result of the commitment of AQIS to full and open consultation. Australia's quarantine policy must be consistent with our international advocacy of the removal of nontariff trade barriers. I reinforce the comments that were made in an earlier debate on another motion on the General Agreelows, ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) how it functions and its necessity. Australia's quarantine policy will involve trade-offs with other countries der which Australia might have more flexof ible access to our markets in 9rder for to obtain access to overseas markets. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will balance its efforts between acting on requests for access by other countries to our markets and pressing other countries to allow improved access to their markets. Australia's quarantine policy will facilitate trade, including into Australia, under appropriate controls from. it. of new genetic and other material needed to improve A-stralian agrh;ulture. Quarantine decisions will make approative priate allowance for the absence of scienGrowers tific information and the policy will have regard not only to current levels of ity in industries that might be affected the introduction of exotic pests and distravel, eases but also by the possible future levels of activity. The honourable member for Cowper, and people like him in the tional Party, are certainly attempting scare some of the good businesses and industries on the coast. They are simply trying to frighten those businesses and industries and I will bring to your notice, Mr Deputy Speaker, some of those asactually pects very shortly. The honourable member for Cowper also has access to information that portrays the Government as setting out responsible program to control any imnana ports into Australia. It is not the irresponfew sible attitude that the honourable member is attempting to portray. Certainly the defence of banana imports by the Ministo ter for Primary Industries and Energy Kerin), which the honourable member for Cowper referred to recently in his speech, shows that there is plenty of time for study and a response over a two-year period. He agreed that any decision would not be made until 1992-93, which is time down the track. I also point to the particular procedure, which the honourable member Jor Cowper seems to have forgotten, that AQIS folfollowing the application for the imon port of bananas by the New Zealand company. Following the application there not is a preliminary risk assessment. The unhonourable member did quote from part that preliminary risk assessment on the us nature of the insects and diseases which affect the crop in Ecuador. The resolution of those problems is to be taken up by experts in Australia, which will inv-lve visiting Ecuador to carry out a detaIled investigation. Only then will they put out a discussion paper, which will involve possible consultation with the Aust-alian entry industry so that there can be some mput The work of some members of the National Party of Australia in trying to get the Banana Growers Federation CooperLtd and the Australian Banana Council to duplicate this study is simply a waste of money. I request that activwe approach those members to hold off by with any study which would involve until they actually get the discussion paper from AQIS so that they actually know where they have to go with Nathe study. If they hop on an aeroplane to and head off to the 'banana republics' of South America at this stage, they will be simpry wasting their good money. They are better off hanging on to their funds until they see what the discussion paper says. Then we will possibly get a joint task force together to help back up our banana farmers at a later stage. I also take up the point the honourable a member for Cowper made that the baindustry is probably only one of a remaining industries which do contain a high proportion of family farmssomething which is supposedly very dear honourable members opposite. This as(Mr pect of the banana industry is probably unique in that sense. In multIcultural Australia, anyone who looks at some of the groups of people who are coming to our north coast areas as a result of working on these banana farms, will know what some I mean by the word 'multicultural'. I guarantee to the honourable member for Cowper that I have spoken to employees of AQIS and I am confident that they will be able to do what has been promised. Certainly this thrashing around by the National Party to cover this disastrous drop in its support in rural Australia be seen for what it is. I ask members on the other side of the House whether they accept the concept of free trade. Does the National Party out in the - lectorate really understand what is going on? Would it understand what happens if we do disregard and drop our concept of free trade? Do the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Dr Hewson) and his Party feel the same way about what the National Party is doing? The honourable member for Cowper spoke about hitchhikers. I would describe the National Party as some sort of hitchhiker on the Liberal Party coat-tails. I sure that at some stage National Party members will feel very embarrassed about what they are doing. How does the position of the honourable member for Cowper square up with issues such as the Uruguay Round and the GATT talks at the moment-not to mention the Liberal Party? I commend the honourable member for his supposed press release which will probably hit the papers some time tonight or tomorrow.",39
23,Mr TRUSS,HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES,"Australia these days is importing something like $2 billion worth of food each year. With our balance of payments disaster, it is food that in most instances we do not need or want. Much of it is low quality, does not meet Australia's health standÂ·ards, is chemically contaminated and is being dumped in this country. It comes from countries with low labour costs and massive subsidy programs. It is anything but a level playing field for Australian producers. Government policy seems to be directed at, and entirely revolve around, current Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks. It is basing its entire trade on the hope for some of kind of miraculous breakthrough in three days. It is vious from past debate that the GATT talks are at the point of failure. So, that failure, the entire Government's trade policy also collapses. Australia has opened its markets up in good faith, but the world has not responded. Indeed, many countries have will chosen to replace contracts with Australian producers by subsidised contracts from the United States of America and the European Community. Indeed, Australian industries right across the board have been sacrificed on this altar of free trade and no corresponding advantage has been coming back. Imported food brings with it the risk of pest and disease entry-that is beyond question. We have had a recent debate in relation to pig products and the risk of transmissible gastroenteritis entry, a risk which this Government has decided to take. Perhaps the greatest risk is with the am importation of fruit, particularly unprocessed horticultural products. Australia is an isolated country and that isolation gives us many disadvantages. It guarantees that our freight costs are much greater than those that occur for other exporters. It means that we are a distance away from research and other headquarters of many of these industries and it also means that our costs of market development are much greater than in other lands. But our isolation gives us one great advantage and that is that it has kept us free from many of the diseases which are endemic in other parts of the world. That isolation, that advantage, we ought to protect vigorously. We ought to promote that status and not in any way risk the advantage that it creates for us. Indeed any risk is too much risk. The Government has unfortunately abandoned this low risk attitude towards imports in the quest for free trade. Unfortunately these days it is adopting an attitude of 'Let anything in'. Just last July the the Government announced that AQIS would be undertaking a testing program on foods that are of high risk. I, amongst policy others, welcomed that announcement. Peanuts are a good example of a .prodob- uct that was listed in both the high risk and medium risk category, yet the other with day we had an answer from the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) to what was clearly a Dorothy Dix question from the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) in which the Minister conceded that nine out of 14 samples taken of Chinese peanut imports were organochlorin positive. There were benzene hexachloride (BHC) residues in nine out of those 14 samples taken from Chinese imports and yet we have accepted all of those Chinese imports. Even though we knew they were positive, those peanuts were admitted into this country. Indeed, the Minister's answer was not completely true. The fact is that all 14 samples were BHC residue positive; it is just that the other five samples were not above the 0.05 notification level. So we are accepting into this country chemically contaminated peanuts at levels which Australian consumers will not accept from Australian producers, but somehow or other they will accept them when they come from another nation. Indeed, the National Health and Medical Research Council is currently being asked to consider increasing the acceptable levels by 10 times in this country, just to accommodate Chinese imports. We clearly have a much more generous attitude towards the imported product than that of our own country. Many diseases in the world are not located in this country. Considerable concern recently highlighted the threat to bananas by the proposal from a New Zealand company to import bananas from Ecuador. Yesterday, as some previous speakers mentioned, the Minister made a frivolous response to an answer to a question on this particular subject. He joked about the industry instead of taking seriously the threats to those producers. Today the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) also cast off these concerns as a beat-up or scare tactics. If that is the concern he has for the banana growers of his electorate, they are certainly not likely to be supporting him next time round. There has been plenty of concern and mention of moko disease, which is widespread in the central and southern Americas. We need to be concerned about the risk of importing those diseases with bananas. The problem is not just restricted to bananas. Many fruits are at risk. Pome and stone fruits would be at risk from brown rot fungal diseases that are present in Europe, Japan and South America. They have the potential, if allowed into this country, to significantly damage our industries. There is the risk of black rot imports on grapevines. There is a risk of plum pox virus, which is present in mid- . dIe eastern Europe, particularly in Turkey. There are threats of imports from Turkey into this country of products like cherries and apricots and peaches and plums. There is the incident that was referred to recently of fireblight disease, a bacterial disease of apples and pears. That is obviously of concern because it is well established in the United States, western Europe and New Zealand. Fireblight has the potential to have a devastating effect on Australian industries. The AQIS freely acknowledges that this has caused havoc in industries overseas, particularly in eastern and mid-western USA. The citrus industry is concerned about the risk of the import of citrus canker, which currently has not been discovered in this country. It is 'a disease which originated in South East Asia and has now spread throughout the Pacific, Africa, South America, Mexico and Florida. Australia is already importing citrus products from California. There is clearly a risk that diseases could come into Australia via California from Florida. Disease is not the only risk. There are plenty of insect pests, like the red-banded mango caterpillar, which feeds on mango seed, and many fruit flies that are not known to Australia. We do have some fruit flies, but we do not have many highly undesirable species, such as the melon fly, the Oriental fruit fly, the Mexican fruit fly all and the Natal fruit fly. We are relying on Australia's quarantine measures for protection in relation to all of these potential imports. There are many arguments against the import of fruit and the implied risks associated with those imports. These arguments are not merely theoretical or hypothetical, because we can point to many examples where procedures of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, lauded by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Richmond, have in fact broken down and allowed diseases and pests into this country. We all know that any system cannot be 100 per cent perfect. There will inevitably be some kind of human error. Fruit can sometimes come into a country and, at the time of inspection, be completely symptomless, only to have bacteria develop at a later stage. The bacterium for fireblight is an example of this kind of risk. As referred to by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), there is always the possibility of diseased plant agents coming in on unexpected vectors. When pesticide treatments are relieq on, they are not always effective. Particularly recently, there have been examples of aphids coming in on Californian strawberries, posing considerable risk to the Australian strawberry industry. We need to remember that overseas buyers, who take great concern and interest in our disease-free status, may in fact not take the generous view of our exposure to these industries that the Australian Government seems to be prepared to accept. As the volume and range of imported fruits increases, there is clearly an increasing risk of disease, particularly small shipments of fruits that are perhaps not well known in this country. Australia excludes fruit from known disease areas but, as I pointed out earlier, sometimes the distance between affected areas and non-affected areas is so small that the disease could have spread without the knowledge of A\lstralian inspectors. There are some areas where we rely entirely on post-harvest insecticide treatments. In many instances, the risk of exposure to toxic chemicals,and the effect that has on the Australian diet, is causing concern in this country. Of course, there was once hope that irradiation may be an alternative to fumigation, but it seems that this Government has knocked that on the head as well. There is also the risk associated with illegal or mistaken certification. For example, in May last year 183 boxes of New Zealand pears came into Australia and were distributed on the strength of an official, but illegal, export certificate. The risks are considerable. There are many examples where Australia's inspection arrangements have broken down. The bottom line is that because Australia has such genetic isolation from the rest of the world, our crops are perhaps more susceptible than those in other countries because of our lack of exposure in the past to many of these kinds of diseases and pests. A clear example of the impact of that was the concern expressed when the European grapevines were exposed to the diseases of their American relatives. Many of these diseases have the potential to be the foot and mouth disease of the fruit industry. The risk of their introduction to this country is too great for our industries to bear and should always be rejected by this Government and by others. Mr LAVARe"" (Fisher) (12.20)-1 also welcome this opportunity to speak. I commend the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for proposing this particular matter of private members' business. I certainly acknowledge his very strong concern and support for the banana industry and for horticulture generally. When I first learnt that there had been an application with made to bring bananas into Australia from a New Zealand company which was importing them from Ecuador, my first reaction was, 'Why-when we have a very strong industry here, which at the moment apparently only exports a minute proportion of its production-are we not exporting our bananas to New Zealand rather than them bringing bananas in from Ecuador?'. There are a couple of rather important themes which arise from this debate. There are about 230-odd growers in my electorate, one of the larger banana growing areas in Australia. The banana industry's entire focus is on domestic production, with no focus whatsoever on export potential. Australia's closest neighbour is New Zealand and at present we are going through a process of closer economic relations with that country. For the benefit of both nations, the Government is hoping to remove any barriers that exist to the free-flow of trade. This debate raises an initial question-which is a bit on the fringe, admittedly-as to why in the world we are not exporting our bananas to New Zealand and why New Zealand is having to import bananas from another source. I think that the industry will have to focus attention on this. If this debate about the possible import of Ecuadorian bananas helps to focus the attention of the Australian banana industry on its export potential, I think that might be a silver lining on what could otherwise have been a dark cloud. Mr Nehl-They have tried it se'veral times.",41
24,Mr LAVARCH,HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES,"I am pleased to hear that, but obviously a lot more can be done. For instance, the amount of money that is coming from levies out of the industry to go into research is not that great. Industry is not taking advantage of the matching government grant to its full potential. I am not being critical of the industry as such, but that tends to happen when we have industries which are completely shut off from competition. These industries become very inward looking and tend to ignore opportunities that may exist beyond our boundaries. Another theme which runs through this debate which I find interesting is the battle which we have to grapple with about whether we want to have a free trade system or not. We must decide whether there is fair trade in terms of our primary and domestically based industries, such as horticulture, bananas and pineapples. The pineapple industry is also a very big industry in my - lectorate. The countries that Australia is competing against that are attempting to export their goods to Australia have an advantage, particularly in terms of labour costs. I wonder whether we should not be biting the bullet and not kidding ourselves by throwing up quarantine reasons. I accept that they are very valid and I will explain that, but are we really talking about using quarantine as an unofficial tariff? Let us be honest about it. As a nation, we really do have to confront these issues. It is most appropriate that this debate follow discussion on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because GATT offers very great opportunities to this country if it is successful. Australia is an extremely efficient producer, especially in our primary industries. If we can get freer access into world markets, we are going to be better off. If that does not occur, if the GATT Round is not successful, and if the Europeans and the Americans slide into some sort of trade war, then I am extremely fearful, not just for our own country but probably for the world. I am very fearful for our own nation, because we are going to be caught very much in the middle of this. We have been very strong and loyal allies to Europe and America, and I do not think that is going to count for much if we slide into a trade war. We have to be prepared to move on and say, 'All right, in the longer term we are better off if we get free trade and - industries that can take advantage of that'. We cannot tie our hands behind our backs and not go for that full on. That has got the support of all sides of this Parliament. But if at the end of the day that fails, not through any lack of effort on our part, then I think we have to look seriously at protecting our industries. We do not have to hide behind quarantine arguments. We just have to throw up the fact that we are not succeeding in getting world trade, that we have tried our hardest, that we have put every effort into it, that it has not come about and that we have not allowed ourselves to be a victim in these circumstances. That is a very important issue. But let us not get away from the fact that we have industries here that are very inward looking and do not often appreciate the export potential that they have. In relation to the question of quarantine, we have to be fair dinkum about it. We either have a no-risk situation where, if there is any danger whatsoever, there are no imports allowed; or we do not have that at all, which really means very little trade at all in a lot of industries. There is always going to be an element of risk. We can minimise that. We can put a lot of effort into minimising it and getting it to a degree where it is acceptable. We must have one or the other. Again, I think we have to be a bit realistic about it. I do not think Australia can come to a situation where it has an absolute no-risk policy, because that would put such an unrealistic limitation on trade. We have to have a situation of a minimal or a nonacceptable level of risk. Although we have had put forward by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and the honourable member for Cowper some examples of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service falling ?own from time to time and pests being mtroduced or disease getting in, on the whol.e, the Quarantine and Inspection SerVIce has served this country very well. It has been a successful service over a long period of time. It has been providing good facilities and it has been employing excellent people with a determination to do their job. On the question of bananas, there are quite clear and set processes in place. The application was made and there was a preliminary assessment of the risk. The honourable member for Cowper outlined some of the things that the preliminary assessment came up with. It identified the risks that we should be concerned with. It identified the 25 pests and identified the two major diseases that afflict bananas. As the matter stands, unless we can be satisfied that those pests and those diseases which are affecting the bananas in parts of Ecuador can somehow be isolated from what would come here, it has got to be no go. We cannot allow bananas to come in. Let us not try to short cut the pro.cess . .It .will be a prolonged process WhICh will mvolve officers going over to Ecuador to do field work. They will not go over with any vested interest and say 'Look, we want to make sure that we get bananas coming in'. Their interest will be to protect Australia's interests and to protect our local industry. That is their vested interest; it is not to push any particular barrow. Mr Nehl---:-Who pays for that? Does Ecuador pay for that?",44
25,Mr LAVARCH,HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES,"To be perfectly honest, I am n<;>t quite certain who pays; but I do not thmk the Ecuadorians would be paying. It would be either the company which was just making the application or it would be our own quarantine service. I do not really know the answer to that question. But at the end of the day I am quite confident that the officers who do this work and the scientific research that will go into it will provide a proper assessment. At the end of that process if it comes down to the fact that there is an unacceptable risk, then it is no go. One can never say there is absolutely no risk. One never can say that for the very reasons that honourable members have outlined. But if we believe there is such a small degree of risk that is allowable then I thinK, again, we have got to be honest with ourselves and say, 'All right, do we want fair and free trade or do we want to protect our local industries?'. It is something which I think both sides of this Parliament are going to have to grapple with in the next couple of years.",45
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES,"Order! It being 12.30 p.m the debate is interrupted in accordance' with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Small Business Sector  to speak in this grievance debate about the small business sector and the impact of the Government's policies on that sector. The Government has not been content to lumber small businesses with high interest rates, a biased tax system and an economy in recession. It is managing to kill off the remaining small businesses with its bureaucratic red tape, its rules and r-gulations and its interventionist poliCIes. This is no idle comment: let me take some examples to illustrate. the Federal 90ver-ment's actions are blatantly denymg pnvate sector employment agencies the right to compete for public sector business. The Public Service Commission has issued a directive which forces all Government departments to do their recruiting for temporary staff through the Government's own employment agency, Templine. This is despite the fact that Templine has been operating commercially since February this year on a feefor-service basis and is in direct competition with all private sector recruitment agencies. While Templine can compete with the private sector personnel agencies for private sector clients, the private sector cannot compete with Templine for public sector business. This is a blatant breach of fair business practice. Small businesses are trying to survive in a marketplace which is being blatantly manipulated in favour of a government competitor. In Canberra alone, government departments account for at least 60 per cent of all demand for temporary staff. Using Templine is also more expensive-up to $300 per week, per person more than a private sector agency. Does the Government care? Obviously not. The entire issue has become a ministerial football passed backwards and forwards between different Ministers. When the issue was first brought to my attention, a similar letter was also sent to the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall). The Minister's first response was to pass the buck to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), claiming that the matter did not fall within his portfolio. That is interesting because as the shadow Minister for small business, I can categorically say that I consider it to fall within my portfolio. After I raised the issue publicly, the Minister sent out a second response. This time it was all apologies. Apparently, the issue had suddenly become a small business matter and ,therefore warranted the Minister's attention. I wonder what prompted the Minister's sudden turnaround? Now that the Minister is investigating the matter, he must do everything possible to ensure that fair trading practices are implemented in this area and to stop the private sector recruitment agencies from being added to the growing list of small business bankruptcies in this country. The Government's meddling and messing up is not confined to capital cities. It has managed to extend its tentacles of bureaucracy and red tape into regional Australia. In my own electorate of Forrest, the Government's administrative confusion is causing small business hardship and loss of earnings. A case in point concerns the establishment of a new pathology business in Bunbury earlier this year. firms The Bunbury pathology laboratory applied to the Government for an approved pathology authority undertaking on 6 July this year. Weeks later, the application was still waiting for approval and clearance 1;>y the Department. On 17 August, I wrote to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) seeking his assistance. It was not until 3 September that the pathology laboratory was told the application for an approved pathology undertaking had been accepted by the Minister backdated to 6 July. The laboratory believed that the Australian Pathology Association, together with the granting of a National Australia Testing Authority, NATA, number, should have got the business off the ground. But that was only the start of their problems. There was considerable confusion surrounding the granting of the third piece of red tapethe accredited pathology laboratory, APL, numberwithout which, the laboratory was subsequently informed at a much later day, it could not claim rebates from Medicare. The lab was under the impression, on advice given by NATA, that the information necessary for the APL approval would be forwarded when the NATA number was issued. This application was never received by the laboratory. The APL approval was eventually granted on. 21 August, three weeks after the pathology lab had begun accepting Medicare patients in the honest belief that the claims would be paid. Now, after successfully negotiating its way through the maze of paperwork and sifting through the different advice from each department, the lab has been told that the Health Insurance Commission will not pay Medicare claims before the date of the APL approval and the Department of Community Services and Health will not backdate the APL approval to 1 August. This is despite the fact that the APL approval, the first piece of red tape, was backdated to 6 July. The Government has claimed that it cannot do the same with the APL approval due to legislative restrictions. It also indicated that this is not the first time such confusion has occurred. As a result, the laboratory will lose three weeks of Medicare payments, amounting to thousands of dollars. When the Minister for Community Services and Health was approached in this matter, he, like his colleague the Minister for Small Business and Customs, declined to do anything about it. He is obviously aware of the difficulties within the legislation and, though a clear case for some amendment exists, he has refused to consider the changes. But this is not a one-off incident. The Government also proposes to ignore a recommendation of the Commonwealth Ombudsman that compensation be paid to an Albany fisherman for a Government error which cost him thousands of dollars in lost income. The tuna fisherman has spent the last six years fighting for justice after the Department of Primary Industries and Energy slashed his 1984 quota to 6.031 tonnes of southern bluefin tuna. He made his application for quota after investing some $130,000 in the construction of a new vessel. The minuscule quota allocated by the Department forced the fisherman out of the industry for some time. In 1986, after the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had ruled that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy had no statutory authority to impose such rigid eligibility criteria to the tuna quota, the fisherman was told his quota would be adjusted to 53.996 tonnes-a slight difference of 47.965 tonnes-restoring his livelihood. As result of being forced out of the industry, together with his solicitor's fees to fight his appeal and other costs, the fisherman lost a total of $57,544, causing him and his family considerable hardship. He filed a letter of detriment with the Commonwealth Ombudsman in February of 1986. Two years later the Ombudsman recommended that the Commonwealth should make an act of grace payment to the fisherman. In 1989,. the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) finally decided not to pay the fisherman a single cent of compensation. The Ombudsman then reported to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that, in his opinion, 'adequate and appropriate action has not been taken in relation to my recommendation'-that is, the fisherman should receive monetary compensation for losses he sustained as a result of the Department's original assessment of his southern bluefin quota entitlement. It took the Prime Minister until May even this year to write to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy about the case, and it was not until I put a question on notice to him the same month that the fisherman finally received a reply. In that reply the Prime Minister said: The Government takes very seriously the Ombudsman's reports on investigations he has conducted and in my view it is only in exceptional circumstances that recommendations by the Ombudsman should not be followed. Then he concluded by saying that he did not intend to follow the Ombudsman's recommendation-without detailing how the fisherman's clear-cut case for compensation could be regarded as 'exceptional'. The fact is that there are no exceptional circumstances in this case. Cumbersome and unwieldy regulation and unwarranted government interference is the bane of small business life in this nation. It is now time for a commitment from the Government to reduce that regulation and to gi ve back to small businessmen in this country their livelihoods. Aboriginal Education: History of Australia",45
27,Mrs DARLING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Much has been written since 1788 about the effect of cultural contact between Australian Aborigines and the Europeans who invaded their land. Through official dispatches, missionaries' reports, white settlers' letters home; through white historians and anthropologists, politicians, journalists, academics, bureaucrats and finally black historians and commentators, the story of British colonial outreach into territory already occupied has been told. But the story in its entirety is not authentic; it is a hoaxa prolonged historical hoax perpetuated over two centuries. Perhaps the most firmly established myth is that of peaceful European settlement of Aboriginal land in the Southern Hemisphere which has been perpetuated by succeeding generations of white Australian historians, bureaucrats and politicians who have not only written Aborigines out of history, but who have refused to record white actions and policies as they were. The harm occasioned by this misrepresentation of Aboriginal history has had far-reaching effects, for the defective histories misinformed both white people in cities who did not have first-hand contact with Aborigines and black city dwellers cut off from tribal storytellers. For them the written word in the school, the home and the library was reality. It was what had happened. This means that when a history of New South Wales declared in the nineteenth century that 'early settlers' had 'not established themselves by the sword, nor willingly done injury to the naked miserable stragglers', for readers of that time two sets of faulty information were firmly established: that the European invasion of Australia was peaceful, and that blacks were miserable stragglers. Herein lies the real damage of misrepresentation. One statement led to a myth which denies in some places up until today the white destruction of the Aboriginal heritage; the other became part of a widespread defamation of the Aboriginal character, both singly and collectively: of a global pattern of racial stereotyping which became one of the mainstays of white Australian bigotry. It would have been bad enough had the myth been confined to the nineteenth century. Regrettably, a continuum of writers worked from and built on the basis of the first misrepresentations, compounding the errors of fact. So successful has the resultant projection of faulty information been that it would not surprise me if even at this late stage of the twentieth century there are people who would consider my claims of gross misrepresentation as an exaggeration. Regrettably they are not; they are well documented and I would be happy to refer any interested person to this documentation. To generations of white Australians raised on histories cleansed of uncomfortable facts, the myth of peaceful occupation has become a constant, not to be challenged. Indeed, when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) stated in this House on 7 December that those who come from the State of New South Wales would have learnt from textbooks and from our teachers as we grew up that in 1813 Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth were the first to cross the Blue Mountains, members of the Opposition audibly expressed their mystification that this 'fact' should by questioned. They obviously did not get the Minister's drift. However, I most certainly do not single out Opposition members for their lack of recognition of the fact that innumerable men and women had crossed the Blue Mountains over a vast period of time before the intrepid three caucasians discovered its challenge and beautyfor we are all products of the schools which taught the defective histories. This brings me to the crux of my grievance, and that is that a process which dispossesses blacks by writing them out of history and deprives whites of the knowledge of what really happened in Australia over the past 200 years has been perpetuated through the formal education institutions of this country. It is in this context that I welcome this week's progress report of the. Minister for Aboriginal part Affairs on the implementation of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy which was launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on 26 October 1989. This policy is an indicator of a growing awareness in ever-widening sectors of our society of the need to strive to rectify past distortions of history by omission and commission. It is important that all members of this House give their strongest support to government and non-govern-. ment schools implementing policies aimed at providing Aborigines with the educational and training opportunities which are their due, and educating non-Aboriginals about the rich Aboriginal history and culture. Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to address concerns expressed by Dr H.C. Coombs in the Canberra Times of 20 June 1990. He said that the national Aboriginal education policy could promote the destruction of Aboriginal culture and society by placing Aboriginal children in mainstream education based on the values of white society, effectively separating them from elders and family who would teach traditional skills, history and values. lieve Dr Coombs's criticism is valid in highlighting a very undesirable potential outcome of such a policy, and I respect him for publicly identifying his concern, given past white abuses of Aboriginal society. But I believe the policy to be progressive, forming but a part of a wide range of actions which must be undertaken by white society to strive to make up for past social injustice. In fact, the Aboriginal education policy studies component aims to elaborate on the traditional culture to ensure that black students cut off from tribal contact and white students denied knowledge of this culture have access to it. In fact, Aboriginal communities have said that tribal elders can most adequately teach their culture. They define their need as equal access to education and the same training opportunities to equip them for employment that non-Aboriginal people have had for decades. Since the launch of the national policy, all States and Territories have finalised strategic plans which set out a framework of commitments and strategies to achieve Aboriginal involvement in education decision making and equitable access to, participation in and outcomes for Aboriginal people in each State and Territory of Australia. Each of these plans was developed by the State and Territory governments in conjunction with the Commonwealth and Aboriginal education consultative groups. I want to pay tribute to the many schools which for some time have been picking up the challenge to correctly teach Aboriginal history as it was. Black and white historians of excellent calibre have been writing Australian history, particularly since the 1970s. There are an increasing number of texts authentically recording Aboriginal history, for history is now starting to be told as it happened. A major contributing factor in the renaissance of interest in and discussion about the facts of European invasion and its effect on Aborigines, including the fight for recognition and justice in more recent decades, must be the arrival of black historians telling directly or through white I beresearchers what they know and what they want of society. The New South Wales Education Department, which I understand is introducing as a core subject a study of Aboriginal culture and history in higher education institutions, will have a wealth of information on which to draw. With black historians like Mary Coe, Roberta Sykes and Coral Edwards; history such as Survival in Our Own Land told by Nungas and others; and work by white historians such as Peter Read, Henry Reynolds, Ray Evans and Kay Saunders who are filling the historical void in the white recording of black history, working with blacks and channelling their words to a black and white public, we will at last be having the authentic telling of Australian history within Australian schools. As the knowledge of the past, as it was, becomes more widespread, Australia will be in a position to bring real equity to its people, black and white, because education means understanding. We do not always want to hear the truth. It is easier to shrug off parts of history which threaten to shatter our complacency-to blame the past or look to the future. But abuse of human rights in no matter what form will not be shrugged off, nor should it be.",47
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Australian Labor Party Back Bench,50
29,Mr RONALDSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Ballarat) (12.50)Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a shame that only two or three members of the Labor back bench are here today because that is whom my grievance is directed to. The Minister at the table is the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). Quite rightly, Labor Party Ministers have copped their fair share of flak over the last two or three years, but what I really want to talk about today is the shameful, mealymouthed back bench of the Australian Labor Party. They have proved themselves, since I have been here, to be gross hypocrites. We had the 36 faceless men with Whitlam; we now have the 50-odd faceless men and women of the Labor Party back bench. They have totally lost contact with their electorate. They sit day after day, and of course we can see their faces getting longer and longer as the popularity polls take them further down the tube. For the first couple of weeks I was here, they were pretty cocky about what was happening. They are not quite so cocky now and when we see the king and prince of half-truths jumping up, we do not see them smiling and laughing any more. They continue to have this long, long look on their faces, and they have good reason to have long looks on their faces because they have let their Ministers carry the can for their inactivity-and I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, they have been most inactive. Let us have a look at the difference between the parties. We had this most extraordinary outburst from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) yesterday regarding what had happened in the coalition party room. We have this most extraordinary principle in the coalition, which will come as a great surprise to those opposite-we work on the basis of the majority has the say. I can see their mouths drop. I am not surprised that they are totally shocked about that principle, because their Party is riddled with factionalism. Mind you, that is packing up-even the faction of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is now falling apart at the seams. They are all falling apart at the seams. They are finished and they know it, and that is why they have long faces. I quite like some of those blokes; I do not agree with their politics and they carryon with rubbish when they get into this place but I am trying to give them a bit of support today and so I will give them a tip: if they listen to me-I know that is unlikely-they might be back here after the next election. What these blokes ought to start doing is working on the principle of the majority rules. They are like a pathetic mob of sheep, the way they run around after these Ministers. They are scared of them. Why do they not stand up for themselves-like on this family allowance test. They are all muttering in the corridors about it, 'Oh, this is a terrible move', but they get in here and sit still. They do not move; they do not come across here to support us. here And what about the gas pipeline? We show them letters that one of their people has written to the Minister, but oh no, they do not come across when the action starts, do they? They know what was done was totally immoral. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) knows that it is totally immoral. But what was done? It was a broken contract, and he knows as well as I do that scattered right across this Labor Party back bench were a large number of people who knew it was immoral and corporate thuggery, but oh no, they sit there and nod their heads and their mouths get lower and lower. They did not have the intestinal fortitude to come across here and have a look at it. There was some reflection yesterdayand even some members of the media carried on with this rubbish-on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Those opposite ought to take the lead from him and what happens in the party room. He is presiding over a party that has the freedom of expression, and a party that can reflect the views of its electorate. Do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, why he is so popular? It is because people know that he is honest, he is approachable and he cares, and the electors of Australia know that when they put a Liberal or a National into this House, they are going to be represented by that person. But I tell honourable members what, the same cannot be said for that mob opposite because they are tied up; they are hamstrung and they sit there. As I say, they get into their rooms, close the doors, draw the blinds and have someone on point duty to make sure that no-one is walking past, and then they really tell the truth about what is happening. They are a mob of sheep. The trouble is, of course, that they are scared. They are all absolutely scared of the Treasurer. Why do they not stand up to him? They know that he is destroying their chances of re-election. I ask them this: why do they not have an election on this assets test, and why do they not put the prince of half-truths into the Prime Minister's chair? If they do not want to be here after the next election, that course they will take. I challenge every one of the back bench opposite: say to this front bench of theirs, 'We want to go to the people on the family allowance'. I reckon we would win any election, while they would get absolutely wiped off the face of this earth-and so they should too. We have this Prime Minister's rural task force. It should be a rural farce force, because it is not representing the people of the country electorates who elected them. This Cabinet thuggery even got the chairman of the Prime Minister's rule farce force to stand up and defend the family allowance yesterday. I felt sorry him, because I knew as well as the member for Banks knew that he did not mean a word he was saying about that, but of course the Cabinet thugs said, 'Well, it is going to give some credence to this if you stand up and do it'. He knows darned well that the decision made by the Opposition's party room to oppose the family allowance assets test was the right decision. There is some sort of ridiculous carry-on that it is tied in with welfare cuts. The honourable member for Banks knows what the history of the family allowance and child endowment is. It is recognition of the extra responsibilities of raising a family. It has nothing to do with welfare cuts. I will give the honourable member for Banks another hint-I have been pretty good to him today-and I am sure he will take it on board because he is the member for Banks. If he goes out and has a chat to the people who put him here-I am sure that he has a lot of low income earners in his electorate-they will tell him that they are sick and tired of welfare not going to the ones whom it should be going to, the ones who should be getting a slice of this huge welfare dollar. Because of stiff Budget constraints, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER and I am sure you are aware of this-the cake is spread too thinly and the people who genuinely warrant the support of this Parliament are not getting their fair share because this mob cannot come to grips with the fact that there are abuses of the system. If the honourable member for is the Banks goes and has a chat to the low income earners in his electorate, as I do day in, day out, they will tell him that they want something done about it and they want something done about it now. The Government's family allowance assets test is an absolute disgrace, and those opposite should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. They know very well that the safety valve on the family allowance is income, and once a certain income level is reached then people lose it. It is not related to assets. The honourable member for Banks may have driven out in the bush for a day and had a bit of a look around and driven back into town again, for but if he got out there and spoke to the people in rural New South Wales and asked them what is going on, they would tell him-as they will tell some of his cohorts-that they rely on this family allowance to keep that family unit together. But oh no, they come in here and will not support the right of families to continue looking after their children. They have no interest in them and they have never had any interest in them. Once they get past the Sydney bus routes or the Melbourne tram lines, they are finished; they do not want to know about them. We do not see them through Ballarat any more. I have invited the Treasury to come and have a look, and I have not even got a letter, 'Dear Michael, thank you for the invitation to come down and see what is going on in Ballarat'. The Treasurer does not care, and he has never cared.",50
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Welfare Policies,52
31,Ms MCHUGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"1 was pretty disappointed when that contribution was made. This morning's proceedings are being broadcast and there are quite a few things I would like to reveal to the listeners as well as to the Parliament, but many people would have turned off during that extraordinary diatribe. On the other hand, I am glad because it is precisely the welfare philosophy of the Opposition and the Government that I wantÂ· to address in the grievance debate today. A lot of publicity has been given this week to a report prepared by the Centre for Independent Studies entitled Voluntary We/fare-A Greater Role for Private Charities by John Goodman and Alistair Nicholas. It was reported in the newspapers and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) answered a question on it earlier this week. I thought I had better have a look at it because the Minister's answer linked it to some of the proposals being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and by the Opposition generally. The media release tells us what it is about. It says that the report contends that all welfare should be delivered on a case by case basis and that such a system can be run only by the private sector. It says that individual taxpayers should be able to determine where their tax goes, not only in welfare but also in areas of human service delivery, that is, social security, health, education and the arts. Great stuff, this. I suppose there are some people who would say, 'Well, why not?'. Let us look at exactly what it all means and on what evidence the conclusions of this report by the Centre for Independent Studies are based, especially as we can see the constant links between the proposals made in this document and the recent suggestions by the Leader of the Opposition, particularly in relation to the privatisation of the social security system. I am going to take an example to show what it means and to show the sort of evidence used. I will take the example that is used all through the book, the exainple of sole parents. Having read every word of this book, I can tell the House that the 'evidence' used is prejudice. First of all, of course, the authors believe the myth and they propagate it. Consider this for 'evidence' on page 5 of the document: What policy-makers are coming to realise only reluctantly is a fact that any radio talk show host can confirm on a moment's notice. Let the talk show host bring up the subject of welfare and the phone banks will light up immediately as callers eagerly recount first-hand knowledgelisten to this; this is 'evidence'of young women who intentionally become pregnant in order to become eligible for welfare . . . They go on to quote other studies-extraordinary studies such as the SwanBernstam study, which I will refer to several times during my little contribution. It suggests that more and more teenage girls are deliberately having children so as to qualify for the pension. This is evidence in the study on which they base their conclusions! Not once in this document is the Cass Review of Social Security mentioned-not even in the references at the end. The first review of the social security system to take place for 40 years, the one on which all the Government programs are based, is not once referred to in this document. Let us go to some of the facts. Let us expose the myth about sole parents. Only 2.8 per cent of all sole mothers are under 20. That is a fact. Most sole parentsabout 70 per cent-are women between the ages of 25 and 44. The typical sole parent is described by Minister Howe, on the basis of the evidence in the Cass report, as women who have been married or in a marriage-style relationship. They are in their thirties and forties, have dependent children, and are desperately short of training and the capacity to get into the work force. These women-the majority of sole parents, women in their thirties and forties who have been in long relationships-are deliberately excluded from the 'evidence' in the Swan-Bernstam study. Quite explicitly, when they refer to the number of teenage parents-they admit that the number is falling-they refer to unmarried mothers, excluding separated wives and separated de facto wives, who of course are the majority of sole parents. What enrages me about this report is the attitude 'to beneficiaries and people on social security. When the authors talk about the teenage brides of the state-by the way, the 'evidence', their book on sole parents, is called Brides of the State-the attitude to people on benefits is just repulsive. On page 32 they say that benefits are so high they 'encourage marital dissolution'. The authors say that they 'find it hard to understand why an even higher proportion of low income families do not separate and why, after relationships have terminated, new partners are found so frequently'. Is that the attitude they have to their own friends, to the people who move in their society whose marriages break up, who fall into unfortunate circumstances? No, that is the attitude to people on low' incomes. It reminds me of the 'Whites Only' signs we see in pictures of South Africa under apartheid. It is revulsion we feel when we see this attitude to certain types of people, people on low incomes. It is as if they are subhuman. What does this philosophy propose for such 'undeserving' people? It proposes that the social security system be privatised and private charities take over. Then, what 'will happen? Let us look at the philosophy of the private sector. On page 28 the report states: In general, private agencies view the preferences of those who pay the bills as the standard, and the recipients are expected to change their hehaviour to satisfy the givers. In other words, under the private sector approach, 'welfare recipients must adjust their behaviour to the preferences of the rest of society, not the other way round'. They will have to change their behaviour. On page 32 we get an example of this, going back to the sole parent: Â· . .' private charities, especially those with a religious base, encourage deserted and battered women to seek reconciliations with their husbands or, failing that, to seek work in order to support themselves and their children. Of course, Government programs help those women to get back into the work force by offering them training. Back to the quote: In some cases the efforts of the women to find work or repair their marriage is a condition of future aid. 'Change your behaviour and get our welfare benefit or do not get it at all. Be a deserving poor person, not an undeserving poor person. Let us judge you, case by case'. What sort of appeal would there be in that sort of delivery of social security? Then, of course, there has to be competition between the charities. Taxpayers will choose where they will give their welfare dollar, their tax dollar, and which charity it will go into. Listen to this: Â· . . private charities would compete on an equal footing with go'vernment welfare programs for the portion of the federal budget that is allocated to poverty programs . . . Anyone could start a private charity . . . When the taxpayer chooses where the welfare dollar goes, some will miss out. On page 44 they say quite explicitly: Â· . . under the government's monopoly the dollars almost never go where the givers would have preferred them to go. How much money would be donated to, say, the Supporting Parents Benefits program? This book actually says that under the authors' program they would get nothing because they do not deserve anything as teenage brides of the state. It is disgraceful that this is being said. What a way to target the welfare dollar! They go on to proposal B, competition and more choice. In proposal C, probably the most abhorrent of all, they move onto the fact that we could get into education, medical research, arts and cultural programs. We could choose where our dollar goes under their system. ' It is totally repulsive. Since 1983 our Government has totally reformed the Department of Social Security. This report basically suggests time travel back to the 1980s. It actually talks about 'the market of private charity'. It talks about the unfair gove--';llllent welfare monopoly. Private chantIes cannot get a look in. Private charities in their market are under threat of being crowded out by government assistance to people. They are frightened there will not be a dollar in there to make out of charity. When I get angry with the Labor Party and the Labor Government, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that is quite often, all I have to do is read something like this-a basic philosoI?hical approach to government now being touted by those opposite. Do not think they are not serious about it. A statement has been made by Senator Alston which quite specifically says that we can go into privatising the welfare dollar it - oasts abou- t-is. sort of thing. In thUmted States. It IS mcreasinglycommon; he says. Mr Deputy Speaker, it will never happen here.",52
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Forest Industry Mr .MILES (Braddon) (1.10)-1 will have to respond very briefly ments we have just heard by saying that some of these changes will not occur. think changes will occur in this place. course, without any doubt they will occur after the next election in particular. I in this grievance debate to express my deep concern at the slowness of the Labor Party to address effectively the need dow!1stream processing of woodchips. In partIcul-r, I. refer to the inability, tardiness, dlthenng and procrastination. that has surrounded the proposal for a new state of the art paper-mill in north-west Tasmania. The forest industry is one of Australia's largest resource industries and is Australgolden is's second largest manufacturing industry after the processed food and tobacco group. It has yearly sales of about $10 billion and provides jobs for 106,000 people. Many of these jobs are in rural Australia and play a very important role in ensuring many rural towns have facilities such as post offices, schools, medical and sporting facilities. Without the forest industry, regional Australia would be even less sparsely populated than it is. Australia presently has an enormous overseas debt in excess of $150 billion and it is growing rapidly at the rate of $15,000m a month. Part of that deficit arises from Australia's importation of over $2.1 billion worth of forest products. We export, in 1988-89 terms, about $500m worth of forest products and thus are left with a net import bill of $1.6 billion, or about 10 per cent of our balance of payments debt for the year. This situation is incredible, given our vast resource of land, our relatively small population and the range of climate that would enable Australia to be a net exporter of wood products rather than a net importer. This incredible situation is even more ludicrous when one realises that of the $500m we gained from forestry'exports, 74 per cent of those earnings come from the low value products of woodchips. If those woodchips had been sold as pulp, Australia would have exported in 1988-89 prices, $2.2 billion of forestry products, and instead of having a deficit in this area we would have had a trade to the comsurplus of over $100m. If those same woodchips were further I processed to make fine paper, then the Of value would be further increased to over $4.4 billion. Why is it then that a country rise with the resources and technical know how refuses to add value to its wood resources? This has been going on for far for too long. Why is not the Government fulfilling its often expressed desire to improve Australia's manufacturing capacity? That is what it has been talking about for over seven years. We must move away, it says, from dependence on the farming industry and the mining industry to greater reliance on manufacturing. Here is a opportunity to make that change in an industry in which we can sell that product overseas. The change has not curred because the Labor Party has not been able to translate its lofty ideals, rhetoric to the Australian people, into reality. For the last 18 months there has been a golden opportunity, as I said a minute ago, for the Federal Government, together with its State counterpart in Tasmania, rationally and systematically to make arrangement necessary to provide for a new, up to date technology pulp-mill in Tasmania, but it has failed to do so. not because we lack the resource. Tasthis: mania has ample resource of wood prodquately uct to be processed. In fact, thousands tonnes of wood in Tasmania are burnt that each year because we cannot export it. We cannot export the wood either as woodchips or as pulp. It is ridiculous that this country refuses to downstream process just because there is procrastination at the political level. We do not lack the technology in this country; it is not because of that. It is because there is a State Liberal Governtrees ment in Tasmania and a Federal Labor Government that there are problems. There is a Labor Government federally and a Labor Government in the State. is not because of scientifically valid possibilities that a pulp-mill does not ahead. I say that there are no valid environmental problems because the difficulties that were there three to five years ago have now been overcome. With respect to dioxins, organochlorcate ides, oxygen demand levels from the fluent out into the waterways, wherever they might be-in the ocean or in streams-and the absorbable organic halment ogen levels from bleached kraft mills are now able to be handled without any diffistead culty. I refer in particular to the dioxins because that was one of the bogey chemdown icals that was used in the debate about kraft bleached pulp mills in Australia about two years ago. But now we know. Where do we get most of our dioxins from? Some 98 per cent of it comes in our food, and that is a reference from the United Kingdom environment, agriculwidely tural and fisheries and health departand within Australia. ments. So the cBinces of pulp mills ever occontributing very much to our health in this way are very small. When samples its were taken of various things we find a much higher level of dioxins in human breast milk than in paper and in pulp. There is no doubt that the technology and the scientific information are available for us to have this type of manufacturing in Australia and to reduce our the dependence on importing overseas products. As recently as two weeks ago a Green It is overseas member of Parliament told me the technology is available to adereduce effluent from bleached kraft of pulp mills, including organochlorides. Now is not the Liberal Party, it is not the timber industry, it is not managers of big business; it is a Green member of Parliament saying that. Here is an industry with which we could reduce our trade deficit, downstream process raw materials, employ skilled workers, and at the same time help the not greenhouse effect by planting a lot more for this manufacturing process. Yet the Tasmanian Government refuses to act and the Federal Labor Government is totally disinterested. Clearly, neither the It Tasmanian Government nor the Federal imGovernment care about the particular ingo terests of Tasmania or the overall interscientifically ests of Australia. Once bound to the apron strings of the radical Green movement in this country, they now find themselves unable to extrithemselves from that position, and efthat is a great tragedy. We ought to be able to pursue the sustainable developpolicies which this Government and the Opposition espouse and support. In-Â· of pursuing a sustainable development policy, the Government is bogged in committees and inquiries and we have a situation of policy paralysis by analysis. In Tasmania in particular the State Government has instituted in under 18 months ov.er 150 inquiries of one form or another, including inquiries into this industry, when the information is already documented throughout the world While the Labor Party fiddles with the Greens, Australia burns. It is simply not good enough. Australia has the capacity for two to three new state of the art mills, and with much of the groundwork completed in Tasmania I call on the Premier, Mr Field, to give the go-ahead to a new mill on the north-west coast. Petrol Pricing",54
33,Dr CHARLESWORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Perth) (1.20)When Adam Smith wrote about his perfect market more than 200 years ago he talked about the invisible hand of supply and demand and how it would operate in such a market. But he put a number of conditions on the market. He suggested that those participating would have perfect knowledge; that there would be free entry and exit into the market; and that the mobility of the factors of production would operate within that market. He would be horrified today, I think, to see how distorted many of our markets are. If one looks worldwide, it is fair to say that the altruist Adam Smith would perhaps have found it necessary to take the view I hold-that there is a place for regulation by governments to ensure that competition is fair and that it does occur. The alternative is large cartels and monopoly activities. When one talks about the petroleum industry, one sees these sorts of forces in operation. Many suggestions have been made recently about the pricing of petroleum products and the way in which we should go about that. Suggestions have been made to our special Caucus inquiry into the petroleum industry. Some people think that the importation and refining of petroleum products should be divorced from marketing and distribution. Indeed, that is a view that has been put by some. The oil companies believe that vertical integration in their industry provides more efficiencies and allows them a window into marketing and distribution. It is clear that if this is to occur there is a great opportunity for cross-subsidisation and, indeed, predatory marketing practices to occur. The Caucus committee that has been inquiring into the petroleum industry has had conflicting views put to it. The major industry companies say that the return on their investment in total is very disappointing-low by general industry standpulp- ards-and that they are being squeezed by regulation. Independent operators would say that they are not able to compete in wholesaling, distribution an- .retailing and, indeed, that the rack pnc-ng system is freezing them out and makmg it more difficult for them to provide effective competition. If one looks at the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) report which was released recently, it is interesting to note that there are a number of different views. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, in summary, put the view that rack pricing schemes tended to disregard the relative purchasing efficie-cies of different classes of resellers, especially the independent networks, and that this reduced the competitive environment which would otherwise prevail. Others put the view that because there were no independent refineries in this country, as there are in the United States, the rack pricing system was inappropriate in this country because there was no-one to supply these independents at a favourable price. The oil companies did not have to compete at the rack pricing level a-d the competition was isolated to the retaIl end of the market. The industry put the view that rack pricing had stabilised prices and was a good thing. Yesterday in the Australian Financial Review, following the PSA's report, Matthew Doman wrote an article about the view of the PSA and its position on the freeze on petrol prices, which was controversial, and rack pricing. He said: The Prices Surveillance Authority yesterday rejected compensation claims by the major oil --mÂ­ panies for losses of more than $1 - O mIllIon incurred during the August petrol pnce freeze, and attacked the companies' 'rack' pricing system as being contrary to the public interest. Under the rack system, oil refineries sell finished product to resellers and wholesalers at a common price, regardless of the size and frequency of orders. The article goes on to indicate that the rack pricing system, which had an effect on reducing competition, was one of the reasons that the compensation request was rejected. The refiners, of course, make different claims. They claim that the system has ended price volatility and eliminated special deals for certain operators, effectively levelling the. playing field for petrol resellers. But one of the most interesting things that we have found from our inquiry is that a large number of authorities independent of the petrol resellers and distributors are receiving significant discounts from the oil companies, much more than those that are available to the franchisees or to independent distributors. Harbour authorities, transport companies, sugar mills-all are getting greater discounts and then on-selling their product. So there is a margin there that obviously the oil companies are well aware of, or there is some sort of cross-subsidisation occurring. Indeed, these special deals still exist, and it is very difficult to penetrate the cost ture of the oil companies. Until that is possible, one must always regard with scepticism some of their claims. One of the pleasing things in the report-and I will cite again this article-is that at least in the interim the PSA is asking the oil companies to notify it of any changes to present discounts that exist. In fact, the PSA has taken limited steps to encourage the companies to do so, compelling them to notify in advance the removal of any remaining discount arrangements and introducing a guaranteed margin for distributors below the reseller price. For independent operators this is something that offers them the opportunity for some relief from the intensive and difficult situations that they have been facing over the last couple of years. In Western Australia we have the largest of these independent operators, Gull Petroleum, which happens to be situated within my electorate. It is a distributor, retailer and reseller of petroleum products, wholly Australian owned, and situated in Bellevue. It has a chain of 41 service stations and about 10 per cent of the market in Western Australia. It is interesting to note in a recent report into Western Australia that in spite of the difficulties Gull service stations have in obtaining competitive prices for their large volumes of product, they are invariably reported as being amongst the cheapest retailers in Western Australia. So one must question this vertical integration that is occurring and how effective it lis for the major oil companies. One must say that if Gull can operate efficiently as a marketing and distributing organisation, then perhaps there is a little bit more fat in the system than the oil companies will tell us. What Gull is asking for, of course, is that its ability to pay for its product and the volumes that it purchases be taken into account and the avoided costs that relate to the rack pricing system be factored into the price. An assessment of those avoided costs is something that needs to be determined and it is hoped that the Prices Surveillance Authority, and strucindeed our inquiry, can make recommendations in that regard. Gull, of course, has one other difficulty which relates toÂ· double-handling of its product, because it does not have access to the depot where petroleum products are available. So it is necessary, as anybody who understands the geography of Western Australia would know, for the product to be driven from Fremantle to Bellevue and then back to Fremantle to the service stations in that area. Of course, if it had access to the terminals it would be able to pick it up in Fremantle and take it straight to the service stations. This double-handling that exists is something that really needs to be addressed. It is the case that the Government does have a role to play in this. The independents are providing important competition. In Western Australia, Gull is one of the largest and one of the few remaining. Many of the others have been wiped out. It is important that this competition be fair in the marketing and distribution of fuel. There are distortions and there is room for improvement in the system, and it is important that we make sure that independents such as Gull can be competitive into the future. Scientific and Technological Research",56
34,Mr MCGAURAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Gippsland) (1.30)Only the most patently uninformed would not know that Australia's scientific and technological research effort faces severe problems, especially in respect of infrastructure, human resources, career structures, graduate support commercialisation. To address these critical problems, government needs to look at new and innovative policies. To this end, I am convinced that we have to reorganise to provide for a more closely coordinated, concentrated research effort which minimises unnecessary duplication of programs and optimises the use of infrastructure among research bodies at the State and Federal levels. Broadly speaking, one of the key difficulties facing Australia's scientific and technological research effort is that it is thinly spread throughout a wide array of institutes, universities and agencies across State and Federal levels. As a result, infrastructure problems and human resource concerns are exacerbated. Other problems arise from the current structure of Australia's research effort. Cooperation between the various research programs undertaken in the various institutional settings is patchy. Resources are rarely used for a common end and there is little community of purpose between scientists and technologists working within a related area of research. Importantly, as research institutes and agencies tend to become larger and increasingly bureaucratised, they lose either their ability or their willingness to respond to private sector expectations and market signals. There have been improvements at the margin in recent times, particularly in respect of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). But significant changes which will lift the currently low levels of commercialisation will not be forthcoming until large scale changes are in place. The real impact of these problems has been particularly in evidence in respect of the problems facing specific scientific ciplines. The 1989 report by the Australian Science and Technology CouncilASTEC-entitled Profile of Australian Science, highlighted these .concerns. In biochemistry, for instance, the report noted: Â· . . the reasons for a fall in our international research competitiveness is the fragmentation of research and the small size of our research groups. and Similarly, in earth sciences, the report found: . Â· . . research is fragmented, spread too thinly and lacks a well thought out, coherent national framework for its conduct. The heads of various geology departments at Sydney's universities have gone to great lengths to present their own model for concentrating and coordinating geological training qnd research as a response to the ASTEC findings. It should be noted the closely related field of geomorphology also suffers from the lack of a concentrated centre of learning which is multidisciplinary and national in its approach. Similarly, in regard to the national shortage of mathematicians, a core subject or knowledge base for most other disciplines, the ASTEC report suggested: Â· . . the concentration of higher education research activities into fewer centres, which act as graduate schools in specific areas of specialisation. The Centre for Mathematical Analysis in Canberra was cited as an example. The ASTEC report also cited the Bureau of Rural Research study conducted by ICI Australia Ltd which, in respect of Australia's agricultural research effort, found: Â· . . extensive duplication of effort occurs between and within the various research sectors. Mr Deputy Speaker, the need for focused efforts in order to maintain a genuinely competitive research effort was also identified in the areas of computing and analytical instrumentation generally. In response to the finding that our research capability in physics is becoming marginal, the ASTEC report suggested that a move to a more centralised environment which brought together the small pool of human expertise which remains in this country would certainly be necessary. The days of the single researcher and the well disequipped laboratory may well be over. The complexity of contemporary research problems and the need for more expensive tools for solving them make the pressure for concentrated research efforts compelling. Perhaps of topical importance is the ASTEC finding in respect of atmospheric research. There are more than a dozen higher education institutions pursuing some aspect of atmospheric research, though only two have any measurable cathat pacity in this regard. Genehlly, it was found that the universities are underture resourced and less able to mount long term research programs than other bodState ies, such as the CSIRO's divisions of mospheric research and oceanography. need Moreover, the recent report by the Buprogram. reau of Meteorology Policy Committee also pointed out that the infrastructure which supported its climate research procentred gram was inadequate to the task. For good measure, it concluded that Australia lacked any national climate program. It would seem from these findings a collaborative approach to research would ensure better use of existing and future resources as well as ensuring continuity supply of trained researchers. In 1989 National Committee for Atmospheric Sciences of the Academy of Science recommended that at least one university department concerned with atmospheric research be built up to such a level that enteringmatically it is safely viable in the long term. The ASTEC report I have mentioned already commented on this situation suggesting that a collaborative research institute involving a research agency university department be formed, and that the strength of the CSIRO be used as a means of providing research training. By way of summary, the report concluded: . . . the possibility of significant longer changes in the climate present searchers with the best opportunity to coordinate and consolidate existing research and develop research directions on a cooperative basis. Mr Deputy Speaker, the virtual amalgamand, ation of the CSIRO's division of soils, the Waite Agricultural Institute and the South Australian Department of Agriculture an example of a recent development which demonstrates the practical potential of operative models to conduct research. The push by some science lobby groups for a compulsory research and development levy upon business is primarily in response to their recognition that the enormity of the funds necessary to address the problems of the rundown of infrastructure, and the impact on morale it has, will be forthcoming only if external resources are accessed. I contend, however, these problems could be significantly offset by way of pooling present and furesources on a more cooperative basis across institutions and agencies at the and Federal levels. And there is no atroom for complacency in this desperate to finally establish a national science Until now so much of the debate has on specific funding issues and we have seen the Government respond on an ad hoc basis to the politicisation of the science community. Yet the problems are of such immense dimensions that they that have defied a series of funding approaches. Let us just look at the infrastructure problem, Mr Deputy Speaker. The of decline in equipment levels has been dethe tailed in last year's Smith report. Let us look at human resources. Though general participation rates in the sciences have not fallen, the quality of students science related courses has dradeclined and there are significant shortages-particularly at the postgraduate level-in core areas such as by mathematics and physics. Output in engineering and information related courses or also fails to meet demand. As a consequence, there is a significant concern that given the age profile of the current generation of researchers across the public sector research areas our continuity and term supply of trained staff will be severed by atmospheric rethe end of the decade. In regard to commercialisation, businew ness expenditure on research and development continues to be at shocking levels consequently, there has resulted little interaction between the private sector and the public research sector. All in all, Mr is Deputy Speaker, I call upon the Government to examine the proposal I have outcolined for restructuring to a certain extent the research effort.",58

36,Dr CATLEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to grieve for a crumbling cathedral in the middle of my electorate. Honourable members would be surprised no doubt to hear that Adelaide has won some fame a city of churches, and we indeed have number of fine old church buildings, cluding cathedrals, in the city-the AngliSteve, can Cathedral of St Peter and the Catholic Cathedral.of St Francis Xavier being most famous. Most are still used for their original purposes, thankfully, although a nice bloke. few have been converted to nightclubs, dance halls, restaurants and the like. I had the great pleasure last weekend visiting St Peter's Cathedral in order celebrate at an ecumenical service the 150th anniversary of the corporation of the City of Adelaide. This was held at Peter's Cathedral. St Peter's is situated the corner of Pennington Terrace and King William Street at the base of North Adelaide. Its tall spires rise spectacularly and provide a wonderful view from North Terrace, particularly on an autumn night when the floodlights throw up the light across the spires. These spires are very visible from over the scoreboard at Adelaide Oval, where the cricket test against England is shortly to be played. Honourable members will have the opreminded portunity not only of seeing the prettiest cricket ground in the world on their telepeople vision screens without having to visit fine city, but will also be able to see the spires of St Peter's Cathedral rising above the scoreboard as it reflects our victory over the old enemy. The foundation stone for this wondersitting ful cathedral was laid by Bishop Augustus Stuart on St Peter's Day in 1869 before more than 1,000 eagerly anticipating tural people. The cathedral was completed in 1903, and since that time no significant restoration work has been undertaken bn it. The National Trust has classified it a building which is essential to the presplanners, ervation of Australia's built heritage. was designed by William Butterfield of England and modified by Edward John Woods, and it follows in the tradition of the great English cathedrals. It is used not only for the regular weekly worship of people in the metropolitan area of Adelaide, but also for special occasions, for State funerals and as a venue for the Adelaide Festival of Arts, which is held every other year. Also in attendance at as this celebration service was the Lord a Mayor of Adelaide, Mr Steven Condous, inand it has been recently reported that when he leaves the office, is going to join the Liberal Party and seek a seat the in the State Parliament. I do hope he reconsiders his choice; he seems such a The service was conducted by the Reverend David Richardson, who is rector of of the cathedral, but the sermon was delivto ered by the Reverend Ivor Bailey, who is the superintendent of Adelaide Central Mission. The service attracted consideraSt ble publicity, largely because Reverend at Bailey referred to the dark side of our city, quoting Salman Rushdie's observation that there is something sinister about Adelaide with its 'trail of blood down Hindley Street'. But Reverend Bailey was not so much referring to the recent unfortunate instances of depraved criminal acts which have occurred in Adelaide as to the sad number of destitute and homeless people in the metropolitan area, as in: other metropolitan areas, and he wisely us that the Adelaide City Council must be as much concerned with these as with its planning, architecture our and gardens. Unfortunately he was not the first to note the schizophrenic quality of the fine city of Adelaide that David growing Lynch depicted in Blue Velvet. However, enjoyable as the service was, very near to the front pew I could not avoid observing some of the degradation that is taking place in the architecstructure of the cathedral, and after 120 years of service to the spiritual needs of Adelaide it is suffering from serious structural weaknesses. I have the report as of the architects, designers and strategic Woods Bagot, who estimate that It it is going to cost about $2m to restore the building properly. An appeal has been set up and is being managed by Tony Summers-who in his spare time manages R. M. Williams, makers of among other things great boots, a pair of which I have on today. The restoration management committee list is like a Who's Who of Adelaide, including such institutions as the State Government, Santos Ltd, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, the National Australia Bank, the Commonwealth Bank, the Co-operative Building Society and many eminent persons who are contributing on a tax deductible basis donations ranging from $10,000 to $250,000. Also many ordinary people of Adelaide, myself included, are contributing what they can when they attend. Two million dollars, however, is a lot of money and in early December Tony Summers is going to be meeting with the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to discuss the possibility of Federal Government assistance for this very worthy project, to restore and maintain one of the great buildings of the country and possibly the most eminent building in my seat. The residents of Adelaide are already digging deep for this worthy purpose and I hope the Government will find itself able to contribute some money of its own, with I hope the bipartisan support of this House. I do commend the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) for joining this appeal.",60

38,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Until their homecoming parade three years ago our Vietnam veterans were the lepers of our returned service community. Thankfully, that injustice has been redressed a.nd those veterans now march proudly in their ANZAC Day and other commemoration contingents. However, .one element of those veterans, and I speak of the national servicemen, continues to receive less than satisfactory recognition. Recently I was made aware of a written approach by the President of the National Servicemen's Association in Toowoomba, Mr Barry Vicary, to. the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) regarding the award of an Australia Service Medal not only to national servicemen but to all in the Vietnam conflict along similar lines to those applying for the Australia Service Medal of 1939 to 1945. I have sighted the Minister's reply of 6 November and find it totally unsatisfactory. I agree with the basic thrust of Mr Vicary's supplementary submission, which states in part that such a medal is 'based on solid precedent and overcomes the injustice of non-recognition not only of the soldiers in Australian history who were conscripted for overseas service, but who never received a medal'. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this worthy cause and Mr Vicary's letter in the very near future. Australian Broadcasting Corporation Children's Programs",61
39,Mr LANGMORE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"After 60 years the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has ceased broadcasting children's radio, and ABC school television programs have been severely cut back too. Only a few remain and even their future is uncertain. The programs have been stopped as a result of the ubiquitous budgetary cuts in public expenditure. ABC management apparently considers children's programs expendable. Unfortunately, these days financial considerations often override educational and cultural goals. The ABC programs have a well deserved reputation of providing splendid entertainment and effective presentation of information ideas and entertainment. Characters in many of the ABC television programs have provided excellent role models for children in an advertising free environment. Many people will suffer from the ending of the programs. Teachers have relied on them, and parents at home with children, traditionally women, have used the programs to entertain and inform not only their children but also themselves. Country people for whom the programs have helped compensate for a lack of resources in small schools have also found them useful in helping to alleviate their social and geographical isolation, as have the visually impaired and the hearing impaired who have watched the subtitled educational programs, poorer people who have no money for videos or the theatre, and children. The ending of these programs is a destructive decision. This happens in the International Year of Literacy and at a time when we are trying to be the clever country.",61

41,Mrs BAILEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to bring to the attention of this House problems reported to my electorate office regarding the Child Support Agency (CSA). The common thread of these coinplaints has been the frustration experienced by my constituents, the majority of whom have been calling the agency's Dandenong office in Melbourne from country Victoria. A classic example was reported to my office yesterday. A constituent advised she had sat by the telephone for 2112 hours continually dialling and receiving the engaged signal. When she finally heard the ringing tone it was to receive a message that the office closed at 4.45 p.m., even though it was then only 4.30 p.m. If the Child Support Agency is to fulfil the task for which it was established, essential that it be adequately staffed both for telephone inquiries and to handle the administrative matters pertaining to each case. To illustrate this point, yesterday'S inquiry revealed a mistake made by CSA staff who had not properly assessed a case on the material provided, which resulted in the custodial parent being advised that she would not receive any payment until February 1991. I urge the Minister to examine staffing levels for the Child Support Agency to ensure that it operates at maximum efficiency.",62

Ipswich, of course, is the major city in my electorate and last year it sponsored the inaugural National Town Criers Championships. The second event will be on this weekend, beginning with a dinner on Friday night for all the contestants, who represent every State in Australia. Last year there were some 16 contestants and this year I understand there is a similar number. The big event will be on Saturday. It gives people the opportunity to have a lot of fun and all the town criers from around Australia gather there for this important occasion. Unfortunately, the prize last year went to Old Sydney Town. This year we will again be supporting our local town crier, Mark Overell, and I am sure he will do our city proud. The organiser of this very important national event is the Ipswich City Mall. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Mrs Pat Claridge for the work she does in promoting the city of Ipswich on occasions such as this. It is in our mall, that which is unique, and it provides a great opportunity for the local community to get together.

45,Mr COWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, I wish to voice my strong concern and the concern of my electors and of the whole of Australia that the Government is gagging a number of Bills through the House this week and on the next day of sitting. I appreciate that the Christmas period is approaching, but I point out that there has been very important legislation before the House today concerning the wool industry, which is vital to Australia, and the bicentenary roads program, which greatly affects transport and the economy of Australia. There have also been Bills relating to industrial relations, which will have a great effect upon the future of the work force and the economy and primary industry in general. When we consider these Bills; together with the issue of the partial privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, and the education Bills that are before the House, we realise how important they are to Australia. The Opposition has constructive statements and speeches and suggestions to make on these Bills, as well as amendments we would like to make. It is interesting to note that the Government has itself amended quite a lot of the legislation, which was actually prepared hurriedly; there is no doubt about that. Queensland Banana Industry",62
46,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Queensland banana growers. Over the next three years the Queensland banana growers are going to sponsor the great Broncos Rugby League team-the greatest team in the Sydney competition. The sponsorship will go towards the recruitment of young players. It will be headed by the great Australian half back Cyril Connell, who represented Australia in 1956, and it shows the positive way in which an agricultural industry-the banana industry-is not only promoting the greatest game of all, Rugby League, but is promoting its own product. It is getting out there and selling its product in the marketplace. It is a positive step to see one of the greatest fruits ever, bananas, being promoted and linking in with the greatest Rugby League team of all, the Broncos, so that people come to see the need to eat good fruit and vegetables. I compliment the Queensland banana growers for their innovative and top marketing skills but also for supporting a great sport in Rugby League. Medicare",63
47,Mr RIGGALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"1 should like to raise a matter that is most important to the people in my electonite at Moe. I refer to the services supplied by Medicare.

On 13 February this year the former Minister for Community Services and Health, now the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett), who claims to be the architect of Medicare, chose the Moe office to come along and celebrate the sixth birthday of Medicare. Of all the offices in Australia, he said, he chose the one in my electorate to celebrate this sixth birthday. He said: Australian people appreciate the stability of the service. Now we have a new Minister for Community Services and Health (Senator Richardson) in this current Government, and in the Budget Speech we heard there is to be a review of Medicare offices. I think it is perfectly reasonable for a new Minister to have a review of the facilities, and in doing so I was very much aware that the Medicare office in Moe was going to come under scrutiny. I wrote to him and I pointed out some of the changing facts within that office, that there had been a change of services. In fact, eight new doctors were setting up a new medical clinic in town. He assured me that the points that I put before him would be brought before the Commission and taken into review. A letter that I received from him dated 25 October said very briefly",63

I found also to my pleasure that the patrons there contribute to the Guide Dogs Association. They have mounted a sort of basketball ring container on the wall about eight feet behind the bar and they throw their loose change into it. By this method the patrons have raised over $78,000 for the Guide Dogs Association in the last seven years. This has provided 23 dogs to blind members of the community and recently they paid for five pets as therapy. They did me the honour of inviting me to hand over the latest donation of $2,500 to the pets as therapy scheme. These animals are given to the disabled and the aged to assist them to live independently with a companion. Of course, these guide dogs are expensive. They cost about $12,000 to train. It gives me great pleasure to say that I have made this presentation and I might urge on other pubs and front bars throughout the nation that they take up a similar sort of scheme, which is a very worthy way of disposing of your loose change.

Mr Speaker, this is an unbelievable uation where we are going to allow the unions to close down power supplies to the State. They have already closed down . the chemical industry; they will close down transport; next it will be schools, then food, then milk. For Heaven's sake, what will we have left? I wonder when on earth the people of this country are going to wake up to what happens when one part of society, trade union organisations, is allowed to achieve a power balance which is all out of proportion to its worth, to the value of socidressed ety. If we allow this state of affairs continue in Victoria, there is no doubt level? that we will. be coming to the Commonwealth shortly to ask it to bail us out.

54,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,My question is adto the Prime Minister. I ask: When to will unemployment peak and at what,64
55,Mr HAWKE,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The standard of questions from the Leader of the Opposition equates with the standard of his press Vicreleases. No-one can say precisely when unemployment will peak or what the date handwill be. I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition, if he knows anything, would know that that is the Although, having witnessed his performance in his own party room yesterday, there must be some serious doubt about whether the Leader of the Opposition has any capacity in the area of economic policy-making at all. What I can say with authority is this: whenever it does peak, it will not be at that level which was inflicted upon this country by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the adviser to the honourable member for Bennelong. That took unemployment in this country into double-digit figures. As has been said before, the Leader of the Opposition, in his capacity as economic adviser with the then Treasurer, achieved what had never been achieved before-a unique achievement: simultaneous double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment. I can answer the Leader of the Opposition by saying that this Government will not match him in that respect. He will continue to be unique in having inflicted that upon this country. This Government will not do it. The Leader of the Opposition seems to assume that there was some alternative method of slowing down the level of economic activity in this country. He does not question, I believe, that the level of economic activity had to be slowed down. Obviously, if we were going to slow down the level of economic activity, which was necessary to deal with the current account challenge facing the country, then we had to add to our already existing tight fiscal policy, tight wages policy tight monetary policy. As he knows, monetary policies have been successively released on five occasions during this year and it is the belief of the Government that by mid-1991 we will see the Australian economy recovering. That is the position that I have put to the House before, a position which is shared by me and the Treasurer. However, as to what precise month that will be reflected in terms of unemployment peaking and at what level, neither I nor any other person is able to say. NA NA",64
56,Mr LAVARCH,ECONOMY,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I ask: What action is the Government taking to deal systematically with structural impediments in the economy? Can the Treasurer advise what some of the remaining impediments are and how the Government intends to deal with them?,65
57,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"Both the Prime Minister and I, and other Ministers, have said often and at length at various times over the last half a dozen years that the Australian economy has been subject to advanced sclerosis in its arteries brought on by, basically, three decades of economic neglect. It has meant that the job of reconstruction has fallen to this Government. It has had to deal with all of these structural impediments, to try to give Australia an external orientation, to allow it - to look outward, to make Australia competitive in the world, not sitting behind tariffs, not presiding over a sluggish, indolent place. To date the Government has systematically moved through a number of the impediments starting, in the first instance, with wages and fiscal policy and tax policy and then moving to industry policy, education and so on. We are now working to a very ambitious micro reform agenda in the three areas of transport. At the Special Premiers Conference we succeeded in getting the agreement of the States to have the Commonwealth levy uniform fees for the use of roads which will permit the operation of a decent land and transport policy. With air transport we have deregulated the domestic air transport system. With water transport great advances have already been made ih relation to coastal shipping, manning, et cetera. It is the same with electricity generation-an item we are now examining-and the pipeline, which the Opposition is refusing to facilitate in terms of energy distribution. Also, telecommunications reform is now being presided over by my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications. In tariffs the Government is examining a further phased reduction in protection. In the labour market award restructuring we are moving away from the craft structure of union organisation to a more flexible labour market through the accord with enterprise bargaining. In terms of general policy, we have made continuing progress on inflation. We now have an inflation rate which is below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 6.6 per cent. We are now at 6 per cent with an underlying inflation rate of 51f2 per cent. The United States is now at 6.2 per cent and Britain is just on 11 per cent. We are continuing to make gains there. Also, we will be keeping that important addition to national savings coming from fiscal policy. I might add that we see no such resolution on the part of the Opposition. Today on the radio program AM the questioner asked the Leader of the Opposition about the appalling decision taken by the coalition yesterday to refuse the passage of the assets test on the family allowance. Dr Hewson said: The shadow Cabinet did take a recommendation to the party room, but the way we look at it is we have to take the best decisions in the interests of the people of Australia. So the shadow Cabinet cannot take decisions which are in the best interests of . the people of Australia. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition went to the party room with a recommendation from the shadow Cabinet, but that recommendation was overturned because 'We have to take decisions in the best interests of Australia and these can only come from the coalition of National Party members and rural agrarian liberals'. So apparently the shadow Cabinet cannot be relied upon to take decisions that are in the best interests of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition was rolled. He went on to say: As far as our economic credibility goes, well, of course, we're on the record as advocating about $3 billion worth of cuts in expenditure at a time when the Government has given up on expenditure cutting. He thinks that just advocating $3 billion worth of cuts in expenditure is all that needs to be done. That is whatÂ· he thinks structural change is about. Structural change is about taking decisions in all those areas I have just mentioned-fiscal policy, wages policy, transport, telecommunications, industrial protection and education. They are all hard things to do. A politician's job is to get the decisions through. It is not to know what should be done. Nearly every academic group in the country will tell us what should be done. We could almost ask the stenographers from the Treasury to tell us what should be done. A politician's job is to actually get the job done. The Leader of the Opposition .said that he came to the job without any IOUs. He said he had been asked to take the job on. At the first test of his leadership, he walked in with the decision that he had personally supported-a decision in favour of this very reasonable measureand he was rolled by his caucus. He did not have enough leadership in him to turn his caucus out. Mr Downer-You stand up and rave on day after day. Mr SPEAKEROrder! The member for Mayo will cease interjecting.",65
58,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"The Prime Minister has just handed me a very fortuitous quote from the Advertiser. It says: Senior liberals said privately they were amazed at the ease with which Dr Hewson conceded . That is the antithesis of leadership-giving up and lying down. The Opposition can accuse us of some things but we do not lie down. I have had my defeat, but I have fought all the way to the barrier. I did not lie down like a dirty dog like the Leader of the Opposition did a day or so ago. Mr Carlton interjecting ",66
59,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,The honourable member for Mackellar will cease interjecting.,66
60,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"Under the assets test people can receive an income of $60,000 a year, they can have their family home exempt and they can still have half a million dollars net of debt. The Leader of the Opposition could not even get such a reasonable proposal through but he had the hide next morning to say he would cut $3 billion out of outlays. Talk about a joke! Any journalist at any door scrum would laugh at him saying he wants to cut $3 billion off. In trying to go for a proposition which put a cap on family allowances at $60,000, with the house free and half a million net of debts, he was rolled by the National Party. Talk about the butt end of Australian politics! Every bad influence in this try-be it tariffs, overvalued exchange rates, arteriosclerosis of the finance kets-can be put at the door of our agrarian rump, the National Party. The Leader of the Opposition is taking the decisions of some agrarian Liberals who drifted into office on the back of difficult economic times against his own shadow Cabinet, and copping it. As the article the Prime Minister showed me said, that was easily conceded. Leadership is about getting the decisions through. That is what politicians are here for-getting the mail through, making the decisions stick and not lying over like a dirty dog.",66
61,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,I call the Leader of the National Party on a.point of order. Mr Tim Fischer-I point out that the Minister is still answering only the second dorse that?'. question of Question Time. The length of his answer now exceeds,67
62,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,Order! The Leader of the National Party will resume his seat unless he has a point of order. Mr Tim Fischer-I raise the point of order that you have on previous occasions advised Ministers to bring their answers to an end because of the length of the answer involved. The length of this answer is now exceeding the guidelines. You should apply the same rule-and he does not really know what he is talking about.,67
63,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,Order! The Leader of the National Party will resume his seat.,67
64,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"I will conclude at this point. I thought the Leader of the National Party was basically all bark and no bite, but I will give him this credit: he rolled the Leader of the Opposition. I thought the old huckleberry hound over there did not have what it takes but, like most country party people, he is in the high tradition of country party thuggery. NA NA",67
65,Mr REITH,BENEFITS,"I refer the Minister for Finance to his remarks this week in emphasising the importance of maintaining tight fiscal policy and the Government's claims that all that can be done to cut expenditure has been done. We have just counhad a second dose from the Treasurer. I refer the Minister for Finance to a promarposal that new migrants will not have access to unemployment benefits, sickness benefits and invalid pensions for 12 months after their arrival in Australia. As this simple measure is conservatively estimated to save $45m per annum and has the Opposition's bipartisan support, can the Minister please explain to the House why the Government has refused to accept these savings?",67
66,Mr WILLIS,BENEFITS,"What a pathetic attempt this is to try to get back on the front foot. Having had the opportunity this week to endorse the best part of $1 billion reduction in outlays, the Opposition now comes up with some pathetic approach saying, 'How about this expenditure cut which we think is all right? Why don't you enMr Reith-Answer the question.",67
67,Mr SPEAKER,BENEFITS,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,67
68,Mr WILLIS,BENEFITS,You have had your opportunity to put your money where your mouth is. Mr Downer-You should understand that question ..,67
69,Mr SPEAKER,BENEFITS,I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,67
70,Mr WILLIS,BENEFITS,"Opposition members have had their opportunity to endorse something like $1 billion of reduction in outlays this year, but they would not.cop it. So do not come to us with some sort of pathetic proposal and say, 'This just shows we have credibility in this area'. When they had a proposal before them from the elected Government to reduce outlays by the best part of $1 billion this year, they would not buy it. They have no credibility whatever. They should not come to us with this sort of puny excuse to try to prove they have some credibility in an area where they have lost all credibility. NA",67
71,Mr BRERETON,PUBLIC SECTOR,I ask the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the recent report by the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) which comdone ments on the efficiency of the public tor. Can the Minister advise the House how the results of that report reflect changes instituted by the Government?,68
72,Mr WILLIS,PUBLIC SECTOR,"I am aware of the paper referred to by the honourable member Kingsford-Smith. I can say to the House that, since we came into office, we been very concerned to improve the efficiency of the public sector-which of estimates course accounts for about a quarter economic activity and has a vital effect on the rest of the economy. The success of our endeavours in this area has been well categorised by the paper referred by the honourable member, an EPAC pahigher per titled The Size and Efficiency of the Public Sector, which came out this week. What that paper shows is a tremendous degree of success by the Government in making our public sector much leaner and much more efficient. It shows that, in the area of general government-which is government activity not including the that, trading enterprises-the share of general government expenditure in the Australian economy is low compared with that most Organisation for Economic Cooperexceeding ation and Development countries now; of the. 24 OECD countries, only Switzerland, Turkey and New Zealand are lower; our general government sector is getting smaller; that, in recent years, government outlays have been declining proportiondoes ally more in Australia than in most OECD countries-only the United Kingdom and Ireland, in fact, had reduced government outlays to a greater degree over the 1980s; that there had been a decline in the Comshipping monwealth Government's own purpose outlays greater than that of the States since 1984-85, despite the fact that the Oppoareas sition tries to make something olit of fact that we allegedly have not reduced our own purpose outlays. The report shows that, in spite of these trends, economic growth and reordering of priorities have allowed significant increases in real expenditure per person in most areas of general government involvement. So, in other words, although we have been reducing the size of the public sector, because things are being much more efficiently there is inseccreased real expenditure per person in most areas. Smaller government is helping to correct many of the structural weaknesses of the economy, especially by enabling the move to Budget surpluses, so for enhancing public and national savings, which is a key policy instrument for re have ducing the current account deficit. The report also shows that preliminary suggest that, in recent years, laof bour productivity growth in the Commonwealth Public Service may have even outstripped the national average. So, not only are we achieving increased producto tivity in the Public Service-indeed, than the national average-but also there have been significant improvements in program effectiveness. In relation to the government business enterprises, it shows that the profitability of Commonwealth business enterprises has been increasing; has been consistently higher than that of the States .and local GBEs; and in the second half of the 1980s, there has been a marked improvement in efficiency in many government business enin terprises with productivity growth that in the private sector. All of that clearly is evidence of tremendous success in the course of this Governthat ment's period in office. The report does, of course, say that that not mean that there is nothing more to do. Of course there is still scope for further improvement, and the report indicates that that is especially the case in the area of electricity supply, rail freight, and port authorities, that is, in areas which are predominantly the province of the States. They were, of course, which were addressed at the recent the Premiers Conference. As the EPAC report notes, reforms currently under way and those announced at the Premiers Conference will ensure further substantial gains in efficiency and productivity in the 1990s. So, in other words, what we have seen from this Government's period in office till now has been a transformation of the public sector. It has been achieved not just by happenstance, but by very hard work by this Government to bring that about. As the report indicates, one important area of reducing the size of the public sector has simply been reducing prices, and particularly through wage restraint in the public sector. It indicates that, of course, that is something which is in itself of enormous credit to the Government. But it also indicates that the dominant factor in reducing the outlays share has been the extensive expenditure review process, which I can assure the House has involved a massive amount of work by the Cabinet-and especially its expenditure review committee-since 1983 to bring about this reduction in the size of the public sector and to improve its efficiency. It indicates that, in that regard, one such approach has been to increase targeting of social welfare payments. The first such factor it refers to in the expendthe iture review process is that one. Of course, that is one which the Opposition has shown time and time again that it would be totally unable to undertake. We have seen this week in relation to the family allowance that the Opposition has not been able to face up to the assets test in that regard. It has opposed the assets test every time it has been proposed, especially when we first introduced it for the pension. The assets test has been crucial in the targeting of social welfare payments. The Opposition has shown all the way that it is simply not up to facing what is involved in targeting social welfare payments. In addition, there has been the r51tionalisation or elimination of programs not achieving their objectives, an increased use of cost recovery from users of government services, the commercialisation of some government activities, and tightened government administration ttL'ough such devices as efficiency dividends, the control of running costs and control of staffing levels. In the area of government business enterprises, we have had a government business enterprise reform package since 1988 which has invQlved getting the Government out of day to day controls, having boards with greater freedom to manage, establishing corporate plans with financial targets agreed with the Government, and the requirement that these enterprises earn an adequate rate of return and charge economic prices. That is all part of the approach of getting these trading enterprises into much more efficient gear, able to increase productivity and have a better presence in the marketplace. We have seen again this week the total failure of the Opposition to be able to embrace this kind of approach in relation to the pipeline. When it was given an opportunity to support increased prices to put the operations of the Pipeline Authority on a commercial basis, it could not face up to it. Mr Charles- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Minister is not answering question. He isÂ· giving a second reading speech and I ask you to bring him to a halt.",68
73,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SECTOR,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,69
74,Mr WILLIS,PUBLIC SECTOR,"As I was saying, the evidence of this week is that the Opposition would be totally unable to bring about a reform package in relation to government business enterprises in the way that this Government has done. Even if it wanted to privatise them, it could not even bring them to a commercial level so it could get a good price for them. In conclusion, it is quite clear that the achievements in the public sector by this Government reflectÂ· enormous credit on it. It is a degree of success which would be totally unachievable by the Opposition, which has shown, by its continued refusal to support approaches by this Government to increase efficiency, that it would never be able to achieve that if it were in government.

75,Mr TRUSS,YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. By how much does the Minister anticipate that youth unemployment will rise in this financial year?",70
76,Mr DAWKINS,YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT,"This piece of lunacy seems to have spread from the Liberal Party to the National Party, rather than the reverse, which is usually the case. As the Prime Minister pointed out, it is not . my function or his function to make predictions about what is going to happen to the youth labour market. I can say that it is infinitely better now, and has been for the whole of our seven years in office, than it ever was during the period of the previous Administration. If there. is one thing that we are particularly proud is the way in which we have been able to provide both educational and employment opportunities for young Australians. A record number are now enrolled in high schools, a record number in apprenticeships and a record number in traineeships. These are the kind of tangible and sensible things which we have been able to do to assist in providing educational and employment opportunities for young Australians. As the Prime Minister said, I have no intention of making some harebrained prediction of what the level of employment for any particular group in the community might be in one or three months from now.

77,Mrs DARLING,CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONS,Can the Minister for Trade Negotiations inform the House what actions are being taken to further the closer economic relations (CER) agreement between Australia and New Zealand following yesterday's conference of the Australia-New Zealand Business Council in Christchurch?,70
78,Dr BLEWETT,CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONS,"I note that, while I regret my absence from this happy place for the last two days, the visit to New Zealand was very productive. I attended the Australia-New Zealand Business Council conference and had discussions with members of the new National Government, including the Prime Minister, Mr Bolger, the Minister for External Affairs, Mr MCKinnon, and the new Minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Burden. I am happy to report to the House that they expressed the full commitment of the new Government to the CER and its development, and also endorsed entirely the position of the Cairns Group at this point of time in the Uruguay Round negotiations. It is worth recalling at this point how successful the CER agreement has been since it came into force in 1983. In that time, total two-way trade has grown substantially from $1,820m in 1983 to $4,124m in 1989-90. I am willing to confess fully that there has been a shared bipartisan policy. The total trans-Tasman investment has grown by 680 per cent of, it from $1,500m in 1983 to over $lO,OOOm in 1989. I think those are the sorts of figures that indicate how successful this agreement has been. From 1 July this year, all border restrictions to trade in goods across the Tasman-such as tariffs, quantitative restrictions, import and export prohibitions and licensing-were removed. Honourable members will be aware that Prime Minister Hawke and the former New Zealand Prime Minister, Geoffrey Palmer, discussed the .next phase of CER development, which is concerning the honourable member, earlier this year and the major review of the agreement for 1992. As the Minister in charge of that review process in Australia, I am pleased to report that we have set up a private sector consultative group to advise the Government on how best we can achieve further liberalisation and integration of our two economies. On its advice, we have set up five private sector working groups to examine taxation harmonisation, tariff and industry policy, transportation and distribution, standardisation of professional qualifications and the harmonisation of business law. These working groups will begin their deliberations early in the next year. I was happy to see at the conference yesterday the New Zealand Ministet for Trade Negotiations, Mr Burden, announce that his Government will be taking actions to parallel the decisions made by this Government. I think it could almost be said that out of that conference came a general agreement on how we should proceed. Mr Burden and I agreed and told the conference that the best way of moving forward on the CER is to take a pragmatic, incremental path, building on the work that has already been undertaken and identifying specific impediments and removing them in the years ahead.

79,Mr RUDDOCK,FUNDING OF ETHNIC PROGRAMS,"I refer the Prime Minister to the answer he gave yesterday at Question Time when he denied knowledge of any payments being made to ethnic organisations on 16 February, the day the election was announced. I remind him that the question did not refer to payments made but to grants awarded by the Government on 16 February. I ask the Prime Minister to face up to the issue in question and to give this House simple and straightforward answers to the ing questions. Did the Government award $3m worth of grants to ethnic organisations on the day the election was called? How and when were these organisations advised of that decision? Was any public announcement ever made of these grants?",71
80,Mr HAWKE,FUNDING OF ETHNIC PROGRAMS,"I feel transfixed. As I advised the House yesterday, no payments were made on 16 February to ethnic community groups of the kind that were suggested yesterday. I understand, however, that on 16 and 19 February the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs did write to recipient organisations to advise them of their success or failure in applying grants. I further understand that grants in aid payments were made from April, consistent with the guidelines and the timetable by which previous grants had been made. -' NA",71
81,Mr HARRY WOODS,WOODCHIP EXPORTS,"My question is to the Minister for Resources, and it is about the export of woodchips from northeast New South Wales and southern Queensland by Sawmillers Exports Pty Ltd and Brisbane Forest Products Pty Ltd. As the Minister is responsible for woodchip export operations, could he tell the House the position relating to the need for environmental assessment of these operations in accordance with the Environment Protection Act?",71
82,Mr GRIFFITHS,WOODCHIP EXPORTS,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and his recent representations regarding the environmental significance of the operations of the companies to which .he referred. ' At the outset let me reiterate that the Government is committed to protecting substantial areas of our native forests. Importantly, it is determined to develop a thriving and secure forest industry to meet the economic and employment needs of this country. Regarding the specifics of the question of the honourable member for Page, Sawmillers Exports Pty Ltd has long term approval to export annually up to half a follow- million tonnes of woodchips from Newcastle derived from sawmill residues, logging wastes, silvicultural residues, and wood from private property. Originally the company's operations involved the export of sawmill and logging waste which, in the absence of the woodchip export facility, had no other end use than to be burnt at the sawmill or left to rot on the forest floor. Subsequently the company commenced the export of silvicultural residues or thinnings derived from State forests and wood sourced from private property. Having fully examined and taken into account the relevant matters, I am not for satisfied that there has been a complete examination of the environmental impacts associated with this form of forest management, or those associated with operations on private property. That being the case, I have decided to designate the company in accordance with the administrative procedures under the Environment Protection Act, and I have asked the company to complete the environmental assessment during the calendar year 1991 and before my consideration of the renewal of its licence for calendar year 1992. The second part of the honourable member's question concerns the operations of Brisbane Forest Products. This company has approval to export from Brisbane each year up to 180,000 tonnes of woodchips derived from sawmill and logging residues. The potential environmental effects of this company's woodchip export operation were assessed by my Department and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and the available formation suggests that the use of sawmill and logging residues is environmentally acceptable and would not affect the environment to a significant extent. However, my Department has advised me, and I have discussed this matter with my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, that the company has recently applied to export wood sourced from private property, and having considered the relevant information, I am not satisfied that there has been a complete examination of the environmental matters associated with the operations on the private property component. That being the case, and in order to ensure the operations on private property are conducted in an environmentally acceptable manner, I have decided to designate the company under the Environment Protection Act.

83,Mr JULL,AIRPORT SECURITY,"I refer the Minister for fascinating Transport and Communications to The First Report on an Inquiry into Aspects of foreign affairs. the Australian Customs Service, tabled this morning by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Pubare! lic Administration. Does the Minister agree that this is a horrifying indictment of the lack of security at Australian ports? While the: report is concentrated on Customs services, is the Minister aware of those aspects of the report directed to the operation of and facilities at major airports, especially Sydney? Will the Minthat ister give a guarantee that the security aspects mentioned in this report are recother tified immediately for the protection the travelling public and the general security of Australia?",72
84,Mr BEAZLEY,AIRPORT SECURITY,"Obviously, as the honourable gentleman conceded, I do not have the carriage of matters relating to the operation of Customs services, but all parliamentary reports tabled in this place are taken seriously by Ministers, including this one. I understand that there is a deal of useful advice in this on airport security matters. There is also, I underinstand, some concern on the part of the Committee that it might not have had all the data that it should have had in doing its study. I am communicating with the Federal Airports Corporation on that matter. There seems to have been a communications problem, but we will look seriously at all the propositions the Committee has put forward, and where we need to address security problems, if there are security problems, then we will do so. NA  ter: Is he aware of claims that the South African Government's decision to cut its diplomatic staff in Canberra indicates a diminution in our nation's influence in southern Africa? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of how best this Government will maintain our influence in South Africa?",72
85,Mr HAWKE,SOUTH AFRICA,I thank the honourable gentleman for his question and I introduce my answer by saying that there is a pattern developing in the comments of the Leader of the Opposition on Mr Smith-Here we go.,72
86,Mr HAWKE,SOUTH AFRICA,"See how senSItIve - hey There is no policy but there IS a pattern. On every issue-from South Africa, to Fiji, to India, to the South Paaircific-the Leader of the Opposition regards criticism of Australia's position by foreign countries as proof that Australia is wrong: if a foreign government, a foreign country, criticises Australia, then is proof that it is right and his country is wrong. When we disagree with angovernment, then that is proof that of we are losing our influence. This is the pattern of the Leader of the Opposition in foreign affairs. . T.h- pattern .of the Leader of the OpposItIOn then IS to agree with everyone but, Mr Speaker, you find that that can be ra--e- difficult at times. For example, he cntIcises us-he criticises his Australian Government-because we disagree with both India and Fiji on the question of Fiji's new constitution. He wants us to agree with both of them. Now he must be just about the only person in this House who must know that that is impossible because the views of India and Fiji are diametrically opposed. It may be all right for a Leader of an Opposition to put out his Mickey Mouse statements like this and pretend he is discharging the duties of Opposition but it is certain that one cannot run a government that way. Foreigri policy is not just a question of making friends; that is not just what foreign policy is about. Mr Speaker, just as in the area of economic p.o-icy, whe-e one has to maJ<.e tough deCISIOns, so In the area of foreign policy does one have to make tough decisionsdecisions that look to the future and serve Australia's best interests in the long term. Sometimes that does not make you frien-s .. Okay, if it does not, we accept that; It IS necessary at times. Mr Carlton interjecting",72
87,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH AFRICA,The honourable member for Mackellar!,73
88,Mr H,SOUTH AFRICA,"WKE-What is important, Mr - peaker, In the conduct of foreign policy IS that one has to take account of Australia's long term interest. Let us take this question of South Africa-the subject of one of the Leader of the Opposition's Mickey Mouse press statements. He put out a press statement this week about Sou-h Africa's decisions to cut its diplomatIc staff here in Australia. What is the profound conclusion of the Leader of the 9pposition - n that point? He says that it IS further eVIdence that we are losing influence. Mr Speaker, as you know because I have said it in this House, I have very profound respect for what President de Klerk has been doing and what he has done. I have expressed that to him personally by letter and I have publicly done that months before the Leader of the Opposition discovered the issue. But anyone who knows anything about South Africa at all knows that the future of South Africa does not lie in the President's hands alone, and, indeed, yo.u would have noted, Mr Speaker, as I thInk any honourable member who has any intelligent interest in this subject would have noticed, that the President of South Africa has said that he would be happy to serve in a Mandela-led government. What Australia has to do in this issue is look to the future. That is what a government has to do when talking about relations with any country, and particularly with South Africa. The Leader of the Opposition himself has said that we have to look to the future. Where is the future when talking about South Africa? Is the future with the Nationalists in South Africa, or is the future of South Africa with those forces who are leading the struggle against apartheid? With whom, one has to ask, does Australia's interests lie as well as Australia's moral obligation in this matter? In his press release, the Leader of the Opposition criticises us. These are the words from his press release. He criticises us in regard to South Africa for: . . . playing favourites with the ANC rather than establishing equal contacts with the various political and community groups representing South Africans. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",73
89,Mr HAWKE,SOUTH AFRICA,"'Hear, hear', Opposition members say. I just ask the Leader of the Opposition and the brave fools sitting opposite this simple question: what do they think the South African Government has done? Whom has President de Klerk chosen alone to be his interlocutor over the past months? The answer, of course, is: Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress. Is the President of SouthÂ· Africa playing favourites? Mr Ford-He is.",73
90,Mr HAWKE,SOUTH AFRICA,"'He is'! There is the answer; there we have it. It is not only the Australian Government that has it wrong, but now the President of South Africa has it wrong because he is playing favourites. The depth of the ignorance of the honourable member opposite is spectacular. It is almost beyond description. Little did I believe that out of his own mouth, by way of his interjection in answer to my question, would he further reveal how profoundly stupid he is. What the Opposition is saying now is that the President of South Africa has got it wrongMr Carlton inteljecting",73
91,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH AFRICA,I warn the honourable member for Mackellar.,74
92,Mr HAWKE,SOUTH AFRICA,"And that the President does not understand the appropriate way of conducting the future progress of South Africa. Because President de Klerk has chosen Nelson Mandela, he has got it wrong. It does not matter where the Opposition addresses itself on the issue of foreign affairs, whether it is Cambodiayou name it-when it comes to South Africa, the Opposition gets it wrong. But, most profoundly, Opposition members reveal their ignorance when, by way of interjection coming in behind their beleaguered and uninformed Leader on the question - f international affairs, say that PresIdent de Klerk has got it wrong because he is 'playing favourites' wi.th Nelso-. Mandela. Let me say this: thIS OpposItIOn must be just about the only political group anywhere on the face of this earth that has made the judgment that the President of South Africa has got it wrong in negotiating with Nelson Mandela. I challenge the Opposition to find any other political group in the world outside of some far right wing dictatorship group tucked away in some little republic, which shares its view that President de Klerk has got it wrong. Let the people of Australia know that these people who put themselves up as the alternative government in this country are now not only condemning Nelson Mandela but are also condemning President de Klerk. What a mighty double they have there! Mr Rocher-Go on, Jelly.",74

Is he aware that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has effectively turned its back on the troubles at Hoechst?

124,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of the figures recently published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which show the dramatic increase in levels of educational attainment in the Australian work force? To what does the Minister attribute this marked improvement in the skills base of our work force?",76
125,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been a recent publication by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on labour force status and educational attainment in Australia. This reveals a very dramatic improvement in the level of skills in Australia, particularly when we compare the period in 1990 with the year 1982. Some 885,000 people in Australia now have university degrees. That is up by a massive 400,000 in the eight-year period that we are talking about. There are now 3.1 million people with trade qualifications, certificates or diplomas. That is up by a massive 700,000 over the same period. This indicates that we now have in the work force or labour market in this country 1.1 million people more with postschool qualifications than we had just eight It years ago. This is not only very tangible evidence of the success that the Government has had in trying to achieve higher levels of participation within the education system but it also augurs well for the future of Australian industry. We know that for Australia to do better in the area of manufacturing and in the area of providing services to the world, we will rely increasingly on a higher level of skills and a higher level of adaptability of those in the work force in order that we can have efficient industry providing high quality goods at a price that the world is prepared to pay. It also augurs well for the circumstances of people who may, for one reason or another, find themselves out of work. The statistics also reveal the enormous difference the qualification makes in terms of entry and re-entry into the labour market. In February of 1990 those who had trade qualifications were experiencing an unemployment rate of some 3,6 per cent, whereas the unemployment rate faced by those who did not continue their schooling career up to the level of year 12 were confronting an unemployment rate nearly three times that, at 9 per cent. This is a very important message for young Australians: in terms of having better opportunities of getting into the labour market, remaining in the labour market and succeeding throughout the career of their choice, the further. they go with their education and training, the better they will be equipped to succeed. It also means that Australian industry is becoming better equipped in terms of the challenges that it confronts in competing with the rest of the world. NA Ml' MILES-Does the Minister for Small Business and Customs expect that small business bankruptcies will rise over the next six months? If so, why? Ml' BEDDALL-I thank the honourable member very much for his question. As I indicated the other day to the Leader of the National Party, it has been fairly constant that over the last ten years business bankruptcies have fluctuated between 2,000 and 2,500. The rise we are seeing in bankruptcies at the moment unfortunately is in consumer bankruptcies. I have no indication that that will dramatically change; the continuing rise in consumer bankruptcies is of great concern to the Government but I would like to reiterate that bankruptcies themselves are not a true indication of how business is operating. Many people, rather than go bankrupt, actually close the business down; they liquidate. To use bankruptcies as a method of determining business wealth is just not looking at the whole picture. Mr Cadman inteljecting-",76
126,Mr SPEAKER,SMALL BUSINESS BANKRUPTCIES,The member for Mitchell!,77
127,Mr BEDDALL,SMALL BUSINESS BANKRUPTCIES,"The Government is concerned at the increasing bankruptcy rates. As I said the other day in answer to a question by the Leader of the National Party, the indications are that the rise in bankruptcies is in consumer bankruptcies, not in business bankruptcies. NA NA",77
128,Mrs JAKOBSEN,STRATEGY,"I ask the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services: has his attention has been drawn to a number of recent media claims that the expenditure of funds under the youth social justice strategy has been slowed down by bureaucratic delays? If so, can the Minister inform the House as to whether there is any substance in these assertions?",77
129,Mr STAPLES,STRATEGY,"I thank the honourable member for Cowan for her question. I inform the House that nearly 400 youth accommodation support services have been funded to date since the youth social justice strategy was announced in the 1989-90 Budget. This strategy committed an additional $100m from the Commonwealth over the next four years to provide support to students at risk; to provide housing and health services for homeless young people; for family mediation and counselling; and for expansion of medium and long term accommodation options. But, very importantly, it enabled-in conjunction with State and Territory governments-the bringing together of a more coordinated action than was in fact possible in the past under the supported accommodation assistance program, bringing together State programs and the wider range of Commonwealth programs that are involved. That $100m can be added to the substantial increase in the crisis 'accommodation program, which went from about $19.5m to $39m in that year 1989-90-a 100 per cent increase. But we cannot rely simply and solely upon the models of the past to deal with these issues, because, in the past, too much of the expenditure has been concentrated upon dealing with the after-effects. If we are to deal responsibly and quickly with the issues of homelessness, we need to deal more with the matters that cause homelessness. For that reason, we are spending more money in dealing with the wide range of needs of people in that regard. So, in extending health services, counselling, mediation and training, as well as income support and other linkages and supports to people, we are seeking to further increase and develop services around the needs of individuals. We are just about to announce two new packages-one in the Australian Capital Territory and one in New South Waleswhich relate to those services already mentioned. But it is fair to say that it was a bit slow at the start-and one would expect that in the first year of operation of new programs, particularly ones that require such interaction between governments. In the process, of course, we set up new community advisory structures which took a bit of time to come together, but are now working very, very effectively in allowing both Commonwealth and State governments to get a much better appreciation of the needs on the ground. Of course, at the recent Special Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth and the States began to address together the issues that continue to bear significant pressure on youth homelessness-and they are the issues of wards of the state and children under 16. I go back to the point that what we are trying to deal with here is, principally, prevention of homelessness-and that coordination of efforts across government departments, government boundaries and local government and community boundaries is very, very important. We have to deal with those causes. The things that cause family breakdown-the untreated mental illness, the child abuse and domestic violence, which are so much a problem in our community behind closed doors, are issues that are very difficult government to deal with. Nonetheless, we are developing programs to better come to terms with those issues. This is an era of unprecedented cooperation between Commonwealth and State governments and, indeed, community groups who deal with these issues. I think it is important, in a week in which much has been said in this House about the issues ()f poverty, to stress that no government in Australia's history has done more to deal with poverty and the causes of poverty than this Government. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training referred in this House today to the growth in the number of children participating in education, and employment growth. Programs such as the family allowance supplement, child-care, public housing, the growth in the supported accommodation assistance program, the national campaign against drug abuse-all of these things begin to deal not only with the after-effects of homelessness and crisis in the family, but also with preventing the causes. I would hope that, in this day and age, with a government that has put so much effort into this area and a Prime Minister who has put so much personal dedication into the issue of solving poverty in this country, this House would have the maturity and the respect to realise that we cannot deal with poverty as a single party issue. When dealing with the issue of poverty, it seems that honourable members opposite sit there with some sort of ghoulish glee just because there are still people living in poverty in this country. The fact is that this Government has done more to overcome the causes of poverty and to deal with its after-effects than any government in this country's history. This issue illustrates the clear distinction between the Government and the Opposition. When the Leader of the Opposition speaks of a $3,000m fiscal gap, he has to address these issues. He will only gain credibility, such as it may be, if he is able to do that. People dealing with the issues of homeless ness and poverty need to know what he is going to do. It for is not sufficient simply to throw up the idea of passing over social security payments to community groups. These issues have to be addressed. People in the community deserve to know what the Leader of the Opposition intends to do. The reality is that those opposite are only there to protect the privilege of the wealthy. This Government gives opportunities to all Australians. AUDITOR-GENERAVS REPORT",77

132,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to reduce our current account deficit, deliver sustainable reductions in inflation and stem the recent rapid increases in unemployment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",79
133,Dr HEWSON,ECONOMY,"This Government stands totally condemned for triviali sing Parliament, for reducing Question Time to nothing better than a farce. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) personally stands condemned for having absolutely no standards of behaviour and being happy to stoop to the lowest possible level, even today to suggest that we had blood on our hands, in order to distract attention from the fact that he has absolutely stuffed the foreign policy of this country. As far as I am concerned, the Prime Minister should be challenged to come back into this House and take this matter of public importance. He has not taken one matter of public importance from me in the time that I have been Leader of the Opposition. He always scurries out; he always delivers personal abuse; he always goes away and hides rather than face the reality. !!Ie tra.gedy is that t.his country is in CrISIS. ThIS country is In the worse economic crisis since the Second World War. All these people on the other side can do is play games, trivialise Parliament reduce Question Time to a farce, to a platform for the Ueputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) to use to deliver personal abuse when hundreds of thousand.s of A':lstralia-s .are out there really hurtIng, 10SIn- t-elr Jobs, struggling with the Trea.surer s !nterest rates, struggling w-th theIr - uts In real wages, struggling wIth the faIlure of their businesses and worrying about their savings being at risk. - he Treasurer struts around this place lIke he has got nothing to hide. It is the most ridiculous and despicable performance by any government in the history of this country. The most amazing thing about the attacks now is that it is always somebody else's fault. The Treasurer always starts out by denying that anything is wrong and then blames everybody else. In the last couple of weeks I have been to blame. It is the Opposition that is to blame for the mess that this country is in. We must be the most powerful Opposition this country has ever seen when the Treasurer spends all his time trying to blame us for his inadequacies. It is quite clear why this has happened. I can quote from anyone of dozens of magazines these days, but I picked up the Bulletin this morning, where I read: There is evidence to suggest Labor is nearing its moment of truth-the electoral point of no ret-lfn, after which it is doomed to defeat, irrespectIve of when the 1993 election is held. That is what this is all about. This is an advanced case of poll shock and not being able to score a point on Hewson. So the Treasurer stands up and decides to denigrate him and throw clirt at him in order to try to divert attention from the fact that the Government is not prepared to govern in the best interests of the people of Australia. . The !reasurer, wh- is sitting opposite, IS partIcularly at a dIsadvantage because he is Mr Seven Per Cent in the polls. The only two polls that he has topped are the most insensitive politician in Australia and the most inarticulate politician in Australia. Those are the only two polls he has topped. Of course, a part of the poll which he has not seen asked the question: 'If the Prime Minister went under a bus, who would you prefer-Beazley or Keating?, The answer ""Yas 51 per cent Beazley, 29 per cent KeatIng. Indeed, when Australian - abor Party voters were polled,. only one In three wanted Paul Keating to lead the - arty. It is' no wonde- that Mr Keating is In a flap: he has mIssed the bus even before it has gone over the Prime Minister. That is the reason why this Treasurer has embarked on the approach that he has in recent days. . I take up the challenge that has been issued by the gentleman on the other side the Deputy .Prime Minister. He has talked in recen- days about guts and credibility. What a Joke for a man who has presided over one of the most disastrous governments that this country has even seen. It has taken nearly eight years to try to solve our problems-and they grow by the day. Let us look at the issue of guts. Why has the Treasurer not got the guts to admit that this country is in a recession? Why does he not have the guts when - veryone e-se knows that this country is In a recessIOn? Why has he not got the guts to take the responsibility for what has happened rather than blame everybody else? The Treasurer has boasted all over the Labor Party meetings in this country that he pulls all the levers. He therefore bears all the responsibility. Why does the Treasurer not have the guts to face up to that responsibility rather than blaming Oppositions, archbishops or bankers, kicking pensioners or whatever he chooses to do to divert attention from his economic mismanagement? Why has he not got the guts toÂ· admit that his Budget is wrong and ought to be redone to give the Australian people hope and a sense of realism? Why has he not got the guts to take on an overhaul of the whole tax system or to bring real reform in the labour market or to bring genuine microreform? The Treasurer boasted today in Question Time about the Government's ambitious micro-reform agenda. What ambitious micro-reform agenda? Why does the Treasurer not have the guts to put one in place, set a clear cut mediumterm agenda for micro-reform? Why does he not have the guts to tackle the crisis in consumer confidence which has fallen to the lowest level since that series began-the lowest level of business and consumer confidence? Why does he not have the guts to admit there are more than 500,000 children now living in poverty despite the cruel hoax of the election promises, or that there are 75,000 kids who are homeless, or 160,000 people added to the unemployment rolls in the last 12 months? Why does he not have the guts to admit these things, and why does he not have the guts to do something about it? The people out there are hurting, and hurting very badly, and all the Treasurer can do is play stupid games, read Keats and run around the press gallery, trying to influence those he can still influence. I noticed in today's press that the Treasurer has only a couple of trustees left now; he is running out of influence even in the Gallery-and that is saying something. Why does the Treasurer not have the guts to admit there are welfare rorts in this country? Why does he not have the guts to do something about the increases in expenditure under this Governmenta 12.3 per cent increase in welfare spending alone in this Budget? Why has the Treasurer not got the guts to say no to Bill Kelty when he dictates policy, when he blocks expenditure cuts, when he blocks genuine reform in the labour market, when he blocks waterfront reform, when he blocks coastal shipping reform and when he blocks priv-tisation reform? Why has the Treasurer not got the guts to stand up to Bill Kelty? Why has the Treasurer not got the guts to stand up to the welfare lobby that he pays out to? Why has the Treasurer not got the guts to stand up to the ethnic lobby that he pays out to? Why has the Treasurer not got the guts to stand up to the greenie lobbies that he pays out to? The Treasurer is absolutely despicable and gutless, yet he accuses me of having no guts. He has no guts for all those and dozens of other criteria. The Treasurer talks about credibility. What a nerve to talk about credibility after eight years of fundamental economic mismanagement. Eight years in office and the Treasurer sends this country to record levels of debt. Today in a doorstop interview, I was asked a question about our Treasurer and his attack on me, and I drew the analogy between our Treasurer and Howard Hughes. He is becoming the recluse of the economic debate in this country. Honourable members might remember Howard Hughes. He had a great idea. He built a plane called the Spruce Goose. It took off and flew for about a mile, got about 50 feet in the air, and that was the last that was ever heard of it. That draws a very strong parallel between the economy that the Treasurer tried to get. off the ground; he has not been able to make it fly in eight years-Howard! So where is the Treasurer's credibility? Where is his credibility when he has scorched the earth of this economy? It is standing out there as a smoking ruin, and there are hundreds of thousands of people losing their jobs, their farms or their homes as a consequence of the Treasurer's policy. Where is the Treasurer's credibility when he has given average Australian workers consistently declining living standards for the last five years? Year after year he has asked them to trust in him-that he would bring home the bacon. Year after year the Treasurer claimed that his wonderful fiscal policy would bring home the bacon, that his ambitious program of micro-reform would bring home the bacon. Yet all he delivers to the workers is continuously falling living standards, and rises in unemployment. Where is the Treasurer's credibility when his policies have caused asset prices to collapse in Australia? We saw in a Sydney newspaper the other day that the value of the average Australian home has fallen $21,000 in the last year, and further falls are in prospect. The Treasurer's Reserve Bank says that this is an essential part of the Government's strategy. What a perverted concept of success-rising unemployment, falling living standards, record levels of debt.",79
134,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,Where is your policy?,82
135,Dr HEWSON,ECONOMY,"We will come to the policy in a second. Where is the Treasurer's credibility when he puts 160,000 Australians out of work? The Government asks them to pay the price for the Treasurer and his lifestyle. The Treasurer has not put in place policies to offer them any hope, any sense of direction, any reasonable chance of a sustainable increase in living standards in the next five to 10 years. Let me finish by issuing the Treasurer a few challenges-policy challenges, challenges that we will back him on 100 per cent. The Treasurer made the great boast t?-ay that leadership is about getting deCISIons through: Okay, we are going to offer to help hIm; we are going to help the Treasurer put these decisions through the Parliament. Let us start: first, I challenge the urer to give Australians an honest and realistic account of the state of our economy-an honest and realistic account. Throwaway the unrealistic and self-serving assumptions and tell them the truth about unemployment, prices and so onand the T-easurer m-de a mockery of those .questIOns today m Parliament. It is a tellIng example of how the Treasurer disregards the best interests of the people of Australia. Secondly, I challenge the Treasurer to give Austr-lians a strategy for controlling a!1d reducmg our foreign debt with specIfi- targets and a specific timetable. ThIrdly? I challenge the Treasurer to give AustralIans a commitment to wholesale r-form of our tax system; to restore inc en-Ive; t- remove the bias against export mdustnes; to do something to embrace a goods and services tax. We will support t-e Treasurer; it ought to be easy this tl-e. If the two of us take on his mate BIll Kelty we will knock him over.Â· He should give Australians a new personal tax system with much lower personal tax and do something about the capital gains tax. It takes away any incentive for anybody to be in business. I .challenge the Treasurer to give AustralIans a plan for boosting national savi-gs with specific targets and a specific tImetable. I challenge the Treasurer to give Australians a specific program for reducing the size of government. The Commonwealth's own general purpose outlays today are the same ratio to gross domestic product as they were in 1984-85. The only rea-OI- the Treasurer has brought it back a bIt m the last couple of years is that he blew it out from 1983-84, 1984-85' that is why, that is the truth. We have' com-it-ed ourselves publicly to detailing $3 bIllIon worth of expenditure cuts. Pick them up and run with them and we will support the Treasurer. Do something abo.ut the cuts. It is nearly 10 times the savmgs the Treasurer made in his last Budget, if the Treasurer wants to set that figure in context. He should give us some specific commitments. on expenditure cuts in terms of time, in terms of dollars. I ch-llenge the T-easurer also to give TreasAustralIans a practIcal commitment in terms of specific targets and timetables for genuine micro-reform, genuine labour m-r-et reform, genuine enterprise bargammg-not the Mickey Mouse stuff that is being trotted around to defuse the issue but genui-e enterprise bargaining; if he does we will support him. If the Treasurer mo,:,es towards genuine reductions in protectIon through to zero by the year 2000 we will support him. ' We will support full blooded competition in telecommunications-and to the credit of the Treasurer, he opposed the Beazley option, which was the third best option, but the Treasurer got rolled of course, in favouring the second best' option. But we will help the Treasurer get t-- fir-t best option: ,full. blooded competItIOn m telecommulllcatIOns, and we will be there every inch of the way to make sure the Treasurer gets it through this Parliament. Also, I challenge the Treasurer to introduce a foreign competitor into coastal shipping. We will support the Treasurer with that. Move to a more open skies policy in relation to aviation; build a third second go. runway; build a second airport-we will support the Treasurer in all those things too. But the Treasurer is going to have to take the decisions because as we see it now none of these decisions are being addressed by this Government at any time. The Treasurer has not done any of them. I challenge the Treasurer to embark on genuine waterfront reform and not the fiction that is being perpetrated around this place by the Prime Minister. There are plenty of challenges. Finally, I challenge the Treasurer to come down with a clearly specified set of guidelines in relation to sustainable development; if he does we will support him. He should throw aside the three mines uranium policy which the Prime Minister said is illogical. If he allows mining at Coronation Hill, we will support him. In those circumstances and in some of the others we will make substantial progress together in this country. The. Treasurer should get the politics out of it and get on and do the job which he has been there for eight years to do and has failed to do. The Treasurer talks about guts and he talks about credibility. He has no guts and he has demonstrated absolutely no credibility.",82
136,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY," Mr Speaker, what we saw today ought to be very salutary for honourable members and for members of the press gallery because what we saw today from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was identical to what we have seen from any other Leader of the Opposition: with the first bit of pressure after six months of a dream ride we saw 10 minutes of a rattled person with a rattled speech. At five minutes before the completion my colleagues and I said, 'Where are you going to get around to the policy?'. He said, 'I will get around to the policy', and at that stage we had had 10 minutes of abuse of the Government-lO minutes of abuse, abuse which said that I am despicable and gutless. Mr Hewson-I raise a point of order.",83
137,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"No, he cannot have a Mr Hewson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Are we going to have a sensible debate on this issue?",83
138,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,Talk about a glass jaw.,83
139,Unknown,ECONOMY,Honourable members interjecting,83
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMY, Order! Honourable members on my left will resume their seats.,83
141,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"The Leader of the Opposition gets one minute of criticism, and he has to get up to try to take a point of order. Then he says, 'I will not debate you'. I have offered to debate with him on the 7.30 Report tonight; he knows I have. And he will probably squib that. Maybe I will goad him into it. What we heard was that the Leader of the Opposition has been under a little bit of pressure for the first time because he could not even support one budgetary measure by the Government. So he comes in here today with a speech which shows him to be as rattled as we and the press believed him to be. What we took was 10 minutes of abuse from him, with his saying that I was despicable and gutless. Mr Downer-You are despicable.",83
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMY,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,83
143,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"The litany basically was, 'Why haven't you got the guts to do this?' and, 'Why haven't you got the guts to do that?' Mr Downer interjectingMl' DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member for Mayo!",83
144,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"The Leader of the Opposition then went on to give the self-pity line, 'That is right; stand up and denigrate Hewson', which has become a sort of a crime against the Opposition Leader. If he proposes anything and is attacked for it, that is denigrating Hewson. This little flower, this delicate little beauty, this little cream puff, is supposed to be beyond personal criticism. If any of us legitimately dare to say that we do not think that $40 billion of social welfare spending ought to be thrown to people who operate vol untaI'y agencies, he says, 'It is a personal attack upon me' or 'That is right; denigrate Hewson'. Then the Opposition Leader made these offers about how he would cut $3 billion from expenditure. Yet as my colleague the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, said, the Opposition Leader could not even take a cent off the millionaires who are getting over $60,000 a year and can still keep the family allowance, a home free of the test and half a million dollars worth of assets net of debts. The Leader of the Opposition could not take a cent from them. He never complained about our measures on the family allowance supplement, did he, where the third child picks up $1,800 and where we have tightened up the test there. Oh no, he was not going to complain about that, because that was tightening up the test on the poor. But if it is tightening up the on the rich, he will not have a bar of that. The Leader of the Opposition, as a new leader, could not even get through his party room support for a proposition as reasonable as that. Yet he fraudulently offers us support for $3 billion worth of expenditure cuts. The Opposition Lead((r then goes on to talk about genuine reductions in protection. Which is the only government in the post-war years which has reduced protection? The Labor Government! There was a 25 per cent reduction in 1973-74, and a 33 per cent reduction to an average level of manufacturing protection of 7 per cent by 1992 and going further. The Leader of the Opposition enjoins us to bring about further genuine reductions in protection. The unmitigated gall of him! He sat as an adviser to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) for seven years, with these protection levels untouched and when he knew that they were the sentries at the gate and being called upon to put remedial changes into Australian policy. And they did nothing about it. The Opposition said, 'Give us a second runway in Sydney'. Its members were in government for 30 yeCj.rs. Why was there not a second runway in Sydney? Because they would never make the decisions. They thought that they would lose the seats around the airport. They have no damned courage, and they never have. Then the Leader of the Opposition says that he wants a reform of the personal tax scales. He was the adviser to the then Treasurer, Mr Howard, for five years. He had the oil boom in revenues from Bass Strait in the second Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) price surge. When I picked up the game, we had a top marginal tax rate of 60 per cent. That is now 47 per cent. The bottom rate was 30 per cent; it is now 21 per cent. The corporate tax rate was 46 per cent; it is now 39 per cent. The rate of tax on distributed income was 78c in the dollar; it is now 39c. Yet the Opposition has the gall to say that it will support us in genuine changes to the personal tax system. It opposed the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. The only thing test we have done that the Opposition has supported is dividend imputation, because we gave business the removal of the double tax on dividends, which members of the Opposition should have done when in government 30 years earlier. Yet the Opposition is up here talking about 'genuine offers of help'. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the strength he showed this week in his own party room. I notice that the Premier of New South Wales had a comment to say about it today. He said: The first rule is that the Opposition leader is always right as far as his colleagues are concerned and the second rule is that if he's wrong go back to rule I. I think that rule would be a salutary piece of advice to the Federal Opposition. Spot on! He understands the value of strength. This week, the Leader of the Opposition has been pathetic. If I might borrow a phrase from an old conservative friend of his, he was simply like a shiver looking for a spine to run up in his party room, not even able to stand up to his own back bench for a measure he knew was entirely reasonable. Then he comes in here and says we denigrate him, as if he holds some virtue. What virtue does he hold? He and Howard sat for seven years in the period when the changes should have gone in and they watched the place sink into a place which was just clogged with sclerosis: a regulated economy, high tariffs, a managed exchange rate, a clogged financial market, a huge Budget deficit, high tax rates, high unemployment, high inflation. What virtue does he think we should have from him that he should say, 'Stand up and denigrate Hewson'? Why should we not denigrate him when he stands up without policy prescriptions or, worse, wants to send $40 billion worth of Commonwealth expenditure on the aged and the poor to the soup kitchens, which is what he has been proposing. When we have the temerity to say that is not a policy, we are accused of denigrating him. . We are the sole government to take up on the post-war years of economic neglect-this crazy, crazed belief that commodities alone would save Australia's bacon, that we only needed to dig up another mound of rocks and grow another paddock full of wheat and that we could pick goods from the shelves of the world and take the creativity of other people and live with a first world standard with a Third World economy. That is the sort of position the Opposition left us in. It knew it was changing. In the 1970s, it was obvious that the terms of trade had moved against us. When the Japanese in the second oil shock came to Australia for coal for the OPEC replacement, the response was, 'Happy days are here again. We don't have to do any of the hard things- All those restrictive work practices on the ports-we don't have to worry about them; the overmanning on Australian ships-we don't have to worry about it; the lack of competition in telecommunications-we don't have to worry about it; the fact that it cost twice as much for an Australian car with high protection-we don't have to worry about it; the fact that it cost twice as much for a singlet or a shirt or a pair of shoes-we don't have to worry about it; the fact that we can go on spending in Country Party electorates and blowout the Budget to produce huge Budget deficits-we don't have to worry about it; the fact that our inflation rate has got to a perpetual 10 per cent and our competitiveness was eroded-we don't have to worry about it.' All those deeprooted structural things were left to us. As we struggled to get down the structures, as we tried to turn this from a slothful, internal economy to one looking out and trading with the rest of the world with a great constellation of companies, in Europe and North America-our Brambles and our TNTs and our News Ltds and the breweries. That never happened in the past. As we go out to the world and trade with the world and open up the place and try to get the winds of competition in with tariff reductions, with changes to the micro-economy, the Leader of the Opposition gloats at our difficulties. He thinks that because he is a fresh facehe is not that fresh because he was around in the days when some of these dastardly things were allowed to happen-he could just come here without the Bib and Bub team of Peacock and Howard fighting each other and that gives him virtue. Our difficulties have been basically loaded on to us by 30 years of coalition policy neglect. He thinks, though, that if we, mere mortal politicians, get up and say, 'Well, how dare you propose this, or this is wrong, or you should support that' we are denigrating him. This is a silly debate that he has managed to put about himself, that somehow he is above politics and he stands for something new. He stands for nothing new. He is just a common or garden Liberal, just an ordinary Liberal Party person, up here like any other politician but, like most Liberals, without any original ideas and, like most Liberals, without any courage. We saw that this week in the party room. Fancy saying that a test by the Government on assets that lets a person have $60,000 of income, a house of any value free of the test and half a million dollars of assets net of debt is too tough to be passed by the coalition! Fancy being rolled by this character, the Leader of the National Party, and the agrarian rump of the National Party! Imagine the ignominy of being rolled by the rump end of Australian politics, the farmyard gaggle from the National Party! Mr Tim Fischer-The party that brought you CER.",83
145,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"Oh, you goose! That is the position of the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that we are making progress on the big structural things. The current account is improving structurally. We have virtually remodernised the Australian economy in the last few years. One cannot go through an Australian capital city without seeing a totally changed cityscape, all of the new tourist developments right up the Australian coast costing $3m and $4m a throw, and all of the investment in our capital stock in secondary industry. All of that is replacing the burnt out industrial archaeology that the Opposition left us with. That has now been replaced anew. That is turning around the current account. So too is the change in inflation. Australia now has a lower rate of inflation than the Organisation for Economic Corporation and Development (OECD). The Australian inflation rate is 6 per cent; OECD rate, 6.6 per cent; the United States rate, 6.2 per cent; the British rate-the Opposition's model-II per cent. Margaret Thatcher is now looking at wage settlements of 15 per cent. Does the Opposition know what ours was yesterday for the year to September? It was 6.8 per cent against Margaret Thatcher's 15 per cent. Our accord delivered 6.8 per cent in a boom, which is now giving us decelerating inflation. The Opposition's hero, Mrs Thatcher, is presiding over wage settlements of 15 per cent and an 11 per cent inflation rate. Britain has now, in desperation, tied its exchange rate to the Deutschmark. British industry will be flooded with European imports, which will carry Mrs Thatcher to her political grave. That is what is going to happen. Progress has been made on inflation, on the current account deficit and on the big structural things, but there is no cheer from the Opposition. My colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and I had our point of view about telecommunications, but he has got the change. He is in there. He has a competitor for Telecom Australia. The Opposition never did. You turkeys never did. We have the changes on the wharves. Last week we started a deregulated airline industry. If someone wants to buy a smoky old Boeing 727, he can do so and fly between Sydney and Melbourne if he can make a buck out of it. But this could not be done when the Opposition was in government because it did its deals with Reg Ansett under its two-airline policy. The fact of the matter is that Opposition members-any of them-have never stood for anything decent in terms of policy for as long as they have been here. They have never actually tried to do anything. They have never put their political skins at risk. Mr Downer interjecting",86
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMY,I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,86
147,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"Well, don't. Send him back to his playpen, Mr Deputy Speaker. the The fact of the matter is that the Opposition has never tried because it has always put its political hide ahead of the national interest. We saw the Leader of the Opposition fail in the party room this week. Today, under pressure, he put up a rattled speech, of which 10 minutes of 15 minutes was just straight abuse of the Government-of me, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Ministers. This is a game for stayers-not players. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will see more and more of these rattled, intemperate performances, and you will see more and more of replies of substance from the Government.",86
148,Mr TIM FISCHER,ECONOMY,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.44)Clearly, it is time-the Treasurer (Mr Keating) just said, 'I think it is time'this country had a new Treasurer; it is time this country had a new Prime Minister; and it is time this country had a new Speaker, but I have to withdraw that so I do. I respond to the Treasurer first and foremost because he had the hide to stand up and address the matter of taxation. I do so by reminding the Treasurer of what his performance has been in relation to taxation over seven years under this Federal Labor Government. Let us look at the situation back in 1983-84 when total Commonwealth tax revenue was $44 billion. Over the next seven years what were the percentage increases in total Commonwealth tax revenue? In the first year; tax revenue went up 9 per cent; in the second year, up 18 per cent; in the third year, up 11.4 per cent; in the fourth year, up 12.5 per cent; in the fifth year, up per cent; in the sixth year, up 11.2 per cent; and in the seventh year, up 9.7 per cent. The total Commonwealth tax revenue is now breaching the $1 00 billion level. This is the performance of this Federal Lahor Government on the taxation front. This is the performance which the Treasurer seeks to defend here today. It is one that he must answer for, and answer for clearly. Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me say to you-in the context of this debatethat this arrogant, awful, atrocious Treasurer has even reached the stage of running the 7.30 Report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). He says that it is the invitation of the Treasurer-not Paul Lyneham's, not the ABC's and not this independent current affairs program's. No, he is inviting the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to go on the 7.30 Report. I remind the Treasurer that he does not run the ABC; I remind the Treasurer that he does not run the country; and I remind the Treasurer that he is hopelessly out of touch with what is happening in provincial Australia, rural Australia, regional Australia-indeed, all of Australia. I want to focus on and build on the case mounted very capably hy the Leader of the OppositionÂ· with regard to the position of the economy and the needwhen enough is enough-to address the fundamental problems which are facing Australia as we draw to the end of this first year of a new decade. I want to focus on foreign debt. On the front cover of a publication of the Business Council of Australia on Australia's foreign debt, for all to see, we are told that in fact foreign debt has quadrupled over the seven years of the Federal Labor Government. The result is that our prospects have been greatly weakened by increased dependency on foreign savings. Our trading performance has been weakened, meaning a further growth in foreign debt and a growing interest bill shackling future generations of Australians-all because of the failed policies of Treasurer Keating. Of course, this is the Keating legacy to this 12.9 country. When economic historians write their history in relation to the last two decades of this century, it will be recorded that it was Treasurer Keating who gave us a foreign debt which has quadrupled between 1983 and 1990, shackled the economy, destroyed our competitiveness, destroyed our productivity, undermined our economic performance and, in the process, undermined the standard of living of all Australians. It is in this context that I have to say that the Treasurer is hopelessly out of touch. He is so out of touch that he could not even hear the message from the rural economic crisis rallies, from thousands of families across Australia, and not even from the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who stood up in this House and argued against the Budget decision on the family allowance. That took a lot of courage, but the courage did not last for long. They caved in yesterday. But we were courageous and made the correct decision on the family allowance. The honourable members for Kalgoorlie and Grey know it. Indeed, so correct was that decision and so frustrated were the factions on the other side of the House that I remind honourable members-we have had that notable customer for Cabinet preferment, the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), walk out of his faction because he is so frustrated byÂ· the performance of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who fell over twice. Indeed, I can see the honourable member for Greenway down clear at the front bench now. He has already moved there, ready to take over as a Minister. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) stormed out of his faction. The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) stood up at a service club meeting in his electorate and said, 'I to say that John Hewson is a very impressive Leader of the Opposition, but I do not like Treasurer Keating'. That is the truth of the matter. We have exposed the Treasurer. We have brought him out of the woodwork. When it came to the ultimate backdown on family allowance by the Government last week, who announced it? Did the Treasurer have the courage to announce the ripping up of his original Budget proC posal on family allowance? No. It had to be the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) outside the House of Representativesdown at the National Press Club. The honourable member for RiverinaDarling (Mr Hicks), in his efficient way, has already brought back to the Parliament the results of the crisis meeting of several thousand people in Griffith this morning. He already brought back the fact that speaker after speaker stood up at rally and commended the coalition for making the really courageous and correct decision on the family allowance, one which will stand the test of time and one which we will fund in accordance with the commitment given by the Leader of the Opposition. At every stage of this debate that will be a funded commitment. It is a responsible commitment because it recognises the reality facing thousands of farm children right across Australia. The Government's action is the reverse of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that no child will live in poverty in 1990. The Treasurer is saying that every farm child will be denied the family allowance whether he or she is in poverty or not. That was the equation being advanced by the Government. That is the equation which we reject here and now. Rejecting the futile attempts of the Treasurer and the Government to maintain a credible performance, let me highlight to the House the ad hoc decision making of this Government. The Leader of the Opposition has already referred to the illogical uranium policy, the three mines policy. Then we had the Prime Minister's ad hoc decision making on the have Chinese students immigration policy. It all happened on a television programnot here in the Cabinet room, not here in the Parliament, but on a television program. Suddenly we saw a change of policy on the Chinese students. Then we had the stop-start situation with bilateral relations with China. I am proud, my National Party colleagues are proud and the Leader of the Opposition has a right to be proud, of our efforts to set the agenda in restoring sensible working relations between Australia and China and we should take credit for that. Then we had a minor matter and a very interesting one-the stop-start ad hoc decision making on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. One moment it was going to be in Canberra, then it was going to be in Newcastle. Then the Labor Party member whose electorate covers Newcastle folded. The Cabinet had another think and back it came to Canberra. The Government cannot make up its mind where that to put such an important body as the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Then we had the incredible decision of the Federal Government to tear up and bring to an end a written contractual business agreement which the Government itself recognises. That agreement, relating to the pipeline and the haulage tariff for gas, was between the Australian Government, in effect, and the Australian Gas Light Co. How can the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) sit at this table with all the dealings in his portfolio and take credit for that decision to tear up that contractual business agreement? Australians have had enough of this ad hoc Government. Australians have had enough of a government which is out of touch. Australians have had enough of a government which fails to address the fundamentals, the economic problems facing so many of them. Australians say that it is time.",86
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMY,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,88
150,Dr CHARLESWORTH,ECONOMY,"Perth) (3.54)I admit that when we received the notice of this matter of public importance at lunchtime we took it as a serious matter. We thought that the Opposition would do so as well. We were delighted that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) had finally been able to get a matter past his back bench and bring it into We came here expecting to hear something. We were concerned because there are a couple of areas in which the Government's record is looking particularly promising at the moment; inflation being one of them. However, it seems that the Opposition did not want to talk about the particular matter of this debate. After 10 minutes, finally with some cajoling from this side of the House, the Opposition Leader got to the substance of the matter. He directed to us his prescription for turning around Australia's economy. He made all the usual pleas about how the Opposition could fix living standards immediately, how it could turn around the difficulties that we were facing. He said that we should come clean with the Australian population about prices. And so we should. The consumer price index (CPI) figures are interesting to note. The figure for the September quarter is particularly promising. The trend""which is more important than anything else if one wants to talk about inflation, is something that we should look at. We look at the CPI figure-Mr Tim Fischer-What about the prime debt?",88
151,Dr CHARLESWORTH,ECONOMY,"The motion is about inflation as well as other things and I will get on to them if I get the chance. It is important that we should look at the CPI because it is very encouraging. It is a figure of 0.7 for the Septemdecrease ber quarter. A better measure than the measure of consumables is the implicit price deflator which is a more general measure of the economy as a whole. It is an economy-wide measure. It measures manufacturing, goods, equipment and capital equipment. It is very interesting to note that over the last five quarters that figure has been coming down on every one of those occasions. It is very likelyunfortunately the September figures are not out-that we will see a further decrease in that aggregate. It reflects the underlying level of inflation in this country which we finally have a chance to do something about. We finally have a chance to build an economy on a base which has this place. a low level of inflation. We are looking at a government that has an average level of inflation un sustainably high at 71f2 per cent, but the Opposition's record was 10 1h per cent. Yet the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) comes in here and wants to talk about inflation. I am amazed. We move on to unemployment. We look at the Opposition which left us with a figure of 10.3 per cent. We find that it is now 7.6 per cent. If members opposite want to compare that result with the deterioration that occurred in 1982-83 they will realise that there is no comparison. A further part of the prescription is a change in the tax base. The honourable member for Farrer talked about gross tax receipts as though they had some relationship to the way in which people were taxed in this country. If the population grows and more people are employed we will collect more taxation, but the only figure that is rylevant is a figure that relates taxation to gross domestic product (GDP). As a percentage of GDP it is no higher. MrKerr-You have to take it very slowly with the Leader of the National Party.",89
152,Dr CHARLESWORTH,ECONOMY,"I will go slower. As a percentage of GDP it is no higher. The important thing about fiscal policy is that we have seen a significant in outlays by government. Part of the prescription of the Opposition Leader is to decrease outlays. We have done it by seven percentage points in a relatively short time. That is unprecedented. Now we have a public sector that is smaller than any other country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Yet he is concerned that we need to go further. I am saying that the Government has been putting these things into place. Ido not know what members of the Opposition have been doing; perhaps they have been asleep. It has been happening. We are concerned about tariffs. The Opposition wants to reduce tariffs. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) rightly pointed out, only two governments since the war have ever reduced tariffs in this country. Both of them were Labor governments. Now by 1992 we are looking at an average level of tariffs in manufacturing of 7 per cent. It is hardly excessive, hardly a record that we should be hiding behind a bush. It is a record that we are happy to talk about. We can go further. We talk about the need for genuine labour market reform. I quote from an article yesterday from the Metal Trades Industry Association Chief Executive, Bert Evans, in the Australian Financial Review. It states: Faced with wage settlements of between cent and 25 per cent under enterprise bargaining and a current inflation rate of 10.9 per cent, economists in Britain are looking enviously Australia's system . . . The Opposition is asking us to go down that path. Maggie Thatcher is tottering the edge. She has inflation going through the roof and massive wage settlements; the pound is under all sorts and there are huge external deficits. And the Opposition is saying we should be going that way. We are trying to get our act together in. this country and the sugthat. gestion that we should be even thinking about that sort of approach is something that we find unbelievable. Those opposite want to talk about ation, the level of taxation and particular taxation measures; then they go into election campaign with a proposal to scrap the capital gains tax. That is one of their proposals. What are they suggesting? Are they suggesting that I can sell a packet shares, make 30 grand in a year and pay no tax, but that the fellow out there works all year to earn $30,000 has to tax? Is that fair? Is that equitable in way? Why are we here today? Because yesterwas day those opposite had terrible difficulty. That occurred because the Leader of the Opposition got rolled on a fundamental issue of equity. Members of the Opposition are here again defending it. This is what we cannot believe. We thought they would hide but they are in here again today defending it. There is a suggestion that we should not test the family allowance. We are told that we can have an income test but we cannot have an assets test. We had this argument before with pensions. Eventually the Opposition caved in because it saw it was fair. Now we are suggesting that farmers who earn $60,000 and who have a house, two hectares of land around the house and, net of debt, half a million dollars are still entitled to family allowance. No constituents in my electorate have half a million dollars in assets; they never will have that much. If we are to rein in public expenditure, we have to make some difficult decisions. A lot of these little decisions-$25m here, 12 per $50m here, $40m there-add up in the end and we reach the bottom line. If those at opposite do not have that much credibility, how on earth can they ever expect to cut outlays by $3 billion, as they say, hairy-chestedly, at the door stop. We never on seeÂ· this occurring. When those opposite were in government they were not able to do it. It is mind-boggling for us on this of pressures side of the House. The current account deficit is one of Australia's great difficulties. I do not deny It is at an unsustainable level. We need to turn it around. Last year in this country we had demand bouncing along at 8 per cent and our economy grew at 4 per cent. The extra 4 per cent was made taxup of imports. It was unsustainable. It was necessary for demand to come down an and it was necessary to institute tough policy decisions. We do not like having high interest rates. Perhaps it would have been easier to go down some other path. of Perhaps it would have been easier to go to an election in March with interest rates who of 10 per cent. But people could hardly pay describe us as being populist when we any went to the election campaign with high interest rates. We went there because it necessary, important and fundamental; it was part of a policy structure. And we were successful because the Opposition was not believed. No-one believed that it had a prescription or an alternative. Since we have been here for the last six months the Opposition has given us no more form. It has shown no more form than it showed then. Yes, our current account deficit is at an unsustainable level but just over the last three months imports have fallen by 8 per cent. Exports are up by nearly 4 per centin manufacturing by 71f2 per cent. The current account deficit for the last three months has fallen by 20 per cent. The trend is right. The trend in inflation is right and the trend in the current account is right.

157,Mr HOLLIS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I present the ninth, tenth and eleventh reports of the Committee for 1990 relating to the following proposed works: Construction of Australian High Commission and defence housing, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea Redevelopment of Aeronautical Research oratory site, Fishermens Bend, Victoria Brisbane Air Traffic Services Centre Ordered that the reports be printed.",93
158,Mr HOLLIS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"by leave-The first report which I have just tabled relates to the construction of 45 new dwellings for the Australian High Commission and Defence Force personnel in Port Moresby. It also includes the construction of associated recreational facilities for all Australian High Commission and Defence Force families living in the capital. The proposal provides for 45 dwellings to be constructed on one site. This approach will allow the most economic provision of adequate security measures and will also provide the opportunity for staff and dependants to enjoy a family type environment. In recommending that the work proceed, the Committee recognises the close bilateral relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It also recognises the need for Australia to give high priority to the effective management of our relationship. This includes the protection of Australian interests there. Due to the restrictions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 on meetings of the Public Works Committee outside Australia and its external territories, the Committee was Mr Sinunable to inspect the proposed site or existing accommodation in Port Moresby. This is completely contrary to the normal practice of the Committee, which has always regarded site inspections as an integral and extremely important part of its consideration of a project. In this case, due to the absence of a site inspection, the Committee was hampered in its consideration of the project, particularly in relation to issues of security. The Committee believes that section 12 (1) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 Reports should be amended to remove the restrictions on Public Works Committee meetings being held outside Australia. The Committee will be approaching the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) on this matter in the near future. The second report I have tabled deals with the redevelopment of the AeronauLab- tical Research Laboratory (ARL) site at Fishermens Bend in Victoria. The Committee has concluded that there is a need for the redevelopment of the ARL site at Fishermen's Bend in Victoria. ARL is part of the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation, and this proposal sought to redevelop the site it now occupies by refurbishing a number of buildings, demolishing others and providing additional external works, such as car-parking and extended security services. The project will cost $17.5m in April 1990 prices. From the Committee's perspective, this was an unusual project because of its length and complexity and because of the issues it raised. The Tasmanian Opposition and the Tasmanian Government both forwarded detailed proposals that the aircraft systems division of ARL, together with the school of air traffic control of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the search and rescue training facilities of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) be relocated to Newnham at Launceston and, with existing institutions there, form national centres for simulation and aviation studies. The Committee carefully considered these proposals. Both the Tasmanian Government and Opposition gave evidence at each of the public hearings. The Committee inspected facilities at Newnham on 18 July 1990. Having considered the evidence presented to it, the Committee believes that ARL will function more effectively and efficiently if aircraft systems division mains at Fishermens Bend. The Committee's reference from the Parliament dealt with the redevelopment of the ARL site at Fishermens Bend. Accordingly, as was made clear at the public hearing on 5 September 1990, we were unable to comment on the merits or otherwise of the proposal to transfer the RAAF and CAA facilities to Newnham. The proponents of these proposals are, of course, free to advocate them to relevant Ministers and organisations. This proposal raised some very important occupational health and safety issues. The Committee is satisfied that appropriate measures have been taken to deal with radioactive material and chemical contaminates found at the Fishermens Bend site. The third report I have tabled is for the to the House. provision of a new air traffic services centre for the Civil Aviation Authority in Brisbane. As part of the CAA's consolidation and rationalisation of facilities functional elements in Queensland, a 14 hectare site has been purchased at the former Brisbane airport. This site includes the former Australian Airlines terminal. The CAA proposes to rehabilitate this building to house new radar equipment being acquired. The Committee concluded that the location of the new equipment in the refurbished terminal offers cost and operational advantages over other alternatives examined. These alternatives included extending the existing air traffic services centre, which is not favoured because of the higher cost, its condition, location and need for existing equipment to continue to operate during the construction of extensions. Another alternative examined was the relocation of the centre to a greenfields site. This alternative would have been relatively expensive. It would have caused disruption and would delay the commissioning of new equipment. The Committee has recommended that the CAA undertake an assessment of energy demand for air-conditioning during detailed design with the aim of minimising electricity charges without compromising the operational effectiveness of the centre. The cost of CAA operations is rerecovered from charges on the aviation industry. The Committee therefore sought details on how the proposal will be funded, as the capital cost of the proposal will have an impact on the level of charges levied by the CAA. The CAA advised the Committee that it is unclertaking a major capital investment program involving nearly $500m being spent over the next five years. During the first few years of its existence, the CAA has undertaken a number of initiatives designed to improve productivity and reduce charges. The CAA advised the Committee that, whilst the investment program is substantial, it is already producing productivity gains which will enable it to reduce charges to the aviation industry. I commend these three reports",93
159,Mr TAYLOR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"by leave-I rise this afternoon to speak very briefly. I and do not want to take up too much time of the House unduly, other than to support all three of these projects not only as a member in this place but also as the Vice Chairman of the Public Works Committee. Of the three projects, I think that all I can say about the Port Moresby project is that I agree with what the honourable member for Throsby has said, particularly in relation to security. We in the Opposition look forward to proposals being put to the Minister in relation to overseas travel so that this Committee-I might add, the oldest standing committee in this Parliament-can carry out its duties more the completely, and I support the honourable member on that particular point. On the third project, that of the air. traffic services in Brisbane, it has to happen and really I do not need to say anything more than the honourable member has said in his speech. The Aeronautical Research Laboratory, the third project, is indeed, and was, a very complex reference. The honourable member for, Throsby (Mr Hollis) has made a number of points about the radioactivity that was detected and has to be cleaned up from that area. We in the Committee feel that the appropriate steps have been taken and will be taken to make sure that that is a totally clean, site before the project gets fully under way. I also agree with the comments that he made about the involvement of the Tasmanian Government and, indeed, the Tasmanian Opposition on this particular project. I give credit to them for their bipartisan approach in putting forward a case which was very strong indeed. But, as the honourable member for Throsby has said, the balance of opinion-and, in fact, I have to say that it was a unanimous decision-was that the Aeronautical Research Laboratory, the aircraft systems division, should in fact be redeveloped in the Fishermens Bend area. I will make one final point, and a very important point, in relation to the Aeronautical Research Laboratory. It relates indirectly to what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in this place during Question Time. I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is with the deepest disgust that I heard the Prime Minister accuse this Opposition of having blood on its hands. I would have to point out to you and to this House that, in relation to the Aeronautical Research Laboratory and a particular project of which I have some information, one of the Prime Minister's Ministers at the very least has misled this Parliament. Mr Grifliths- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am always quite relaxed about people ranging far and wide, but, on the honourable member's own admission, he is talking about matters that have a most indirect relationship with the matter before the House, and I would ask him to address his comments to the matter before the House.",94
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I believe that matters relating to the redevelopment of the Aeronautical Research Laboratory site at Fishermens Bend are all right. I do not believe that in this debate the honourable member may talk of misleading the House by any Minister.,95
161,Mr TAYLOR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Let me just put my case, if I might.",95
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,No. The Chair has ruled that the honourable member cannot discuss the misleading of the House in this debate.,95
163,Mr TAYLOR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes, I accept that. But, in relation to the Aeronautical Research Laboratory, what I am saying to this House is that, in a recent question-",95
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I have not found a point of order on that point. The honourable member may continue to speak.,95
165,Mr TAYLOR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Thank you, very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. What I would point out to the House is that, in a recent question upon notice in relation to a crash of a Nomad aircraft in South Australia-and of course the Aeronautical Research Laboratory-- . Mr Grifliths- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a further point of order. If the matter is on notice before the House, once again it is inappropriate to canvass it here.",95
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,There is no point of order at this stage. The Minister will resume his seat.,95
167,Mr T AYLOR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The question has been answered by the Minister. In reply to a question on notice, the Minister fo- Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bdney), representing the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), said that, in relation to that crash, there were some servicing deficiencies. I quote from the reply to my question on notice: There weno; some servicing deficiencies; however, these were not related to the causal factors involved in the failure of the tailplane structure. I would like to refer the House to the official Board of Inquiry of that particular crash.",95

169,Mr TAYLOR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I accept that, Mr Deputy Speaker. My point is that the Aeronautical Research Laboratory, of which we did a very thorough examination during this public hearing and inspection, is involved in work in relation to some of the matters that I raise before the House today. I think that it is very appropriate that it be aired in this forum. If I could go on and refer to the Board of Inquiry of which the Aeronautical Research Laboratory-",96
170,Mr GRIFFITHS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, the honourable member is clearly flouting the intent and the spirit of the Standing Orders of this chamber.",96
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The Minister will resume his seat. There is no point of order. I remind the Minister that the Chair has ruled on this point.,96
172,Mr TAYLOR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The board of inquiry of that particular crash said in - art-and I quote: Had the aircraft research and development unit been directed to carry out acceptance servicing, the damage would have been detected and the accident avoided. Similarly, had an S17 servicing been carried out, the damage to the tail plane would have almost certainly been detected and the accident would not have occurred. The reason for raising that matter in the House today is that I heard the Prime Minister earlier today accuse this Opposition of having blood on its hands. I say to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table, that, potentially, his Government has had blood on its hands in relation to this particular Minister's responsibilities. Whilst I know that in the context of this debate I cannot say anything about the degree to which the Minister mayor may not have misled the House-",96
173,Mr GRIFFITHS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,You are going very close.,96

175,Mr TAYLOR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"This matter is so important that it should be on the public record. That is why I make th- point this afternoon.

179,Mr KERR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I seek leave to make a very brief comment in relation to the report tabled previously. Mr Smith-I had agreed if the honourable member sought leave.,96
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The honourable member has leave to make a brief statement. We will change the rules of the House to allow him to make it.,96
181,Mr KERR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I thank you and I thank the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who is the shadow Minister. I commence by saying that I am sure my remarks would be echoed by the shadow Minister, because before this debate occurred we were anticipating what our views might have been had the proposals in the report of the Public Works Committee been endorsed-that is, that the Aeronautical Research Laboratory (ARL) project proceed at Fishermens Bend, contrary to the submission that was put forward by the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian Opposition. All I will say in the circumstances, given the time constraints, is that all concerned with this matter, I am sure, believe that the Tasmanian Governinent and all parties associated with it put forward a very credible case. There are a number of ancillary matters which, of course, were not within the terms of reference of the Public Works Committee. The Public Works Committee was charged with the responsibility of reporting to the Parliament on the merits of the original proposal regarding the ARL, but the Tasmanian proposal went further in relation to proposals for the relocation of the Royal Australian Air Force School of Air Traffic Control at East Sale and the Civil Aviation Authority Search and Rescue School at Canberra. Those are matters on which, no doubt, the honourable member for Bass and I will make further representations to the relevant Ministers in the future. Whilst we are-and I am sure the honourable member for Bass would agree with me-disappointed with the conclusion in the report, I would like to say on behalf of the Tasmanians who made submissions to the Committee that they certainly reported that the Committee received their submissions courteously and considered those submissions fully. Whilst we regret the outcome, I am sure that both the honourable member for Bass and I will continue to press the case as best we can for those matters which remain outstanding. NA NA Bill presented by Mr Griffiths, for Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",96
182,Mr GRIFFITHS,AND CHARGES COLLECTION BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is the first in a package of Bills relating to the collection of primary industries levies and charges. The purpose of this Bill is to make provisions to enable measures which will allow more cost-effective and efficient levy collection techniques to be utilised. In 1988 this Government introduced measures to allow the Commonwealth to be reimbursed, out of industry funds, for expenses incurred in relation to the collection of the many levies, export charges and taxes and for other administrative expenses. These measures have meant that the Government has had to seek means, at industry insistence, to reduce the burden to industry, since initially the effect was to increase costs and in some cases cause hardship. This Bill and the complementary consequential provisions Bill have been designed bearing this primary aim in mind. Other aims are to allow those required to pay small amounts to take the option of making larger accumulated payments over longer periods of time; to allow for regulations, as nominated by industry bodies, which provide for various optional collection methods; and to obtain a consistency of approach to procedural matters currently embodied in more than 30 Acts. A review of all levies and charges collection legislation showed that while many administrative provisions were similar in all of the existing Acts, many required updating, some not having been upgraded since 1962. It is on this basis that this Bill has been developed. This Bill provides one Act which will deal with all primary industries levy and charge collection, thus enabling a uniformity of collection procedures which was previously not possible due to the large number of collection Acts in existence. 1990 I now come to the main provisions in the Bill. Most levies and charges are payable by the producer, or grower, of the produce. In order to reduce the costs of collection, the Bill provides that for the better securing of the payment of levy or charge, moneys may be collected from intermediaries such as first purchasers, agents or exporters-on behalf of the producers. The Bill stipulates that the Commonwealth may enter into collection agreements with States and Territories, and other collection organisations subject to full consultation with industry groups. Such agreements will assist in meeting the goal to keep costs to an absolute minimum by significantly reducing the number of collection points. New levies and charges which may from time to time be implemented may be prescribed by regulation. In addition, there are provisions which will allow for a greater flexibility due dates for payment, and the introduction of techniques adopted recently in the horticultural industry. Revised provisions for imposing penalty for late payment of levy or charge have been included, reflecting changes in debt collection techniques. Powers of authorised persons seeking returns and information, as well as for those carrying out field audits and investigations, have been modernised. The Bill allows for an authorised person to publish certain information to specified bodies permitting proper administration of each levy or charge scheme. This provision is required to cover the requirements of the Privacy Act. There are also enhanced but simplified methods to allow reconsideration and review of decisions in relation to remission of penalty for late payment and in certain other cases. As I said earlier, this Bill achieves an aim of which many legislators will be envious: the consolidation of more than 30 Acts into one. As the Commonwealth now recovers all costs of collection there are no net financial implications arising from this or the associated consequential provisions Bill. Any savings which are achieved will be immediately passed back to the relevant participating industries via reduced costs. I commend the Bill to honourable members, and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA NA (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1990 .

183,Mr GRIFFITHS,AND CHARGES COLLECTION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time., The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill is the companion Bill to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990 which I presented in earlier. The purpose of this Bill is to make the consequential amendments to each of the levy and charge imposition Acts needed following on from the main collection Bill outlined earlier. The specific amendments to each Act are contained in schedule 1 to the Bill. Most of the provisions in this Act are of a technical nature and arise because of the vastness of the scope of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990. Each of the levy and charge Acts previously had their collection Act incorporated and read as one with it. Such an approach is no longer considered appropriate where a considerable number of imposition Acts are now associated with a single collection Act. Accordingly, a new method allowing for the interpreting of words and phrases is utilised throughout this Bill. The opportunity has been taken to rationalise many provisions and to update others, some of which had not changed for over 15 years. There are no financial implications arising from this Bill.

This Bill merely retains existing provisions contained in the former Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collection Act 1964 which is being repealed through the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill presented earlier. The trust account facilitates the financial operations of the national program for cattle disease eradication. There are no financial implications arising from the Bill.

185,Mr DUFFY,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In 1986 the High Court of Australia decided the Williams case-161 CLR 278in which the central issue was whether, after his arrest, the suspect was detained longer than was reasonably necessary to enable him to be brought before a magistrate. He was arrested early one morning. The police were satisfied that he was responsible for several burglaries in the northern area of Tasmania. The relevant State law provided that he should be taken before a justice as soon as practicable. At the police station he was questioned both about the crimes in respect of which he was arrested and about a number of other crimes, and he made a number of admissions. He was eventually charged on 26 counts in relation to those other offences, as well as the crimes for which he was arrested. He was taken before a magistrate at 10 a.m. the following morning. The trial judge was satisfied that the confessions were voluntarily made but, in his discretion, he rejected them. He held that Williams was wrongfully detained because he was subjected to lengthy questioning about matters other than those for which he was arrested. The High Court, however, held on appeal that 'as soon as practicable' gave no power to question an arrested person about the offence for which he had been arrested or other offences and did not make justifiable a delay which resulted only from the fact that the arresting officer wished to question him. It had previously been taken for granted that an arrested suspect could be questioned about an offence in the course of deciding upon a charge or charges before taking him or her before a magistrate. This decision has created a real and serious dilemma for me. I come to the Parliament with two important competing responsibilities: my responsibility to maintain and defend the civil liberties which we have inherited through the centuries in our common law, and my responsibility to ensure that the laws made by the Parliament are able to be properly enforced, so as to afford appropriate protection to the community. Law enforcement agencies cannot be expected to function effectively with their hands tied behind their backs. Not only must they be able to investigate and prosecute offences effectively, but they need to ensure that they do not proceed to invoke the inexorable machinery of prosecution against a suspect, with all the suffering and expense for the person that that entails, when an early period of questioning and investigation may disclose that prosecution is not justified. The solution which satisfies me, and which I trust will satisfy the Parliament, appropriately balances these competing interests in a just and equitable manner. That solution, which I find most fair, balanced and workable, is to provide for a maximum period during which an arrested person may be held for questioning or investigation before being taken before a magistrate. Within that maximum is a defined 'investigation period' which is a period of active audio/video-recorded questioning or investigation regarding the relevant offence or offences, reasonably appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case. The specified period is a maximum period in which a person may, unless a longer period is authorised by a magistrate, be held in custody before being brought before a magistrate. I emphasise the word maximum. It is not a period .during which the police may simply hold the person; even within that period the time for which the person is held must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. Any gaps in time apparent from the audio/video-recording would need to be stringently accounted for, even though occurring within the permitted maximum though some provision may be made fo; 'dead time' which I will explain later. As well as the tape-recording, other safeguards are built in-communication with friend, relative and legal practitioner, a right to have the latter present during the investigation period, and special protection for vulnerable groups which I will go into later. If an extension of the investigation period is required, which, on the basis of experience in other jurisdictions, I would expect to be rare, it may be granted for a further. finite period up to eight hours, a magIstrate, or, where a magistrate is unavailable, a justice of the peace, who must be satisfied that this is justified in the particular circumstances of the case. The suspect is entitled to make representations to the judicial officer. Where an extension application is made by telephone or other electronic means, procedural safeguards similar to the usual provisions relating to telephone applications for search warrants must be complied with. Any periods of custody of the same person within any 48 hour period, whether for the same or different Commonwealth offences, must, in the aggregate, be within the relevant permissible investigation period. Briefly, that is the outline of my proposal. In reaching the position I have just put before the House, I surveyed, and will share with the House, the background against which the issues dealt with in this Bill arise, the work already done in the area by others and the efforts of other jurisdictions to solve the dilemma. As honourable members are aware, section 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 applies the law of the particular State or Territory in respect of the arrest, custody, examination and trial of persons apprehended for Commonwealth offences. The laws of the States and Territories are becoming increasingly diverse and based on different approaches of principle. This is particularly apparent in the area of post-arrest procedures where there is wide variation in the degree of safeguards provided by legislation extending the permissible period of pre-charge detention. Further divergence is likely to be created by the introduction of corresponding legislation in the remaining jurisdictions. The various State and Territory legislati ve measures taken regarding pre-charge detention were mainly introduced, as is the present Bill, to deal with the problems crystallised in the Williams case. The result of that decision is that, subject to the exception I will mention later, where a confession is obtained from a suspect while he or she is in police custody after by the time when it has become reasonably practicable to bring him or her before a magistrate, that confession is liable to be rejected in the discretion of the trial judge as having been unlawfully or unfairly obtained. The exception is where legislation, either Commonwealth or applied State or Territory legislation, lays down a different rule. Four of the five judges in the Williams case refer to the need to strike a balance between the requirements of effective law enforcement and the long-standing common law protection of personal freedom. They express awareness, too, of the difficulties presented by complex investigations. In this context Justices Mason and Brennan in their joint judgment point out at page 296 that: If the legislature thinks it right to enhance the armoury of law enforcement, at least the legislature is able-as the courts are not-to prescribe some safeguards . . . Justices Wilson and Dawson also recognised that the policy issues involved were properly the province of this Parliament. They said at page 313: If the law requires modification then it is done . . . by legislation. For there must safeguards, if necessary in the form of time its, and they must be set with a particularity which cannot be achieved by judicial decision. The questions which I, and the Parliaof ment, have to face are, firstly, whether should move at all to alter the effect of the decision of the High Court in the Williams case, and secondly, if we do what should be the manner of vention, best to balance the community's interest in effective law enforcement and the interest in maintaining high standards of criminal justice in which individual rights are given appropriate protection respect. Law and practice in this area have uncertain and unsatisfactory since well before the Williams case. In 1975 the Australian Law Reform Commission its report on criminal investigation noted that, although the common law principle that an arrested person must be brought before a magistrate without unreasonable delay had been given statutory expression in most jurisdictions in Australia, words used to delimit the permissible time period were variable and imprecise. Judicial interpretation of a permissible ranged from holding 'forthwith' to mean' exactly that in Drymalik v Feldman (1966) SASR 227-that is, no time at all for to interrogation, similar to the Williams potion sition-to holding permissible a time which extended several hours after it came practicable to bring the person fore a magistrate, in R v Banner (1970) VR 240. Police practice was similarly variable, and the Law Reform Commission found that one of the most frequently voiced complaints against the police was unnedictions. cessarily prolonged custody, in some cases up to three days on minor public order charges. The Law Reform Commission recommended that there should be a prespecified cise time limit set for police custodial investigation. It set this at four hours with some provision for 'dead time'. 'Dead time' means those periods of time which it is considered appropriate to exclude from the calculation of the investigation period, as they are all periods when invesbetter tigations should not, in fairness, take be place. They include direct travel time to limthe police station, time arranging communication with family, friend or lawyer, and time spent waiting for the attendance a lawyer or prisoner's friend. They also we recommended provision for extension of time, in appropriate circumstances, by application to a magistrate-by telephone if so, necessary-in no circumstances to exceed the intera further eight hours. The Commission was well aware of, and gave careful consideration to, the objection that any acceptance of post arrest investigation is undesirable because it is and a retreat from the common law principle that arrest marks the point of executive been commitment, when there should be a reduction, not an expansion of police power, and when the judicial arm should take in over as soon as possible. Subject to the dissent of Mr F.G. Brennan, QC, as he then was, who would have preferred to increase police powers prior to, rather than after, arrest, the Commission felt that this argument was the outweighed by other considerations. In September 1988 the Committee retime viewing Commonwealth Criminal Law chaired by the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Harry Gibbs, was asked report specifically on the issue of detenof a suspect by investigating officers for the period necessary to complete an beinvestigation, and on the issue of introbeducing a requirement that confessions be tape-recorded. The Committee's report was presented in February 1989. In the course of its deliberations the Committee considered the history of the responses to the problem in other jurisThere are essentially two approaches to defining a period of pre-charge detention. One involves providing a reasonable investigation period within a maximum period, with or without allowance for 'dead time', usually with provision for its extension by application to a magistrate in appropriate circumstances. The other allows a reasonable period of pre-charge detention and provides statutory criteria to define those matters which may be taken into account in deciding what constitutes a reasonable time in all the circumstances of a particular case. Victoria provides an example of the actual operation of both approaches. The history of the Victorian legislation began in 1983, even before the High Court's decision in the Williams case, after confessional evidence had been held inadmissible in several cases as having been obtained during a period of unlawful detention. A committee was appointed, chaired by the then State Director of Public Prosecutions, now Mr Justice Phillips, to address the problem. That committee recommended legislative amendments to provide for a maximum period of six hours, which could be extended on application to a magistrate with the consent of the arrested person. These recommendations were put into effect by amendments to section 460 of the Crimes Act 1953 (Victoria) in 1984. After a period of close monitoring, the police compiled a report detailing a number of deficiencies in the operation of the amendments, and the consultative committee was reconvened under Mr Coldrey  Public Prosecutions, to examine the effectiveness of the amendments. The Coldrey Committee recommended that a reasonable time be substituted for the specified maximum period, and that practical criteria be provided to guide the courts in assessing the conduct of the investigators. The maximum period was considered insufficient for major investigations into complex crimes and multiple offences. It also required the interruption of the continuity of the interview or investigation to seek an application for extension of time, and, generally, lacked flexibility. The Committee's recommendations were enacted in 1988. It should be noted that the Victorian fixed time provision made no allowance for dead time. The law as it stands at present, as is reflected in the conclusions of all the mittees which have published reports on the issue, manifestly fails to take into account the legitimate needs of the police in their investigations of crime, particularly of complex and serious crime. It is necessary to make provision in the system for the realities of police investigatory requirements. Both the Law Reform Commission and the Gibbs Committee were well aware of the concern that by providing for a lawful period of custodial detention there might be a tendency for the maximum permissible period to become the norm, thus endangering civil liberties. Mr Coldrey, QC, in his report of April 1986 on the Phillips amendment to section 460 of the Crimes Act 1958 Victoria, quoted research findings on a similar Scottish provision for a fixed maximum of six hours pre-charge detention, in operation since 1980. The findings were that the average time a suspect spent at the police station, despite the permissible six hour maximum, was two hours and 15 minutes, 20 per cent spent less than one hour and 50 per cent of all detentions lasted less than two hours. Coldrey found that over 99.5 per cent of investigations under the Victorian provisions took place within the six hours but no breakdown of figures within that period was available. Having reviewed the legislative and case law history of the pre-charge situation, the Gibbs Review Committee formed the clear opinion that the law should provide investigating officers with a reasonable opportunity to interrogate an arrested person, and conduct other necessary investigations, before taking the arrested person before a magistrate. At page 312 it quoted Wilson J. and Dawson J. in the Williams case as recognising that 'the restrictions placed by the law on the purpose for which an arrested person may be kept in custody have on occasions hampered the police, sometimes seriously, in their investigation of crime and the institution of proceedings for prosecution. And these are functions which are carried out by the police, not for some private end, but in the interests of the whole community'. The Committee pointed out that the comquestioning of suspected persons is not in itself an evil, but a necessary and very important part of law enforcement. Objection can only be taken to the use of compulsion to answer questions and to unfair or oppressive methods of questioning, and it is these risks associated with extended pre-charge detention that the safeguards in the proposed legislation address. Recommendations of the Review Committee relating to safeguards which are reflected in the Bill include the following: provision for the customary caution that the person in custody does not have to say, or do, anything, but that anything he or she does say or do may be given in evidence, the caution to be given in, or translated into, a language in which the person is fluent, where necessary; provision for the person, before the commencement of questioning or investigation, to communicate with a friend or relative, and with a lawyer, and for a lawyer to be present during investigations involving the arrested person, subject to some specified conditions; special provisions for the protection of young persons, foreign nationals and Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders; provisions requiring sons in custody to be treated with humanity and respect for human dignity, and prohibiting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and provisions requiring electronic tape recording of interviews, a copy to be made available to the arrested person. Both the Law Reform Commission and the Gibbs Committee also recommended the incorporation of measures to control any possible tendency for police to allow the maximum to become the norm. The Commission favoured a formulation requiring police to take a person before a magistrate, or make a release or bail decision 'as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event longer than four hours' after the commencement of custody. The Gibbs Committee suggested a provision 'that the ""investigation period"", for which the person may be detained, be defined as a period not exceeding the specified maximum, during which that person is detained for the purpose of investigating whether he or she has committed an offence', that is, a period during which active questioning or investigation is taking place directly related to an offence for which that person is being held. The investigation period is not intended to provide time in which a person may be simply held in custody while police engage in other activities to which they accord a higher priority. The time is provided for active investigation with participation by the suspect on a voluntary basis, and if the permissible fixed time, after allowance for any 'dead time' is improperly used, evidence obtained even within that period may be inadmissible. In other words, even within the investigation period, the time for which the person is held must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. In addition, the usual civil damages remedy remains available, and an externally enforceable police discipline code may be invoked as provided by the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, if a person who is being held, being involved in active investigation or questioning, withdraws his or her voluntary cooperation in the investigation, this fact per- will be electronically recorded and if confessional material is later obtained, even within the permitted period, there is a real likelihood of its being held inadmissible if the prosecution is unable to discharge its onus of proving the voluntariness of the confession and the propriety of the 'investigation period'. Indeed, the most potent safeguard against abuse of the custodial investigation period is the tape recording requirement. The caution and any other information required to be given to the person under the legislation must also be recorded, together with the person's response, if any, prior to the commencement of the interview. Subject to judicial discretion exercisable in the interests of justice, no confessional evidence will be admissible unless the tape recording requirements are complied with. The equipment to be used by the Australian Federal Police, and other Commonwealth investigators subject to. the proposed legislation, for the tape recording of interviews is intended to be composite audio video recorders with a builtin, tamper proof timing device which will show the time and duration of all recorded interviews. Any gaps in time, not identifiable as dead time-which would usually be independently verifiablewould need to be strictly accounted for, even within the permissible fixed period. Dead time, as recommended by the Gibbs Committee, is time to be disregarded in the calculation of the investigation period, and an exhaustive list of those periods of time is to be found in proposed subsection 23C (6) in clause 3 of the Bill: reasonable travel time to the nearest premises with the required facilities from the place where the person is taken into custody; any period required to allow the person to communicate with persons that he or she is entitled to contact under provisions of the Act relevant to him or her; any period reasonably required to allow such persons to arrive at the place where questioning is to take place; periods required for the person to be questioned to receive medical attention or to recover from intoxication; or any period during which an application for extension of time is taking place. The maximum periods in the Bill vary slightly from the Gibbs Committee recommendations. It is proposed that no distinction be made between summary and serious offences in relation to the maximum permissible period of detention, which is set at four hours. The Committee recommended a four hour maximum in respect of summary offences and a six hour maximum in. respect of serious offences. The reason for not following that recommendation is that such a distinction may lead to evidentiary problems in situations where a person was arrested in respect of a serious offence but in the analysis, a charge of a summary offence may be more appropriate. It would be unfortunate in such a case if a more serious charge were adhered to in order to try to ensure that evidence would be admitted. It is also proposed that the maximum period for which a young person, that is a person under 18 years of age, or an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander, may be held for voluntary participation in questioning or investigation in relation to any Commonwealth offence be two hours. That questioning, of course, will take place subject to the special provisions in the Bill for the protection of young persons and Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders which essentially involves a right to the presence during any questioning of an interview friend, specifically defined for each group, whether or not the person has been taken into custody in any of the ways defined. The two hour maximum period will also be subject, as in all appropriate cases involving serious offences-that is, offences punishable by more than 12 months' imprisonment-to extension by a magistrate for a period not exceeding a further eight hours. The fact that the Bill proposes that Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders be subject to similar special provisions to those found suitable for young persons may strike some as patronising and some as discriminating in an unfair way against non-Aboriginals or non-Torres Strait Islanders. The intention is, and the operation of the provision should be, neither of these things. Firstly, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders come from a vast range of backgrounds, and any particular background may not be apparent superficially to a member of the police. An Aboriginal person from a remote, traditionally oriented part of Australia may visit friends or relatives in the city, as maya country dweller. When Forster J first formulated the Anunga rules-which I recommend that the honourable member have a look at-for the questioning of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory in R v final Anunga-(l976) 11 ALR 412 at 414-he emphasised that he was: not expressing the view that Aboriginal people are any less intelligent than white people but simply that their concepts of certain things and the way in which they are expressed may be wholly different to those of white people. Even if they understand the words, they may not understand the concepts which the English words and phrases express. Cultural values of polite agreement and deference to authority may also affect sponses to questioning. Protection in these circumstances is justified as a special measure under Article 1(4) of the Interin national Convention on the Elimination monwealth cases. of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and section 8(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Furthermore, the Interim port of the Royal Commission into Abopermissible riginal Deaths in Custody refers propriate specifically to the risks associated with initial period in custody. If an investigating official has reasonmay able grounds for believing that such person's level of education and underwhich standing is such that he or she is not at any disadvantage in comparison to memtive bers of the Australian community ally, then the official is not required to comply with the special provisions. Howcording ever, he or she should bear in mind that cultural as well as purely linguistic factors may contribute to disadvantage and that the onus will be on the prosecution to prove that the investigating official reasonable grounds for the belief. Other departures from the Gibbs Reoriginals view Committee's draft Bill are mainly matters of drafting or made for the purence pose of clarifying the way in which the provisions are intended to work in pracviews tice, particularly given that the Commonness wealth legislation has to operate background of State and Territory law. A detailed explanation of the provisions the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum, and here I have addressed only its more significant aspects. In summary, the whole emphasis of the proposed legislation is on achieving, with proper and adequate safeguards, that essary balance between the reasonable quirements of law enforcement and the confession protection of the rights of individuals which the High Court, constrained terpret and apply the existing law, acknowledged was for the legislature to determine. Legislation is essential to provide this balance. The law applying to persons rested for Commonwealth offences in different parts of Australia is highly divergent and can be expected to become more reas other jurisdictions enact legislation to resolve the problems exposed by the Williams case. Different results can occur different jurisdictions in similar ComI consider that the concept of a strictly defined reasonable investigation period Rewithin a specified maximum period of pre-charge detention, with approvision for 'dead time', and the provision for extension by a magistrate in those very few complex cases where it be necessary, is, of all possible solua tions to the Williams problem, the one best balances, within a democratic society, the community's interest in effeclaw enforcement and the rights and generfreedoms of the individual. The introduction of mandatory tape reof interviews with suspects is the best kind of safeguard against any possible abuse of the extended pre-charge period. Together with rights of communication with a friend or relative-with had special provision for the protection of young persons, foreign nationals, and Aband Torres Strait Islanders-and rights Qf consultation with, and the presof, a legal practitioner, the uniform and mandatory tape recording of interprovides the best guarantee of fairin investigatory procedures operating against a in Australia at this time. I must emphasise that nothing in the of proposed legislation alters the law so as to give police a power to detain involuntarily a person who is not under arrest. The Bill does not extend the powers of arrest. The right to refuse to participate in questioning or investigation is prenecserved. The onus remains on the proserecution to prove the voluntariness of a and the court retains its discretion to exclude unfairly, illegally or imto inproperly obtained evidence. The only financial implications arising from the Bill concern the cost of elec. tronic recording which will be required by proposed sections 23U and 23V. It is esartimated that the costs involved will be $2,625,000 in 1990-91 and $804,000 in 1991-92. These costs relate to eq uipso ment-including cassettes and editing, enhancement and reproduction facilities-building alterations and transcription. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.  journed. NA AGENCY BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mrs Kelly, and read a first time. Second Reading",99
186,Mrs KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Canberra-Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) (5.06)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Purpose of Bill This Bill is for an Act to establish a statutory authority to be called the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The Bill will provide this country with an independent body to conduct a comprehensive drug testing and educational program for Australian sport. The establishment of the Agency is an integral part of the Government's commitment to achieve drug free sport in this country and to contribute to the global 'clean-up' of sport. The Bill sets out the objects, functions and powers of the Agency. It also covers a wide range of issues relating to the management and operation of the Agency. Background On 19 May 1988, the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts received the following reference: The use by Australian sportsmen and sportswomen of performance enhancing drugs and the role played by Commonwealth agencies. The Committee produced an interim report in May 1989 and a second report in May 1990 that in total stretch to over 1,000 pages. It has made 65 recommendations that are far reaching, touching on all the issues of concern in this problem area. I am pleased to say that the Government has accepted and already implemented the key recommendation of the Committee-namely, the establishment of a comprehensive drug testing program. It has achieved this by establishing the Australian Sports Drug Agency as an extension of the Australian Sports Commission's anti-drugs program. Although the Agency is functioning most effectively, there is a need to ensure the organisational, legal and financial independence of the Agency by establishing it as a statutory authority. The drug testing agency must be, and must be seen to be, totally divorced from any direct involvement in sports administration. I take this opportunity to emphasise the Government's resolve to address the problem of drugs in sport. The use .of performance enhancing drugs in sport is cheating. It is totally against the values that we have in Australia, the values of fair play, the values of reward for excellence and for dedication. We have a proud sporting record that has been built on the notion of fair play, of th(;! best athlete winning, not the athlete with the best chemist. The Government's response to the Senate Committee's reports was tabled in the Senate on 7 November. That document indicated the Government's intention to introduce a Bill to establish the Agency as a statutory authority, thereby guaranteeing its independence and parliamentary scrutiny of its activities. Major Features of the Bill The Bill outlines the objectives of the Agency, which are: to encourage the practice of sport free from the, use of drugs; to encourage the development of programs to educate the sporting community at large about the dangers of using drugs in sport; to provide leadership in the development of a national strategy on drugs in sport; to encourage the establishment of a centralised drug sampling and testing program that exposes all competitors to drug sampling and testing at short notice, both at sporting events and during training; to encourage State and Territory governments and national, State and Territory sporting organisations to adopt uniform drug sampling and testing procedures; to encourage the development and maintenance of drug testing laboratories accredited by the International Olympic Committee; and to promote and encourage the adoption, at international level, of uniform sampling and testing procedures, and of educational programs relating to the use of drugs in sport. The Bill defines the functions of the Agency, which include: the maintenance of an up-to-date schedule of prohibited performance enhancing drugs and doping methodsthis will be the internationally recognised List of Doping Classes and Methods developed by the International Olympic Committee; the establishment and maintenance of a Register of Defaulting Competitors; the dissemination of information about likely penalties and testing procedures; the selection of competitors, times and places for testing; the collection of samples and arrangements for testing; the development and implementation of educational programs; the encouragement of uniform policies domestically and internationally on drugs in sport; the confirmation of Australia's compliance with international agreements on drugs in sport; the conduct of research into drug use in sport; the promotion of sports medicine and sports science research; and the establishment of a national information service and the provision of advice to the Minister. The Bill also defines the powers that the Agency will have to undertake its activities and provides for the appointment by the Minister of a chairperson, deputy chairperson, chief executive and not fewer than one nor more than three other members of the agency to exercise these powers. Honourable members should also note the powers and responsibilities of the Minister in relation to the Agency. The Government wishes to ensure that the Agency will work within the framework of Government objectives and policies. The Agency will be required to submit estimates for its proposed annual budget, produce an annual report, an annual operational plan and a strategic plan each of which must be approved by the responsible Minister. Its financial affairs will be subject to scrutiny by the Auditor General. These provisions, together with those allowing the Minister to issue directions to the Agency and to seek information on specific activities, will ensure a proper degree of ministerial overview and responsibility. This Bill has been framed following widespread consultation with interested parties including the interim agency, the Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Olympic Committee, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association, the Human Rights Commission and the Privacy Commissioner. This legislation reflects the privacy and human rights principles laid down in other Commonwealth legislation. In particular, only those who need to have access to information will be informed. The names of competitors who return a positive test result or who fail to provide a sample will not be published. The Government has also been concerned to protect the rights of athletes and has built into this legislation certain appeal rights to ensure athletes are protected. The issues of protection of individuals' rights, the right of appeal and the process of investigation have also been raised with State sports Ministers and umbrella sports bodies such as the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and all have undertaken to develop policies consistent with the principles adopted by the Commonwealth. The State and Territory sports Ministers have also undertaken to seek the introduction of complementary legislation once this legislation has commenced. The Agency will be established as an independent testing authority. In taking this position the Government is conscious of the need to separate the testing process from the broader issue of the policy of drugs in sport. It was decided to provide the Agency with a relatively narrow and virtually non-discretionary role-namely the thorough and professional application of internationally approved drug sampling also and testing procedures to detect drugs on the International Olympic Committee's of banned substances and the notification of positive test results. The Government wants to be in a poobjectives sition where the registering by the Agency of an athlete's name on the Register of Defaulting Competitors means only that he or she has recorded a positive failed to provide a sample. The issues of guilt or innocence, inadvertent or delibpenses erate use, length of sanction, Commonand wealth view on the appropriateness of the sanction and so on are therefore issues for Government and non-government auis thorities other than the Agency. The Agency,_ therefore, will not be dertaking a range of related functions such as developing sports drug policies, liaising with law enforcement agencies, adjudicattract ing on penalties imposed by sporting fedon erations or conducting investigations, which the Senate Committee recomlarged mended. The Government considers that these are more properly within the province of organisations other than the Agency. example, drugs policy at Federal level is better handled by the Australian Sports Commission and by my Department in liaison with other Federal, State and ritory authorities. National sporting ganisations also have a role to play in imposing penalties and giving athletes fair hearing. However, the Agency will not isolate itself from these broader issues. It will draw upon key areas of expertise such the medical, legal, sporting and health ucation communities. It will have ternational role in enhancing testing processes, bilateral and multilateral agreements, updating of the International adjourned. Olympic Committee's list of banned substances and so on. It will have a significant education role. It will be involved, with the Australian Sports Commission, in discussions with national sporting bodies on uniform doping policies and sanctions. Financial ImpactÂ· Statement The strategic and annual operational plan requirements are in line with Government's commitment to overall fidaB), I move: list nancial management improvement within the public sector. In its strategic plan the Agency will be required to develop broad in performing its functions and the manner in which it proposes to perform its functions. Ministerial endorsement and tabling of the plan in both test or Houses will be required. The administrative and operational exrelating to staff, travel, meetings, day-today running costs of the Agency will be determined annually in the Budget. The Agency's budget in 1990-91 $2.143m which includes provision for 2,000 'public interest' tests to be fully unfunded from the Agency's budget. Tests additional to these' will largely be requested by professional sports under conto the Agency and will be conducted a 'fee for service' basis. It is hoped that this market will be progressively ento include neighbouring countries as they develop their own drug testing programs. This legislation is further evidence of For this Government's commitment to sport and its willingness to take positive steps to assist Australian sportsmen and sportswomen achieve their true potential by Tercompeting on an equal basis. The elimiornation of drugs in sport remains one of the key objectives of this Government. I a am sure honourable members on both sides of this House want to ensure that the long held Australian traditions of honesty and a fair go in sport are preserved for our children. This legislation is an as integral step in that process. I commend edthis Bill to the House. I present the exan inplanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate on motion by (Dr Bob Woods) NA NA NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",106
187,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUSTRALIA,"On behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, the Minister for the Small Business and Customs (Mr BedThat, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Martin Place, Sydney. The proposed work is for the refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia head office premises at 65 Martin Place, Sydney, New South Wales. The Reserve Bank building was completed in 1965 and extended in 1980. The premises are now in need of substantial refurbishment. The standards to which the building was designed are in a number of respects no longer consistent with modern building practice or current codes. Building services are nearing the end of their operational life. The proposed scope of work will involve upgrading of office areas and basement areas, including removal of asbestos fire-retardant materials from the original section of the building; upgrading of building services and the fire sprinkler system and installation of new ceilings, lighting and carpets. The external facades are in need of extensive restoration. The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in June 1990 and a public hearing was held in September, with a private meeting in October 1990. The Committee tabled its report on 13 November 1990. In its report, the Committee recommended that the refurbishment work should proceed at an estimated cost of $72.2m at June 1990 prices. It also made the following recommendations: that the Reserve Bank investigate the concept of joining with other banks located in the Sydney central business district to provide a child-care facility for its employees; that fire-retardant materials, including woollen carpets, be used throughout the building; that every effort be taken to reduce the impact of construction activities on the occupants of the building and on nearby premises; that the Reserve Bank advise the Committee on a six-monthly basis of progress and actual expenditure on the proposed work. The Reserve Bank has accepted these recommendations. On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Comof the mittee for its report. I commend the motion to the House.",108
188,Mr ROCHER,AUSTRALIA,"The Opposition, of course, does not oppose the proposed refurbishment of the Reserve Bank's headquarters in Sydney. It notes that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works did have the opportunity to examine it thoroughly. I notice that its Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), is in the chamber. We also noted when the report was tabled-or should have-that certain very necessary work is to be done, including the removal of asbestos in accordance with the best advice we have obtained on matters pertaining to health in the working environment these days. It is also necessary to make sure in public buildings owned or administered by the Commonwealth that the fire protection services are of the highest order. These buildings are also to be modified in a way which will provide the necessary protection. The recommendation of the Public Works Committee that fire retardant carpets should also be used throughout the building is eminently sensible with the objective of modern fire protection services in place. We presume that the refurbishment will facilitate the work of the bank, though it is surprising that since the most recent upgrade in 1980 there should be the need to spend something like $77.2m on this project. However, that has been examined by the Committee, and I have no doubt that its detailed deliberations were both careful and more than adequate. By providing the bank with these upgraded facilities, we will, of course, be facilitating the work of the relatively new Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Fraser. It is important that he and his staff have, if not the very best, certainly reasonable facilities in which to carry out their very important work because the Reserve Bank has had a load imposed on it, particularly since the appointment of Mr Fraser. In fact, we see more and more nowadays the Governor acting as the agent of government policy, and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) makes no secret of that. So it is important that the Governor have the facilities-both the premises and, naturally, the accommodation-for the staff that he needs to service his duties. In fact, if he is going to be the agent the Treasurer that he is and, if it is to the case that he will in future foreshadow Government policy rather than those icy statements being made in this chamterms ber, it is all the more important that premises are adequate. These days we find that we can get some inkling of what the Government inOpposition tends to do in its economic management by reading major speeches given by Mr Fraser, In fact, if we look at the speech he made a few weeks ago, we find more in it about the Treasurer's immediate and short term objectives for Australia than in this context. we will hear the Treasurer deliver in this place. So it is extremely important that these premises are of such an order that they enable Mr Fraser to carry out his work and that the most modern of equipment be installed in them. That includes puter based and related equipment and facilities. He will have to make some very important decisions in the absence of decisions from the Treasurer. Whatever the rights and wrongs of that, that certainly seems to be the role afforded to the Governor. No doubt, the Deputy Governor,   unknown to be a critic of the Government following and particularly of the Treasurer's policy, sional actions and inaction. We do rely heavily on people within. the system to second guess and to keep the public advised. Certainly, the Opposition is able to garner information from what is said by Mr  Wefind that very helpful. We also intend to study very closely what is said by them in future because it goes a long way towards helping us understand the Government's appreciation of the economic difficulties it has got itself into. As a consequence of these difficulties, 160,000 Australians have been added to unemtion ployment lists. They would be looking for the day when we see some more hopeful news emanate from the office of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. What he is going to do for accommodation in the meantime, I am not sure. I of hope that adequate provision has been be made because, as I have said, he administers probably the only reliable instrupolment of government economic policy in of information on which we can the base our judgments and from which we can do the Government's job for it in informing the Australian public of where we might be heading. The Leader of the (Dr Hewson) did a pretty good job of that today. If it gets coverage, we hope that perhaps our task will be made a little bit less in terms of interpreting the jargon we hear coming from the other side and, in particular, from the Treasurer With those few remarks, I reiterate that the Opposition does not oppose the measure and, in fact, welcomes it. We hope that the refurbishment can be finished speedily and, as always, we hope that the proposed expenditure of $77.2m in this comyear's dollars will be on target. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveThat, in relation to the proceedings on the Bills, so much of the standing and sesorders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1990; Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Amendment Bill 1990; Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1990; Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 1990; Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990.",109
189,Mr FIFE,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The Opposition will be opposing the motion just moved by the Leader of the House, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). For the benefit of those who are not aware of what he is about to do, let me point out that for the second time this week the Government is guillotining legislation through the House of Representatives. We have just concluded three days of debate on 39 Bills, and now the Minister proposes to suspend Standing Orders so that he can move a motion to declare five Bills urgent and then put down a timetable for the consideration of those Bills with a view to finishing discussion by 10.25 this evening. What the Government is doing, of course, is outrageous. Those who know my background know that I have been in politics for a long time-IS years in this House and 18 years in the New South Wales Parliament, half of the time in government and half of the time in opposition. I have sat under Labor Prime Ministers, Liberal Prime Ministers, Labor Speakers and Liberal Speakers, and I have to say quite categorically that the standards being employed in this House at the present time are the worse that I have experienced and the worse that I have read about. I say with all the seriousness that I can muster that this Government is taking the people of Australia for granted. It is treating the House of Representatives with contempt and it is getting worse as it progresses. In the 1988 Autumn session it required the House of Representatives to deal with 53 Bills in a period of nine days. In the Budget session it actually worsened its record by requiring the House to deal with 49 Bills over a period of six days. In the Autumn session of 1989 the guillotine was used again. On that occasion no less than 32 Bills were dealt with in a period of four days. In the Budget session of the same year, 1989, 11 Bills were dealt with over a period of three days, 15 Bills in four days, and one Bill-and here the Government was quite magnanimous-was allowed one day, a total of 27 Bills over a period of eight days. In the Autumn session of this year the Government created a record. Thirty-four Bills were dealt with in a period of two days. As I said a moment ago, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week the House was required to deal with no fewer than 39 Bills. When the five Bills for today are added we will have considered a total of 44 Bills in 10 days. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there would not be a member of this chamber who hasÂ· had an opportunity to scrutinise every Bill that has come through the House, let alone read and study the contents and form a conclusion. I can see that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) is a bit cynical about this, but he has not been here long. When he has been here a bit longer and he is sitting on this side of the House-as he will be in the very near future-he will understand what it is all about. In the Parliaments I have sat in there has always been time for those who have had responsibility for the carriage of the legislation to deal with it in a proper way so that they can advise their colleagues. No-one is able to scrutinise every Bill but, as I said a moment ago, I believe that no one member of this House has been able to scrutinise the Bills as they should be scrutinised prior to their being debated and voted upon. One of the pieces of legislation that went through here in the last day or so was legislation to enable the new Australian Securities Commission to operate from 1 January this year. The shadow Minister for corporate law reform and consumer affairs, the honourable member for Higgitls (Mr Costello), did a magnificent job in advising the shadow Cabinet on its contents, but he had to admit that he had not had the time to go through the whole document. He had not had time to study it in detail. As one who had the responsibility for bringing the national companies and securities legislation into this House let me say to the Government that we put that legislation on the table in one session and dealt with it in the next session so as to give people an opportunity to scrutinise it. As a result of that exercise amendments were suggested, some from Government members, some from Opposition members. We accepted many of those amendments because they improve.d the legislation. I predict that that particular piece of legislation will be found wanting and the Government will have it back in some succeeding session to correct the problems that will be detected in due course. What is happening now is something that I did not think would ever happen in an Australian Parliament. We are now dealing with the bulk of the legislation by way of guillotine. This creates enormous problems for members on both sides of the House, not just in the Opposition. On Monday night of this week the shadow Ministry sat until 12.45 in the morning trying to deal with the legislation that had been introduced, most of it on the previous Thursday night; trying to get a grip on what the Government proposed so that we could, in turn, advise our party room on the Tuesday morning. This is rushing legislation through, taking all sorts of They are risks for the Government and for the people of Australia. This is contemptible and it is time that the Government gave an assurance that it will not happen again. There are many reasons why the legislation is being rushed through but there are two main ones. Firstly, the Government is not allowing this chamber to meet as often as it ought. This year we will meet for only 36 days. Thirty-six days out of 365 days is all that this House will meet for. That is the second lowest number of sitting days since Federation and the lowest for 50 years. The only time the Australian Parliament has sat for less time than we will meet during this year was in 1937. It is a disgrace. The second reason why the legislation is being truncated in this way and rushed through without proper scrutiny and debate is that the Government is not managing its affairs well. Instead of meeting on 21 August, we could have-Mr Snow-There is a third reason; what about the Senate?",110
190,Mr FIFE,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The honourable member came in at the right time. If he had waited about one minute he would not have made that interjection. We could have come back two or three weeks early; it is up to the Government to arrange the business. If we had come back two weeks early we could have dealt with the same amount of legislation spread over two additional weeks and still met the cut-off date that the Senate has applied. Can we blame the Senate? I do not know how many Bills are before the Senate that have to be dealt with by the end of the year, but this Government has the record for pushing things through this chamber, rolling them up into wheelbarrows, delivering them to the Senate and saying, 'Look, fix it all by Christmas'. That is what the Government has been doing. Because of that the Senate has wisely imposed a cut-off date. Whilst that cut-off date exists the Government should plan its program so that the legislation comes into this House in time to be dealt with in a proper way. While I am not privy to what is going on risks. in the Cabinet room, I suspect from the experience that I have had in government that Ministers and Minister's departments are not getting legislation up to Cabinet on time. We are going to come back in the middle of February next year and I suspect that when we get back we will be, to a large degree, freewheeling for the first couple of weeks. There might be a little bit of legislation around to start with. Then there will be a gap and then there will be the guillotine. The guillotine will be brought in again at the end of the Autumn session next year so as to rush through the legislation that some Minister, Ministers or departments have said they want by a certain date. Both on the basis of the contemptuous way that this Government is dealing with the House of Representatives and with the Senate, and because of the Government's mismanagement of the parliamentary calendar and the parliamentary program, we oppose the suspension of standing orders to allow this motion to be moved. We will vote against it, we will vote against the motion and we will vote against the allocation of time. So as to save time on that debate, let me point out to the House that if the allotment of time, as has been proposed and circulated, is adhered to, the Government will require the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill to be dealt with by 5.50 p.m. I would hope that the Leader of the House might amend the times that have been circulated. Forty minutes has been allowed for the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan GUarantee Amendment Bill, 40 minutes for the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill, 40 minutes for the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill and only 45 minutes for the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill. I plead with the Leader of the House for those proposed times to be amended before he puts the motion to the House. We oppose the motion for the suspension of standing orders and we will vote against it.",112
191,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"in reply-The honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) frequently has good advice for the Government, generally delivered privately as opposed to across the despatch box. Today was no exception as far as that was concerned. A number of points can be made in response. With all the best will in the world to the honourable member, I do not believe this place is as bad as the New South Wales Parliament, and I accept that as an act of hyperbole on his part for the purposes of making a point in debate. There are a number of different aspects of style by different governments, and the way in which we often choose to keep the legislative program discipline is different from that which the Opposition chose when it was in government, though the effect may be the same. I agree that the Government has had recourse to the guillotine more since it has been in office the Opposition had when it was in office. However, the Opposition when it was in office made far more use of the closure, which, whilst not as predictable in the allotment of time as the guillotine, has the same effect in closing debate. During the period of the Fraser Government, 439 closures were exercised by the Opposition; in our term of government 301 have been exercised over a slightly longer period. A closure has exactly the same effect as the guillotine except that the Government does not predict the hour of the day when the Bill closes. But debate is shut off by the guillotine and by the closure. The effect is exactly the same. The process, however, by which that is arrived at is somewhat different. The Opposition ought to reserve a bit of its unction for a consideration of different statistics. The second point that ought to be made is that when we were in Opposition on the occasions when we and others had a combined majority in the Senate we did not have the arrogance to state to the House of Representatives that we would consider no legislation after a particular date. The people of Australia, if any are masochistic enough to listen to this, ought to be advised that the Senate will consider this year no legislation passed by the House of Representatives after 16 November. Until the time of the guillotineMr Fife-They will have 70 or 80 Bills to do.",113
192,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,They will have; the honourable member is quite right.,113
193,Unknown,URGENT LEGISLATION,Opposition members interjecting,113
194,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"This is getting like the New South Wales Parliament! Until the time of the guillotine this House had passed 43 Bills. As of yesterday the Senate had passed 20. So, the House has passed, without the guillotine, substantially more legislation than the Senate. In addition to that, we have had in the course of the debate on the Appropriations Bills, both in the second reading and committee stages, the lengthiest period of debate that we have had on the Budget than for some considerable period of time. As I said, there were some 43 Bills. We have had plenty of legislation in the six or seven weeks that we have been considering legislation; without the guillotine we have passed 43 Bills. We have finally reached the point when, if we are going to meet that 16 November date imposed on us foolishly by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in the Senate, this is the only way in which we can get the legislation up to the Senate. We are not particularly proud that we have to do that, but we will not be moralised at by the Opposition, given its record on closure when it was in Government.

196,Mr FIFE,PAIRS,"The Leader of the Rocher, A. C. Ronaldson, M. J. C. House (Mr Beazley) has followed the advice that I gave him a few minutes ago. ScoU, Bruce Shack, P, D. He has altered the timetable for the consideration of these Bills. The time, of Sinclair, I. MCC. Smith, W. L. course, that has been allocated is still insufficient and I am sure he acknowledges Sullivan, K. J. Taylor, W. L. that; nevertheless the programming of the Bills is much better than that which was Wilson, I. B. C. Woods, Bob initially proposed. Wooldridge, M. R. L. This means, of course, that the House will sit for a further 35 minutes. I am sure that no honourable member on either side of the House will object to that course, because it will provide additional time, particularly for the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill, which, under the original timetable, would have been denied consideration of any description.

In the same period, the Senate had dealt with 20 of those 43 Bills. I remind him and the House that we will have dealt with 44 Bills in four days, compared to 43 Bills in six or seven weeks, I think that illustrates in a very graphic way the manner in which the Government is steam rolling Guarantee legislation through the House.

197,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Before everybody leaves the chamber, let me Costello, P. H. Cowan, D. B. assure honourable members that the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill is of Downer, A. J. G. Edwards, Harry very real importance and interest. First, I take members through the reason for this Fischer, Tim Fisher, Peter Bill, because it has a rather interesting background and gestation. The Bill was initiated largely as a result of the activiHall, Steele Halverson, R. G. ties of members of this Parliament. The former honourable member for WentHoward, J. W. Jull, D. F. worth, Peter Coleman, made representations on this particular matter, as did my Lloyd, B. MCArthur, F. S. colleague Senator Peter Baume, and there were also some efforts of my own for a short while. The introduction of this Bill represents Moore, J. C. Nehl, G. B. one of those very rare occurrences in parliamentary history when the impetus Peacock, A. S. Reid, N. B. originally came from the way in which legislation impacts upon a private citizen. Riggall, J. P. Rocher, A. C. The only comment I make about it is that, while the Bill may appear, as one reads it, a miraculous conception, it has Scott, Bruce Shack, P. D. in fact been a long time in gestation. Sharp, J. R. Sinclair, I. MCC.",116
198,Mr LLOYD,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Like nine months or a bit longer.,116
199,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I must say a good Taylor, W. L. deal longer than nine months. It is a Bill Truss, W. E. that was designed to remove an anomaly in the Australian Citizenship Act which Wooldridge, M. R. L. entrenches discrimination against citizenship through maternal lines. It is intended, therefore, to remove that bias and also to clear up some administrative difficulties in the operation of this Act. The Bill amends the Act to allow children born outside Australia and Papua New Guinea prior to January 1949 to acquire citizenship by descent through their mother, provided their mother was born in Australia or Papua New Guinea, or was naturalised in Australia before January 1949. Applications for citizenship under the new provisions must be made within five years of the commencement of this unique set of provisions. The applicant must be of good character and have been present in Australia at some time before May 1987. Provision also exists for children of applicants to be included in such applications. There is also a provision, I gather, for waiver of fees for people who might be able to access these provisions. The Bill will also ensure the validity registration of persons whose applications were lodged prior to their eighteenth birthday but who were not registered until after that date. It will also enable a parent's certificate of Australian citizenship to be amended to include the name of a child if the child was under 16 at the time the parent applied for citizenship or at the time the parent applied to include the child in his or her certificate. The provisions are designed to remove the present discrimination in the operation of this Act which has prevented a child born to an Australian mother acquiring her citizenship by descent in the same way that he or she could if it had been his or her father who was an Australian. The other provisions are essentially of a technical character and are unexceptional. They relate primarily to the use of forms and the imposition of fees. I guess that the Government in that case is trying for more abundant precaution to ensure that those forms and the use of them are valid and that the fees are validly imposed. I suspect that this situation has arisen because somebody has found out that the Government, in charging fees and in requiring the use of forms at the moment, is in some way doing so without legislative authorisation. It may be one of these things about which we are not told and that there is some challenge down in the bowels of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs which has put at risk these matters and, thus, for more abundant precaution, this provision is being slipped in. Mr Hand-We know about it.",116
200,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"We do not oppose this Bill, but I think it is important. Mr Hand-Stop talking nonsense and talk about the legislation.",117
201,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It is part of the legislation. It deals with fees and the provision of forms and the requirement to use forms in a particular way. As I mentioned, the background to this legislation did involve the case of an individual-Dr Geraldine Room, an overseas born child of Australian parents. Her mother was of Australian born; her father, a distinguished Australian academic and a member of the Australian armed forces, was born in the United Kingdom. If one wanted to find out details of this particular case, one could do no better than go to a article written by Robin Fitzsimons in which she outlined, in a very comprehensive and detailed way, the situation that affected this young lady. She was born in the United States, came here when she was five months old and spent the next 30 years of her life believing that she was an Australian, carrying an Australian passport. When she found out, having been for a relatively short period in the United Kingdom, that she was not an Australian it was a matter of very considerably moment to her. This situation arose because of the anomalies associated with the Citizenship Act in its original and amended versions. That is. the matter that we are seeking to redress. If she had been the daughter of an Australian father rather than an Australian mother, this problem would not have arisen. One might politely say that it was gender specific, but in fact it invol ved a very certain act of sexual discrimination, and the problem lay in the transitional provisions in the 1948 Act, which was intended to ensure that all existing Australians assumed for the first time the title of 'Australian citizen'. They were, in all cases before that time, British subjects. Geraldine fell through the net because she was born between 1944 and 1949, and because of the provisions of section 25 (1) (d) of the Australian Citizenship Act, which required that to qualify for Australian citizenship, applicants should have been normally resident in Australia for the previous five years. She was only five months old at the time, and she was not entitled to Australian citizenship through descent via her father since he was British . n . Her mother could not pass on citizenship either. That was the nature of the problem Dr Room faced, and that is the issue that is now being addressed. I thank the Minister for that, although it has taken four years to get to this stage. It is a good thing that Dr Room will become entitled to be an Australian citizen, and it is unfortunate her mother did not live long enough to witness this happy occasion and know that her daughter and grandchildren could proudly call themselves Australian citizens. I am pleased that in the gallery tonight we have Robin Fitzsimons who wrote about this matter at some length drawing it to the attention of us all. I also wish to take this opportunity to draw to the attention of the House some other issues relating to Australian citizenthey ship. As the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) will know, he recently wrote to me in response to my request that he might look at the situation concerning former British subjects who had not taken up opportunities to obtain Australian citizenship. The Minister has informed me by letter, and will tell us that former subjects were given a relatively long period to take up citizenship in Australia, but the fact is that over that time many have not seen fit to do so, in many cases largely through ignorance. This is a matter that is frequently raised with me, and most frequently raised by a unique group of people-that is, those individuals who were in Australia as British subjects before the last war and enlisted in the Australian forces, went overseas,fought to protect this country, and now find through inadvertence, through lack of application, that they have not taken up formal Australian citizenship. Some of those who seek to take up rights, or seek to have a declaratory certificate simply confirming that they are Australian citizens-in many cases, they may have been Australian citizens who had not formally taken up that citizenship and were not recorded in the processes as Australians; but they were able to serve overseas in our armies-find that there is nothing in the Department that says they are Australian citizens. They have to produce evidence-in a form which I have seen and which, I must say, is most detailed and comprehensive, but difficult to understand. Affected individuals have to pay a fee to get an Australian declaratory certificate, presenting the evidence to enable the Department to be able to make an assessment as to whether or not their claim to take up Australian citizenship is valid. By the time they have gone through that process they can then go and apply for an Australian passport. The situation is that they have to apply for a declaratory certificate and pay a fee; then they have to apply for an Australian passport and pay a fee. However, they are in a situation where, if they want to apply for a British passport in the meantime, as are perfectly entitled to do, they can do so for a fee that is a good deal cheaper than ours. If they choose to renew a British passport they do not have to go through this indignity, as they see it, of having to apply for a declaratory certificate in which they have to provide the evidence because no-one is able to simply look at a register and establish that. they British are Australian citizens. I know there is an honourable member on the other side of the House who wishes to speak and perhaps someone on my side of the House might wish to speak as well. I realise that the cut-off time is 8.15 p.m. and there are only 20 minutes left for the debate with the guillotine in place, but I do want to raise some other questions. Yesterday, as honourable members may know, I spoke at the National Outlook Conference sponsored by the Bureau of Immigration Research dealing with immigration issues. In my comments to the. Bureau and its audience I mentioned the issue of citizenship. Citizenship is an important question which I do not think the Government disputes. A good deal of effort has been put into promoting citizenship and encouraging people here to take up Australian citizenship. I wish to discuss today some of the reasons why Australian citizenship as such seems to be a matter which many people are not prepared to take up- even though they are long standing residents of this country. Some of the research produced indicates that quite variable approaches have been experienced with people from different nationalities. It is said that year after becoming eligible to apply, 40 to 60 per cent of Mediterraneans, north western Europeans and immigrants from the Third World have acquired Australiap citizenship, but only 25 per cent of immigrants from English speaking countries have sought citizenship after becoming eligible, and that is a significant factor. One has to ask what is it about Australian citizenship that leaves a large number of people who are permanently resident here to opt not to take up Australian citizenship? One has to ask oneself: what does one actually get when one takes up Australian citizenship? We know that as long as one was a former British subject resident in Australia before 1986 one has the right to vote. We know that if one wishes to work in the Public Service it may be helpful to be an Australian citizen. Jury service is another matter sometimes mentioned, but in the main there is little else which would encourage people to take that important step. This matter is not new as these questions have been addressed before. The report of the FitzGerald Committee to advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, which the Government commissioned, raised some of these issues, and it is interesting to reflect on the matters raised in the report because it recognised that the benefits of citizenship are very limited. However, it is an important step, it is a sign of commitment to Australia, and the report makes the point there may be ways and means by which Australian citizenship could be enhanced by the provision of other encouragements. We on this side of the House will be addressing those matters in the next few months as we consider the question of Australian citizenship. Whilst not suggesting that we have come to any conclusions, I simply make the point that a number of steps could be taken. One of the steps FitzGerald recommended was that we could restrict particular welfare benefits now available to noncitizens to citizens as a means of making some people apply for citizenship. FitzGerald raised that, I think quite properly, suggesting that there ought to be survival one benefits available, but non survival benefits ought to be examined. It is a proper question to address. Another matter he mentioned was the question of sponsorship of migrants, and it was suggested that might be an issueMr Hand-Citizenship on day one? If they do not take it up on day one?",117
202,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I did not say that. I am saying the report that your Government commissionedMr Hand-I am asking you what you are saying, not what the report says.",119
203,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"The report that your Government commissioned raised these IssuesMr Hand-It is time to put your cards on the table. Mr ,RUDDOCK-I will say exactly what I have said already in this speechMr Hand-You are ducking and weaving all over the place.",119

205,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"No, they are said very carefully for good reason. These are matters FitzGerald raised, and we have indicated that the Opposition is prepared to look at these matters, along with other issues, so as to give this important step some greater meaning. The Government itself ought to be prepared to look at these questions. It addressed them before and obviously dismissed them, but the question of Australian citizenship is one of great importance as can be seen by Dr Room's approach where she has put so much effort into ensuring that having lost it, been deprived of it, that she has been able to get it back. The Opposition supports the Bill.",119
206,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,120
207,Mr JENKINS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1990 makes a small number of amendments to the principal Act. The most important of those amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act is to allow children born outside Australia and Papua New Guinea prior to 26 January 1949 to acquire citizenship by descent through their mother in certain circumstances. There are another three minor amendments that improve the administration of the Act. It is very telling to have a look at the debate that was carried out back in 1948 on the original Bill, the Nationality and Citizenship Bill of 1948, because I do not think that many people realise that before Australia Day 1949 there was no such thing as Australian citizenship and that people resident in Australia were British subjects. So that gives some context for the debate that occurred back in 1948 at the time of the principal Act. No better can the attitudes of that time be reflected than in a comment made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, Mr Harrison, in his speech at the second reading stage in reply to Mr Calwell, who was the Minister who moved the second reading. On 18 November 1948, Mr Harrison said: . . . this bill reflects the views of separatists, and is directed towards the liquidation of the British Empire. The bill would destroy the principle of a common British citizenship. People would understand the differences of attitudes and values of this time. It was even more telling when I was flicking through the Hansard volume that had Arthur Calwell's second reading speech and I stumbled across a debate in Committee of Supply of the Estimates of 1948-49. The honourable member for Darwin, Dame Enid Lyons, was talking. I had not expected until stumbling across this quote that I would ever be in this House necessarily quoting something that Dame Enid Lyons had said. It was intriguing that, in her contribution to the Estimates debate in committee, she commenced: This is a man's country, and if anyone here should doubt the truth of that statement let him look around the chamber at the moment. My sex is represented by two members only. As a matter of fact, we have 100 per cent. attendance at the moment, while the other sex is not so strongly represented . . . So it says that one thing perhaps has not changed and that is the number of honourable members who are able to attend in the chamber during debates. The point is, however, that whilst the improvement in the number of females as honourable members of this House is only marginal, attitudes in the general community have changed and continue to change considerably. So I suppose that it would come as quite a surprise to people to learn that a transitional provision of the Act is still in place. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) quite adequately covered the provisions of the Act in his second reading speech. Those provisions were also covered by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) who lead for the Opposition. The honourable member for Dundas also went on to outline the role of certain people who have shown a great deal of interest. He mentioned Dr Fitzsimons, who has been in the gallery during stages of this debate. It is also important to note that the principal Act occurred at a time when other parliaments of the British Commonwealth were enacting similar legislation, as there was a move away from everyone being covered by British citizenship within the British Commonwealth. I am led to believe that we may be the first of those parliaments to rectify the anomaly of the transitional aspects of the legislation as we are doing in this amendment Bill. I want briefly to take this opportunity to say something about citizenship. One of the more pleasing roles as a member of parliament is to be able to attend citizenship ceremonies and to feel the great pride of those who come forward to take Australian citizenship. In an electorate like Scullin where just under 40 per cent of the population was born overseas, one can imagine that some of those citizenship ceremonies in my electorate are quite large. Before entering this place, in the year when I was the shire president of the municipality, I carried out the oath and affirmation to a touch under 1,000 people from the municipality. When I attend citizenship ceremonies conducted by municipalities like Broadmeadows and Whittlesea, where on the night there might be something like 250 to 300 people, one can understand the contribution that migrant Australians have made to such municipalities. I also attended, I think late last year, a corporate sponsored citizenship ceremony at the Ford Motor Co. of Aust Ltd. That again reflects the attitude of the Government in trying to accommodate and assist people in becoming Australian citizens. That is also very important. In the year of citizenship completed in September of last year, we had something like 119,000 applications for citizenship-l08,000 people became citizens. The annual report of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs outlines the background of some 130,000 people who became Australian citizens in the year ended 30 June. That is a considerable number and, quite rightly, as has been acknowledged by the honourable member for Dundas, this Government has taken a good deal of effort in promoting Australian citizenship and encouraging people to take up Australian citizenship. The important thing is, as was outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when he promoted the year of citizenship, that act of seeking citizenship should be entirely voluntary and made for reasons of genuine commitment. So it is very much about putting in place the type of information that is required, the climate that is required and the administrative processes that are required to enable people to take that step as and when they see fit. I am concerned that the honourable member for Dundas raised the recommendation of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies on the restriction of welfare benefits. Whilst it is true that we as a Government sponsored the inquiry-we have had a clear response to that inquiry-we have rejected that recommendation. It would concern me that if we were to pursue the question of whether migrant Australians, without becoming Australian citizens, should get survival benefits we would be placing in the equation in the decision making process of the individuals some form of punitive measure. That is unfair and contrary to the tenet of allowing and encouraging people to make a decision of it was their own volition. That is one of the important aspects that perhaps is often overlooked. It is not surprising that the major group that takes its time about taking out citizenship consists of British citizens. Sometimes it is not as clear to them and there is a greater need for them to be aware that their commitment is such that they want to take the step. Many migrant Australians play their role to the fullest in Australian society. One only has to look at the representation in this chamber to see that that is the case. Last night I attended a function where three of my former colleagues who departed this place after the last election were the guests of honour. It was perhaps coincidental that those three-being Lewis Kent, Peter Milton and Allen Blanchard-were all migrant Australians. I pay tribute to those people as an example of the achievement and contribution that migrant Australians can make. It is important that the House supports this legislation. It reflects modern views about where females play their role in society and it is very important that the amendments that ani contained in the Bill be carried.",120
208,Mr NUGENT,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"1 will speak somewhat personally because I too am in the category that the honourable. member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) was talking about-I am a migrant-as I know are other members of this chamber. I was fortunate enough to be able to choose the country where I came to live. I could have gone to Canada-which is probably a bit cold-or New Zealand or wherever, but I chose Australia for a number of positive reasons. I consider myself very fortunate and certainly have no regrets. Mr Ruddock-I think we are very fortunate as well.",121
209,Mr NUGENT,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I thank the honourable member for Dundas. I brought my wife and children as well. I might add that I also had my grandchildren here and I hope that before Ilea ve this place, they will be voting for me as well. Last Monday I had my 77-year-old mother visiting from England. She sat up in the gallery. It happened to be her day. She, like most mothers, obviously had had some reservations about her son going overseas to live and certainly some reservations about giving up his original citizenship. When she came here and saw this wonderful country of ours, she well understood why I came, stayed and became an Australian. I became a citizen in the early 1980s, having come here in the late 1970s. Not only have I become a citizen, but I felt, as I believe all migrants who come here and intend to stay should, that I should cut my formal links with my previous country. I have renounced my British citizenship quite specifically because I think that it is the right thing to do.",122
210,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,And pledged your loyalty to this country.,122
211,Mr NUGENT,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Absolutely. People come here for a variety of reasons: for the peace and security; in many cases, for democracy; for the rule of law; for the opportunity to better one's lot; and for freedom of the individual. I came here for a number of these reasons. These benefits are there not only for my wife and myself, but for the future opportunity of my children and grandchildren. I believe that we should encourage all of our migrants to become citizens. It is an expression of their commitment to this country and represents an acceptance by their fellow countrymen. But it should carry with it responsibilities as well as rights and benefits. By 'responsibilities' I mean the responsibility to vote, to do jury service and to uphold the values and to recognise the first allegiance to this country. Having come from the United Kingdom (UK), I regret to say that there are large numbers of British migrants who do not take up citizenship. They ought to recognise that the UK is no longer home if they have been here for 25 years and that they ought to take the step by declaring their loyalty here. They and all others, however, perhaps need incentive. Perhaps we can provide some of that incentive, and the coalition birthwould certainly wish to move in the direction of providing incentive, in the sense of getting rid of some of the niggling costs, certainly streamlining some of the complicated rules, getting rid of some of the bureaucracy and the confusion about dates-for example, 'Did you come before this date or after that date?' - age, where one's parents were born and so on. But we also need standards for our citizens. Compared with other countries, we have perhaps the least rigorous citizenship qualifications of almost anywhere. Trying to get into the United States of America, for example, is like pulling hen's teeth. We have to develop pride in being a citizen. People must want to be a citizen and it should be a prized objective of all migrants. I go to citizenship ceremonies, as do other members, and I tell the story about my citizenship. I say, 'I sat in that chair eight years ago and took out my citizenship'. I meet a variety of people-some old, some young and some who have been here for years and wished that they had taken out their citizenship earlier. I stress the unifying aspects of Australia and our values as a nation. But the overriding aim is to identify with Australia first and foremost, for all Australians, and we should be proud of it.",122

214,Mr LLOYD,SCHEME LOAN GUARANTEE,"The purpose of the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Amendment BillÂ· 1990 is to provide a government grant of $5m for a loan guarantee for commercial borrowings up to $40.9m, which will be used to buy out units from the fishery in an effort to reduce the fishery from 96,000 units to 50,000 units. There is agreement that the fishery should be reduced in size because of declining stock, but there is some debate about whether it should be reduced to 70,000 or to 50,000 units and how this should be done. The management plan has been tabled under regulations and will be not part of this legislation. The coalition parties are still considering the fairness of this plan. The Government introduced a buy-back scheme in 1985 and this has reduced the number of boats from 302 to 217 and the units from 133,274 to 96,400. The major problem with the voluntary adjustment scheme was escalating costs and the fact that the scheme ran out of money. Had there been more money at the beginning of this year when was there was such a poor banana prawn season, more units would have been taken out of the fishery. Initially, units were bought for about $120, but later reached $700 until the money ran out. Under this legislation, from January to April fishermen will be able to sell their units to the buy-back system for $450 a unit and a further $500 a unit if taking their boat out of the fishery. When the buy-back finishes in April 1991, if the fishery is not down to 50,000 units, then units will be compulsorily acquired without compensation after April 1993. The number of units each boat holder will be forced to surrender at that time will depend on how many are needed to be taken out of the fishery to bring it down to 50,000 units. While many people argue that 70,000 units is biologically sustainable, it appears that the Government is really more interested in the fishermen making a profit so that it can extract a resources rent tax. It believes that, at 50,000 units, the fishery will be economically efficient and able to pay the tax. The one-boat owners-that is, the single-boat owners-will be faced with having to buy units just to keep fishing, because unless they have the correct number of units on their boats, they will lose their licences in April 1993 when compulsory surrender comes in. Many will need about 250 units just to stay in business and then they will have to pay the levies to pay back the money borrowed in the buy-back scheme: There will be a pool where 40 per cent of all voluntarily surrendered units are placed. The multi-boat owners have first access to the pool and can claim back 30 per cent of the units they have surrendered on other boats. Fishermen with only one boat will then be able to buy units from the pool at $500 each. How these will be divided between the small operators has not yet been decided. The pool isÂ· not expected to have enough units in it to satisfy the needs of the small operators, who will then have to compete against other operators to buy the additional units needed to enable them to continue to earn their living from fishing. Fishermen have expressed a concern about having to pay up to $5,000 a unit on the open market and some believe they may have to find about $lm just to be able to continue fishing. In other fisheries when stocks are tight quotas have been put in place, and while this is difficult with prawns, it is not impossible. If this were done, at least fishermen could continue to fish, although with a reduced catch and income, but at least they would be debt free. Virtually all the fishermen want the buy-back system, the Government money and the Government guarantee for the loan but they do not want compulsory acquisition. As this Bill covers only the money-that is, the loans and the guarantee-the coalition will support the legislation. The money borrowed to buyout units will be paid by a levy on all units remaining in the fishery. The management plan, including the compulsory acquisition, covered in regulations. I want to assure fishermen-that is, those in the northern prawn fishery-that we are looking closely at the regulations to decide whether we should object to them. The Government is, in my view, using blackmail by saying that if we object to compulsory acquisifishery tion without compensation, the money will not be provided for the buy-back scheme. But the important principle is that there is equity within the fishery between different categories of boat owners. If there is no agreement with the ernment on the management plan, it will ing to address. not provide the $5m grant or the loan money for restructuring. This would hurt the people who are in financial trouble and want to sell their units. However, do have to weigh up whether more people will be hurt by just allowing the manageYork ment plan to proceed. At this stage there are many unanKarumba swered questions. Why are so many boat owners-in the sense of single-boat owners; the boats are not necessarily small-against the plan? Why are the fleet owners so anxious to have the plan? Is it a fact that the fleet owners are not cura rently as profitable as the single and boat owners, as they claim? Will the fleet owners just be restructuring their fleet the help of levies paid by single-boat ers? Is it a scheme to get small boats of the industry? Is it about stocks or ing fishermen viable enough to pay a sources rent tax? How will the units in the pool be divided among the small boat one. owners? What will be the effect on employment and the fishery generally? We need to have these answers by early December because at that time the time limit on blocking regulations in the Senate will expire and a decision will be made between now and then by the Opposition in the best iriterests of that fishery. In the meantime, since this legislation, as I said earlier, is for the Government grant and the loan guarantee, which everybody in the fishery supports, we will support the legislation.",123
215,Mr HULLS,SCHEME LOAN GUARANTEE,"My comments on the Northern Prawn Fishery is Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Amendment Bill will be brief. This Bill is a shining example of the way industry and government can work together to achieve common industry goals. In this case the goal is to virtually have the number of boats in the northern prawn to about 110 by 1993. Overfishing has been recognised as the most significant long term problem facing the fishing industry since at least 1971, when the first the northern prawn fishery management scheme was introduced. It is a problem that operators of the northern prawn fishGovery and the Government have been seekThe northern prawn fishery, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, extends across we northern Australia from Cape Londonderry in Western Australia east to Cape in Queensland. Karumba, a town in my electorate famous for its prawns and crabs as well as for its animal bar at the Lodge Hotel, is at the centre of small the northern prawn fishery. Since fishing in the northern prawn fishery started in the early 1960s, the fishery, like fisheries worldwide, has gone through continuing cycle of boom and bust. The dual effects of the boom and bust cycle are obviously felt by everyone in Karumba with and in coastal towns across northern Ausowntralia. I am pleased to say that the volout untary adjustment scheme has the support makof most in the industry in the area. Low reprofitability and overexploitation are understood by all to be no good for anyAs marine fisheries are community owned resources, the Government has a responsibility to ensure that they are managed not only in the best interests of the people in the industry, who have the right to exploit them, but also in the best interests of the entire Australian community. The northern prawn fishery is the most valuable fishery managed by the Commonwealth. As a high proportion of Australian seafood is exported, there is all the more reason to ensure that the industry undergoes the necessary restructuring to ensure its long term viability. This responsibility includes ensuring not only that the resource is sustained for future generations but also that its exploitation is rational and, indeed, efficient. This Government has been working with the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Committee to do just that. The traditional way to inhibit excessive investment in fisheries has been to impose restrictions on fishing efficiency, which had the effect of increasing fishing costs and removing much of the incentive for innovation. This Government is determined to restructure fisheries so that these inefficiencies can be removed and fisheries can play their proper role in the national economy. The principles of sustainable development are obviously intrinsic to the restructuring. If the northern prawn fishery is fished out because of uncontrolled exploitation, we all lose. There will be no more prawns to throw on the barbie. This Bill results from the recommendations of a joint government-industry task force and the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Committee. Throughout the process, industry was widely consulted and there were a number of meetings with people involved in the fishing industry at the principal ports. This Bill builds on the voluntary adjustment package introduced in 1985. Since that date $16m, $13m of which has been contributed by the fishing industry, has been spent on a buy-back scheme which has reduced the number of boats entitled to fish in the northern prawn fishery from about 302 to about 215. While this has been a major achievement, both the fishing industry and the Government agree that the adjustment has been too slow because of restrictions introduced to avoid the collapse of the tiger prawn sector of the fishery and, indeed, the collapse of the Japanese prawn market in 1989. In December 1989 the Government released a policy statement titled New Directions for Commonwealth Fisheries Management in the 1990s. In the statement, the Government indicated that it believes that fisheries management must now place greater emphasis on preventing wastage of economic resources and ensuring that exploitation does not endanger the future viability of fisheries resources. The December statement also emphasised the . need for commercial fishing operations to be economically efficient using the most appropriate technology to achieve the greatest net retums. The statement also recommended that, assuming new profits are generated, the fishing inhas dustry should make appropriate payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource for private gain. This policy will be given effect to in legislation that will be introduced in the autumn sitting. The fishing industry now recognises that the 1985 voluntary adjustment scheme has not gone far enough and more drastic action is required if the northern prawn fishery is to be restored to sustained profitability and if pressure on the resource is to be reduced so as to allow some of the restrictions on efficiency to be removed. The new approach set out in this Bill is also based on restructuring the industry through a very generous buy-back program. Under the new scheme, those who elect to withdraw boats from the fishery will receive a fixed price for each fishing unit surrendered. In addition, they will receive a fixed rate per unit as a redeployment payment in compensation for the likely loss on sale of the boat or for converting the boat to some other fishery or use. However, under the new package the voluntary buy-back part of this scheme will operate only for a strict three-month period at the beginning of 1991. This means that those boat operators who leave before April 1991 will receive very generous compensation packages. To help finance the buy-back program the Government will provide a guarantee for a commercial loan of up to $40.9m to be repaid over some 10 years. The Government will also provide a grant of $Sm over three years from the national fisheries adjustment program to assist the industry to repay the loan in the initial years while profits are building up. The new package goes further than the buy-back scheme, however, and sets a fixed target size for the fishery of SO,OOO fishing units by the start of the 1993 ing season. This is because past experience has indicated that, for the restructuring schemes to be successful, a fixed target is essential. Otherwise, millions of government and industry dollars can be spent without an assured outcome or significant increase in profit. In 1987 the industry had the Senate reject a proposal to reduce the fleet to 70,000 units by 1990, claiming that this could be achieved by the buy-back scheme without any compulsory component. Someone had been 'coming the raw prawn', as there are still 96,000 units in fishery. If the target provided for in this Bill is not met, a pro rata compulsory surrender with special provision for single boat operators will be implemented to bring the number of units down to a more satisfactory SO,OOO. In conclusion, there really is nothing fishy about this Bill. It will secure the future of the northern prawn fishery. We must put paid to the preponderance of piscatorial predators. I fully support this Bill.",124

219,Mr SNOWDON,SCHEME LOAN GUARANTEE,"I must say that I was keen to address it in some detail, Mr Deputy Speaker.",126
220,Mr REID,SCHEME LOAN GUARANTEE,Fishing for an angle.,126
221,Mr SNOWDON,SCHEME LOAN GUARANTEE,"That's it. There are a number of aspects of this legislation which I would like to address. Firstly, the reforms will enable the industry to plan for a stronger, healthier future. The honourable member for Kennedy has gone through in some detail the benefits which will accrue to the industry as a result of these measures. The major problem which has been affecting the prawn fishery has been its exposure to cyclical booms and busts. Both industry and government agree that major reforms are needed to manage the northern prawn fishery efficiently. The issue is that the industry has a classic economic and ecological problem, namely, efficient management of a resource for. which there are no property rights. The problem is that when prices are buoyant there are additional entrants to the industry. This causes an oversupply of boats in times of low prices. There are, of course, also ecological problems with this, as resources then tend to be overexploited. Clearly, on this basis the industry requires restructuring and the Federal Government has taken a leading role in working with the industry. I must compliment those involved in the indusof try for their participation in consultations and negotiations which have gone into that this legislation to introduce a .package sensitive to the needs of the northern ing operators. While on that point, I would like mention two individuals in particular and their roles in the industry. One is David Dunstan, who is the executive officer of the Northern Territory Fishing Industry Council, and the other is Eddie Kemp, who is the Northern Territory's representpackage ative on the Northern Management Adit visory Council. Both of these people have been involved in the industry for a long time, as I am sure that the honourable member for Kennedy would know. The dent, leadership of the fishing industry has a very responsible attitude in the which it has addressed the rationalisation of the fishing fleet. I would like to commend Mr Kemp for the role he has taken and the way in which he has represented his industry's interests on the Northern Management Advisory Council and Mr Dunstan for his role in the Northern Territory Fishing dustry Council. There have been some problems in that there are some aspects of the outcome involved in this legislation which not everyone is totally happy with. I think it would be dishonest of me suggest that everyone was happy. But in broad terms there is general agreement about the necessity of this islation and the approach that has been adopted by the Government. For that, again I would like to commend both the Government and the industry for the way in which they have been able to come that resolution. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you would be aware that the 1987 voluntary buy-back has proved totally inadequate, as the honourable member for Kennedy this said. I am absolutely certain that you would know all about that. Mechanisms are needed to speed up the restructuring Kennedy. of the industry. Under the buy-back provisions, boat operators receive $450 for each unit surrendered plus $500 per unit as a compensation for likely loss of sale the boat. Therefore, a total of $950 is paid for each unit. The industry agrees this offer is reasonable, given that the average return per unit per annum, in fishterms of fishing, is $1,245. The Bill before the House is a twoto phased package: voluntary restructuring first then, if further restructuring is required, pro rata reductions in fishing rights. The buy back provisions will cease on 1 April 1991, at which time the compulsory pro rata surrender begins. The before us is a major reform, and is understandable that industry participants are concerned to ensure that restructuring occurs for the betterment of all in the industry. I am absolutely confias is the Government, that the needs taken of the industry can be accommodated way in within the current package. There is one aspect which should be of interest to the House. Obviously, there are a lot of boats coming on to the market as a result of this restructuring process and license buy-outs. A by-product of the problems in the Middle East is a lot of uncertainty in the market now for the sale Inof these boats. This uncertainty is obviously a consequence of the Middle East conflict because the Middle East has been a market for these second-hand trawlers. I think it is important to recognise that, to whilst we are taking people out of the industry, they end up retaining a capital asset-a boat. This is a sizeable capital investment. To recoup that investment, legthese people obviously have to move the asset on somehow, especially those people who are owner-operators with no other source of income at the time that they surrendered their licence. It is important to that they are able to use that boat for another purpose or to move it on in a way which gives them a satisfactory return on their investment. I do not want to say too much more on legislation. I have to say that I cannot come up with the same sort of quips as my comrade the honourable member for Mr LloydWe are pleased about that.",126

223,Mr DOWNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is my humble duty to take the place on this occasion of the honourable member for  on his behalf the coalition's position this particular piece of legislation. I he has probably chosen me because shadow Minister for Customs for a brief period. A lot of these details have escaped me in the years that have ensued since . then. I am indebted to the honourable member for Forrest for providing me some guidance on this legislation. The first point we make is that Customs and Excise Legislation Amendorgans, ment Bill was only introduced into the House of Representatives on Tuesday. legislation which is fairly complicatedHawke) although I know from my own experitries ences that it has been discussed from time to time with people within the commuenough, nity-to be introduced on Tuesday and then debated the following Thursday ning does not show, in my view, a very great regard for the process of debate legislation in this Parliament. I think is regrettable. Certainly from our point view it makes it much more difficult us to scrutinise this legislation effectively, as certainly would be the case with number of members on the other side the House. . Despite that we are prepared to support the legislation-legislation which is really divided into three parts. The first part relates to export reporting processes. The Bill proposes to amend the Customs ActÂ· to provide the legislative framework for the introduction of electronic entry and cargo reporting systems for exports, a system known appropriately as EXIT, and be for export details to be reported prior to departure. Under the present arrangement exporters are required to lodge details of all goods exported manually and after the goods have left the country collective lodgement of details on a periodic basis is apparently permitted. 1990 The Australian Customs Service considers that the existing system has two basic disadvantages. As those particular returns that reporting form the main source of data for the balance of payments figures, the amount of time taken and the accuracy of those figures is affected in a deleterious way' because of what Customs believe is a misuse of the scheme. Exporters under the existing arrangements lodge on details well after the goods have departed think and in some instances, I understand, do I was not even lodge details at all. The second disadvantage of the existing scheme is that the procedure undermines the control of Customs officers in identifying and assessing high risk goods and with prohibited exports. The House is probably aware that prohibited exports in the clude things such as human blood and drugs, equipment for military use, as well as goods for prohibited destinaFor tions and-the Prime Minister (Mr would like to hear this-counsuch as South Africa, and also, under present circumstances, Iraq. Interestingly we were exporting military equipment to Iraq right up to the time Iraq eveinvaded Kuwait. But I digress. The Bill proposes to overcome these of problems by requiring details of goods that exported to be reported prior to their deof parture. This will bring the collection of for export data into line with the procedure for collecting import data which is ala ready in place. This collection of export of figures prior to departure will have an impact on the statistical outcome of Australia's balance of payments figures probably sometime early next year, in February or March. There is a view that it may show as a result of these changes that Australia's halance of payments figures in February and March of next year look more favourable than they might otherwise be. We would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that when those figures are finally published in March and April next year it is likely that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will claim that they show the wonderful success of the Government's policies, whereas the reality is that they will be directly affected by the change in the statistical method of collecting figures. That will be a point we will make at the time. Indeed, if the figures do not show a wonderful improvement in our balance of payments that will be something very serious to worry about. To facilitate the collection of export tails the Australian Customs Service has proposed, as I have said, to introduce this new electronic transmission reporting system known as EXIT. We on this side of the House were concerned about the cost to exporters of accessing this new electronic data system. I remember that even when I was the shadow Minister for Customs this was something of an issue with ,exporters. In particular, there was concern as to whether exporters would have to subscribe to the Customs network. We have been reassured, I gather, that the Australian Customs Service has not placed any charge on access to the system. which is to be welcomed. To access EXIT, exporters will require the appropriate software and this will impose some cost on those exporters, but it is expected to be a cost of somewhere in the vicinity of $200. That will not be popular but it has to be taken into account that exporters typically will achieve some administrative savings by using the new system and therefore the net cost is likely to be very much less than $200. It is worth noting that exporters will not be forced to join the EXIT system. They will have the option of participating in the program directly, of engaging an approved EXIT user or of using a manual pre-shipment export entry system. That raises questions still about how accurate these balance of payments figures are going to be, given that people will have a range of choices as to how to lodge these statistics. Nevertheless, I recall that it was something that we argued for some time ago-that there be a range of choices because of the concern expressed by exporters about possible costs. The Bill provides the legislative framework for the operation of EXIT, including procedures for applications and allocation of an identifying code, provisions for the system going down-crashing as they those say-and also security procedures. The honourable member for Forrest has reminded me that this proposed system brings Customs procedures into what he describes-frankly, I think, rather euphemistically-as the twenty-first century. deCongratulations to the. Australian Customs Service if this really is twenty-first century technology. Anyway, it certainly is an advance. Mr Beddall-Best in the world.",128
224,Mr DOWNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister says that it is the best in the world. He should remember that it was not dreamed up when he was the Minister; it was dreamed up well before his time-of that I can assure him. The second aspect of this legislation is that which deals with advanced vessel reporting. New sections are introduced which provide for the advanced reporting of ships and aircraft, their cargo and their crew. At present the master owner or pilot of a ship or aircraft is required to report the arrival of that vessel and details of cargo carried to the Australian Customs Service within one day of arrival. The Australian Customs Service has identified this post-arrival reporting procedure as an impediment to effective contraband enforcement. For a very long time we on this side of the House have been continually urging Customs to give a high priority to effective contraband enforcement. It has given it a high priority, what is more. This Bill proposes that more detailed information be provided at a time prior to arrival. However, where only one reconundrum. port used to have to be furnished to the Australian Customs Service, as I have mentioned, the result of these amendrepealing ments is that there will be four separate reports which will have to be submitted. That obviously has some administrative implications for the vessel owners and pilots. The Australian Customs Service has been at pains to point out that although the number of reports to be submitted has increased, the actual volume of inforamendment mation supplied remains unchanged. The Bill introduces clauses which this information can be provided electronically. The amendment, interestingly enough, is in line with the Australian toms Service policy to protect the Austrarospective lian community against the importation of narcotic and illegal goods by tightening control and scrutinising more closely barrespects rier entry. Understandably, we have real difficulties with that. The final aspect of the legislation relates to prohibited imports. Clause 49 of the Bill proposes to validate past dangerous goods which had been seized on the basis that they were prohibited . imports under item 18 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Item was introduced on 14 December 1956 the Menzies Government. It prohibited the importation of 'goods which, in the opinion of the Minister, are of a dangeraly ous character and a menace to the comtions munity'. Goods seized under this item have cluded machine guns, flick knives, landaround mines-fancy people bringing landmines into Australia-flamethrowers, children's that toys which do not meet safety requirements and so on, However, the Federal the coalition Court in the Owen v. Turner and Jones case found that item 18 was invalid. basis of its decision was that item 18 is an unauthorised delegation of the Goveragreement nor-General's power under section 50 of the Customs Act 1901 to prohibit the importation of goods. Consequently, goods which had previously been understood to have been prohibited imports and hence were seized were not in fact prohibited imports at all. It certainly created quite a The Government has already addressed the future control of dangerous goods by item 18 and inserting new items into the regulations to prohibit the importation of former item 18 goods. This was effected in October, just last month. The for amendment we are addressing this evening is intended to deal with the status of actions taken before 11 October 1990 under item 18. Therefore-and this is in principle something of a concern-the is retrospective back to 1956 when, as I mentioned earlier, item 18 was provide that originally introduced. Any retrospective legislation, in particCusular legislation which provides for a retliability, is a very considerable cause for concern. Among other things it removes the rights of citizens in some and it can prejudice, at least in no theory, a person's legal rights. We have considered this in some detail and certainly had to look at the issue of the principle of retrospectivity and weigh it up against the practice of what has hapseizures of pened since 1956. In this case if the section were not made retrospective-and that is obviously the 18 alternative proposition-then all dangerby ous goods seized by the Australian Customs Service since 1956 could be returned into the community. Because of an anomin the way the legislation and regulawere originally drafted, we would have back all the flick knives, landmines, inflame throwers and machine guns floating the community. We have had to take that into account, and our view is tion-I in the interests of community protechave to say, in this particular instance, in the interests of cOinmonsenseconsiders it appropriate that The the provision be made retrospective. The Government should not take our on this occasion to mean that we will sanction retrospective legislation in general. We certainly will not. It is important to underline the point that in principle we are totally opposed to retrospective legislation, and this is a very special case where the principle, if you like, of non-retrospectivity is somewhat outweighed by the common sense principle of allowing all this dangerous equipment back into the community. It is a very difficult choice and a very difficult decision for the Customs Service and the Government to make, but let me emphasise that we are prepared to support the decision that they have made and to support the three aspects of this legislation: the introduction of the Exit reportthis ing system, the advance vessel reporting procedures and the changes to prohibited imports.",129
225,Mr MARTIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"ln entering this debate tonight 1 congratulate the Opposition for the support that has been given to the passage of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment BilL On a day like today, when a report on the operation, of the Australian Customs Service has been tabled by one of the Parliament's committees, it is appropriate that we are dealing with legislation complementary to that report. The report to which 1 refer, a report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, entitled Risky businessThe 37, 000 kilometre challenge goes to some of the specific issues contained in this legislation. As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said in his contribution tonight, this legislation was introduced only on Tuesday. The Government is debating it today. Today a report was tabled which complements the legislation, and immediately we have action. That is government in action. We do not muck around. If there is a need to put computers in place, it is done. The legislation is in; debate it; we will vote on it tonight. The Customs Service will probably have the first computer switched on next week. That is what this Government is all about when it comes to the process of cracking down on the importation of illegal drugs, looking at ways to facilitate the movement of legal goods into and out of Australia and, of course, just facilitating the import and export community in all its various guises. As was mentioned by the honourable gentleman opposite, there are three basic parts to the legislation. The first is a group of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to provide the legislative framework for the introduction of an electronic entry and cargo reporting system for exports, known as Exit, and the consequential repeal of the export return scheme. Early in the autumn session the Committee of the Parliament, which tabled first report on the Customs Service today will be tabling a second report on Customs dealing specifically with the import-export subprogram. The specific matter of the Exit system being put in place has been brought to the attention of .the Committee by a number of people in the export community. It is therefore appropriate that tonight we see that the legislation is providing for that to be put in place almost immediately. As was mentioned in the second reading speech, the legislation will assist the Customs Service to play a crucial role in the reform of the flow of cargo documentation and information by putting electronic initiatives to good use. During the contribution of the honourable member for Mayo 1 heard the Minister for Customs and Small Business (Mr Beddall) interject that the Australian Customs Service is the premier customs service in the world. It leads the world in terms of its initiatives in electronics, drug combating and a range of other matters associated with the free flow of goods into and out of Australia. Certainly from the perspective of the Committee that conducted this inquiry and the ongoing inquiry, 1I have to suggest that the honourable member is absolutely we correct. We have seen a willingness on the part of the Australian Customs Service to embrace the latest technology and drive that technology so that Australia benefits. 1 commend the Customs Service, as 1I have done previously in legislation that has come before this House, because of that initiative which is displayed. 1 also want to comment specifically on the part of this legislation that goes particularly to the continual fight that this Government-and, indeed, this Parliament-have brought against the flow of narcotics into this country. I can recall that in past debates on customs legislation this issue was raised, and raised very fiercely, by honourable members on both sides in their opposition to the importaor tion of narcotics, illegal substances, into this country. I am pleased therefore that this legislation and the changes being troduced tonight represent a further tightthat ening of that particular set of screws against the importation of illegal narcotics into this country. The Committee report to which I referred earlier was able to demonstrate, through tables and through the report self, that the Customs Service has been spectacularly successful in its crackdown on the importation of illegal substances into this country. In 1987 the seizures heroin, cocaine, cannabis and other forms adopted. of drugs amounted to something like 550; that rose in 1.988 to 831 and rose again in 1989 to 1,130; in the period January 1990 to May 1990 the number of sdzures of those illegal substances was of the der of 579. What we have also seen is that the quantity of drugs seized by the Australian Customs Service in that time has also increased. This can say either one of two things. Firstly, it could be put down the Customs Service's methods such as the use of electronic initiatives and advance reporting of shipments coming in, as is proposed in this legislation, the risk assessment management technarcotics nique which is put in place, the training programs which it has given to its emrunners ployees, improvements in the administrathe tion and efficiency of the Customs or simply to the dedication of the employees themselves who work at the barrier. could be put down to those simple reavast sons. Alternatively, it could be put down to the unfortunate fact that perhaps people are still importing drugs in considerable quantities into this country. I would think it is probably a combination of both. Certhrough tainly, as I said earlier, the performance of the Customs Service is nothing short of outstanding and the dedication is nomenal. In terms of where that dedication is directed, of course, one only has to look again at a second table that appears in the report, where quite clearly we see that it is air passengers, either with or without accompanying baggage, air cargo, postage sea vessels which are being used to import those quantities of drugs. I think that that puts to bed something of a myth inin the community that a lot of the drugs come into this country are dumped at remote locations around our coastline. In fact, the statistics show that that is not the case. Australia has 37,000 kilometres of coastline, and if one is trafficking in something that is worth a lot of money, itone wants to get it to the destination quickly. That is why the Customs Service, with its initiatives at the airports and the ports, is doing the right thing in terms of of the management strategies that it has As I say, this legislation also makesamendments to schedules 6 and 8 of the Customs Act, dealing with prescribed commercial and trafficable quantities of orproscribed narcotic substances, to address the fact that the Act's control regime for specified narcotic substances does not extend to analogues of those substances. In other words, the amendments create a catch-all provision for the designer drugs to that we hear so much about these days. The unfortunate thing again is that, no the matter how sophisticated the techniques adopted by the Australian Customs Servor to ice are in combating the importation of into this country, they are matched by the sophistication of the drug in their efforts to get drugs into country and to meet a market which, Service, unfortunately, is still here. What we have seen in the past is the It ability to conceal trafficable quantities, quantities in some cases, of powdered drugs in wine bottles, in shampoo bottles, furniture and so on. If it was not for the combined resources of the Customs Service-using data which it collates a variety of different enforcement groups within the community, such as the Australian Federal Police, the National pheCrime Authority (NCA) and the State police forces, as well as its own intelligence gathering network-if it was not for the use to which the dog drug detector unit is put, and if it was not for the ingenuity and just the gut feeling quite often of the Customs officers themselves, the number of seizures of drugs coming into this country would, I suspect, be much lower and the quantity of drugs coming in would be much greater. As I said at the outset, it is my considered view that this legislation is timely; meets certainly a demand within the Australian community for continued high standards to be set by Australia's Customs Service at the barrier; it makes timely amendments to the Customs legislation; and I welcome the fact that the Government's actions in this regard have been put into place so quickly-the legislation having been introduced on Tuesday, a committee report having been tabled today, the legislation being debated tonight and about to be passed. I wish it speedy passage through the Parliament. I am pleased, as I said, to see that the Opposition supports this legislation. The Customs Service plays a crucial role in our society in guarding the barrier and, as I have said before, I commend it. I commend it particularly today for another major seizure which I understand was made in Melbourne in the ports and, whilst ever we have those sorts of activities continuing with the Customs Service playing such an active role, I am sure we will all feel a lot safer. I commend the legislation to the House.",131
226,Mr CADMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), mentioned the timeliness of this legislation. The Opposition would have to agree with that. It is a great shame that the legislation before the House that we have to deal with so urgently and in such a short time is not as significant as this current legislation, nor is there the same urgency for that legislation as there is for this current islation. . This legislation is timely. Since 1956, there has been a problem with land mines and machine guns. So perhaps in that sense one could hardly call this a timely amendment, as it has taken some significant length of time for those in charge of the legal affairs of the administration of Customs to realise that there was a loophole. One could not, with the wildest stretch of the imagination, consider the passage of time between 1956 and 1990 to be a speedy process. I personally am absolutely opposed to the retrospectivity of this legislation. I am it sure that there were many other aspects of drawing out and achieving a similar objective that could have been explored, rather than adopting the retrospectivity approach. One of the previous speakers mentioned, in fact, that there was a risk of machine guns and land mines and all sorts of weapons being handed back to the public because the legislation was out of time or insecure. Not in my wildest dream could I believe that that could have been possible. Even under the dangerous goods Acts of each State, something such as that could have been easily prevented. I do not believe that this Parliament in any circumstance should pass retrospective legislation. There is no way that nations such as ours, having gone through the tax processes of the past, having looked at circumstances pertaining to dangerous goods, such as those covered by this legislation, and having looked at industrial relations matters, where retrospectivity at the moment has pulled a case out of the Industrial Relations Commission, should introduce retrospective legislation. I think that is absolutely inappropriate. It is bad law making; it leads to distrust of this Parliament; it leads to an insecurity of appellants before courts; and it leads to an apathy on the part of the community. Law making, whether itÂ· be in taxation, Customs or any other areas I have mentioned, should be secure and safe, and the community should rely on it. In areas of taxation, we have seen the Tax Commissioner and the Treasurer (Mr legKeating) apply discretion which leaves the community absolutely uncertain-people having paid taxes or not paid taxes on what they believe to be a rock-sure statement. The capital gains tax legislation of the Treasurer is a classic example. There a statement was made nine months before the legislation was produced, but the legislation was completely inconsistent with his earlier statement. In regard to this legislation and the retrospectivity aspect of it, I do not believe that this is the only approach that could have been adopted. Surely, it was within the wit of the Parliament not to have the Australian Customs Service give up land mines and machine guns to claimants back to 1956. That is incredible and crazy. I do not believe that any of the Ministers or members at the table-the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp)-would have supported that. I do not believe that even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), with his statement in the House today so anti the stance Australia took in Vietnam, would accept for one moment that su-h dangerous goods could be put in the hands of criminals or ordinary citizens by some failure in the legislation of this place. It is lutely wrong that this Parliament should pass retrospective legislation, yet we are doing it tonight and we have done it twice in the last week. I do not believe that simply because the Government is slack in the preparation of its legislation and because there are amendments lobbing on our desks at the time we are trying to debate that legislation-extremely difficult, impossibly slack and very badly prepared legislation-it can use the excuse of urgency to explain away retrospectivity. In regard to other aspects of the Bill, such as designer drugs, I guess Australia is about three years behind the times. There is no doubt about that. I remember Mick Young, who at that stage was Minister for Customs, sitting in this chamber three years ago assuring Australians that there was going .to be no difficulty with the drug known as crack. At that time worldwide, crack was a difficulty; at that time worldwide, designer drugs were a difficulty. And here, three years behind the times, the Government is producing what has been termed by the previous speaker 'timely legislation'. Why are we not ahead of these processes in Australia? Why do we have to wait until the difficulties of narcotics strike our young people before we move to legislate against them? Why do we have to wait, when we know the rest of the world is suffering from this nefarious trade, before we take any action? It is a matter of too laissez-faire, too late, too much of a problem; she'll be right mate-and this Government is a classic example of that attitude. The way in which it treats this Parliament is enough of an example. The Executive is allowed by members of the Government to just ride roughshod over all the proper procedures of discussion and exploration. We as a Parliament need to act on behalf of the citizens of Australia in a proper way. Here, in regard to designer drugs and the drug 'crack', suddenly we are going to do something. It has taken three years, since Mick Young said there was no problem, for us to take action against these drugs. The Governabsoment has taken the action; that is good and I appreciate that. The previous speaker, who has recently chaired a committee on behalf of the Parliament to look at the Australian Customs Service, has been very supportive of Australian Customs. Whilst there are good officers in Customs, I do not believe that this is a time to rest on laurels or make extravagant statements about the competency of anybody who comes into contact with a criminal element that has international links. If one looks at the raw figures, one sees that the success rate, the hit rate, of Customs is very impressive. If one were to compare that to the figures on the importation of drugs into Australia, one would find a different story. As in other nations, particularly the United States, we are not keeping pace in this war. The serious effect imported drugs of all types are having on our young people can be explored right at this minute in any of our major cities. If one were to walk down the streets of Sydney or Melbourne, one would see the dramatic increase in and availability of any sort of drug. One can get any drug cocktail one wants on the streets of any major city in Australia. Instead of patting ourselves on the back and saying, 'What a terrific job we have done; there is no need for the Parliament to worry any more', I urge the Parliament to take a serious look at this matter and to realise the tremendous damage that narcotics are inflicting on young Australians. I urge the Parliament to recommit itself, to redouble its efforts. I urge the Government to be more anxious about this issue and to be better prepared with its resources in order to meet the challenge of drugs. The Government has been able to paint across so much of its downfall in regard to the criminal elements and the drug trade in Australia. Costigan produced a number of main streams that he was exploring in regard to drugs and drug-related activities. This current Labor Qovernment buried those findings in the National Crime Authority and nothing has emerged in any of those streams that Costigan was following. That is the real tragedy. The Government is prepared to say, 'We will not give proper authority, by this Parliament, to an organisation to pursue criminals, because we feel that there are some civil liberty factors involved'. It has neglected the imperatives that Costigan put into this Parliament. I believe it has neglected its support for NCA and it has been prepared to take second best in these areas. One does not have to ask why. I believe it is due to slack administration and the fear of being proved incompetent. The Government can gloss over it as a party and not worry about young Australians who are dying a,t increasingly rapid rates because of its indolence. I support this legislation. Every member of parliament should support it. Let me say to the Australian Labor Party and those Ministers present in the chamber: Do not think that passing retrospective legislation is necessarily the best way of coping with this problem or, indeed, the only way. Do not think that a measure enacted three years after designer drugs became a problem on the streets of Australia or on the world stage is timely legislation. It is time the Government really got out into the community and did something. The whole of Australia is aware of the Government's economic failures. They ought to be aware of its failures in so many of these other critical areas.",133
227,Mr BEDDALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 will not take up very much of the time of the House because I understand and appreciate the bipartisan support that most of this legislation has. I particularly wish to comment on the value of the contributions by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). I would like to correct some of the illusions of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). He referred to the previous Minister for Customs talking about the drug 'crack' three years ago. As most people would be aware, crack is a derivative of the drug cocaine, so it is easily definable within the terms of the Act. Unfortunately, what has happened siv.ce then is that designer drugs such as ice and others have come onto the market much more quickly than Customs has been able to identify them. The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill has a .catch-all provision so that as new drugs are designed in the the laboratories of the drug lords, they are picked up before they come into this country. I wish to make that point very strongly. That is why this is very much timely legislation-because the people who peddle drugs to the young of our society are very quick in designing new drugs. Therefore, it is important not to go to derivatives like crack, which is a derivative of an existing prohibited narcotic like cocaine, but to go to the new pharmaceutical drugs that are made up of a whole range of chemicals that, individually and when combined, can create the drugs we are talking about. In relation to prohibited imports, such as weapons, that have been referred to, the reason why retrospective legislation is needed is that the courts have ruled section 18 of the Act invalid. We are talking about Menzies' legislation of 1956. Obviously, this is something that was not perceived by governments long past. That is why I 'thank the honourable member for Mayo and the Opposition for supporting, in this instance, retrospective legislatext tion. I take the point that, as a fundamental principle, the coalition does not accept retrospectivity in legislation, but on this particular issue it recognises the fact that, without the retrospectivity of this Bill, we would be placed in a very difficult situation where the community would be at risk by the release of weapons. I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Beddall) read a third time. NA (PLANNING AND LAND MANAGEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 November, on motion by Mr Simmons: That the Bill be now read a second time.",135
228,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"It is perhaps a little unusual for me to be speaking on a Bill relating to Australian Capital Territory planning and land management, but the representative of the shadow Minister in this place is the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who is not able to be present this evening when the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill is being debated. However, in the versatile way that members on this side of the House are able to handle these matters, I will hopefully offer some useful comments on the matter before us. It is interesting that the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 was enacted to establish a body to be responsible for the development and administration' of the national capital plan and to establish another body, a Territory planning authority, which was to be responsible for the development and administration of a Territory plan. This all occurred in the conof the development of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Before that time, these matters were in the hands of the National Capital Development Commission, the NCDC, that was so well known to us all who visit this place as the principal planning body for Canberra. What has happened, of course, is that the self-government arrangements have brought to fruition a situation in which the national functions are to be kept in the hands of a body which the Commonwealth sees as being its creature, and the Territory functions are to go over to a body in which the Territory Administration has a voice. That was to be associated more particularly with the residential areas of the Australian Capital Territory which provide the great bulk of people who vote in Territory elections and participate in the self-government arrangements. The main provisions of the Act deal with the establishment, organisation, functions and powers of particularly the National Capital Planning Authority but also the Territory body. According to that Act, the functions of the body were to prepare and administer the national capital plan, to keep the plan under constant review, to propose amendments to that plan when it was thought necessary and, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to commission works to be carried out in the designated areas in accordance with the plan when either the department of state of the Commonwealth or any Commonwealth authority has responsibility to commission those works. It was also to recommend to the Minister the carrying out of works that it considered desirable to maintain and enhance the character of the national capital and to foster awareness of Canberra as the national capital. Strangely, some might think, it has also been given a charter to subcontract, to be able to take on additional functions-I found this quite interesting-and perform, with the approval of the Minister, planning services for any person or body whether within Australia or overseas. Undoubtedly, if the National Capital Planning Authority has kept on any of the expertise that the old NCDC had on board, it could well offer advice to other centres, other capitals, about the way in which they might be able to produce a very handsome, marketable and rather delightful capital city, perhaps at a cost. But here we have these new arrangements put in place. The Bill we are dealing with tonight modifies certain transitional provisions that were put in place to enable the existing planning system to be utilised for a time until the new planning system was developed. There was also a provision that the Governor General would be required to declare an end to the transitional period within a year of self-government commencing. Interestingly enough, the explanatory memorandum tells us that self government day was 11 May 1989. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would appreciate, that date is now well past, and we are dealing with legislation that I gather is being proposed for what I used to call, when I practised law, more abundant precaution. There appear to, be some reasons associated with that more abundant precaution, but it was not altogether clear from reading either the explanatory memorandum or the Bill, consisting of one page with an additional note on the other side. However, it was of interest to read the local newspaper, the Canberra Times, because it starts to give one some insight into what has occurred. It seems that the Commonwealth was told by its advisers that it was in a position to be able to go past the 12-month transitional period without very much difficulty. We have this interregnum as a result of the delay in the preparation of the national capital plan where the Commonwealth could not declare an end to the transitional arrangements because the new plan had not been prepared. But the matter was to be allowed to go on, it appears, administratiVely. In the Canberra Times of 10 November it becomes clear what has happened and why this legislation has been introduced this week, read for the first time on 13 November, is to be dealt with in the House of Representatives on 15 November and the Government sees some urgency associated with this. It was because the legal basis for this Act relating to the planning system for the Australian Capital Territory was under challenge in the Supreme Court. According to news reports, it could have seen all decisions of the interim Territory planning authority declared invalid. So for all the good work and all that advice, it emerges that there was very considerable uncertainty when the Government took the opportunity to look at this matter again. The matter becomes clearer in the reports that were carried in the Canberra Times as recently as yesterday. The Government was warned four months ago that there were significant problems with the transitional provisions. This matter was made clear when the Law Society of the ACT wrote to the Government pointing out the problems and suggesting that an urgent amendment was necessary-and that was even after the 12-month period had elapsed. Of course, when the matter came before the Supreme Court, a Canberra company called Argyle Homes Pty Ltd was challenging an interim planning authority decision to build a tourist road in the old Canberra Brickworks to the Royal Canberra Golf Club car park in Yarralumla. The main argument of Argyle Homes was expected to relate to the interim Territory planning authority's legal standing because of this problem involving the transitional period. This matter occupied counsel, no doubt at considerable cost. I am not sure who represented all the parties, but I am at least sufficiently familiar with the workings of myoid profession to know that one does not go into proceedings in the Supreme Court without considerable cost to the parties involved, and that may have involved cost to the Government or in this case governments, as well. Th-re was a day long hearing of the case before Mr Justice Higgins, and the matter has been adjourned. So it seems to me that we have before us certain legislative provisions designed as it is said in the explanatory memorandum, to put the matter beyond doubt. All that may be fine, and undoubtedly is important, but for the life of me I cannot u-derstand why we are being asked to put thIS matter beyond doubt at this late stage. I am not taking sides, because I do not know the merits of the arguments that might be advanced by those concerned about the road at Yarralumlabut I do not like a situation in which the rights of parties in legal proceedings are interfered with at a late stage-and it is a late stage when the parties are already in the court. It is wrong in principle; it should not occu-; and it is not a matter that ought to go wIthout comment. That is the matter that I wish to draw to your attention.' Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the attentIOn of the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmo-s). I. think the Minister ought to be askmg hIS officers how they put him in a situation like this, which is a matter of considerable embarrassment. We have a sit-ation where the national capital plan, WhICh was expected to be prepared within 12 months, is obviously not yet available. We have a situation where we still do not know whether the draft plan, which I understand the Minister may now have received, will be finalised this month, next month, next year. I ask the Minister: is 12 months enough? Do we need more time? Are we to be asked to consider this type of legislation again? It is a matter some concern, and I express that concern. I hope it is a matter the Minister and his advisers will take on board. Nevertheless, the Opposition will not oppose this legislation. We will allow the matter to proceed on the basis that more abunda,nt caution is appropriate, is proper, and will undoubtedly minimise further litigation and further costs. I make the point again that it is late in the day for the Government to recognise that there were problems of this sort and to attempt to deal with them in this Parliament.",136
229,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY," I call the honourable member for Fraser. Ms MCHugh-Hear, Hearl",138
230,Mr LANGMORE,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,Fraser) (9.33)Thank you. What a nice way to finish a very difficult week. I welcome that encouragement from the honourable member. . Ms MCHugh-It will be a good week from now on.,138
231,Mr LANGMORE,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Indeed it will' such euphoria is uncommon at the end' of a long and tiring week. . The Australian Capital Territory (Planmng and Land Management) Amendment - ill is a small but significant and very Important amendment. As the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said the original Australian Capital Territory (Planning .and Land Management) Act 1988 speCIfied that the national capital plan should be prepared during a transitional period which would last for a year from the date of self-government. That is what actually happened: the plan itself was prepared well within that year. The Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory is well aware of the enormous amount of hard work that that preparation took. We did a very detailed study of the first draft and wrote a report on that, and I am glad to say that our report involved bipartisan agreement. The plan was revised following our comments and those of other people in the community, and then it was revised again. It has gone through a very detailed preparatory of process. It could have been finalised well before 11 May if the election had not intervened, but because the election intervened-and of course it is improper for Ministers to make decisions of substance during an election campaign-it was not possible-Mr RuddockIt did not seem to worry them in ethnic affairs.",138
232,Mr LANG MORE,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I will not enter into that debate. Ministers were very responsible in this area, and I imagine they were in that area as well, but I am not familiar with the facts of that case. No decisive action was taken in relation to the plan before the election. After election the Minister for the Arts, ism and Territories (Mr Simmons) had legal opinion and the Joint Committee also had a legal opinion to the effect that the certified plan, which had been settled on 9 March, was sufficient to meet the requirements of the Act. It did allow time to work on resolving some of the remainresolve ing conflicts, and that was valuable, cause it meant there could be negotiation between the Commonwealth Government and the Australian Capital Territory GovInterim ernment. There has been further consultaking tation with the Joint Committee and those remaining conflicts have now largely been resolved. That is a welcome development because it means that the document that has now gone to the Minister is, by and large, an agreed document which is not only the result of very hard work by planners themselves but also incorporates widespread community consultation, well as consultation with this Parliament. The document will be stronger because that, I believe. Because there was some remaining doubt about whether the certified plan was sufficient to allow the process to tend beyond a year, the Government quite wisely has decided to introduce this amendment to extend the transitional phase from one year to two. That the issue beyond any doubt, I believe, and it is a welcome step. It is quite true that at present it is being used in a case as part of an argument, and I think it is comments important that that part of the argument support the Bill. be removed from dispute. It is a sensible amendment. I conclude these brief comments by congratulating the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA) for the quality its work. It has done a very high quality job, as the public will see when the ised plan is released. I also congratulate the Interim Territory Planning Authority for its cooperation with the National ital Planning Authority. It is important ning. that the wider community recognises the rigour and hard work that has gone into the preparation of the plan. I hope that the NCPA will receive the full support of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the the Environment, Tourism and Territories. TourThere was a rumour or two that wholea hearted support might not have been forthcoming. It is important, I believe, that it should be forthcoming, as there is a difficult process involved in planning in Canberra. We do have two planning authorities and they have difficult issues to between the responsibility of the beNCPA for maintaining and enhancing the beauty, stature and dignity of Canberra as the national capital and that of the Territory Planning Authority for responsibility for advising the Australian Capital Territory Government. The matter will not always be free of conflict. Inevitably there will be conflict over issues. There was conflict over the division of land between national land and local land. Inevitably there is conflict the over the use of powers, the powers of designation, and over the use of special as conditions which the National Capital Planning Authority can impose on the of Territory, or simply the comments the NCPA can make. I think it is important that this Parliament support the NCPA in its task of exmaintaining and enhancing the national capital so that a good balance is maintained between the responsibilities of the two organisations and the issues with puts which they are involved. I congratulate the Minister for taking this very appropriate and sensible step. I one use this opportunity to make these few on planning, and I strongly",138
233,Mr SIMMONS,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY," in reply-I acknowledge the contribuof tions of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the honourfinalable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) during the debate on the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land CapManagement) Amendment Bill this eveAs has been indicated by the speakers, the Bill seeks to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 by extending the period from one year to two within which the national capital plan is to cover the Australian Capital Territory. It alters two sections of the principal Act to provide under section 57 (1) that when the Governor General is satisfied that the national capital plan sufficiently covers the Territory then he shall, by proclamation, declare the transition period ending on a day specified in the proclamation. Secondly-and this is the subject of the amendment before the House tonightthe day specified shall not be later than one year after self-government day. The drafting of the National Capital Plan by the National Capital Planning Authority was completed in February 1990 following a process of public consultation. As the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) rightly acknowledged, I should think that all parties that were part of that consultative process would agree that it was a very, very necessary step. When one has transitional arrangements, when one has a very unusual situation where there is a National Capital Planning Authority responsible for the planning functions of the national capital and an Interim Territory Planning Authority established when self-government was determined within the ACT, there are obviously going to be transitional difficulties during that process. The approvals processes, which include the consultation with the ACT Executive on the plan, its approval by me as the responsible Minister, consideration of the plan, its approval, again by me as the responsible Minister, and consideration by the Parliament at the end of the process, could not be completed within the period of one year mentioned in the principal Act largely because of the Federal election and, as speakers have mentioned, the convention that Ministers at the time do not take policy decisions which may commit an incoming government. However, the decision was taken by my predecessor, the now honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), and the draft plan was certified, giving it temporary force under the Act, on 9 March 1990, some two weeks or so before the historic fourth term Federal election victory of 1990. During this process my Department and the National Capital Planning Authority did seek advice from the Attorney-General's Department on whether the provisions of the Act which required the National Capital Plan to sufficiently cover the Territory within that 12-month transition period were mandatory or whether or not flexibility was available in extending the period. In responding to the comments of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), the advice from the Attorney General's Department in that instance indicates in part that although the Act shows a parliamentary expectation that the National Capital Plan will sufficiently cover the Territory within one year after self government day, which was 10 May this year, the Act does not impose on anybody any duty in this regard. If the National Capital Plan was not in effect until after 10 May 1990, the Governor General could declare the end of the transition period under section 57(1) of the Act to be later than 10 May of this year, notwithstanding the second provision, that is, section 57(2) of the Act. . Mr Ruddock-How could you be confident enough to rely on that opinion?",139
234,Mr SIMMONS,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"The transition period would not automatically come to an end, . in other words, on 10 May 1990. My colleague opposite, the honourable member for Dundas, certainly does have a number of advantages over me in this sense because I do not profess to have the legal training that he had prior to entering this particular establishment. Ministers who do not have that extensive legal training are obviously guided by the advice of their department. I accept the advice of the Department in this regard. This process is very important, as the honourable member for Fraser acknowledged in his contribution. The cooperation between the Interim Territory Planning Authority and the National Capital Planning Authority during this potentially difficult transitional phase has been outstanding. The two authorities have been working together on the relative levels of responsibility and grappling, with the problems of appropriate designation of land and the special requirements of land. I also acknowledge the contribution of the ACT Government in this regard. I have had two major discussions with the Chief Minister, Mr Kaine, and his support and understanding are also to be acknowledged in this regard. I take the opportunity to acknowledge that because it is important that once the National Capital Plan is established it enjoys the support of not only this Parliament but also the ACT Government. I have no doubts that once I have passed that plan through the Cabinet process and brought it before this Parliament it will enjoy support of this Parliament; it will, I am sure, be supported by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory and, indeed, the ACT Government. Mr Ruddock-How long will it take?",140
235,Mr SIMMONS,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Dundas seeks to ascertain the length of time before the National Capital Plan is available. Obviously because of the nature of parliamentary sittings and the limited number of days that we have, I think it would be, an unreasonable expectation that that would be available within the next few weeks. However, the purpose of this amendment is to extend that transitional plan. There is a reasonable expectation that the Government will not come before this House seeking an extension of that transitional period. So the honourable member for Dundas can feel very relaxed indeed that we will not be seeking an extension of that process because of the extensive consultation that the National Capital Planning Authority, the Interim Territory Planning Authority and I have had. So in order to remove any doubt on the status of the decisions taken in the period since the expiration of the existing one year period set out in the Act, that is, since 10 May this year, the Bill seeks to extend the period to two years, and the advice from the Attorney-General's Department concurs with that appropriate solution. With the benefit of hindsight, which, I am sure, all honourable members would agree is a wonderful attribute, perhaps there was a slightly unreal expectation that this process could be completed. I am prepared to acknowledge the gentle slap on the wrist that the honourable member for Dundas has given me during his contribution to the debate. I am sure that with his extensive legal training he acknowledges the point behind this legislation. ' I conclude by once again thanking the honourable member for Dundas for his support of this Bill on behalf of the Opposition and the contribution of the honourable member for Fraser who, as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the the Australian Capital Territory, takes a very close interest obviously in matters affecting his electorate. I thank those honourable members for their contribution during this debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

EDUCATION SERVICES (EXPORT REGULATION) BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate'resumed from 8 November, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the Bill be now read a second time.",141
236,Dr KEMP,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I rise tonight to signal the Opposition's intention to oppose the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill. Before commenting on the provisions of the Bill and the surreptitious manner in which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) sought to have it passed through this House without informing any of the major players in the education export industry-and I have much to say on this point tonight--'-I want to remind this House once again of the circumstances which have given rise to this Bill in the - rst place. This Bill is but the latest happening in a sarry saga af gavernment mismanagement af the expart af educatian from Australia. Nawhere has the bungling and incampetence af the Minister far the Arts, Taurism and Territaries (Mr Simmans) been mare apparent than .in the expart educatian industry. Mr Ruddock-He is preaccupied with his facti anal disputes.",141
237,Dr KEMP,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"He has been very busy laaking at ather appartunities. As I cammented just last week when we debated the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bil11990, few areas have cantributed mare to. the Minister's declining fartunes and to. his growing reputatian far bungling and incampetence than his management af educatian exparts. Few areas better epitamise his style af management than this area. Last week I tald this Hause haw the Minister had created baam time expectatians when cautian and prudence were needed; haw he failed to. properly caardinate palicy with the Minister far Immigratian, Lacal Gavernment and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) to. pratect the integrity af this natian's immigratian palicy; and haw he impased requirements an calleges to. repart visa vialatians as a precanditian far registratian, but then failed to. respand when these reparts were made and thus sent precisely the wrang signals to. industry participants. I tald this Hause haw the bungling af the Minister has left thausands af averseas students in this cO,untry, thausands mare averseas awaiting refunds, an industry in chaas and a cauntry whase reputatian has been badly damaged in areas averseas where, in the past, great goadwill had been established. I will nat go. aver this graund in detail tanight, but it must be said that there is plenty to. sayan this BilL It must be said that this Bill is truly a case of clasing daar after the harse has baIted. It seeks to. address a number af prablems which have largely ceased to. exist either as a result af, firstly, belated and by no. means whally satisfactary changes to. visa procedures which have largely ended the prablem af fees paid fallawed by visa refusal; ar, secandly, the actian af the States to. set up their awn legislative framewark; and, thirdly, act Ian by the industry itself tp establish a proper framewark far financial management. Firstly, I wauld like to. discuss the circumstances surraunding this Bill. But befare daing so', let me make ane thing absalutely clear. This Bill states that it affects praviders. It defines providers as individuals ar institutians which provide caurses, nat just registered providers and nat just approved praviders, but praviders af caurses. Caurses are simply defined as caurses af educatian and training. What daes this mean? It means that - veryÂ· clause in this Bill applying to. a pravider applies to. every gavernment schaal, every nan-gavernment schaal, every university, every callege, every technical and further educatian (T AFE) callege, every private provider af educatian, every business providing training, and indeed every persan who' pravides educatian and training fram his ar her hame, even if such a pravider has and will never came into. cant act with an averseas student. The abligatians applying to. praviders, whether ar nat they have averseas students, includes the apening and maintenance af trust accaunts, the keeping af quarterly audited reparts unless exempted and the taking aut af insurance. The implicatians af this are far reaching far educatian and training in Australia and I will return to. them later in my speech. The Minister must accept respansibility far this catastrophic and. appallingly drafted piece af legislatian. On 30 July the Minister far Emplayment, Educatian and Training delivered in Melbaurne what was described as a majar speech an educatian expart. Apart fram a dash af vitrial to. try to. sheet all the blame far the prablems af the industry hame to. the private the colleges, the speech was just oazing with gaadwill. The Minister was gaing to. do' samething navel-he was gaing to. cansult with the States and the industry. In fact, because what happened pravides such a striking cantrast to. the intentians af this speech, let me just read a few gems from it: The Commonwealth will be consulting with the States and Territories in the framing of this legislation . . . The Commonwealth has no intention of pre-empting State/Territory responsibilities . . . I am awaresaid the Ministerthat the majority of States and Territories themselves moving to a legislative basis for ulating the industry and the Commonwealth's own legislation will make allowance for that. It is all very reassuring stuff, but it better, forhe praises the work of the sociation of Recognised ELICOS Centres and the Australian Council of IndependOne ent Business Colleges in establishing standards within the industry and comes the formation of the Australian Council of Private Education and Trainment ing, which would, in the Minister's words: . . . make the task of consultation with ernment authorities that much easier. It gets even better. I quote again-and this takes the cake: To facilitate its dialogue with the entire industry, the Government has decided to establish tional consultative committee on the Education Export industry. Its objective will be to a forum for discussion and information exchange on education export policy issues and to ensure co-ordination in the overseas promotion of Australia's education and training services. partment is currently seeking the views of and Territory authorities and to formalise its establishment in the near future. There we have what we all have been waiting for. The Minister may have tramsult, pled all over higher education and he may have been plotting to grab control schools, but here in the twilight of his Ministry were the first signs that he was becoming mellow. 'Consultation' was to become the new by word. One could be forgiven for believing in the light of the Minister's speech of July; the Bill under consideration tonight would be the product of widespread conthey sultation. One could be forgiven for be the lieving that because this Bill affects whole overseas student industry, and indeed the whole of education and training in Australia, the international developity ment program would have been conintroducing sulted. One could be forgiven for believing that because this Bill affects all private educators taking in overseas students, Australian Council for Private Education and Training and the ELICOS association would have been consulted. One could be forgiven for believing that because this Bill affects universities and TAFEstaking in overseas students, they would have been are consulted and certainly their representaregtive bodies, such as the Australian ViceChancellors Committee, would have been extensively consulted. One could be forgets given for believing that non-government Asschool authorities would have been consulted, for it impacts on them as well. could certainly be forgiven for believing that the State and Territory govwelernments would have been consulted, given the Minister's very explicit commitin that speech. One could be forgiven, because that is certainly what the govOpposition expected would be the case. But we were too trusting. Our first indication that something was amiss was when we looked into this Bill after it was introduced into the House. a naThe Bill contains several onerous provisions which were to apply to any educaprovide tional institution taking on overseas students. We could but wonder: did all the bodies just referred to agree to this? My DeNo, they did not. At the time they had State not disagreed, because they had not been I expect to be. able consulted. When we discovered that the Minister had repudiated his commitment to conthe Opposition decided to fill in for him. I am sure that you would be pleased of to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that now all the major representative organisations have had the Bill drawn to their attention, not to mention the States and territories. Rumour has it that there has been quite that a torrent of calls and mail to both the 30 Minister's office and the Department on this Bill, a torrent of calls and mail which quite deliberately sought to avoid by clandestine fashion in which this Bill the was drafted and introduced. The Minister has further grievously damaged his reputation and his credibilin the education export sector through the Bill in this way. The Minister is developing what is clearly a well earned reputation for slapdash, surreptithe tious and inept policy making. We can only agree with the Queensland Premier when he commented on the Minister's proposals for schools at the Special Premiers Conference in the following terms. The Queensland Labor Premier said: . . . the Premiers weren't prepared to accept that sort of slapdash, late attempt thing through that had not been the subject of discussion and negotiation. This is becoming a hallmark of the administration of this portfolio. The Minister's slapdash bright idea style of policymaking has well and truly taken hold in education export. As the Minister has done with the Premiers, so he has forfeited the trust of the entire education export and overseas student sector. I challenge the Minister to inform this House as to the reasons why so many of the key organisations with which the Opposition has held discussions in recent days were not consulted by either the Minister or his Department. The Minister may see fit to address this House during this debate-or maybe he will not-on what actions he may take to address the considerable concern that his inept handling of this matter has generated. He may make reassuring statements; he may promise to remedy the problems through careful drafting of regulations; and he may even foreshadow later amendments. Let me say this: no institution or enterprise engaged in the export of education can have any assurance that undertakings and commitments which may be made in response to recommendations will be kept, for this Government has made commitments to the education export sector before and has just as easily broken them. Only a fortnight ago, when we debated the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill, I brought to the attention of this House the explicit commitment the Government gave to tertiary institutions when it moved from a subsidisation scheme for overseas students to a full feescholarship scheme that, whilst they could no longer count overseas students as part of their student load for the determination of Federal Government funding, the losses to revenue of institutions would be offset by direct revenue arising from the new scholarship places. It took only two years for the Government to explicitly violate this undertaking. As I informed this House, tertiary institutions stand to lose $1. 7m this year, $8.2m next year, and $8.3m the year after-and the figures to push somemay be even higher. This is a government which carelessly makes undertakings and carelessly violates them. This Government has no integrity and cannot be trusted. The lack of consultation on this Bill is manifested in almost every clause of this ineptly drafted piece of legislation. Mr N .A. Brown-Where is the Minister, anyway?",142
238,Dr KEMP,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I intend to speakÂ· on the provisions of this Bill in detail, but before doing so, some comment is warranted on the need for this legislation. It would be good if the Minister was in the chamber, as the honourable member for Menzies has indicated, because he may as yet be unaware of some of the very grav- deficiencies in this carelessly introduced piece of legislation. I wish it to be noted on the public record that I wrote to the Minister on 13 November bringing to his attention the concerns that I am about to discuss. No-one would deny that there is a need for a regulatory framework for this industry. I have publicly drawn attention to this need on a number of occasions in the past. Industry participants themselves are of this view. This need exists even though the prime responsibility for the chaos that has ensued in the industry can be traced directly to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs failing to act in a manner which protected the integrity of our n.ation's immigration policy and which resulted in the several policy U-turns that we have witnessed. After a slow and unsatisfactory start, the appropriate regulatory framework is coming into place as a result of action by industry itself and by the States and territories. Indeed the Minister acknowledged this in his speech on 30 July. When one looks through the provisions of this Bill, one cannot but be amazed at the level of duplication involved. Some institutions will now be registered under up to three schemes: an industry scheme, a State and territorial scheme, and a national scheme. It is a cumbersome and excessive regulatory framework. Surely, notwithstanding the lack of warmth between the Minister and the States, the nature of State regulation so as to include the matters in this Bill could have been the subject of negotiation when the decision was made to invite the States to provide for the regulation and registration of colleges. At a time when duplication of regulation between the States and the Commonwealth is at the top of the agenda of national debate, one could not imagine a more blatant example of such duplication than this. . In discussing the provisions of the Bill on,e thing should be kept in mind: it applies to anyone-I repeat, anyone-who, in the words of the Bill, provides a course of education and training. So it applies to schools, universities, T AFE colleges and private providers. As we consider the provisions of this Bill we should, unlike the Minister to date, consider how the provisions impact on each of these sectors. Now I would like to take the House through the problems in this Bill. Firstly, the Bill restricts institutions from marketing courses overseas unless they are registered and constitutes an undue restriction on their trade activities. Even if it has industry and State registration, Federal registration has been denied to it an institution will be committing an offence if it undertakes any kind of normal marketing activities. Indeed, there is a provision which states that education providers cannot even hold themselves out as being willing or able to provide a course to overseas students. So, if an institution decides it wants to enter the education export market and decides to sound out agents and others overseas to see whether there is a market before going through the process of obtaining registration and in doing so indicates a willingness to offer a course, it will be in violation of this section and liable to a penalty of $10,000. For this section on holding out makes no attempt to specify who the provider cannot hold out to. It covers everyone. Then we have the definition of a course. It is defined in the Bill as a course of education and training. If one decides to employ an overseas student who is able to work 20 hours per week pursuant to the visa and to provide that student with some in-house training by way of a course, one will have to register that course with at least the State and Federal governments. If one does not, one will be liable to a penalty of $10,000. This highly inadequate definition makes no attempt to limit the definition of a course to a feepaying course. Then we have the trust accounts. As many honourable members may be aware, the private providers section of the industry has already formulated a system of registered accounts. We do not know in detail what the Minister thinks of these accounts, other than to note his congratulations in his speech of 30 July to representative bodies in the private sector such as the ELICOS Association for establishing a regulatory framework for the industry. We certainly have not heard any criticism from him of these accounts and why they should be replaced by trust accounts. We certainly have not heard why institutions such as non-government schools, amongst others, should be required to maintain such accounts. I have had countless recommendations if about the damage that the trust account mechanism will create for the education export industry, p""articularly for the private providers. It will create severe cash flow problems for these institutions. We have had no indication whatsoever from the Minister as to how he will respond to these claims. Indeed, with the complete lack of consultation to which I have already referred we can only assume that he was not even aware of these problems when this Bill was being drafted. The situation is worsened, however, by the failure to provide adequately for the management of the accounts. For example, who is to keep the interest earned on these accounts-the institution or the student? If it is the student, as seems most likely under the present Bill because the student would be the beneficiary of such a trust account, then the cash flow difficulties created for institutions will be further exacerbated. Many institutions include the interest earned on student moneys as a part of the revenue they receive for the provision of education services. They will no longer be able to do so. Instead, they will be forced to go through the costly and time consuming task of allocating the interest earned on a single general trust account to individual students. The complexity of this task, given the differing amounts deposited by each student and the differing length of time of each deposit, boggles the mind. . Worse is still to come. We then have to confront the provisions concerning withdrawals of funds and refunds. These are completely inappropriate. The provisions on when funds can be withdrawn from the trust account once a student commences a course are unsatisfactory, to say the least. The fact that the accounts themselves are constituted as trust accounts has the potential to create difficulties, but tract. these problems are compounded by the fact that the sums of money which may be withdrawn at various stages during a student's course of study at the institution are to be determined by regulation. How can we be asked to pass a provision when we have no idea how this power will be used? Is the Minister aware that if the regulations are unsatisfactorily framed, even inadvertently, it could very well mean the difference between survival and winding up for many providers? Indeed, the reference to the term 'cost' would seem to limit the amount an institution can withdraw from a trust account to cover costs actually incurred whilst the student is at the institution. It may be that the institution cannot withdraw that proportion representing its profit element until the student has completed the course. Then there are other problems. Written notice must be given to overseas students as to what amounts will be considered non-refundable. But the Bill is unclear as to whether this provision is satisfied if amounts that are non-refundable are contained in the contracts between the student and the institution. But the most unacceptable provision in the financial regulations section involves that governing refunds of moneys to overseas students who have commenced their courses. This provision effectively states that students, if they withdraw from a course after having commenced that course, will be entitled to a refund of all moneys held in the trust account other than those amounts which the provider was entitled to withdraw. There are four vital words at the beginning of this provision. Those words are 'If for any reason'. This is an unrestricted licence' for abuse and a 180-degree turn from what is current practice. What is current practice? The current practice unambiguously provides that institutions are not required to give refunds once a student has commenced the course: We would not expect otherwise. I understand that this is the practice around the world. The onus is on the student and this is' clearly stated in the standard conMoreover, the industry is contracting and competition is intense. Why should institutions make significant investments in overseas recruitment and marketing only to see institutions in Australia which do not undertake similar marketing efforts undercut those institutions and poach their students with the knowledge that the student can change institutions with impunity? This is a recipe for destroying the marketing of education overseas-nothing more and nothing less. It is drafted by people who are ignorant of the most basic business practices. It will create anarchy in the industry and bankrupt providers. Quite frankly, it is discriminatory. A privilege is being conferred on overseas students which is not conferred on Australian students. Overseas students are being protected from what is a quite normal contractual practice, but Australian students are not. Not only is this a recipe for commercial anarchy; it is also a recipe for the creation of resentment. The Government has the gall to come and tell us that it is for tolerance and fostering good relations. It then goes on to formulate policies which it knows have the potential to create envy and ill-will and to poison the atmosphere. This discriminatory provision is a most unwise development. This Bill is quite anomalous in the manner in fails to account for the type of parties entering into contracts. On occasion, it is a third party, such as a parent or employer, who signs the contract rather than the student. The clause dealing with moneys to be deposited into trust accounts only refers to three sources: overseas students, intending overseas students and their agents. So what happens if a third party,such as an employer or parent, pays the money? It would be impossible, surely, to describe such people as agents. Was it intended that such people were not to be covered by these provisions or is it just another drafting error? Whilst referring to overseas students, intending overseas students and agents, it completely fails to account for the agency relationship by stating that any refund will be only to an overseas student. Thus, even though it might be. the agent who is the signatory to the contract and who paid out the fees, it is the student who receives the refund. It places the agent in a very poor position if that agent has not been reimbursed by the student and made the initial payments out of his own account. If we must have trust accounts, I cannot for the life of me understand the purposeÂ· of the insurance provision. While I have noted that circumstances have changed dramatically in the education' industry, insurers will be well aware of its recent unhappy past. They will price their policies for insurance accordingly. The costs may well be prohibitive. It will place some institutions in a classic catch 22 situation. The more difficult their fmancial circumstances, the more costly will be their insurance, the greater will be the burden on their cash flow and the more likely will be their financial demise. It should be noted that thereÂ· are no exemptions from the requirement that insurance be taken out.Â· . Then there are the auditing and information provisions. Four times a year institutions will be required to provide audited accounts to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I acknowledge the discretion vested in the Secretary to that Department to exempt institutions from such requirements, but once again, notwithstanding this discretion, to require institutions to provide such audited accounts on a quarterly basis indefinitely borders on draconian and is, to the best of my knowledge, quite unprecedented in the education sector. Indeed-and this is the supreme blunder of this Bill because of the way this Bill is drafted-the liability to take out insurance and open bank accounts for overseas students extends to all providers of education and training courses in Australia, whether or not they intend to or attempt to recruit overseas students. If they do not do so, they face fines of up to $3,000. Every school, TAFE, college, university, and business which is a provider of training must take out insurance and open a trust account. This Bill is beyond belief. Anyone who provides an education or training course in Australia-whether or not involved in the marketing of education overseas-will be required to comply with these matters on force of prosecution and potential fines. This fantastic provision highlights the utterly obnoxious character of this disgraceful Bill. It throws a net which will impose heavy new burdens on every institution providing education and training in Australia. If the Minister thinks there has been an upsurge of concern over the last 48 hours, let me tell him that he has experienced nothing compared to what will occur when I leave this House and write to alert as many major educational institutions in this country as possible to the consequences of this legislation. He has experienced nothing compared to what will occur as the full implications of this legislation become known around Australia. Equally unprecedented is the ambit information request clause, whereby the Minister can ask for any information on the provision of courses to, and recruitment of, overseas students. There is. no limit as to the size of the request, nardly any limit on the type of information that can be sought and no limit on: the purposes for which the information can be requested. In a Bip whose theme is overreaction, this is yet another clause which is thoroughly objectionable and which holds great potential for abuse. Whilst the Government's disgraceful performance during the national identity card debate makes clear its contempt for issues such as privacy, it nonetheless displays a considerable gall to insert a clause such as this in this Bill. The handling by the Government of education export over the last two to three years warrants the strongest condemnation. The Minister may claim that he has made errors and learnt from them. What this Bill demonstrates is that he has learnt nothing. This Bill continues the trail of devastation the Minister has hacked through education in this country. His bungling and incompetence are becoming a millstone around the neck of the Government. Whilst the Minister is contemplating his predicament, he might consider remedying the two drafting errors presently still in the Bill. I draw his attention to the misspelling of 'registration' in the heading above clause 5(I) and the reference in clause 6(2) to subclause (2). I believe this might be intended to be subclause (1) (b). This Bill is a disgrace. Its implications mayor may not have been foreseen by the Government. It should not have been presented' to this House. When its provisions become known to the providers of education and training in this country, the outrage that the Minister will hear will be unequalled.",144
239,Dr CATLEY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I rise in support of the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill, which is designed to regulate the operators of one of the newest and fastest growing export earning industries that this country has witnessed in the last five years-the provision of education. For centuries education systems were, and in many countries still are, based essentially on the national market, except for poor scholars who for centuries have scoured around the great institutions of learning for bits of knowledge. . Today the international education industry is a multi-billion dollar earner for the providers of education. For a country such as Australia that is suffering balance of payments problems, and has. been throughout the 1980s, to forgo entry into the international education system would be to forgo the possibility of substantial export earnings. Big educational export earners include the United States and Britain. For many years they have been earning tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars annually from overseas students entering, their education institutions. This is a situation that we clearly could not allow to remain, an industry that we were not a party to, particularly since we have an education system which is highly competitive internationally in terms of cost and quality. It is recognised to be on a par with that of the British and United States education institutions, although even such an acolyte of our tertiary education system as myself, and possibly the shadow Minister 'for, education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), would have to concede that certhat tain of the more pre-eminent British and American universities may be able to charge a premium as against ours. 'This Government has tried to capitalise on the fact that we have a potential export income earner in the education industry and we have tried to provide a framework within which earnings can be achieved. This piece of legisiation is designed to enhance the regulatory framework within which the industry has' operated. If we look at foreign students coming to Australia, non-foreign aid students-that is, those who are outside the Colombo Plan, which I suppose was the inception of foreign overseas students coming to Australia, particularly in the tertiary sector-there has always been a certain number of overseas students studying here, particularly in the university and old college sector, but the numbers were fairly small until the early 1980s. Perhaps coincidentally with the formation of the Labor Government in the early 1980s the number of overseas students attending Australian educational institutions grew. Particularly during the early 1980s there started to be an obvious growth in demand for English language courses, which may have reflected the changes in the value of the Australian dollar as against the other major English speaking countries of North America and Britain. There may have been other factors. Nonetheless, it became clear that there were export earnings to be made out of the education sector. During the mid-1980s, in 1985 and 1986 in particular, the Government set about streamlining access, notably to the university and college sector, but also to the State school and private institutions sector for overseas students. Indeed, my impending daughter-in-law was one of the beneficiaries of this project, you will be pleased to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker. She studied in high school in Adelaide and then went on to Adelaide University where, fortunately, she met one of my sons. Generally the foreign students involved were required to pay fees in advance, or at least a proportion thereof. In December 1986 further checks were added although we could hardly say that they were stringent. There then followed in the mid1980s a rather big upsurge in applications for the English language intensive courses for overseas students, the ELICOS courses. The demand increased considerably, particularly, as is now well known, from the People's Republic of China. Even five years ago murmurs started from the ELICOS sector that the rapid growth in demand and the corresponding growth in supply was causing diminution in standards and other problems. Although as a result of these concerns the Government tightened entrance requirements, the number of private ELICOS colleges continued to increase very rapidly and the number of overseas fee-paying students who went to them also increased rapidly. As a result, by mid1988, the Government, which was receiving messages from the sector on a continuing basis, started to express its concerns that there were emerging in this very rapidly growing sector for export earnings, a system of rorts. As a result in mid-1988 a further set of regulations was announced. It is important to note that the growth of ELICOS institutions continued such that there were 62 by late 1988 and there was an ever growing student number corresponding to that growth of institutions. By the end of that year there were about 25,000 outstanding applications for entry into that sector by overseas students. There were about 25,000 of them in the queue. It was also becoming clear that an overstayer problem was emerging. Everybody in this House would be familiar with the expression, whichÂ· relates to the number of people who come in on visas for one purpose and overstay the date on that visa. The number of students coming in under the ELICOS schemes who were overstaying was emerging as a bit of a problem. At that stage we unfortunately ran into the suppression by the Chinese Government of the student democracy movement in Beijing in June 1989 with the attendant fact that a large number of Chinese nationals were students in Australia at the time of that suppression. I do not want to go through the events associated with that and the difficulties we have had dealing with it. Simultaneously there began to emerge further reports of ELICOS institutions over-recruiting students to their coursesthat is, providing facilities for courses for, say, 20 students and actually recruiting 40 on the apparently increasingly wellfounded assumption that not that number of students would turn up because many of them were not coming in here to study in the ELICOS courses at all. They were not genuine or bona fide students but were potential overstayers coming here op student visas in order to overstay and never having any intention of doing anything else. On the other hand, as this sector expanded rapidly, the number of ELICOS colleges that - ent broke during the process of expanSIOn for a whole variety of reasons was also becoming more widespread. So we had a very rapidly growing sector that was encountering all sorts. of problems. I want to make it very clear - ere that I - m not talking about the tertiary educatIOn sector of universities and the old college sector and I am not talking about the State-run school sector. As the member for Adelaide, I am also not talking very much about South Australia where the growth of the industry to that stage, and to this stage, despite the presence of my soon to be daughter-in-law has been very slow. ' The new institutions in South Australia the three-university tertiary educatiosector which is going to be formed on 1 January next year, have noted this and under the inspiration of the State Labor Minister for Tertiary Education Mike Ra!1n, they are going to set up a - ollaboÂ­ ratIve body whereby they can collectively market packages of courses of study for overseas students in all three South Australian universities, which is part of the reform and expansion program that we have introduced in the tertiary sector. By 1989 the sector was faced with a fe- appar-ntly unscrupulous private institutIons WhIch posed a consequential threat to. academic standards and reputations in thIS country and apparently an increasing expa--ion of br-aches of student entry condItIons assocIated with the overstayers. . Bef?re it sounds as though I am agreemg wIth - he shadow Minister oppositeand I WIll take on board some of his points-we have to look also at the positive side of these developments. These are considerable. If we look at mid-1990 we find that there were 70,000 overseas students studying in Australia. Of these 70,000 about 44,000 were full fee-paying overseas students. Of - hose 44,000, about 21,000 were enrolled m formal studies in public institu-ions such as secondary schools, techmcal and further education colleges and universities. When we compare that with the 1986 figure when we started the expansion program we find it was 250. In about four years we have gone from 250 in the non-problematic area of overseas students courses to 21 000 full f-e-paying students. That is the fi-st positive aspect to note. The remaining 23,000 of the 44 000 full fee-paying overseas students u-dertake - elatiyely s-ort. nO!1-formal courses, mostly m pnvate mstItutIOns. These students are concentrated in English and business studies, but they are also studying in areas suc.h as aviation, computing and the arts. Thl- s-ggests that they have a genuine asplratton to undertake these improvements in their technical skills and go back to their country of origin. In 1986 this figure was 2,000. In this sector in four years we have gone from 2,000 - o 23,000. Over the past five years educatton exports have become a significant source of foreign earning for the Australian economy. The Department's records-the last ones I was able to get hold of, and I apologise that they are a little dated-show that more than $318m had already been collected in fee income this calendar year alone. If we assumewhich is not an unreasonable assumption-that for every dollar spent on fees the student spends another dollar on living costs, books, food or assistance to study, then overseas students have contributed in gross terms $636m to the Australian economy between 1 January and 12 September this year, which was the last date for which I could get figures. I draw the attention of honourable me-bers to the fact that in 1986 the gross earnmgs from the export of education services was somewhat less than $1 Om. In four years we have gone from $ 10m gross m a year to $636m gross in nine monthslet us call it a year because most of the income would have been collected in fees earlier in the year. That is a very substantial increase. The figures have gone from 250 to 21,000 students enrolled in formal studies in public institutions; from 2,000 to 23,000 students enrolled in short nonformal courses; and from $10m to $636m million in gross earnings. The industry's net contribution to Australia, which would be something else, would probably be a lower figure, although maybe the calculations I am makcultural ing for the gross figure would have to upgraded and we would have to subtract some of the fees which might have to be returned for whatever reason. Let us say we do not know what the net figure will be. What have we done? We have to the Industry Commission a reference to report-and I am assured it will port-by March next year what the net contribution of this industry is to the Australian economy. I cannot be sure of the exact figure but I think we can rest assured that it will be over half a billion dollars for this year and possibly substanStates tially higher. There are problems. What I have said so far indicates that I agree that there have been problems in this industry. It hardly surprising. It has gone from noin where to over half a billion dollars a in four years. The main problems have been associated with the private sector, which has, it must be noted, flourishedand, on the basis of the figures I have just presented-in the environment we have created since 1985. The problems, as I money. have suggested, relate to possible rorting by non-bona-fide students merely seeking back door entry, by possibly unscrupulous institutions seeking either, on the one hand, to assist the objectives of these bona-fide, potentially overstaying students or, on the other hand, to rip them off their fees. We have also had the usual business problems where a certain perstudies centage of those institutions have gone broke for reasons of mismanagement, the over-extension, under-financing, lack of quality products and so on. The point is that self-regulation in this industry has been tried, and it has failed. It has not proven to be sufficiently effecmanagement, tive and so-and I am glad to have remarketing, ceived the recommendation. from the abet shadow Minister that we should this direction-it needs legislation and regulation to a greater degree than it had in the past because self-regulation not been sufficient. With this regulatory framework we are trying to establish ulations with which we can maximise the undoubted and large financial benefits us and the consequential good social and relations which will be produced be by a large number of Australian-trained English-speaking and other languagespeaking people. in the regions of our near north which provide most of the students and while achieving these benefits to referred eliminate the rorts. How have we done this? The entry rerequirements have already been changed. These will be administered by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs so I do not wish to deal with them here; they come more properly under a different debate. The and institutions are moving in tandem in the process of establishing this new framework but, as the shadow Minister has pointed out, they do not agree is with all the directions we want to move and we are still negotiating and disyear cussing with them. This is the normal process of Federal-State relations in just about every sector I have come across as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) continually recommends, never stand between the Premiers and a bucket full of Essentially we are talking only about the private institutions. These regulations and this regulatory framework is designed essentially to cope with them and not the nonexcellent courses in law, medicine, engineering, humanities-some of which the for shadow Minister opposite used to teach, and I commend him for that-business and others that our university sector and state school sector provide. It is reputation of the private sector of the industrY which has been tarnished, unfortunately, by the behaviour of a very small number of institutions within it that have provided poor standards, facilities and but unfortunately excellent and some may have agreed to the fraudulent provision of visas for move in non-bona-fide students. The Minister for Employment, Educahas tion and Training (Mr Dawkins) has perhas haps struck his penchant for forceful expression, for which the shadow Minisregter has most certainly not commended him, when he has pointed out that there to has been a widespread perception of this group as 'sharks, spivs and fast-buck mer, chants'. Even if that is an exaggeration of the business practices in this sector, it must still be cleaned up and the generally unfounded reputation that has spilled over into the sector as a whole has to be eliminated. Between 1986 and 1990 this rapid growth has produced a, growth of ELICOS .institutions from 19 to about 105, of which about 70 per cent are privately owned, and of these the five bad apples have to be plucked from the basket. The clauses that apply to introducing a new regulatory framework for preventing the continuation of the situation are as follows. In the first instance, as set out in clauses 4 and 5 and clauses 9 to 15 of the Bill, a registry of approved providers of such courses for overseas students shall be kept by the Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and those who fail to comply with the standards established and who engage in rorting will be struck off and precluded from operating. Secondly, such registered providers establish trust funds in banks into which shall be paid received fees in advance of service so that such funds can be retrieved in the event of the service not being provided. Clause 6 is intended to protect overseas students against unscrupulous operators and ensure their good treatment when they arrive here and the maintenance of the good name of the product. Thirdly, clause 7 ensures that providers shall be insured in such a fashion that, if they do not or cannot provide the service, no person-and that means students primarily-will lose substantial sums of money as a result. Finally, the long clause 8 allows for Minister and the Secretary to monitor the behaviour of the institutions covered by the register. This Government has permitted and, indeed, encouraged this industry to develop. It wants to see these institutions flourishing to provide not only the financial contribution they have made to overseas earnings of the Australian economy but also the long term good relations that we know will spring from having large numbers of students from the Asia Pacific region learning about Australia an,d learning about how well we can do things. This Government has permitted the industry to develop, and it has flourished. As it has expanded, it has become clear that certain problems are associated with the development of this industry; it would be surprising if there were not such problems, given the enormous growth rate that it has experienced over four years. We have tried to address many of these problems in this legislation. , The shadow Minister has made a few points against this Bill. He said a couple of things I cannot agree with. First, he said that it damages Australia's credibility to market education services and that the Government has no understanding of how to set up such an industry. This is very difficult to understand. This Government created the framework in which this industry came into existence and this industry has grown extremely rapidlyshall extraordinarily so-and made a large contribution to export earnings. The Government is very intent on maintaining the flourishing nature of this industry and ensuring that it continues without the rorts which were apparently emerging in the system. The shadow Minister also made some points about the complete lack of consultation. I am afraid that I consulted the Minister's office and found that he insists that there has been discussion with the relevant State Ministers, which the shadow Minister conceded. He has a letter from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that supports the 'attempts by the Government to ensure appropriate reguthe lation of the industry' and there is also capacity within the legislation to apply its exemption provisions so that it can be flexibly applied. This is a fast growing industry. It has been financially successful. We are now trying to ensure the integrity of its administration so that it can continue to grow in the way that it has over the last four years.",148
240,Mr ALDRED,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Deakin) (10.40) In this evening's debate on the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990, once again have an example of the ernment covering up a debacle. This time it is blaming private enterprise for mess in the export education industry, we have heard already from the other side DEET. of the House. The purpose of this Bill is to provide both regulation and registration of those institutions which provide education to students from overseas. The legislation is quite simply a case of shutheard ting the stable door after the horse has bolted-it most certainly is. Whilst a sensibleÂ· government would have put into place regulations similar these in 1986, circumstances have now changed. As the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has pointed out tions quite correctly, the legislation is no longer necessary. The schools and institutions are increasingly under the control of the and Territory governments. Those govadministration ernments, perhaps conscious of the mess the Department of Employment, EducaDEET tion and Training (DEET) was making the industry, have stepped into clean the muddle. Even the Government's own requirement of overseas students having to have a visa before being allowed to pay DEET's behalf. for their course goes a long way in making this legislation completely redundant. The dishonest schools will no longer have cess to an enormous quantity of cashOctober cash, I might add, that was temptingly available in their bank accounts months, due to the bureaucrats in the Hawke Labor Government dithering with the regulations. The entry of overseas students is now also more closely controlled by immigrarecords. tion policy. As I have said previously, Department of Immigration, Local Govmight ernment and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA) is starting to exert some control over DEET's ambitions at long last. I notice evidence of a continuing dispute between DILGEA and DEET, in the Financial Review of November, where the head of the international students division in DEET, Lesley Riggs, is quoted as saying: . . . There had been tension between the departments when formulating policy. I can only say that I am pleased that skilled DILGEA is now starting to win some of we these policy formulation disputes. Ms GovRiggs is also quoted as saying:The Government had been unprofessional in the marketing some of its policy changes. as Such a statement is of course typical of The Department always appears anxious to blame someone else for its debacles; it is usually the schools-we have that again here tonight. I am simplifying matters for it. The Government and the Department of Employment, Education and Training have been careless in their handling of this industry. The to boom and bust phases that they have put the \!xport education industry through have shown the same grasp of the funcof planning and control as one would expect from a pack of rampaging soccer hooligans after a bad loss. There needs to State be a thorough investigation into the of this Department and its Minister (Mr Dawkins). It appears that officers have this compelling need of to reassure the rest of Australia that up everything is fine and dandy with the industry, and that the problems are in the past. This is clearly wishful thinking on In an earlier speech on DEET, I made acmention of a report in the Age of 30 where a Mr Hogan, the head of the overseas students section in for Melbourne, was quoted as saying: There had been no evidence of malpractice in the eight institutions looked at so far. At the time, I admonished DEET for only investigating institutions with good track In further research, I have disthe covered that, even though these firms have had a good track record, they also have had problems. It appears this DEET officer did not tell the Age journalist the whole story. What is new with DEET, as the honourable member for 13 Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) correctly says? The joint investigation by DEET, DILMs GEA and the Victorian State training board has, until this stage, been appartwo ently only a cursory study, as DEET is unwilling or perhaps unable to devote staff to the essential task of cleaning up the industry. One of the institutions studied included the Australian College of Travel and Hospitality, where they found the school failing to report students who did not achieve a 90 per cent attendance level. The study also included theÂ· International College of English, where there are complaints about the educational standards and facilities for its students. It also included Hales Business and Commercial College, which, likewise, was not meeting the 90 per cent reporting rule. I think in summary it would be fair to say that the DEET officer was not telling the whole truth when he said there had been no evidence of malpractice in the eight institutions looked at so far. Of course, this urge to hide the true position is not limited to DEET Melbourne. Indeed, it seems to be a major feature of the Department's corporate culture, particularly under its current Minister. A telex sent from the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur to Canberra on 24 May of this year summarises this culture. The telex reads: The file of abovenamed is no longer available. Following the withdrawal of the OSO officer at the time of the closure of the students section in the High Commission coinciding with the opening of the A.E.C. all student files from approximately 1981 to around April 1990 were destroyed by burning. Yes, that is an incredible situation: the destruction of hundreds, if not thousands, of files. The telex goes on: The decision to burn the files was taken by the first secretary (administration) without consultation with the migration section. He advises he consulted with the outgoing OSO officer and formed the opinion that the files were no longer required. We have pointed out that the files are migration files and subject to archival requirements. He believes there was a misunderstanding between himself and the OSO officer. The telex continues: You will note from the above that virtually all student files in the office from 1981 to April have been destroyed. We have been receiving enquiries from OSO DEET officers around Australia which we are unable to respond toNo wonder! No files. The telex goes on: Likewise we have had some enquiries from DILGEA officers for information which are unable to be answered. Appreciate you alert officers of the situation and advise them we can only provide computer held information of a limited nature for persons visaed in the last 12 months. We are unable to tell if fees have been paid or what amount may have been involved. That is the end of the telex. Of course, it could be a simple error and maybe the guilty party is actually the administrative secretary. But remember again the corporate culture of DEET. That culture historically appears to be based on two premises: making a quick buck, and keeping the people of Australia in the dark about how that buck was made.",152
241,Mr KERR,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Hear, hear!",154
242,Mr ALDRED,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"It is good to hear the approval from the other side. Is it any wonder that Australia has an enormous number of illegal migrants? The department largely responsible for the problem does not even see the need to keep comprehensive records. How many thousands, if not millions, of dollars will this latest debacle in DEET cost Australia? Mr N.A. Brown-Was it an accident this time?",154
243,Mr ALDRED,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"That is a good question which should be properly looked at, as the honourable member for Menzies rightly points out. There is another facet to this situation. It is an offence-as the honourable member for Menzies would well know, having been a former shadow Attorney-General-under the archives Act to destroy Commonwealth records. I am aware that the relevant section in the Department of Administrative Services is looking into the matter. Now that this issue has been made public, I hope there is action on the matter-and I hope the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table; takes note of this-and that DEET does not succeed in burying the issue. In conclusion, until there is both a com1990 plete investigation into DEET and a complete change in its management philosophy and culture-and I would suggest a change in the Minister, too-this House will be continually debating Bills to clean up the ongoing mess. Finally, I seek approval to table the telex mentioned in my speech. Leave granted.",154
244,Mr LES SCOTI,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"The export of education services has, of course the potential to earn Australia tremendous income in future years, largely due to the promotional efforts of this Governincreasing ment. Therefore, I am disappointed that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) and the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), with their opposiing tion to the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill, for instance, have chosen to treat the issue in such a shallow way. It really does amaze one when one thinks of the potential we have in this particular industry. The pictu,re they have painted of this industry is devoid of any detailed analysis of the foundations laid by the Government and shows a complete lack of foresight of what is required for tralia to capitalise on the export of eduand cation services and a whole range of other services as well. This is especially true the ever expanding Pacific Rim region. Take the media release of 14 November 1990 of the honourable member for able Goldstein, for instance, in which he through this legislation that the GovernGovernment ment was: . . . showing its complete contempt for those wh? are struggling to provide high quality catIOnand that: . . . there had been virtually no consultation this legislation. That has already been proven to be a of rubbish by the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley). I wish to take issue with the honourable member for Goldstein on those particular counts. The Minister for Educat.ion, Employment and Training, Mr Dawkms, has certainly been an exnecessary t-emely good Minister and well resp-cted nght throughout the education commuEnglish nity particularly and held in very high regard. I ask the honourable member for Goldstein: In the seven years of the Fraser Government what was done to promote the export of education services? Very litin tle, I would suggest. What is more, I derstand that the honourable member for Goldstein himself was a member on Mr Fraser's staff at that time. It is not surprising, then. I am very pleased to report that the number of private overseas students undertaking studies in Australia has been steadily over recent years. For the period from 1986 to 1990, for instance, the total number of private full time paying overseas students undertakcourses increased from 2,168 in 1986 to 41,739 in 1990. Good figures indeed. Enrolments of private students have increased substantially in secondary, higher education and post secondary and nonformal courses over this time. The fastest growth has taken place in the area of higher education, where, in 1986, there were 128 full fee paying overseas students and in 1990, there are 14,464. That is an Ausincrease of more than 10,000 per cent, an overall increase of full fee paying enrolments of more than 2,000 per cent of in four years. And the honourable member opposite says, in his media release of 14 November, that the disarray continues! Contrary to the claims of the honourmember for Goldstein, the true backsaid ground to the legislation is that the has always maintained an unregulated stance and promoted the growth of exports in education services. eduHowever, it would be simply irresponsible of any government to let this industry run free when certain issues emerge which clearly need addressing. The catalyst for on the substantial growth in student enrolments since 1986 which I have just cited lot was the decision by this Government to simplify student entry provisions and to encourage the provision of short English language courses. Given that our chief markets for higher education courses are in Asia, prior English language study is for most overseas students enrolling in our tertiary institutions, and the language intensive courses for overseas students-ELI COS-institutions provide this bridge to tertiary study. In my maiden speech in this place, I spoke of expanding export opportunities the service sector, the fastest growing unarea of international trade over the past 20 years. The legislation I speak in favour of tonight will do much to open up the service industry, paving the way for other service sectors such as medical, financial, travel and recreational services. This will be done through further expansions in the intake of overseas students, giving a more international perspective and hence a foothold in these areas. With services now included in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) discussions, it is important that Australia put itself in the box seat to capitalise on any new markets. We have certainly had a lot of discussions this week on GATT, which is very encouraging. The international expansion of the services sector which will flow from this legislation also has the potential to open up new doors for Australian industry overseas and the trade in services is one of the things Australia should really be trying to expand. For example, an expansion of services in our export industry can only produce more jobs and opportunities for Australians and, in doing so, improve the quality of life for all Australians. Unthe list. der the proposed Â·legislation, the Commonwealth will be able to maintain quality courses which sit well with this aim through their enhanced promotion of export opportunities. Much has been said of the unscrupulous operators in the education of overseas students. I point out to the House that the few cases of this that have taken place have been precisely because of the lack of protection measures which are now proposed. I put to honourable members opposite that if it is these unscrupulous operators who they wish to see precluded from providing courses for overseas students, why are they speaking against the establishment of a register which will achieve this wish? The absence of a register for institutions wishing to provide courses for overseas students would see an increasing number of students preyed upon and at the same time would do untold damage to the reputation of those genuine course providers. The mor-l question is also raised of the countries from which the students come who are wishing to undertake these courses. It is usually the case that these students are from poorer countries and are desperate to flee their own countries to gain the necessary skills to succeed once they return to their homeland. These students often only get to Australia with the financial support of their families, who are prepared to forsake their own well-being in the short term for their children. It is appalling to think that the Opposition would speak against legislation which protects the basic rights of these students that will give them that chance. In the now infamous media release of the honourable member for Goldstein of 14 November, he described this legislation as draconian in some of its provisions. Let us look at who is more fitting to wear the 'draconian' badge. Firstly, with regard to the legal basis for register that the Opposition is so concerned about, clause 5 of the Bill specifically provides for the exclusion from the register of any provider who does not perform. If providers abuse conditions designed to protect overseas students, they are wiped from The register will contain the name of each approved provider with rega!!:i to one or more courses in respect of a State or States. If the provider is not a natural person, the name of the principal executive officer of the provider is required to be placed on the register. The register will also contain particulars of each course in each State for which providers have been approved. The honourable member opposite says the legislation is draconian, but these are not all of the provisions. Let us look at the protection measures for students' financial interests which have already been referred to tonight. Approved providers of education for overseas students will be required to open and maintain an account with a bank in Australia to prevent the laundering of moneys from overseas into areas difficult for students to access. With the exception of any non-refundable deposits, all moneys are to be kept in such accounts. The course provider must also keep records of any amounts paid by overseas students in relation to a course; any payments out of withdrawals from that account for each person undertaking a course; and the amount remaining in the account from time to time for each student. By limiting payments out of, or withdrawals from, accounts established under these conditions to such conditions as the written authority of the student concerned or when an amount is owed by the student to Medibank Private or another hospital benefits organisation, the possibility of students being exploited is greatly reduced. For those who fail to abide by these conditions, there will be a penalty of $5,000. I would hardly call these strong protection measures draconian. Further protection is evident in clause 8 of the Bill which provides for the capacity of monitoring in compliance with the above measures. Each quarter, a detailed report of each trust account must be presented by the approved course provider containing information relating to transactions conducted during that particular quarter. Certainly, accountability is very high and is something that is very important to this Government and something that I have always been very concerned about. This report must be accompanied by a report by a registered company auditor declaring that the particulars in the report are correct, and that the provider has complied with specifically named sections of the legislation. These provisions further demonstrate that, rather than stifling this industry, which has enormous potential for expansion, as I have already mentioned, and as has been claimed by the Opposition, the Government is fully committed to promoting the export of education services as much as possible. With the focus on Australia's exports having to change to increase our international competitiveness through this legislation, the Government will open a new gate to achieve this goal. As has been shown by its performance in the Parliament this week, the Opposition is forever ready to feed the media circus with its line that more than rhetoric is needed to address our current account deficit. Yet, when given the opportunity to support a genuine initiative, all we hear are more emotional lines. This clearly shows that it is the members on this side of the House who are genuinely getting in there and doing something about broadening our export base. As I mentioned before, the ability to trade in services is one thing that we as a nation should get out there and do a lot about, and is something which should receive the full support of the House. In the first nine months of this calendar year alone, it is estimated by DEET that the Government's initiatives in promoting the export of education services have netted the Commonwealth more than $318m. Put another way, if for every dollar spent on fees, there is another dollar spent on living costs, overseas students have contributed in gross terms more than $636m to the Australian economy from January to September this year. In 1986, gross earnings for the Commonwealth from the export of education were less than $ 10m. However, not content to sit on this success, this Government has asked the Industry Commission to conduct a public inquiry into the benefits and costs of education exports and issues associated with regulation of the industry. To place Australia in the best possible position to gain from this expanding industry, the inquiry, which is due to report by mid 1991, will provide a more exact measure of the economic benefits of this industry to the Australian economy. When one looks at the outline of this particular Bill in the explanatory memorandum, it is very difficult to see why the Opposition opposes it. I think that many educational institutions would be pleased to participate and register to protect the rights of overseas students coming to Australia. In relation to particular courses, I suggest that there would be no problem in having those courses accepted, as any genuine educational institution in Australia would have little difficulty in complying with these guidelines. Educators in this country are held in very high regard, as I said earlier. Our Minister is held in exceptionally high regard. I know that people in the technical and further education institution in Bundamba, in my own electorate, always speak very highly of the Minister. He has certainly provided a real turnaround, as can be seen when we look at what is happening in education in Australia today. This Bill protects overseas students coming to Australia. It gives them confidence that they are going to be protected and receive a good education. They will be able to go back to their own countries and help, in their own way, to promote the education services that we can provide in this nation. The trade in services such as education is a real boost to this nation and it is something we really should take every opportunity to get behind and support. I certainly hope that honourable members on both sides of this Parliament will give this legislation their full support. I share with the Minister the prediction that the inquiry will reveal that education training services have become a significant new source of income for Australia. I look forward to seeing the fruits of this legislation improve the benefits which have already begun to flow to the Australian economy.",155

Bond University: Gold Coast University College",158
247,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrieft) (11.10)Fisher. Peter Ford. F. A. In the course of the last fortnight some publicity has been given to, and there has been some chat in this chamber directed at, the fact that Bond University is going to discontinue its School of Science. Over the past fortnight approaches have been made to the Government to keep for Australia as a group the unique grouping of scientists that Bond University gathered together in its science course. This course included some of the best brains in Australia, if not the world, in their own field. A few days ago the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) answered a question in this House in which he made much of the matter of a smarter Australia for the future. The Gold Coast University College of Griffith University wishes to keep this group of scientists together, and we have a unique opportunity to do that. The science course at the Gold Coast University College commenced only this year. Its applications for next year are already more than 30 per cent higher than the applications for this year. So far nearly 350 students have applied to enter the Gold Coast University College course next year. My understanding is that the amount of funding needed for the Gold Coast University College in order to retain this particular grouping of scientists would be met over the next three years under normal growth. The Gold Coast University College has been appealing to the Federal Government to provide the necessary funding now to retain this grouping of scientists on the basis of an enrolment it knows it will have within three years. With supportive funding that can be achieved. Obviously, as one of the members representing the Gold Coast, I am interested in supporting the interests of the Gold Coast University College. However, I point out to the House that on previous occasions when I have raised the subject of funding for the Gold Coast University College I have made the case that we have here the fastest growing region of Australia. Indeed, I am told that the rate of growth in the Gold Coast-Albert local government areas is not only the fastest in Australia, but also the fastest rate of growth that has ever been known in the developed world. There is a unique challenge there. When the Gold Coast University College was established, already the demand for its services was well overdue. The rate of growth of this college has been hindered only by the rate of funding. I do not say that in any sense of having a gratuitous swipe at the Government this evening; I say only that the demand is exponential. The demand for tertiary education on the Gold Coast is enormous. The age group which is into or about to enter tertiary education is a very high percentage of this already highly populated area. I point out that the population of the area is 250,000. Predictions are that within 10 years the population will be half a million. That is an enormous rate of growth, and when one compares the tertiary facilities available with comparable population in other ,parts of Australia, one can see that the Gold Coast is by no means overendowed with tertiary facilities; indeed, if anything, it is underendowed. That is a legacy of the past. I now appeal to the Government to take the opportunity to meet a wonderful challenge. Bond University in its science faculty put together a group of brilliant science researchers. To keep them together at a very small cost is imperative. The Gold Coast University College has established this year for the first time a science faculty. It is more than willing and able to take over that function that Bond University put together. It is important, not only for the Gold Coast, which can meet the demand that is necessary to support that level of funding; it is also important for the future of science research in Australia. If the Government can show it is willing to meet that small amount of funding-small in comparative terms, only $3m-it will show it is indeed serious about taking the very real opportunity that now presents itself for the future of science and science research in our nation. Health Services in South-Western Sydney",158
248,Mr GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"As honourable members may be aware, once again there has been publicity directed at the standard of health services in southwestern Sydney, particularly the operational standards of Liverpool Hospital. the Federal member for the area in quesmind tion, I wish to place on the record my absolute disgust at the manner in which the New South Wales Government has guts' allowed the standard of health service in south-western Sydney to deteriorate. Mind you, I am not surprised that the horror stories we are reading about in press have taken place. It was always going to happen, as surely as millionaires vote Liberal, that the election of a conservative government in New South Wales would spell the end of the Labor campaign of our colleague the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) to bring 'beds to the west'. The best we can say for the conservatives is that they are est. They do not care about working class people-they never have, and they are prepared to prove it by allowing more than a million people to exist under ical conditions which are of a Third World standard. Who could honestly believe that any government would be prepared to implebest ment funding cutbacks which would force 16 senior doctors to be sacked? The Greiner Government certainly was. It did so at Liverpool Hospital last year, knowof ing full well that understaffing already isted. Who could believe that a responsible government would force the closure of much needed diabetic and cardiac clinics in oneÂ· of the fastest growing and least health conscious areas in Australia? Again, the Greiner Government was prepared do so. These are two more acts of political honesty from a government which underwatch stands where its political support comes from and is prepared to act accordingly. Honourable members need only look at the comments in today's Sydney Morning Herald by our esteemed New South Health Minister to appreciate the refreshing candour of this conservative Governare ment. What did he say in response to allegations of health chaos at Liverpool Hospital? He said that the Government was well aware of medical staff shortages in some major hospitals in the region. ought to be aware; after all, he caused of them to be sacked at Liverpool. He also said that more money would be horrendous As available over the next decade-decade, you-for hospitals in the western and south-western suburbs, but he had no intention of, and I quote, 'ripping the out of hospitals in the inner suburbs. Clearly the people of New South Wales have a current health Minister who, if nothing else, is scrupulously honest. The the population may be contracting on the north shore and the more affluent sections of the eastern suburbs, but the Liberal vote is not. No sir! No Laurie Brereton 'beds for the west' from this Government: just a vague and condescending half commitment to more money in 10 years' time. I can tell this Parliament that the people honof south-western Sydney are fed up to the back teeth with promises and a standard of health care which is deficient compared with that for other residents in the Sydney medarea. We have had to accept second best for too long, and I am honest enough to say that some State Labor governments have not done as much as they could, either. Our colleague and, I believe, the health Minister to ever serve the people of New South Wales, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, has been the only shining light for the people south-western Sydney. He understood exthe problems of the west, and he took on the vested interests by pushing health funding out where it was needed. Regrettably all of his fine work has been stopped. In south-western Sydney we have finally to reached the point where we can take no more. We are not prepared to sit by and as the conservatives financially emasculate important programs, such as the program of aids for disabled people, and we are not prepa,red to see our major hospital operate with insufficient nursing, Wales medical and paramedic staff. The fact is that community leaders who fighting the campaign for better facilthe ities, such as Dr Albert Galea and Mr Neil and Mrs Joy Nielson, have the total support of the residents of Fowler. Dr Galea, as a community doctor, is at the He coalface where the problems associated 16 with the hospital are most visible and tragic. He has told me some incredibly stories about the hospital, ineluding one particularly regrettable case where a man with abdominal extension, which is fluid in the abdomen-the same complaint is evident on the other side of the House, except it is in their headshad to wait five days for admission after the specialist recommended immediate hospitalisation. That particular shortage of beds could have been catastrophic for the wider community as the man also had acute infectious hepatitis B. Joy Nielsen has been a resident of Liverpool for many years and has problems of her own. She has had a long history of illness, and has on many occasions had to travel to the north shore undertake and inner city hospitals to receive treatthe ment. Her husband Neil, who, has been active in local community affairs for more than 30 years, believes the situation has never been worse and can only continue to deteriorate-",159

(9) Are the levels of funding for nuclear science and technology research as described in an article by Verona Burgess in the Canberra Times of 30 August 1990. Mr Kerin+-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes; (a) Based on the estimated costs, the Government's contribution is expected to be about $30,000; (b) The Government's financial contribution was provided to assist in paying for the categories of services mentioned. In addition, a small number of government officers assisted with the organisation of local arrangements for the seminar. (2) Yes; copies of the speech were provided to the press at the time. (3) Invitations to Australian media representatives to attend the seminar were extended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (lAEA) to editors and senior environment, mineral resources and science and technology writers of the major newspapers in all states and territories, to the producers and senior journalists of a range of national radio and television programs, and to reporters from a number of selected magazines. The primary selection criterion was to obtain, as far as possible, a broad selection of Australian media representatives with journalistic responsibilities for the abovenamed subject areas. The IAEA received nominations from regional governments for overseas regional media participants. (4) At the request of the IAEA, officers from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), in collaboration with officers from the Departments of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) and Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and from the Australian mining industry, liaised directly with Australian media organisations in relation to the selection of Australian media participants. Participants' names were then recommended to the IAEA. (5) There have been no complaints about the procedure for the selection of the media participants. Criticisms were made by Greenpeace Australia about the lack of some other categories of participants, but these seemed to be based on a misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the seminar. Some of the criticisms have been repeated in a few subsequent representations. (6) A list of the media representatives who attended the seminar is available from ANSTO. (7) The seminar papers and speeches will be available from ANSTO. (8) Since not all seminar accounts have yet been received, the final cost is not available at this time, The agreed basis upon which costs are to be shared is that the IAEA will pay all costs, other than for the Australian participants and certain local costs. The estimated contributions, based on the seminar budget and IAEA advice of its own direct costs, are: (a) IAEA: $120,000 (approx) (b) ANSTO $ 15,000 (approx) (c) DPIE $ 15,000 (approx) (d) Australian Mining Industry $ 30,000 (approx) (9) Yes; ANSTO budget and research program documents show that ANSTO's annual appropriation is about $60 million, the bulk of which is spent on national programs in biomedicine and health; environmental protection; and medical, agricultural, industrial and other applications of radioisotopes and nuclear radiation, to the direct benefit of the Australian community. About $10 million of ANSTO's annual appropriation is directed to nuclear energy related work. Most of that is devoted to radioactive waste management studies-particularly work on Synroc, the Australian invention for immobilising high level nuclear waste-and to environmental protection studies. Aboriginal Folklore (Question No. 217) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 12 September 1990: Further to the answers to questions Nos 4205 (Hansard, 17 February 1987, page 74), lOS (Hansard, 18 February 1988, page 319), and 33 (Hansard, 21 August 1990, page 1211), have there been any Government proposals for legislation to be drafted in the area of Aboriginal folklore the report by the Committee of Inquiry into Folklife in Australia and the 1989 Unesco Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is. as follows: I am advised that the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Folklife in Australia reached the view, after having regard to the special complexities and sensitivities in Aboriginal culture, it would not report on traditional Aboriginal ceremony, lore and belief. It did however include in its consideration aspects of contemporary Aboriginal craft, and urban and rural Aboriginal life which it saw as being intertwined with the contemporary life of other communities within Australian society. It gave attention to Aboriginal broadcasting and the potential of broadcasting within Aboriginal society to conserve and develop cultural expression. I am advised that it called for a reconsideration of an earlier recommendation of a Working Party to examine possible legislation, but concluded that model provisions for national laws, advanced by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and World Intellectual Property Organisation, were not an appropriate basis for legislation to protect Aboriginal folklore in general. There has been little support from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community for traditional or contemporary culture to be codified and protected by legislation administered by the Crown. The issues are complex and the Government will be guided to a large extent in these matters by the wishes of the Aboriginal community. There have been no Government proposals for legislation in the area of Aboriginal folklore. Treasury: Sales Tax (Question No. 218) Mr Mack asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 September 1990: (I) Has his attention been drawn to claims that payment of millions of dollars in sales being evaded through abuses of the Government's system of sales tax exemptions. (2) Is any provision made in the 1990-91 Budget for closing loopholes and preventing abuses of sales tax exemptions claimed on goods to be exported under Item 110 of the First Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. (3) Are tax free sales of goods by certain retailers with an interposed wholesale company, on the basis of a certificate signed by the purchaser that the goods are to be exported, not subject to the restrictions and controls applied by the Comptroller-General of Customs to goods pursince chased from registered duty free stores. (4) Have either the Australian Customs Service or airline companies implemented procedures to ensure that goods purchased free of sales tax from such retailers on the basis of a certificate from the purchaser that they are to be exported, are in fact exported. (5) Is he able to say whether some retailers in Australia have sold goods, such as microwave ovens and 29 inch screen television sets, to purthat chasers and have accepted a claim for sales tax exemption if the claim is supported by a certificate signed by the purchaser stating that the goods are to be exported from Australia as airline passenger luggage. (6) Are goods purchased exempt from sales tax on the basis that they are to be exported supplied to the purchaser in the same way as non-exempt goods and may be used in Australia. (7) Is he able to say whether sales tax ""consultants"" have sought to enlarge loopholes in Item 110 of the First Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act by publicly promoting the view that it is sufficient that the purchaser have the intention, at the time of purchase, to export the goods, and that it does not affect the exemption if the purchaser subsequently changes his or her mind and does not take the goods overseas. (8) Was the potential for abuses of the sales tax exemptions provided in Item 110 drawn to the attention of the Commissioner of Taxation up to three years ago by officers in his Department and others; if so, did the Commissioner recommend any action to the Government to deal with the potential problem. (9) If the Commissioner had been warned of the potential for abuses but did not recommend any action to the Government, why not. (10) Has he been advised by the Commissioner of Taxation of the extent of abuse of Item 110 and the resulting annual loss to the Treasury in sales tax revenue; if so, what is (a) the extent tax is of the abuses and (b) the loss in revenue. (11) Are any steps being taken to close loopholes and prevent abuse of Item 110; if so, what steps.",162
254,Mr KEATING,IMMIGRATION POST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government is aware of difficulties being encountered by the Australian Taxation Office in administering the system of sales tax exempt ions. It was announced in the 1990-91 Budget that the current administration of conditional exemptions would be examined as part of the review aimed at simplifying the wholesale sales tax system. (2) The 1990-91 Budget did not specifically provide for any changes to be made to Item 110 in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. (3) Duty free stores which are licensed warehouses under the Customs Act are bound to operate in accordance with the requirements of that Act and its Regulations. Retail stores which are not licensed under the Customs Act are not subject to those requirements. (4) No. (5) Yes. I am advised by the Commissioner of Taxation that these types of goods have been sold free of sales tax to persons travelling overseas the basis that the goods are to be exported from Australia. (6) A person travelling overseas may only purchase goods to be exported free of sales tax by furnishing the supplier with an appropriately worded certificate of exemption certifying that the goods are to be exported from Australia. The certificate is required to include details such as the passport number, airline ticket and flight number and date of departure. Exemption is claimed on the basis that the goods are to be exported from Australia and in some cases there may be limited use of the goods prior to export. (7) The Australian Taxation Office is aware that it is argued in some circles that an intention at the time of purchase to export the goods is sufficient for exemption to apply and that subsequent events may result in the goods not being exported. If it can be shown that the purchaser did not have a bona fide intention to export the goods at the time of purchase, then the certificate supplied would be a false or misleading statement for taxation purposes. That person could then be liable to prosecution under the Taxation Administration Act. (8) The Commissioner of Taxation has been aware of the potential for abuse in relation to Item 110. The Australian Taxation Office has taken action to deal with this through increased audit activity in respect of stores selling goods sales tax free to overseas travellers. (9) The Commissioner regarded the potential for abuse of Item 110 as a compliance issue and responded by increasing audit activity. I am advised that the audits have been very successful. Large amounts of tax have been identified and action is under way to recover the tax. Prosecution proceedings will also be initiated where appropriate. (10) No. (11) The question of whether Item 110 should be amended will be considered in the course of the review of the existing system of conditional exemptions. Public Telephones (Question No. 239) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 19 September 1990: (I) How many public telephones (a) were situated in, at 1 January 1990, and (b) have been removed from, since 1 January 1990, (i) the electoral division of Reid and (ii) New South Wales. (2) What criteria are used to determine whether a public telephone should be removed or not. (3) To what extent is the level of private telephone ownership in an area a factor in determinon ing the removal of public telephones in that area.",166
255,Mr BEAZLEY,IMMIGRATION POST,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows. (I) (a) (i) 215 (this figure is approximate as the electoral division of Reid overlaps exchange boundaries.)(ii) 10,706; (b) (i) 145 (approximately); (ii) 500 The number of public payphones removed from NSW and the Electorate of Reid is due mainly to Telecom's programme of providing a card operated payphone system. Units are being withdrawn for refurbishment and modification to accept Phonecards. (2) The assessment of whether a public payphone should be removed or not takes into consideration a number of community and commercial factors and attributes the relative importance of each of the factors to the location being assessed. There are no dedicated weights applied to the factors but the assessments reflect practical, commercial and humane responses to the need for a public payphone facility. Factors evaluated consistently include the following: continued availability of line plant and continuous commercial power-facilities that must meet the requirements of the local power authority and that must satisfy Telecom specifications; changes to accessibility for maintenance, coin clearance and cleaning; changes in climatic conditions; the revenue earning potential to offset the capital investment and ongoing maintenance costs; changes in penetration in residential in the community; ongoing community needs-safety backup for domestic service; a service for travellers, visitors and the local community when away from home; the proximity of other public payphones; the need to remove payphones to upgrade the equipment; for example, the current conversion of public coin payphones to card and coin operated payphones., Given a positive response to the above factors, the following would then be taken into consideration: changes in the concentration of vehicular and pedestrian traffic; prominence of the sites following building developments; ongoing safety of location and continued acceptable environmental impact. (3) The penetration of private telephone ownership is one consideration in the many factors used to reach a decision about the allocation of the public telephone resource. There is no formula that indicates a public telephone should not be removed or provided as determined by the level of private telephone penetration. Transport and Communications: Access and Equity Plan (Question No. 249)",166
256,Mr RUDDOCK,IMMIGRATION POST,"the Minister for Transport and Communications,' upon notice, on 19 September 1990: With respect to each of the Departments and agencies for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, (a) when (i) was the first round Access and Equity Plan published and (ii) will the second round Access and Equity Plan be published, (b) what mechanisms have been set up, including at the regional level, to ensure ongoing consultation on access and equity with community organisations, (c) which community organisations or representatives are involved in such mechanisms, (d) which officer has major responsibilities for access and equity in the Department or agency and what is the officer's position and (e) what are the names and contact telephone numbers of the access and equity officers in each region.",167

Specific programs undertake the following consultative mechanisms: NA Domestic Aviation has a policy to consult widely on major policy and program changes. The views of the aviation industry, consumers, community groups and local government are sought either through a formal review process or by inviting public comment. NA The Broadcasting Council meets every two months and provides a forum for high level consultation between the Department of Transport and Communications, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Special Broadcasting Service, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters and the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia (each industry body represents regional/remote area interests) Persons or bodies outside the Broadcasting Council may make representations to the Chairman, or another member, on matters that concern them. Regular consultations take place between the Media and Communications Council (MACC) and the Department of Transport and Communications and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. MACe was established in 1984 and is a coalition of community and consumer organisations, coordinated by the Communications Law Centre at the University of New South Wales. Consultations provide an opportunity for exchange of information in regard to legislative developments, and for MACC members to provide input on the issues raised. MACC meetings have on the whole been held in Sydney at three monthly intervals. The Department provides some clerical servicing of MACe. COMMUNICA nONS OPERATIONS The UHF Section maintains a data base containing addresses of community and television industry organisations. These groups are provided with information on UHF television and FM radio services in their areas. The data base is located in Central Office iT! Canberra.

In"" dustry information seminars will be introduced on a regular basis. TELECOMMUNICA nONS Public consultation is given a high priority when changes to telecommunications policy are being considered. This was exemplified during the recent review of structural arrangements among the three carriers (ROSA). This approach was earlier taken during the policy review process leading up to the Minister's statement of 25 May 1988, and subsequently in consultation on the drafts of the Telecommunications Bill in 1989. The Department has close links with AUSTEL, and has an observer on AUSTEL's Consumer Advisory Committee (described more fully under the""AUSTEL"" heading). This representation enables further access by consumer bodies to the policy making process. NA The Australian Road Transport Advisory Committee (ARTAC) is an advisory and consultative committee made 'up of government, industry and TWU representatives which has been developed to advise the Minister on road transport issues.

This will involve ongoing consultation with women's representative groups. Aboriginal road safety campaign The Federal Office of Road Safety is partsponsoring a road safety campaign being developed by the Northern Territory Road Safety Council. The campaign targets Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and will involve consultation with Aboriginal groups in the Territory. Rural Male Drivers Under 30 and Road Safety Towards the latter part of 1989, the Federal Office of Road Safety initiated the early stages of a public education campaign to improve the safety of rural car drivers. The initiative resulted from recognition that while the population of rural areas of Australia is just over one in every three persons, the ratio of involvement of rural dwellers in road fatalities is one in two. Consultative mechanisms which were setup, to help understand the needs of the young rural driver, included listening to the target group ie. intervie'wing a wide range of young males 18-30 years of age in unstructured group discussion sessions; and listening to significant others ie. listening to other people who are closely or partially involved with male drivers under 30 years of age. NA Dialogue with staff associations, the industry, industry and community groups involved in maritime safety and regulatory services.

Members advise the Board on programs and program policies and play an important role in assisting the ABC Board to keep attuned to community needs. Although members are appointed as private individuals, they are usually people with strong links to their communities and frequently to community organisations. In addition, Radio and Television, as very different media, adopt a variety of different. strategies to maintain links with the communities they serve, including the following: ' Radio I Presentation of between 20 and 40 community service announcements weekly on the Metropolitan and Regional stations. Co-sponsoring of events of community and public interest by the Metropolitan Stations and Triple Consultation with Aboriginal and ethnic communities and organisations by a range of program areas including ABC FM; Music and Arts; Education; Spoken Word; News; Rural and Current Affairs.

Since June 1990, regular community consultations have been held by the full Board, to coincide with the monthly Board meetings. In addition, there have been consultations by the Chairman, local Board members and the Chief Executive in Capital centres where regular Board meetings do not occur. For example, theÂ· Chairman and Chief Executive recently visited Perth with the local Board member, to conduct a community consultation. Also, a community consultation involving the Chairman and the Head of Television occurred at Brisbane in August 1990. NA NA Regular meetings with the Media and Communications Council. The Council is an umbrella group comprising entertainment industry unions and public interest and consumer organisations.

The Department will participate in future workshops of this kind. State/Territory offices of the Department also have links with ethnic community organisations through participation in committees, conferences, seminars and informal networks, for example through: - DEET Migrant Services Unit in Victoria; - Queensland Department of Education, Immigration and Education Services; - Overseas Qualifications network in Adelaide, including representation on committees established by the State Government Overseas Qualifications & Skills Board; - Awards Management Branch seminars to groups of adult migrants (various states); - Bureau of Ethnic Affairs in Qld; - Federal-State Government Committee responsible for coordinating the strategy for the development of a Migrant settlement plan for WA; - Direct contact with Migrant Resource Centres; - Ad-hoc arrangements with groups involved with or representing migrant communities. The Department is involved in wide-ranging consultation with a number of organisations which are either directly or indirectly representative of the broader community in matters of industrial relations. These include peak representative organisations such as the ACTU and CAl as well Ac- as State Governments. Issues directly associated with multiculturalism are dealt with, for example, in the National Labour Consultative Council. In matters related to the operation of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act, the Department consults through ad-hoc meetings with bodies having links with ethnic community organisations, such as Government overseas qualifications units. There is also general consultation through employer associations and trade unions represented on Central and Local Trades Committees. A trial series of multilingual information spots has been broadcast recently on Melbourne community access radio, seeking a response from members of ethnic communities on such matters as award restructuring and equal employment opportunity. Approaches are made regularly by the Department with ethnic community organisations in relation to specific initiatives. For example, representatives from the recently created Work and Family Unit discussed the role of the Unit with a representative from the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia. Portfolio Agencies Portfolio Agencies have developed a range of consultative contacts, including community orAffairs in ganisations. Some examples: The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (Worksafe Australia) consults through a range of mechanisms including: - the tripartite nature of the Commission-ensuring ongoing consultation with many community organisations within industry and the union movement; - links with Worker's Health Centres; - ad-hoc working groups and committees formed for particular projects and consultations with organisations-for example when developing Worksafe Australia's work safety signs poster, a wide range of ethnic community organisations was consulted; - a consultant has been engaged as part of a noise information program to liaise with community organisations in the western suburbs of Sydney, including ethnic women's groups; - Worksafe Australia liaises with Government organisations concerned with ethnic groups, for example the NSW Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Adult Migrant Education Service (NSW) and the Office of Multicultural Affairs; and - use is made of the media, including the press and community radio. The Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) consults with its client group, the trade union movement, and addresses access sues through that forum. Of its student contacts (in the last financial totalled 86144) TUTA aims to increase the participation rate of persons of non-English speaking backgrounds, women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and the disabled so the opportunity to participate in union organisations. Courses designed and conducted specifically for women have been attended by some pants. One course was conducted for aboriginal workers in the Northern Territory. Three courses have been conducted for workers of non-English speaking backgrounds-one building industry and two in the steel industry. (c) Community organisations involved mechanisms include: - Migrant Resource Centres (various); - Federation of Ethnic Communities' Council; - Ethnic Communities Council (SA); - Adult Migrant Centre (NT); - Employment Advocacy & Health Advice Org.

Whilst residential customers are of course welcome, it was not seen as viable to set up the necessary security measures required to protect the staff if cash was handled. (b) Since no cash is kept on the Centre premises, no exceptions can be made to current arrangements. Telecom has agency arrangements with both the Westpac Bank and Australia Post to handle cash transactions. Both agencies are in close proximity to the Bunbury Telecom Business Centre and reports from the Bunbury office suggest that there are very few difficulties associated with these arrangements.""

(d) Not applicable. Country Telephone Directories (Question No. 310)  Tral1sport and Communications, upon notice, on 20 September 1990: (1) Why did Telecom decide to issue three distinct country telephone directories in Western Australia last year. (2) Did Telecom examine the likely financial impact of such a change on businesses advertising in the country directory yellow pages, especially those businesses which required advertising throughout all country regions. (3) Did Telecom determine whether the change would be cost neutral or whether it would raise additional advertising revenue.

(5) What is the estimated revenue from yellow pages advertising in (a) all Western Australian directories, (b) the metropolitan directory and (c) each country telephone directory for 1990. (6) What was the percentage revenue increase achieved as a result of the introduction of three country telephone books compared to one. (7) If Telecom will not release this information, why not.",178
267,Mr BEAZLEY,QUEENSLAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows: (1) Telecom decided to issue three distinct country telephone directories from 1988 taking into account several factors, including: - Calling patterns, which showed that less than 3% of calls were between the three directory areas. - Environmental. The three book format uses 70% less paper than the combined directory. - Cost savings of approximately $0.6 million p.a. - Improved service to small businesses in the Yellow Pages, allowing coverage of a local area only at a lesser cost. (2) Yes. Telecom records show that approximately 80% of country advertisers elected to advertise in one book, at a significant saving on costs that would have applied for a combined book. 11 % advertise in two books, at a cost slightly below the projected rate for a combined directory, and 9% (generally larger businesses) advertise in all three directories at a higher On balance, the benefits for 80% of advertisers, mostly small business, significantly outweigh the disadvantage to a much smaller number of generally large businesses. (3) The change was established to be revenue neutral. (4) Yellow Pages is a competitive service offering and this information is regarded as commercial in-confidence by Telecom. (5) Yellow Pages is a competitive service offering and this information is regarded as commercial in-confidence by Telecom. (6) Revenue growth cannot be attributed to any one factor. Other factors such as price increases, business growth and effective sales campaigns have significant impact. Generally, however, revenue increases in WA Country over the last several years have continued roughly in line with trends in other states. No change in this trend was perceived following the introduction of the three country books. (7) The only information which is not being released relates to revenue received from Yellow Pages advertising. As indicated, this is regarded as commercial in-confidence. Country Telephone Directories (Question No. 312)  Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 20 September 1990: (1) Did Telecom conduct market research, in conjunction with AGB-Spectrum, regarding the level of public acceptance of the issue of three separate country directories in Western Australia; if so, (a) when and (b) what proportion of people surveyed expressed a preference for one country telephone directory rather than three.",179
268,Mr BEAZLEY,QUEENSLAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows: Telecom commissioned AGB-Spectrum to conduct market research in July 1989. The survey showed a high level of satisfaction with the current three-book format, while noting a general preference for one directory. A summary of the findings followsI.
