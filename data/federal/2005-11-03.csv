1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 9.00 am and read prayers. NA NA BILL 2005 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill builds on the experience from the 2001 Census of Population and Housing where over 50 per cent of Australians elected to have their name-identified census information retained by the National Archives of Australia. Given the support shown by the community for this option to continue into the future, this bill will ensure that such information, from households which provide explicit consent on their census form, will be kept by the National Archives of Australia. This bill applies not only to the next census, due to be held on 8 August 2006, but to all future censuses, providing future generations with the option to have their nameidentified information retained. After each census, the information will be held for a closed period of 99 years and will then be made available for genealogical and other research. This will be a valuable activity for future generations, in that it will provide a more comprehensive picture of the people we were and the society we were in at the time of each census. All name-identified information from censuses before 2001 has been destroyed, as has the information for people who did not provide their consent in 2001. The retention of such information in future censuses was recommended by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report Saving our census and preserving our history. The Australian government accepted the committee's view that saving nameidentified census information ‘for future research, with appropriate safeguards, will make a valuable contribution to preserving Australia's history for future generations'. Australia has a justifiably strong reputation for the quality of its census information, which provides the statistical foundation for decision making by the public and private sectors. This reputation has been achieved through the excellent work of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the trust that Australians have that the information they provide will be protected. The Australian government believes that nothing should be done that would put at risk the public's cooperation in compiling the census, or the quality of census information. For this reason, and in keeping with privacy principles, the bill requires the consent of households in order for the name-identified information to be retained. Households that do not consent to the retention of their information can be assured that their census information will be destroyed as soon as statistical processing is completed. This bill ensures that in the closed access period, the retained name-identified information is completely protected whilst held by the ABS during the processing period and thereafter by the National Archives of Australia. The information will not be available for any purpose within the 99-year closed access period, including use by a court or tribunal. The bill amends the Census and Statistics Act 1905 to make it explicit that this protection includes protection from disclosure under compulsion to any Commonwealth agency. The public can accordingly be confident this picture of Australia will, in a very real sense, be preserved in a time capsule, available after 99 years has expired, as a legacy for our descendants into the future. The bill also contains a number of consequential amendments arising from the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and also harmonises the criminal offence provisions in the Census and Statistics Act 1905 with those in the Criminal Code Act 1995. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA NA NA First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.06 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill implements an important commitment made by Australia as a member of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the bank) to assist Mongolia's economic and social development. Australia values the friendly relations we share with Mongolia. Diplomatic relations were established in 1972, and we share a common voice as members of the same constituency at both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. More recently a parliamentary delegation visited Mongolia in April this year. The bank was established in 1991 to ‘foster the transition towards open market oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in the Central and Eastern European countries committed to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics.' Mongolia has made progress in implementing economic reform and encouraging private sector growth, and the bank is ideally placed to assist in future private sector development. These amendments will encourage such reforms. The board of governors of the bank unanimously voted in favour of admitting Mongolia as a country of operations of the bank, thereby making it eligible to receive development financing from the bank. The Treasurer, as Australia's governor to the bank, supported this move and voted in favour of Mongolia's membership of the bank. BILL 2005 Mongolia can only be admitted to the bank once all member countries have completed their ratification process. The bill implements this commitment by amending article 1 of the Agreement Establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to specifically provide that Mongolia be a country of operations of the bank. The bill also creates a regulation-making power so that any future amendments to the agreement can be made by regulation. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",19
2,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (9.09 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: RAAF Base Amberley redevelopment stage 2, Queensland. The proposed RAAF Base Amberley redevelopment stage 2 will provide new working accommodation and infrastructure for the multi-role tanker aircraft to be operated by No. 33 Squadron; provide new working accommodation for elements of 9 Force Support Battalion; and upgrade and refurbish the base's engineering services and infrastructure. The proposed redevelopment provides suitable facilities and infrastructure to enhance the base's operation requirements. With the planned arrival of the multi-role tanker transport aircraft, RAAF Base Amberley will be one of the busiest Defence airfields in Australia. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposed works is $285.6 million. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction could commence late this year and be completed by December 2007. I would like, on behalf of the government, to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",20
3,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (9.10 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Relocate selected RAAF College units to RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, and RAAF Base Wagga, New South Wales. The Department of Defence proposes the relocation of selected elements of the RAAF College. This will involve, firstly, the relocation of the RAAF College Headquarters from RAAF Williams, Point Cook Base in Victoria to RAAF Base Wagga in New South Wales; secondly, the relocation of the Officer Training School from Point Cook Base to RAAF Base East Sale in Victoria; and, finally, the relocation of No. 1 Recruit Training Unit from RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia to RAAF Base Wagga. The relocation project will comprise a number of distinct elements. At RAAF Base East Sale there will be new administration, training and living-in accommodation facilities for the Officer Training School, as well as a new combined mess and an upgrade to various base support elements, including the base engineering services. At RAAF Base Wagga there will be new administration, training and living-in accommodation for No. 1 Recruit Training Unit; a refurbishment to the airmen's mess kitchen; an upgrade to various base support elements, including the base engineering services; and officer accommodation for the Headquarters RAAF College, which will be provided by refurbishing an existing facility. The total budget for the proposed works is $133.4 million, with at least $60 million expended at each site. In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of of the Defence accepts and will implement these recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will start later this year and be completed by the end of 2008. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (WORK CHOICES) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 November, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time.",21
4,Mr BEAZLEY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I absolutely oppose this bill. This government, with total control, is out of control. It has turned its sights on that most basic protection of our people-a fair and decent wage. The bill is evidence of a government growing more extreme and arrogant and more out of touch by the day. It is the product of an extreme, outdated ideology-an ideology that has nothing to do with the challenges we face in the first quarter of the 21st century and nothing to do with the nation's economic needs, but everything to do with the prejudices that one politician formed in the last quarter of last century. the most savage attack on the values of Australian society and the security of working families that I have seen in 25 years in this place. The Australian public are just now getting to understand how un-Australian this bill is. They know it threatens aspects of the Australian way of life that they have held sacred for generations-fair minimum wages for all workers, decent working hours so families can organise to spend time together, penalty rates and shift loading. So much of this is now at risk; so many of these provisions will be eroded by this bill. This nest of termites will now eat away at the foundations of the living standards and security of working families. Month by month, year by yearthere will be no cataclysm in this-workers who do not have strong bargaining power will see the steady erosion of their rights and entitlements, and those who do have strong bargaining power will be fewer and fewer in number. Australians simply do not want this law. They do not want to wind the clock back to the 19th-century model of industrial relations, where employers enjoyed absolutely unchallenged power over employees enforced through individual contracts. Every published opinion poll points in the same direction-two in three Australians oppose this legislation. That is why the Prime Minister has been so desperate with it. It is why he has rushed this legislation into parliament1,252 pages of legislation and legal explanation. Only after we twisted his arm did we get even 24 hours to make our way through the complex maze of this bill. It is why he has had to pull Andrew Robb onto the job, because his minister has done such a pathetic and unconvincing job of a sales pitch. It is why he has had to pull in Ted Horton and the Liberal Party advertising agency, Dewey and It is Horton, who runs their nasty election campaign as. It is why he has had to pull in 11 big-city law firms to write the bill for him. It is why this government has had to steal $55 million worth of taxpayers' funds-more than the entire spending on the federal election campaign by all the parties in last year's election-to fund Liberal Party as to try to change people's minds about this disgusting law. Why do I emphasise these things? Because this is straight out of Liberal polling tactics, straight out of Liberal advertising; this is a pure political exercise of Liberal ideology. The Prime Minister's problem is this: no matter how much he tries to ram his as down the throats of Australian families, he is up against something that is bigger than anything he has tried to do in his nine long years of office. This is not some technical argument about federalism and states rights, though every now and then they seem to retreat to that. It is not an academic debate about labour market institutions and productivity growth. It is not a textbook debate about backwards-bending labour supply curves. It is about basic values and the lives of Australian families. It is about the kind of Australia we want our kids to grow up in. It is about how mums and dads manage the difficult balance between work and family life. It is about whether we put families first, whether we say that what we value most in our society are family and relationships and a fair go for everyone, whether we still believe that being an Australian means respecting and valuing every person in this country-no matter if they are a kitchen hand, a nurse, a mechanic or a customer service representative. Let me make this clear. John Howard picked this fight. And he is not just fighting the unions or the Labor Party; he is fighting against basic values that Australians do not want to lose-the right to a fair go and the belief that you deserve decent standards and decent protections, even if you cannot afford a big-city law firm to protect you in court. The real danger for John Howard in this law is not that Australians do not know enough about this legislation and need to be told more; the real danger for him is that Australians already know enough about what he is trying to do in this bill. They know exactly what it is all about, and that is why they do not trust him. Frankly, the more they find out about it, the more detail they get, the more the tide will move against him. But the Prime Minister assumes that, if he just shouts louder and louder and longer and longer, he will win the argument-like a child who does not want to face the truth but just blocks his ears and raises his voice to fever pitch. And hasn't it been a fever pitch for the month? There is barely a place you can turn to-on TV, on radio, on Australian web sites or in papers-without being bombarded with this deceitful, misleading campaign. The real character of what is in this bill is shown up by the arrogance and deception that has characterised these changes from day one. If you want to know what is behind these campaigns, look at the tricks they have used to introduce it with this ad campaign. Never in Australian history have we seen such a partisan abuse of public funds. In other democratic nations you could not get away with this abuse. In other nations governments have fallen and leaders have been forced to resign for abuses of office smaller than this. You would go to jail for this campaign in the United States. These as do not provide information; they provide disinformation, as every independent commentator has been saying for months. Australians will not accept what this bill tries to do to their way of life. You can imagine what it must have been like in the Liberal Party strategy room when they first got the polling results back in June and decided to blow this money. Imagine the atmosphere. Mark Textor plonks down a slab of polling results showing that 70 per cent of the Australian community believe the changes are bad news. He says to the Prime Minister, ‘You're in trouble. You just cannot sell this law to the workers. They're not going to buy it; they don't trust your motives; they don't want to lose their holidays; they don't want to lose the independent umpire; they don't what lose their penalty pay.' ‘If you're going to win this debate,' Ted Horton says in this gathering, ‘we're going to have to turn the message inside out. Don't tell them what we're taking away; just tell them what we're letting them keep, and bombard them every day and night until those poll numbers shift.' We can tell exactly what the last Prime Minister said in response: ‘Whatever it takes, whatever we have to spend. It is not Liberal Party money anyway. It comes from the taxpayers, so we can take as much as we like and to hell with it. They can't vote us out now.' We can see exactly the strategy they came up with. They will not tell us what the legislation really does. They will not tell us that takes fairness out of the national wage case. They will not tell us that it takes rights against unfair dismissal away from almost four million Australians and compromises for all the rest. They will not tell us it allows employers to dismiss workers with no compensation simply by bringing in the lawyers and restructuring the business. They will not tell us that it smashes the award system, destroys the no disadvantage test-the foundation of a fair system of enterprise agreements. Instead of telling people what the legislation really does do, the as tell us what the legislation does not do. It is like an arsonist who burns down your house who, as it all goes up in flames, just says, ‘Well, you've still got the garden shed protected by law!' The whole aim of the ad campaign to sell this bill has been to create the false impression that the laws give stronger legal protection than people have now. That is exactly the message they convey. It is not an information campaign; it is a political advertising campaign conducted for the partisan political purposes of the Liberal Party. It is precisely what that great English writer George Orwell was writing of almost 60 years ago in his landmark essay, Politics and the English language: … political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness … … … … … designed to make lies sound truthful … Let us take a couple of examples of making lies sound truthful. Under the award system, Australians have 20 pay and condition standards that are protected by law. After this bill is passed, they will have just five. But the Prime Minister hopes that, by talking about the five and how they are protected by law, we will not know what is happening to the other 15 entitlements that can now be reit moved at the stroke of a pen-rights like holiday leave, redundancy pay and penalty rates. Take another example: employees' rights to protection from unfair dismissal. The as tell us that employees' rights against unlawful dismissal are protected by law, hoping to confuse people about the difference between unlawful and unfair dismissal rights. An honest information campaign would tell people about the difference between the two sets of rights, and tell them that for 99 per cent of workplaces the government wants to abolish unfair dismissal rights completely. Instead, there is no mention of what is being taken away, just the misleading impression that nothing is changing. Take another example-the example the government cites to show the benefits of enterprise agreements. The as suggest that to enjoy the flexibility of these agreements we need to change the bargaining laws, but the fact is that the flexibility to improve work practices and to get higher pay is already in the system. It has been there in part since 1991 and in full since 1994, and it is what has underpinned the growth of real wages for 15 years-introduced by a Labor government. The bill does not make it any easier to increase pay; it just makes it easier to cut take-home pay because employers do not need to compensate workers for taking away entitlements like penalty rates, holiday pay and shift loading. That is the breathtaking arrogance of the Prime Minister-taking millions upon millions of dollars out of the pockets of working Australians and bombarding them with a campaign that tricks them about the rights they have already got, that tricks them about what they stand to gain and that tricks them about what they now are going to lose. It is a typical mealy-mouthed, tricky, lawyerly deceit that has characterised John Howard's prime ministership for nine long years. And it is a deception from the beginning to the end, because they know that they cannot let Australians know the truth about this bill. But on this side of the House we will fight to let them know. As leader of the Labor Party, let me say how proud I am to be able to take the lead in this House in defending the rights of working families against the attacks in this bill. Let me say how much I look forward to the contributions of my colleagues as we dissect these 1,252 pages of infamy and expose this bill for what it really represents-the greatest backward step, the most systematic attack on the Australian way of life and Australian values, the most systematic attack that we have seen in a century in this parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. Let me go straight to the government's deceitful rationale for this bill, because we are going to hear a fair bit about that over the next few months and years. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations says it is about higher productivity. The Prime Minister yesterday was saying it was about the economy. Of course this government has never offered anything more than an assertion; it has never demonstrated any understanding or interest in the serious international economic debate about what drives productivity in a country like ours. If it was interested in understanding productivity, it would quickly learn this: its own policiesclosing the door of TAFE colleges to young Australians, squeezing the universities, giving no priority to research and development and innovation-are the clear explanation for the slump in productivity growth in recent years. Let us not forget that Australia is the only country in the developed world in the past decade that has actually cut public investment in education and training. The reality is this: if we do not invest in the skills of our work force, the only way we can compete is by cutting pay and fostering a competitive option for low-skilled, low-wage temporary jobs. You do not compete with India and China on the basis of skills; you compete with them on the basis of wages. And on the basis of that every Australian family goes to hell in a hand basket. That is the road the Liberal Party wants to take us down-as if we could compete with low-wage countries like China and India. And it has started already with the regulations gazetted by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs this week that set up a system of foreign apprentices in Australia, a system that gives employers the incentive to bring in apprentices from overseas because they know they will have absolute control over those workers. If they do not do what they are told, they lose their apprenticeship and they have to leave the country. How do young Australians compete with the low wages and poor conditions of overseas apprentices? But this is the bleak world that John Howard's industrial and migration laws now are creating. It is a profoundly pessimistic view of Australians in the future, but it is all you have got left if you do not believe in investing in your own people. Our view on this side of the HouseLabor's view-is completely different. We believe Australia's future prosperity will come from competing on the basis of our creativity and skills, not by cutting minimum wages. That is why we need a genuine productivity agenda which allows businesses and employees to share the gains of both pay rises and profit rises. Let us not forget it was the Australian Labor Party that delivered the golden era of productivity growth in the 1990s. But it is the Liberal Party whose narrow, antiworker, antiskills ideology has delivered the productivity slump of recent years-great productivity growth under Labor, great productivity slump under Howard. What this country needs is not these 1,252 pages of extremism. What we need is a positive vision for raising productivity, not a negative vision for cutting pay. First, above all else, our labour market policies need to focus on helping people to work smarter. It means recognising Australian workers as the greatest asset in our nation. It means investing in the know-how of Australian workers. It means rejecting short sighted policies of cutting back the national investment in skills and education. It means giving every Australian school student the choice of a first-rate, specialist trades or technology high school. It means training Australian workers, instead of relying so heavily on importing 180,000 skilled workers from overseas. It means no longer turning away Australians from TAFE colleges, as the Howard government has done to 270,000 Australians. It means fostering better management practices and fostering innovation, like our competitors have been doing. It means national leadership to deal with our crumbling infrastructure. There is a genuine agenda for productivity growth: improved skills outcomes, better human resources management practices, a new approach to innovation, national leadership on infrastructure and competition policy. But instead we get this attack on the living standards of Austhe tralians from a government that has no ideas to raise productivity, just tricky ideas as to how to cut pay. As our eyes glaze over with the mindnumbing complexity of these 1,252 pages of legislation, we might as well ask what we are doing in this House debating it today. If it not about productivity, what is it for? The Prime Minister let the cat out of the bag some months back at the Liberal Party Federal Council meeting as he fought off rising internal opposition to this plan. As he said in his own words, industrial relations is just an article of faith for him. It is not a matter of reason; it is a product of brittle, extreme ideology. It is because John Howard has been obsessed with industrial relations laws for almost 30 years. And now, with unchecked power in this parliament, John Howard can impose his ideological vision on the nation. So Australian families now face the erosion of their work and pay conditions, all because of one man's ideological obsession with an outdated view of Australian workers. Australian workplaces have changed since Treasurer John Howard messed up his economic policies and oversaw a wage breakout of 14 per cent back in 1982. But John Howard has not moved with the times. What this bill shows is a plan to take us backwards to the 19th century world, even with the same arguments and language of the 1890sthe ‘freedom of contract', the language used to justify employers having unrestrained power over their employees. More than a hundred years ago, Australia abandoned that. It was not under a Labor government. Indeed, it was under Alfred Deakin, who as Attorney-General introduced the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. With that bill, Deakin called forth a new era that recognised the rights of workers. I quote him: Social justice is a lofty aim ... We have trusted for centuries to the various tribunals erected for administration of civil justice, and I hope that we shall begin from this day forth to trust to these courts for industrial justice. There is no interest in justice in the Liberal Party of today. The Liberal Party is not the Liberal Party of the turn of the century in Federation; it is the pre-Federation Liberal is Party with just a nasty right wing, hand-medown ideology to Americanise our workplaces. Let us be plain and simple about this: it Americanises our workplaces. But I have got to say this: having had a chance to study this bill and knowing that that is what I thought their intentions were, actually American workers have more rights than Australian workers will once this bill is through. This has gone beyond Americanisation of workplaces-perhaps the South Americanisation of workplaces. This bill is like, as I have said before, a nest of termites that in the months and years ahead will slowly eat away at the foundations of the living standards of our families. It undermines family life by proposing to give employers the power to change employees' work hours without reasonable notice. It attacks living standards, removing the no disadvantage test from all our collective and individual agreements. It abolishes annual wage increases-made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for workers under awards-with the simple aim of reducing the minimum wage in real terms. It delays the next national wage case by a period of six months so that at least 1.7 million workers under awards will not receive a wage increase for a period of 18 months or longer. It destroys the legacy of the hard work of generations of Australian workers. It undermines the principles of fairness that have underpinned the Australian industrial relations system for the past hundred years. It takes away the independent umpire who currently can ensure fair wages and conditions and resolve disputes. It distorts the workplace bargaining relationship in favour of employers and against employees. It denies Australian employees the capacity to bargain collectively with their employer for decent wages and conditions. It denies individuals the right to reject ual contracts which cut pay and conditions and undermine collective bargaining and union representation. It allows individual contracts to undermine the rights of Australian workers under collective agreements and awards by eliminating penalty rates, shift loadings, overtime, holiday pay and other award conditions. It takes away any protection from unfair dismissal from almost four million workers and, frankly, seriously compromises it for all. A little known point in this piece of legislation is that for workplaces over 100 there is a right of unfair dismissal now if it is in the operational requirements of the company. That is before we get to analysing all the complexities in this which allow for constant restructuring of the work force, constant creation of greenfield sites in which for five years no strikes can take place and so on. It proposes to fine union representatives up to $33,000 if they negotiate to include health and safety, training and other clauses in agreements-and if they do not pay that fine they go to jail. The dishonesty and deception is becoming clear. First, the government say they want to simplify workplace laws. But they have added 1,252 pages of complex law and legal explanation. Kevin Andrews could not get his own department to write the law. They had to hire 11 law firms to write it for them at enormous cost to the taxpayers. Second, they say the law will provide for fair wage decisions by the new Fair Pay Commission. But the bill does not even allow the Fair Pay Commission to take fairness into account when it comes to pay decisions. Right now, the AIRC makes wage decisions based on fairness-that is explicitly in section 88B of the current law-but, under section 7J of the new law, the Fair Pay Commission is not even allowed to take fairness into account in making its decisions. They have explicitly cut fairness out of the wage decisions for individstruggling Australian families. Third, they say the bill aims to get rid of unions having a say in working conditions. But the bill gives the Liberal Party minister control over every wage agreement in Australia. There has never been such power for an industrial relations minister. The bill hibits any workplace agreement from including what the minister decides is prohibited content. The minister can decide to prohibit anything he likes. Already, they have decided that they will slap a $33,000 fine on a union official who asks an employer to include a provision in the agreement that protects workers from unfair dismissal, a $33,000 fine for asking for union involvement in dispute resolution, a $33,000 fine for asking for a commitment to collective bargaining. So what comes next? What else will the Liberal Party prohibit? What other bans will they slap on the Australian workplace in their micromanagement of Australian work practices? It is an offence to try to negotiate thing the minister prohibits. So, with one stroke of a pen, a Liberal Party minister can interfere in every single enterprise agreement signed up in Australia, no matter what its character. Fourth, it appears the bill will allow an employer to require employees to sign an Australian workplace agreement or lose their job. Section 104 of the bill says specifically that it is not duress for an employer to require an employee to sign an AWA. That seems to say, despite what the explanatory memorandum says and despite all the government's claims, that an employer in fact can demand you sign the contract or you lose your job. We need urgent clarification of this because we know that the AWA can remove basic pay conditions that families rely on to survive from week to week such as overtime, penalty rates and holidays. The Prime Minister tells us in this place that he is the workers' best friend. With friends like this Prime Minister, who needs enemies? And here in this House yesterday, as he slapped the minister on the back and congratulated him on his attack on working Australians, we saw his mask drop. We saw the end to the pretence of friendship with pro- working families. The Prime Minister has exchanged hypocrisy for vice. In the government's extreme changes that we debate today, we see Australian politics stripped bare. Australian politics is reduced to its historic essentials in this debate. This is how Australian politics began: two opposing political forces, two opposing political ideas, on one side my party, this fighting Labor Party, a parliamentary vanguard at the head of a mass movement of millions, united to fight for mateship and the fair go at work, standing alongside the trade union movement-the other wing of the total Labor movement, that movement which has fought so nobly for so long for decent pay and conanyditions for ordinary Australians, which has stood up when it has often been hard to stand up, which stood up for people other than their union members, which stood up for fairness, decency and social justice in this nation for 100 years-and it is targeted in this legislation for jail, for fining and for destruction. And then opposite us: this lousy rotten tory mob determined to tear this country apart, to set family against family, friend against friend and to politicise every workplace. In 25 years in public life, I have never seen a greater threat to Australian living standards than the government's extreme plan-one man's tired old dream; a living nightmare for all Australians. This fight will go on until the next election, and my party will go to that election on a platform to dismantle the system the government has put up, the injustices that are contained in it, and to put in place a balanced and fair industrial relations act. This law is gone. The Labor Party will fight to the end for the rights of working Australians. We will fight for a fair go for all Australians. We will fight for the rights of working families and decent work laws. We will fight for a strong safety net of minimum award wages and conditions, an independent umpire to ensure fair wages and conditions and to settle disputes, the right of employees to bargain collectively for decent wages and conditions, the right of workers to reject individual contracts and the forbidding of individual contracts which cut pay and conditions and undermine collective bargaining and union representation, proper rights for unfairly dismissed workers and the right to join a union and be represented by a union. That is our party's policy platform, if government wants to know it. It appeared not to want to yesterday. Our party was created by working people and has been built on their determination, their dreams, their unshakable belief in a fair go for everyone, and we will never walk away from the right of every Australian to a fair go.

5,Mr ROBB,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise to speak in very strong support of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. This is a hugely important body of legislation for Australia. By putting faith in greater choice and flexibility in the workplace rather than in choking regulation, this legislation will underpin the future prosperity of Australian workers and their families for generations to come. This is fundamental legislation and fundamental reform. This legislation will promote job growth and job security. This legislation will promote a strong economy and better living standards for all Australians. This legislation will unlock productive capacity at every workplace and give everyone a bigger slice of the pie. This legislation will empower employees to directly influence their own work arrangements. This legislation will allow flexibility as never before, allowing for more family-friendly work practices as well as arrangements which suit people who do not have families. This legislation will make it easier for the small and medium sized businesses, the local corner store, the small tradesman and the mid-sized tourist venture to make agreements with their employees that are relevant to their businesses. It will provide opportunities for employees and, in turn, make for happier, more collaborative and more productive workplaces. This legislation will provide opportunities for small and medium sized businesses that larger businesses have enjoyed from some of the legislative changes over the last 12 years. This will spread the the productivity improvements that we have seen from a more flexible workplace over the last 12 years-the evolution we have seen over the last 12 years to a more productive and flexible system. This legislation is fundamental to spreading that evolution to small and medium sized businesses-to hundreds of thousands of workplaces across our economy. By promoting flexibility and greatly simplifying the system of industrial relations, this legislation will deliver better outcomes for interest rates and employment and inflation, a factor ignored by the Leader of the Opposition in his tirade over the last 30 minutes. Fundamental to these changes is the health of the economy. Jobs, growth, productivity and quality of life all stem from a strong economy-these changes are fundamental to that. This legislation will promote the ability to adapt and compete effectively in a global world, ensuring quality employment prospects for our children. There is an inevitability about the need for these changes. It has come since 1970 with the globalising of the world economy. We cannot go on with a blinkered view about trying to prevail and to protect the regulation that has endured for 100 years; we have to be able to adapt and compete in this global world. This legislation is fair to unions but requires unions to earn their place in the sun and not have it guaranteed by legislative fiat. This legislation ensures our workplaces will no longer be hamstrung by a one-size-fits-all approach to workplace regulation. This legislation is about letting the people who know what is best for them choose the working arrangements which work best for them. At their core, these workplace reforms are about giving every Australian new freedoms and new choices while ensuring strong safeguards and protections. They are about enhancing the way of life of everyday Australians. Yes, ever since these reforms were announced we have faced a campaign of scaremongering and deliberate deception from those opposite and from their ACTU bosses. We have heard that society will crumble, that living standards will fall, that economic growth will stop and that there will be a class war. We heard it all again this morning-on and on and on and on. There was no substance, just endless rhetoric. We have heard that democracy is under threat. We have heard that this is a pact with the devil. We have heard that reform will lead to enslavement. Indeed, just about the only thing we have not heard is that the earth will stop spinning-although it did not stop at the suggestion that women and children will be murdered as a result of these reforms. This crying wolf, this facile exaggeration and this deliberate deception will come back to seriously bite those opposite. Their pathetic overreaching is leading the electorate to largely switch off from this issue, because they have heard it all before. They have heard all this scaremongering, this facile exaggeration, endlessly from the other side of the House. In 1996 we heard the Chicken Littles opposite say the same thing. We heard from the member for Perth: The Howard model is ... about lower wages; it is about worse conditions; it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation; it is about the abolition of safety nets; and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards ... John Howard will reduce your living standards. This was 1995, not 2005, from the shadow minister. Of course we now know that this prediction was nonsense. Precisely the reverse occurred. Yet this has not stopped the member for Perth and the Leader of the Opposition crying wolf, making the same extreme predictions. It is intellectually lazy or inept or both and it patronises the Australian people. The overreaching and the scaremongering from the Labor Party is also saturated with hypocrisy. For over a decade both sides of politics have recognised the need to modernise our workplaces, to turn away from a centralised way of doing things, to encourage our businesses to be flexible and fast on their feet. In 1992 Paul Keating told the International Industrial Relations Association Congress that the system at the time: ... was doing its best but it had just about run out of possibilities. Every principle had got a run at one time or another-basic wage, total wage, relativities, work value, absorption, non absorption, flow ons, no flow ons, indexation, no indexation, minimums and maximums, industry decisions and national decisions ... Every principle, except the simple and straightforward principle of working together to find outcomes which left us all better off. In 1993 Paul Keating, when speaking to the Institute of Company Directors, said: Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards ... Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards, with fewer clauses ... We need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards ... to being full substitutes for awards. This is not John Howard in 2005; this is Paul Keating in 1993, and it was the forerunner to an attempt to bring in legislation to give effect to that model. To deliver this Keating model-that is, to make agreements full substitutes for awards rather than add-ons to awards-the no disadvantage test would need to be replaced with a strong safety net set within a framework of minimum standards. This is exactly what our legislation proposes. This is one of the points that we keep hearing from the opposition. Those opposite know this, of course. They know that what we are proposing gives effect to the model that Paul Keating outlined in 1993. It is why they have spent the last three weeks fulminating about the cost of communicating the detail of the legislation while ignoring the substance of the changes in the legislation. We heard it again this morning. We heard the Leader of the Opposition spend probably half his time on a tirade about the communication program, ignoring the substance of the changes in the legislation. They have asked for months for details on the substance and when they got it they ignored it. We have had two weeks of facile arguments about the cost of communication in the face of a campaign of deliberate deception by the ACTU and deliberate deception over many months by those opposite. The fact is that in their hearts those site fundamentally know that what we propose is good for workers and good for the country but not good for their political tions and not good for the privileged, protected comfort zone of their union bosses. On the other side of the House they are under instruction on this matter. You can see state leaders all around the country under instruction to go out and do their bidding. They have not got their hearts in this. They stand that these changes are fundamental to the future well-being of Australian families and for that reason they are fulminating and carrying on with politics but not with the substance that is put in front of the House with this legislation. As the member for Lilley said in 1993 when Labor introduced workplace legislation: I support the Industrial Relations Reform Bill because it will accelerate the move towards enterprise bargaining, continue to make Australia a more productive and competitive nation and lead to the generation of more jobs ... That was well said. The member for Lilley was talking about the model articulated by Paul Keating. We all know that the final Keating legislation was nobbled by the ACTU back in 1993, but it was a start. It was a start in the move to true agreement making at the workplace level-a start we aim to complete with these reforms. Labor's crass opposition runs counter to their own policy disposition when in government. When they came into opposition in 1996 they chose to follow a strategy of opposing for opposing's sake. Since being in opposition they have talked endlessly about economic reform, but when it comes to the crunch they can never vote for economic reform. Not content with simply opposing our 1996 workplace reforms, they have opposed every major piece of reform this govoppoernment have put forward. On top of workplace reforms they have opposed welfare reform, GST reform, waterfront reformambi- another major productivity improvement opposed in total by this opposition-$21 billion in recent tax cuts and the related reforms to tax thresholds. There was also their total opposition to the sale of Telstra, higher education reform, border protection measures, health insurance rebates and the recunder- ommendations of the Cole royal commission. There is an endless litany of opposition to every piece of substantive reform this government have put forward. With every flurry of opposition they have cried wolf and they have predicted dire consequences. We have heard it again this morning. Noise is no substitute for reasoned debate, yet all we get is bluster, hyperbole and misguided attempts at political opportunism. No wonder their party president recently dismissed their policy platform, acknowledging that their: ... unwillingness to tackle tough issues courageously creates an image of indecisiveness and lack of conviction. That lack of conviction is being exposed once again. In full force, over many months, endlessly their lack of conviction is being exposed. They are opposing reforms which I sense they know in their heart of hearts are right and are good for Australians. Certainly they agreed with the policy direction when Paul Keating talked about these reforms. They embraced it then; they have opposed it ever since they got into opposition. It is cheap political opportunism and they will be found out again and again. By allowing employees and employers to choose what works best for them, this legislation will facilitate the spread of the cultural change that has been evolving in our workplaces over the last 20 years. Fast fading is the 19th century model of a bitter them-andus class struggle, where workers are treated as industrial foot soldiers and the workplace is treated as a battleground. There is no place in a modern economy for this mentality. Fundamentally, Work Choices is about giving all businesses in Australia the chance to share in the simple, straightforward principle of working together to find outcomes which leave us better off. Our current system encourages employees and employers to outsource their problems to a third party. There is especially the welter of regulation which still discourages small and medium businesses to take responsibility themselves. It encourages them to outsource their problems to a third party-a union, an employer association or the commission. This encourages antagonism and rigidity. It works against an adaptable workplace, it works against a flexible economy and it works against competing effectively in a world market. Work Choices places the primary emphasis on employers and employees to resolve their differences and to identify opportunities at the workplace level. This means that both employers and employees will need to develop their abilities to manage their relationships at the workplace level-to be more open and more empathetic. Developing more open and more collaborative workplace relationships will provide significant benefits to employers, workers and, ultimately, the whole community. We have seen it again and again where this flexibility has spread through larger businesses that have had the money to deal with the complexity of the system and still take up some of the big productivity improvements. We have seen a fundamental change in the attitude, the opportunities, the flexibility and the productivity. Take Rio Tinto, for example-with workplace agreements across all of their miners in the Pilbara. There has been a fourfold increase in productivity and a fivefold increase in improvement in safety ever since they went to a collaborative arrangement. Compare that with the record of industrial sabotage and total disruption that plagued that industry for 20 years. It is a revolution which we need to see spread throughout the Australian economy, through small and medium sized businesses. Open communications lead to a happier workplace. It means that individual circumstances are known and can be taken into account. It also means that employees can share their ideas and know-how with their employer, which will benefit productivity. It is a partnership between an employer who brings capital and a business to the table and an employee who brings not only labour but know-how. Employees understand their work and their responsibilities. They are a great source of invention and productivity improvement. If employers can tap into a collaborative workplace which forces employers to work better with their employees, it will encourage and unlock the ideas and the know-how of employees, which will benefit the activities of each business. Better productivity leads to a stronger, more sustainable business and a stronger, more sustainable economy. There is nothing which generates job growth, higher wages and security of employment more than a strong economy. By delivering a strong economy, with opportunity for people to give expression to their own unique talents and circumstances, people will be happier and more fulfilled and we will see steady improvements in the quality of life for all Australians. At the same time as freeing up Australians to have a say in what is best for them, the government also recognise that strong protections are needed to ensure that the vulnerable are not exploited. There are very strong protections throughout this legislation. We have worked very hard to ensure that we have genuine bargaining at the workplace level. That is a must if this system I support Work Choices because it will deliver real benefits for Australia. In my earlier life, my involvement in the Mudginberri wide-comb dispute opened my eyes to the straitjacket that a highly regulated centralised industrial relations system places on employees and employers and on the country as a whole. At Mudginberri, an agreement between an employer and his employees to pay on the basis of productivity suited the economics of the meat works and the peculiar nature of that remote workplace. Despite the fact that the workers were happy with the deal-and why wouldn't they be; they were by far the best paid meatworkers in the country-it took two years, a $10 million fighting fund, 27 court cases and a $2.3 million damages bill to convince the union that this was a good and proper thing for the country. The wide-comb dispute in the wool industry highlighted the foolishness of unions opposing the adoption of new technology. If they do not adapt, the world will pass them by, ultimately putting at risk many jobs in an industry that they purport to protect. These and other disputes were a forerunner to the legislative changes of the last 12 years, to the evolution which has significantly contributed to the robustness of the Australian economy over the last decade-an evolution that must continue and go further if we are to maintain that economic strength. We must never lose sight of the fact that the quality of life of the Australian people critically depends on the strength of the economy. The government have worked very hard over the last 9½ years to improve the lot of the working men and women of Australia, and we are very proud of the record. These reforms are fundamental to continuing the improvement in the quality of life of Australians now and in the future. They are fair and they are a progressive set of reforms, and I is to work. commend the bill to the House.",29
6,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS," The problem for the House and the problem for the Australian community is that these reforms in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 are not evolutionary; they are revolutionary. These reforms tilt the balance of power in the workplace so substantially against the employee in favour of the employer and do that in such an unfair way that they effectively change the culture that Australians have come to see in our workplaces. These are not evolutionary reforms; they are revolutionary reforms. The proof of that is in this very simple fact: we heard none of these things in the run-up to the last election, yet now they are so tremendously and terribly important that they have to be done or our economy and our international competitiveness will crumble, collapse and fall. We heard nothing of these things before the last election. When did we start to hear of these things? We started to hear of these things when the government woke up on a Sunday morning in October last year and realised that it had all power under the sun. It realised that it control of the House and control of the Senate and that it could do what it liked, and it would. Where did it return, when it appreciated, realised and understood on a Sunday morning in October that it could do what it liked? It returned to John Howard's long standing, ideological and political views about industrial relations and workplace relations-the sorts of views that he had adhered to and articulated in the sixties, seventies eighties but had dropped off in the nineties and in 2000 when he came to appreciate that these views were not acceptable to the Australian community. When did we start to hear about these extreme measures? When did we start to hear about these unfair measures? When did we start to hear about these divisive measures? When the government realised it had all power under the sun. What have we seen? On 26 May in this place, the Prime Minister gave a ministerial statement. On 9 October the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations released an advance explanatory memorandum of 60 pages. We have had five months and $55 million worth of Liberal Party advertising, at the taxpayers' expense, to get to yesterday and today. What did we find out about that advertising campaign? A very important illustration was made about that advertising campaign. A number of people who were involved in the production of the as themselves said that they had been misled as to what the purpose of the as was. A young hairdresser from Melbourne and a couple of employees from Sydney who worked in a workshop said, ‘We were told that these nice, friendly adverts were about workplace safety.' If you cannot trust the government to be truthful even to the people involved in the production of the advertisements, how can you trust the government to be truthful about had the content of the legislation? That is why the government wants to slide through 1,250 pages worth of bill and explanatory memorandum with minimum scrutiny. Introduce it yesterday, debate it today and slide through a Senate inquiry. Even when John Howard had Peter Reith and the alsatians and the balaclavas, you had a Senate committee that met for two to three months examining it line by line. Even with Peter Reith, alsatians and and balaclavas, John Howard gave what he described as a rock solid, ironclad guarantee that no individual Australian employee would be worse off. In respect of these measures, he said, ‘No Prime Minister can give that guarantee.' The problem for John Howard is that he gave it himself. The reason he will not give that guarantee-the guarantee that no individual Australian employee will be worse off as a result of these changes-is that the public policy objective of these changes is to make people worse off. That is the public policy objective. By reducing their wages and removing or reducing their entitlements, the public policy objective of these measures is to effect a further shift in the total income of the economy from the wages proportion to the profit proportion of the economy. John Howard will not and cannot give the guarantee that no individual Australian employee will be worse off, because the public policy objective is to make them worse off. We often hear from the Prime Minister: ‘In 1996, all these things were said, and it did not occur then. It's Chicken Little-it did not occur then.' But guess what happened in 1996? Because the government did not have control of the Senate, the Senate effected something in the order of 150 to 230 amendments, knocking off some of the worse excesses of that which the government presented. So the sky did not fall in, because the government was not in the position that it is in now-all power under the sun and unbridled political ideology. What do we find now? How does that attack on wages and entitlements occur? It occurs in a very un-Australian way. A lot of us have been poring over this bill page by page-and there will be a lot more detail that will come out in due course-and, as you turn over each page, redolent in each page is just how un-Australian these measures are. Why are they un-Australian? Because they make people vulnerable and they prey on their vulnerability. They make it easier for employees to be forced onto employment conditions which are inferior. They make it easy for employees to be dismissed without any remedy. The bill preys in an un-Australian way, in an unfair way, on vulnerability. Where we will end up as a consequence of these changes, if they are allowed to be implemented and effected, is with an American-style working poor. People at the lower end of the scale, on wages reduced in real terms and with entitlements and conditions stripped away, will rely, as the working poor in America do, on the tipping bowl mentality to try to make ends meet. That is where we will end up. How is the attack effected on wages? The attack is effected on wages by the government's attack on the minimum wage. The government's objective is to reduce the minimum wage in real terms. If the government's submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission had been agreed to by the commission, the minimum wage since the government came to office would have been $50 a week or $2,600 a year less. The minimum wage would have been reduced by the government in real terms by 1.55 per centnot the 12 per cent increase in real terms that has been effected as a result of the commission's activity. The government wants to get through the back door what it has not been able to get through the front door. So what does it do? It removes the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, from the wage-fixing mechanisms. It establishes what it calls the Fair Pay Commission. I agree with Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald: if you are the ‘Socialist Republic of Mongolia' and you are required to call yourself the ‘Democratic Socialist Republic of Mongolia', it is because you are not democratic. If you are required to call yourself the Fair Pay Commission, it is because you will not end up with fair pay; you will end up with unfair pay and low pay-and the proof of that is in the pudding. Yesterday in question time the Prime Minister denied that fairness had been removed from the requirements of consideration of the calculation of the minimum wage. And what do we find? We find the current Workplace Relations Act 1996 explicitly has at section 88B(2), ‘(a) the need to provide fair minimum standards ...'. In the government's legislation, on page 29 of the bill in section 7J, ‘AFPC's wage-setting parameters', there is no reference to fairness. So just as the government did when they shredded some of their advertising materials because their market research said, ‘You'd better put the word “fair” in because the community respond well to “fair”,' they have labelled the wage-fixing mechanisms fair but have taken fairness out of the criteria. That is another classic John Howard mean and tricky approach where you pretend something is fair, you label something fair and what you do is pull fairness out of the criteria. Just as the bill is called Work Choices, this bill provides no choice-no choice for employees, only choice for employers. Where do we find that? We find that in the second bundle of the attack upon living standards, entitlements and conditions. The government in their adverts say, ‘These are all protected by law'-and what do we know? We know that the wage is attacked through the change to the minimum wage calculation entitlements, and conditions are attacked through the removal of the no disadvantage test and through the capacity of people to be forced onto individual contracts unfairly. Where do we find that? We find that in section 170WG of the current act which says: (1) A person must not apply duress to an employer or employee in connection with an AWA or ancillary document. The bill as introduced repeats the same provision but states: To avoid doubt, an employer does not apply duress to an employee for the purposes of subsection (5) merely because the employer requires employee to make an AWA with the employer as a condition of employment. It is not duress if you require an employee to go onto an AWA which is not protected by the no disadvantage test. Penalty rates, overtime, leave loadings: all those conditions are removed without adequate, any or just compensation. It is not duress to force an employee-a new employee or an existing employee-onto an AWA as a condition of employment. What does the word ‘duress' mean? The normal and natural meaning of duress is: coerce, compel, force, pressure, threaten, browbeat, bully, intimidate, demand. The government sits there and pretends that (a) there is no change other than to current arrangements and (b) nothing bad is going to happen. This is a monstrous, unfair, further shift in the balance of the bargaining powers between employers and employees. How do we see the attack upon living standards? We see the attack upon living standards through the attack on a real wage increase in the minimum wage and an attack upon the removal of conditions and entitlements, forcing people unfairly onto AWAs or individual contracts without the protection of the no disadvantage test. That was a protection inserted by the Senate the last time there was substantial reform along these lines in 1996. That duress-the coercing, compelling, forcing, pressuring, threatening, bullying, browbeating, intimidating and demandingcomes even before you get to the government's unfair dismissal proposals, under which you can be unfairly dismissed with no remedy if you are in a company which has 100 or fewer employees. Four million Australian employees-98 per cent of Australian workplaces and 99 per cent of private emthe ployers-come into that category. And that is before you get to the change that the government proposes to make in terms of operational reasons irrespective of the size of the company. The new provision is at subsection 170CE(5D) and reads: ... operational reasons are reasons of an economic, technological, structural or similar nature relating to the employer's undertaking, establishment, service or business, or to a part of the employer's undertaking, establishment, service or business. That is so wide that any decision by an employer to terminate an employment for so called operational reasons will be justified by any ground. This is effectively giving Peter Costello what he wanted, which was to abolish unfair dismissals for all employees. And no compelling economic or other reason has been made out for these views. There is a lot more that I could add, and that my colleagues will add, but I thought it appropriate that we give the House the opportunity, by way of a second reading amendment, to list in some logical order the A to Z of the reasons the House should reject this bill. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House declines to give the bill a second reading, because the House condemns the Government: (a) for failing to allow the House of Representatives and the Australian people proper scrutiny of the bill prior to the debate in the House; (b) for spending over $55 million dollars of taxpayers' money advertising Liberal Party policy proposals before the Work Choices legislation has entered the Parliament; (c) for misleading the Australian people in those advertisements by making unsubstantiated assertions about the benefits of these changes and misrepresenting the extent to which employees will lose their rights under the Work Choices legislation; (d) for creating an industrial relations system that is extreme, unfair and divisive; (e) for failing to put working families first in developing its plans to dramatically change Australia's industrial relations laws; (f) specifically, for failing to commission and publish a Family Impact Statement as promised during the election for all family related legislation; (g) for failing to provide a guarantee that no individual Australian employee will be worse off under the extreme industrial relations changes; (h) for attacking the living standards of Australian employees and their families by removing the ‘no disadvantage test' from collective and individual agreements; (i) by allowing employees to be forced onto unfair Australian Workplace Agreements as a condition of employment; (j) for abolishing annual wage increases made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for workers under Awards with the objective of reducing the Minimum Wage in real terms, and by removing the requirement that fairness be taken into account in the calculation of the Minimum Wage; (k) for delaying the next National Wage Case by a period of six months, so that at least 1.7 million workers under Awards will not receive a wage increase for a period of 18 months or longer; (l) for undermining family life by proposing to give employers the power to change employees' work hours without reasonable notice; (m) for destroying rights achieved through the hard work of generations of Australian workers; (n) for undermining the principles of fairness that underpinned the Australian industrial relations system for the past hundred years; (o) for gutting the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and eliminating the role of an independent umpire to ensure fair wages and conditions and resolve disputes; (p) for developing proposals that will deliberately distort the workplace bargaining relationship in favour of employers and against employees; (q) for denying Australian employees the capacity to bargain collectively with their employer for decent wages and conditions; (r) for denying individuals the right to reject individual contracts which cut pay and conditions and undermine collective bargaining and union representation; (s) for allowing individual contracts to undermine the rights of Australian workers under collective agreements and Awards, for instance by eliminating penalty rates, shift loadings, overtime and holiday pay and other Award conditions; (t) for removing from almost 4 million employees any protection from unfair dismissal; (u) for refusing to consult with State Governments in developing a unitary industrial relations system resulting in an inadequate and incomplete national system; (v) for launching an unprovoked attack on responsible trade unions and asserting that those unions have no role in the economic and social future of Australia; (w) for proposing to jail union fine them up to $33,000 if they negotiate to include health and safety, training and other clauses in agreements; (x) for ignoring the concerns of the Australian community and Churches of the adverse impact these changes will have on Australian employees and their families; (y) for failing to guarantee that wages will be sustained or increased in real terms under these changes; and (z) for seeking to justify these measures by asserting that slashing wages will somehow make Australia more competitive, more productive, and increase employment”. This is the A to Z of why the House should reject these revolutionary reforms. The government's measures are not evolutionary; they are revolutionary. The government seeks to justify these unfair, divisive and extreme proposals by saying they are necessary for our economy-as if somehow the slashing of wages at the lower end will magically increase employment, as if somehow by slashing wages we can compete with India, Indonesia and China on their wage rates. We can only compete by investing in the skills, education and training of our work force, by being a smart and great trading nation and by investing in infrastructure, innovation, research and development. These are the things that will continue to sustain our prosperity, not an unfair attack in an un-Australian way that will see slabs of our community end up with the tipping-bowl mentality of the American working poor, who live in a world where they cannot make ends meet and where there is no family and work balance in a dog-eat-dog society. Such a world is un-Australian, unethical and immoral and runs counter to the characteristics, values and virtues that have held our nation well for more than 100 years. These extreme measures are contemptible and should be representatives or rejected.",33
7,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Griffin-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,38
8,Mr HENRY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Hasluck) (10.24 am)What a charade. What a deceitful, shameful charade we see from the opposition on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. I am sorry that the member for Brand has just left the chamber, because it was interesting to note in some of the earlier remarks by the member for Perth that he mentioned ‘trust'. Who can you trust? Let us look at the background and some of the circumstances that prevailed when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training between 1991 and 1993. The member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, had a record then of one million unemployed, 329,000 long-term unemployed and teenage unemployment of 34.5 per cent. The member for Perth mentioned Labor putting families first. That sort of level of unemployment is how Labor put families first. That sort of uneconomic outcome is just unacceptable today. Yet, they talk about trust. They talk about lies and deception-that is all on the other side. How did the member for Brand as minister for jobs and skills go? At page 371 in the biography Beazley by Peter Fitzsimmons in 1991, the member for Brand says: ... I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining ... I thought that there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than just about any I have had. When he was employment minister, he gave up on the unemployed; he abandoned them. This is what he said about youth unemployment in an interview on 6 May 1993. The interviewer asked: So this groupthe unemployedare being told, in their twenties, by society, effectively: You're the losers; go to the scrap heap.",38
9,Mr BEAZLEY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS," Well, those who haven't made it into work and who are among the long-term unemployed, that's a reasonable statement. He gave up. On The 7.30 Report on 6 May 1993, in answer to a question about the 329,000 long-term unemployed, he said: Where it is now is unacceptable; where it's going to is even more unacceptable. Consider the Leader of the Opposition's record in relation to skills when he was minister for jobs and skills. He has been going on about how the government has not performed in this area when his performance as minister in this area was absolutely appalling. Between 1991 and 1993, the number of people in apprenticeships in traditional trades fell from 151,000 to 122,600-a decline of 23 per cent. It was only in 2004 that this level returned to the level it was just before Mr Beazley became minister for jobs and skills. So I again ask: who can you trust? You can trust the Howard government. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 is a pivotal piece of legislation. In my view, and the view of my colleagues, the future prosperity and economic success of this great nation of ours and the people in it depend upon the passing of this legislation. I remind the House of what has been achieved by the Howard government's economic reform measures since coming to power in 1996. The government's record is remarkable, representing as it does an increase in real wages for Australian workers of 14.9 per cent, the creation of around 1.7 million new jobs and an unemployment level that is near a 30-year low. Contrast that with the record under Mr Beazley as minister for employment and training. Australia today ranks 53rd in terms of world population but it is the world's 13th largest economy. In terms of income per head, Australia ranks eighth in the world and, in the not too distant future, this government will be debt free-a fact that is even more remarkable when you consider the $96 billion debt that the previous Labor government left as part of its legacy of economic mismanagement. Part of that legacy also included high inflation and even higher unemployment, which I demonstrated earlier. This government recognises that Australia's economy has not made such strides forward and its people have not enjoyed such prosperity by the government of the day standing still or adopting a do-nothing attitude to such an important issue as workplace relations reform. Unless the economy is provided with the impetus and the framework for growth, we will be failing the Australian people. This bill will deliver a substantially improved workplace relations system for Australia by providing an alternative to the overcomplicated structure that exists within the country today, with its more than 130 pieces of separate legislation, 4,000-plus different awards and six distinct workplace relations systems. Labor talks about the need to preserve these areas, but I can tell you that business out there, and employees and employers, are confused by the complexity of these systems. We need to change to a much simpler and more understandable system. Work Choices will deliver even higher real wages, create even more jobs and continue the downward pressure on unemployment. It will contribute significantly to the future success of our economy and it will mean that Australia will remain one of the world's most successful and vibrant economies. This belief is shared by the OECD, which has described Australia as a model for other countries, and the International Monetary Fund, which holds to the Howard government's view that Work Choices provides real opportunities for job creation. Before considering the detail of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005, it is appropriate to first say a few words about the campaign of fear and lies on the government's workplace reform agenda that has been waged for several months by the unions and the Labor Party at the state and federal levels. The campaign took advantage of a period while the detail of Work Choices was being prepared. It was based on outright lies, innuendo, erroneous assumptions and the twisting of facts for self-serving ends. Ultimately, it was a politically motivated campaign with one purpose: to improve Labor's rating in the polls. The ACTU admitted as much when its secretary, Greg Combet, announced at the launch of the campaign: ‘We need a change of government.' Why does the ACTU need a change of government? It seems there are 47 million reasons, because over the last 10 years unions have invested $47 million in the Labor Party and they want a return on their investment. The ACTU wants a government, not an opposition, that it can control and that will adopt policies it can dictate. The member for Perth mentioned employer control, but he continues to ignore the union control of the opposition. In 1996 the current Leader of the Opposition predicted the Workplace Relations Act would turn Australia into a low-wage, lowproductivity industrial wasteland. He was dreadfully wrong then and he is wrong now, as is everyone on the opposition benches and their union mates. The Leader of the Opposition needs a lesson in history; perhaps he also needs to learn a little from his more cessful predecessors, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, who embraced the liberal democratic reform process and introduced enterprise bargaining and individual contracts. Ms Macklin-That's a bit rich!",39
10,Mr HENRY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Workers are a lot richer under the Howard government than they ever were under the Labor government, that is for sure. At least they are getting jobs now. Here is a quote that appeared in the Australian on 1 November 2005 which was attributed to Bob Hawke when he was President of the ACTU in 1971: The least likely way of maintaining harmonious relations in industry is going to be a system where some external parties impose their will on the two parties most affected. That was Bob Hawke. Work Choices actually delivers on that ethos and should be embraced, not opposed, by the Labor Party. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 represents a major step forward in achieving a simpler, more effective and nationally based system for workplace relations. It will simplify the workplace agreement process and enshrine for the first time a statutory set of minimum conditions within federal legislation. The bill provides for the establishment of the Australian Fair Pay Commission, which will set minimum wages and award classification wages as well as rates for juniors, trainees, employees with disabilities and casual workers. Significantly, the Fair Pay Commission will be independent of government and its primary responsibility will be to promote the economic prosperity of the people of Australia. That requirement has significant implications because it means that the Fair Pay Commission will have to look at the capacity of the unemployed and low paid to obtain and remain in employment, as well as factors suc- impacting on employment and competitiveness across the economy and the need to provide for a safety net for the low paid. I welcome that responsibility being placed on the shoulders of the Fair Pay Commission. It introduces equity for those seeking entry to the job market for the first time and for those on low wages, as the Fair Pay Commission will be considering their needs alongside those of the rest of the work force. The setting of overly high minimum wages without reference or link to the impact on the job market and the ability of the economy to generate new employment opportunities is wrong. I hold the view that, ultimately, the best form of welfare is a job, and the requirement placed on the Fair Pay Commission will help ensure that those seeking to escape the welfare trap will have a chance to do so. Much has been said in the media about the impact of this legislation on minimum wages and award rates. As part of their deceitful campaign, Labor would have us believe that wages will fall and that workers will be worse off as a result of the new workplace relations regime. I believe the opposite to be true. The idea that employers are waiting in the wings for this bill to pass through parliament, eager to seize an opportunity to erode the working conditions and entitlements of their workers, is absolutely wrong. I know that employers will pay the prevailing market rate for a job to be done. If they paid less than the market rate, who would want to work for them? Labor needs to face up to the fact that the myth it is promulgating that businesses are lining up to seize any opportunity to strip away worker benefits is a lie. As we have already seen from the impact of previous workplace relations reform legislation, the opposite is true, as employers and their workers together reap the benefits of a growth economy. Much was made in the union sponsored misinformation campaign about workers losing their right to lunch breaks, having their annual leave entitlements cut or losing out on public holidays. The undeniable fact is that under this bill these rights are protected within the bargaining process. However, they can be traded off for other benefits if workers so wish, and many workers I know welcome this. I have seen it happen time and time again to the advantage of both the employer and the employee. As the name implies, Work Choices is about choice. It is about flexibility and the ability of employees to negotiate with their employers to put into place working arrangements that suit them and fit into their lifestyle. This means that, under this bill, workers will have the right and the ability, if they so desire, to cash out some of their annual leave entitlement or arrange an earlier finishing time in exchange for a shorter lunch break; but these trade-offs cannot be forced on them. It is not the case that there is no choice under this bill, as claimed by the unions and Labor. There is real choice, as opposed to the situation under Labor, in which employees would have no choice and no work unless they had a union ticket. ‘No ticket, no start' is the claim of unions, supported by their Labor mates. Without a union card, workers would be denied the right to a job. No wonder we had so much unemployment under the previous Labor government-workers chose not to join a union. And they continue to choose not to join a union-all we have to do is look at the huge decline in union membership across this country. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 does not cover a number of conditions, such as superannuation, notice of termination, jury service and long service leave. This is not because, as a desperate Labor Party wants the general public to believe, such conditions are being abolished but plainly and simply because they are already covered and provided for in other legislation. Work Choices is about simplifying workplace relations systems; it is not about complicating and duplicating existing measures. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 does not abolish the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It defines and focuses the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's role to a specific set of responsibilities that are better suited to its capabilities. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will retain responsibility, with the consent of the parties involved, for dispute resolution under workplace agreements. It will have the power to deal with unlawful industrial action, including industrial action in support of pattern bargaining. It will regulate the right of entry to workplaces by unions and will be responsible for the unfair dismissal system as well as the conciliation of unlawful dismissal claims. A key part of this bill is that it provides for businesses employing up to 100 staff to be exempt from unfair dismissal claims. This is a most welcome provision which, in my electorate of Hasluck, in Western Australia, has been hailed by small business owners as a major step forward in providing the right conditions for them to grow their businesses, to provide more employment opportunities and to move away from casual staff by taking on those same casual staff as permanent employees, which is a great benefit to those employees. The current unfair dismissal law, which was introduced by a Labor government in 1993, saw a massive switch from permanent employment to casual employment in small to medium sized businesses. It turned off potential employers from taking on more permanent staff. Work Choices will change that and, with that change, will come some very real benefits to those who are currently casual staff, such as being able to qualify for mortgages once they are taken on as a permanent member of an employer's team. There is no doubt that the 1993 unfair dismissal laws deterred small business operators from growing their businesses. They were, and are, fearful that they could potentially become subject to unfair dismissal claims, at a cost to their businesses, and they could ill afford the risk. There is significant evidence to demonstrate that just that situation has occurred. Since being elected as the member for Hasluck, in 2004, small and medium sized businesses within my electorate have had a simple and crystal-clear message for me to bring back to Canberra: push on with workplace relations reform, provide the right conditions for us to grow our businesses and lift the yoke of the current unfair dismissal arrangements. Work Choices delivers on that, and I applaud its introduction on behalf of all businesses and their workers in Hasluck and Australia. Importantly, under Work Choices, protection against unlawful dismissal will remain for all employees regardless of whether their employer is a small, medium or large business. It will remain unlawful for any business to dismiss an employee on the basis of marital status, family responsibility, pregnancy, colour, race, creed, age, sex, physical or mental disability, union membership and a host of other fundamental freedoms that characterise Australia's commitment to a fair go for all. Unlike Labor, the government is happy for employees to belong to a union or not to belong to a union. Employees will have that choice and that right. In that regard, I welcome today's announcement by the government of $28.3 million over the next four years to fund an unlawful termination assistance scheme, which will support workers whose employment has been unlawfully terminated. Under the scheme, parties making an unlawful termination claim will be eligible to apply to the government for up to $4,000 worth of independent legal advice. One of the other important aspects of the bill is the transitional arrangements. In my experience in workplaces over the years, there has been huge confusion and concern when businesses buying out other businesses are wrongly impacted by the industrial arrangements prevailing prior to the business being purchased. The complexities of that arrangement will be addressed in this bill in these transitional arrangements. Work Choices provides that industrial instruments will transmit to a new business owner only where employees transfer to that owner and will apply only to those who have transferred. The bill also provides that these trans2005 ferred collective agreements and awards will apply for a period of only 12 months. After that period, the employers existing award system will apply to all employees. The opposition has made much about the government not having raised a number of the reforms provided for in the Work Choices bill. However, they overlook the fact that Work Choices contains most of the government's reform proposals that have been stalled by the Senate since 1966. Since that time, there have been 13 separate Senate inquiries into the coalition government's workplace relations proposals, eight of which have considered reforms to the unfair dismissal system. So we have been very upfront about our intentions and there has been a huge amount of debate and transparency. Australia's future prosperity and the prosperity of its people depend on the ability of this House-(Time expired)",40
11,Ms MACKLIN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Jagajaga) (10.44 am)Today we are considering 1,252 pages of the most draconian, the most unfair, the most extreme and, yes, un-Australian piece of legislation ever to come into this parliament. It is ideology fashioned by the Prime Minister, John Howard, who for more than a quarter of a century has dedicated himself to dismantling the rights of Australians to decent working conditions, to a decent standard of living and to be treated decently at work. We are seeing the leader of the Australian national government forcing this nation down the road of an American style industrial relations system, with tearing cuts to the fundamental fabric of the independent society we have built over the last hundred years. His monster will, without a shadow of doubt, attack and lay waste to crucial aspects of the Australian way of life. What appals me most about the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill is the deliberate imposition of this radical industrial ideology on families, on the disadvantaged in our society, on the low-paid and on the young and powerless. It also represents a fundamental assault on the rights of Australians to exercise their hard won democratic right to be represented collectively-an assault this Prime Minster has been plotting and planning for a quarter of a century. No government in Australia should deny workers the right to be represented by their union, deny their rights to have someone to speak up on their behalf and on behalf of other people in their workplace. But this bill threatens to impose fines of tens of thousands of dollars on workers and their unions for even asking for basic rights. They face fines merely for seeking appeal rights for workers who believe they have been unfairly sacked or for asking for mandatory union involvement in resolving workplace disputes. What sort of government fines workers for asking for help? There is no doubt that this bill attacks the very heart of ordinary men and women's rights to get a helping hand from their union and, in doing so, takes Australia further and further down the American employment road, where the tip jar provides more support than their government. Like most of this government's policies, John Howard's industrial relations agenda will do the most harm to the lowest paid and least secure working Australians. That means it will fall most heavily on Australian women. Women's industrial rights are fundamental to our equal citizenship. Labor believes that governments cannot stand by while women earn less than men toiling in casual and often low-paid jobs. Political rights for women must always go hand in hand with industrial rights. Correspondingly, industrial rights are fundamental to dignity in work for all Australians. But this government is dismantling in one fell swoop women's hopes for equality in the workplace and in society. Like men, women work to earn a living. Often, unfortunately in Australia today, that living is still not very good. Women are disproportionately represented among minimum wage workers, women are disproportionately represented in the casual work force and women still do the ‘double shift', doing most of the housework and most of the child care, even when they are in full-time paid employment. Australian women are bearing the brunt of the insecurity and uncertainty in today's economy. This family-unfriendly bill will destroy what little job security many women have. This government is taking an axe to the minimum wage. In is an outrage that in Australia today women earn less compared to men. When this government took office back in 1996, men on average earned around $230 a week more than women. Now the gap is over $308 a week and women's total wages are just 66 per cent of male total earnings. But of course, with this legislation, it will worse. The minimum wage protects 1.6 million of Australia's low-paid workers-60 per cent of these are women. The Howard government is about to appoint a hand-picked ‘unfair pay commission', as we call it, to set that minimum wage. It is hand-picked by the government that has opposed every single increase in the minimum wage since 1996. The government's massive expansion of Australian workplace agreements will also hurt women the most. The wage gap will become a chasm. Currently women receive around 90 per cent of the hourly pay of men on collective agreements, but under Australian workplace agreements women only earn 80 per cent of the hourly pay of men. Casuals and part-timers earn 15 per cent and 25 per cent less respectively on Australian workplace agreements than they do on collective agreements. That is happening now. What is more, only seven per cent of private sector individual contracts contain work and family measures. This bill will well and truly tip the work and family balance scales against women. Very few Australian workplace agreements help women balance work and family commitments through measures like flexible starting and finishing times for ordinary hours of work, family and carers leave, paid maternity leave and home based work. Individual workplace agreements are already very bad news for women, but they will get much worse under the government's plan to replace the 20 allowable matters in the current employment standard to just five minimum standards. These five standards will only include a minimum rate of pay-now under threat, we know-annual leave, eight days of personal leave, parental leave and maximum ordinary working hours. That is all that we will see in the minimum standards. The basic working conditions that men and women rely on to get assist their ongoing work and family juggling act are all under threat. The Industrial Relations Commission recently ruled that 1.6 million Australian parents should have the right to request two years of unpaid parental leave when their child is born and the right request part-time work until their child reaches school age. This ruling will last about as long as the government takes to ram this legislation through this parliament. Men and women will be powerless to reject an Australian workplace agreement that their employer tries to force on them. This bill's definition of ‘oppressive behaviour' does not include the all too imaginable situation where an employer says to an employee, ‘You either sign the unfair individual contract or you don't get the job,' or ‘you don't keep your job.' Yes there is choice for employers, but no choice for employees. With these extreme laws that the government has introduced into parliament, John Howard, this Prime Minister, will push many Australian families not only over the financial edge but over the edge of holding together their family life. John Howard's unfair dismissal provisions also mean that Australian women could be sacked even if they cannot get to work because their child is sick. The government says that people who are fired because they have family obligations will be able to sue for unfair dismissal, but how many working families can finance a drawn-out legal battle? And how many employers would be silly enough to announce that a sacking is due to marital status, pregnancy, family obligations or even gender when they are not required to give a reason? Under the government's legislation employers are not required to give a reason at all. If the government had set out to develop a blueprint to take Australian women backwards, they could not have done a better job than the legislation we have before us. Government policy should be about opportunity and respect for Australian families and about preserving human dignity. This bill is none of those things. It is mean, unfair, indecent and cruel. It will hurt working people, and to the women of Australia will bear the brunt of it. Members on this side of the House, Labor members of parliament, are well aware of the severity of the skills crisis confronting Australia. We know that businesses around the country have realised that the single biggest constraint to future growth is not industrial relations laws but a lack of properly trained staff. Every day we hear more and more stories about the skills crisis jeopardising industry projects. I have spoken on so many occasions about the Howard government's shameful and inadequate record when it comes to training Australians, especially young Australians. Under these extreme industrial relations changes, things are only going to get worse. This country will not solve the current skills crisis by making apprenticeships less attractive to young Australians, by stripping away award conditions and by forcing apprentices onto a ‘take it or leave it' workplace agreement. But that is exactly what this legislation has in mind. As I travel around the country talking to young apprentices on building sites, in workshops and at TAFE colleges, the one issue they bring up time and again is their poor wages and conditions. So why on earth would you force extreme industrial relations changes that will drive down wages when what we need to do is encourage young people to get an apprenticeship, to increase their skills? We have an enormous problem in this country, with apprentices dropping out and not completing their apprenticeships. Forty per cent of Australian apprentices do not complete their apprenticeship, and low wages is a major contributing factor. Apprentices are an investment in our future. Without them our country cannot grow. What this government should be doing is improving their wages, not putting in legislation that will see their wages cut. Under this legislation we now know that wages for apprentices will be set by the new ‘Unfair Pay Commission'. Apprentices will see this move for what it is: yet another attempt to strip their wages. It is a proposal from a Prime Minister who has form on this issue. Back in 1992, John Howard said, ‘Dramatically lower minimum wages for young people,' and proposed that the youth minimum wage be reduced from $8.50 to $3.00 an hour. A recent survey of young workers in South Australia has shown that young workers already feel dirt-cheap and disposable-that is how they described it. That is how they feel already: dirt-cheap and disposable. Many new apprentices are earning as little as $5.95 an hour. Only a government that is totally out of touch would think that an apprentice can make ends meet by earning such a pittance. This legislation puts at risk apprentices' pay and conditions, and will force Australia down the low-skills, low-wage road. Stripping back awards and the minimum protections that they offer is a major assault on Australia's future skills development; the other, of course, is forcing apprentices onto Australian workplace agreements. The Prime Minister is quick to say that everyone will be paid more under Australian workplace agreements-after all, John Howard says, ‘It's a “workers' market” like never before.' Let's have a look at what is happening in Western Australia, where the unemployment rate is 4.1 per cent-and if the Prime Minister is to be believed, a ‘workers' market', if anywhere is. Australian workplace agreements currently being offered to first-year apprentices in Perth in Western Australia are paying as little as $6.90 an hour, all up, 40-hour week, including sick pay, penalty rates, and other allowances. So these individual agreements are already in place in Western Australia. In a buoyant labour market and in a state with record low unemployment and record skill shortages, an apprentice chef can be paid just $6.90 an hour, including all those penalty rates, so just imagine what awaits future apprentices where there is not such an apparent workers' market. Also, young apprentices are especially vulnerable when it comes to bargaining with the boss. For many it will be their first experience of full-time employment. We, especially those of us who are parents, can all picture the complete power imbalance young people feel when talking to their boss, talking to their employer, about problems at work, let alone their core pay and conditions. Imagine how difficult it will be for young apprentices, going it alone, to negotiate intricate workplace agreements-but they are offered no protection in this bill. In the Howard government's brave new world of Work Choices, the only real choice many young apprentices will have is low pay or no work. Recently I spoke to some young carpentry apprentices at a TAFE up in northern New South Wales. Frankly, they were incredulous that they were going to have to negotiate their wages and conditions with the boss. As one young man said to me, ‘But he'll just cut my pay, and we're already paid a pittance.' The apprentices know what their bargaining position is. They know how tough it is going to be. Labor wants to encourage young people into apprenticeships. Stripping away protections and paying them poorly is no incentive, and we will see the skills crisis worsening and the future prospects of young Australians massively harmed. Labor wants a highly for a skilled work force underpinned by more apprentices earning decent pay. What we stand for is apprenticeships as an investment in our future and not as a source of cheap laboureverything this government and this legislation do not stand for. This is draconian legislation, and there is no other word for it. It is a very ugly symmetry of everything this Prime Minister stands for: inequality, unfairness and a fundamental lack of respect for hard working Australians. These hard working Australians are the people who truly build this nation, doing the long hours and taking the overtime so their families can get ahead, often with both parents working and regretting the sacrifices they have to make as to time with their families. These are the true Australians already putting in the hard yards, struggling to pay their mortgages, to pay these rising petrol prices that the government takes absolutely no responsibility for and to pay the costs of child care. What parents are trying to do is build a better future for their children and the Australian community. This industrial relations legislation is mean, it is cruel, it is indecent, it attacks the rights of working Australians, it is small minded and it exploits people's vulnerability. For the sake of fairness and decency in the working lives of all Australians, Labor will reject this bill and all that it represents.",43
12,Mr JOHNSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I am pleased to be the Howard government's third speaker on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. This bill is well overdue, and the reforms that it will bring into the Australian economy and the workplace are well overdue. As the Prime Minister has indicated, this is a big bill, but it is also a very fair bill. This in the national economic interest of this country and, because of that, I support very strongly its passage in the Australian parliament. That having been said, I want to say thankyou to those in the Ryan electorate who have taken the time to write to me, phone me or email me to express their reservations and their thoughts. I do appreciate that some have had concerns, and I want to take this opportunity in the parliament to thank those constituents who have come to me to express their thoughts. It is my job as their local representative to hear their views and to feed them back into the parliament and the government. But, given my own very strong support for this piece of legislation, I want to try to explain to the people of Ryan what this bill is all about and why I fully support its passage in the House of Representatives. This is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that the 41st Parliament will pass in its three-year parliamentary term. In fact, this bill will probably rank as one of the most significant bills that the parliament has passed in recent years or is likely to pass in the decade ahead. At its heart, this bill is all about making the Australian industrial relations system simpler and fairer and about protecting minimum conditions. At its heart, this bill is also about increasing the productivity of this country and securing the economic prosperity of our people for the next generation. The current industrial relations system has grown increasingly cumbersome and unwieldy for we Australians to simply sit back and rest on our laurels. This bill will create a modern workplace architecture that is well overdue. In doing so, it will replace an outdated industrial regime that had its birth in the early 1900s-that is right, early in the 20th century. This bill seeks to replace a system that had its birth in 1904, over a century ago. That was a time when the horse and buggy prevailed, a time when the horse bill is and buggy was mainstream thinking. We have moved beyond that. There is no doubt that this bill will change the landscape of the Australian workplace. But that is its very intention. Its precise intention is to update and modernise our national workplace structure. Its intention is to make the national industrial relations structure relevant to contemporary Australia by embracing a single workplace system, a structure that will create a national regime. The current system has encumbered us with six different workplace regimes across Australia with over 130 separate pieces of industrial relations legislation and over 4,000 awards. (Quorum formed) In the parliament today I want to say very clearly, particularly to the constituents of Ryan, the moments we have just experienced reflect very strongly why the Labor Party continue to be in opposition, why they have lost four elections on the trot and why they will continue to sit in opposition-because they have no policies and no ideas. They will continue to sit in opposition. They do not even give members of this parliament on this side of the chamber an opportunity to speak to the bill.  a point of order. Either members should be at their places or they should leave the chamber; they cannot stand.",47
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,I thank the member for Chifley. Would those members who are leaving the House do so in an orderly manner or resume their place in the parliament.,48
14,Mr JOHNSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"If the opposition leader, the opposition front-bench, the members opposite and the Chief Opposition Whip focused more on coming up with ideas and policies instead of pedantry they might actually get the attention of the Australian people. I am pleased to continue speaking on this bill. As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted by the Chief Opposition Whip, this country today has over 130 separate pieces of industrial relations legislation and over 4,000 awards. In a country of our size, this is surely absurd; for an economy of our structure, this is surely highly inefficient. This bill seeks to legislate for a uniform system that will cover the majority of Australian workers-up to 85 per cent. There has been a lot of misinformation and misrepresentation from the union movement and, of course, to be expected, from the Labor opposition about the conditions that will exist following the passage of this bill. The reality is very different. This legislation will introduce choice for employers, for employees and for job seekers. More than ever before, Australians want choice in their employment arrangements. Australians want and deserve flexibility-flexibility to spend time with their families, to work more overtime, to go on holidays or to earn extra money. More people are working part time, on contract or in other arrangements that suit them and their employers. For the benefit of the people of Ryan, whom I have the great privilege to represent, for Ryan businesspeople, let me spell out clearly the position in relation to the minimum conditions that will be protected and will endure as a result of this bill. First and foremost, there will be a single minimum wage. There will be protected minimum standards and conditions. Annual leave, personal leave and parental leave will be protected. This safety net will be enshrined in legislation. Let us have none of this nonsense that the ALP peddles about the government's bill and its intention to destroy minimum conditions. Let us have none of this nonsense from the unions about employers sacking workers because they have sick children and they need to stay at home. It is an absolutely disgraceful public scare campaign that does nothing for the reputation of the union movement in this country. No wonder the union membership rate is 17 per cent; less than one in five workers in this country belong to unions. Mr Hardgrave-Most of them are forced to join.",48
15,Mr JOHNSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Indeed, Minister, you are correct. No doubt many of those are compelled to join the unions just to simply make up the numbers. This legislation will also set up the Fair Pay Commission. This is going to be an independent wage-setting body. Its inaugural chairman is Professor Ian Harper, who has already been savaged by union thugs and heavyweights. One such is Bill Ludwig from Queensland, who indeed is a constituent of mine, a Ryan resident. I encourage Bill Ludwig to be a bit more courteous in his treatment of distinguished Australians. The Fair Pay Commission will have the responsibility of setting and adjusting the minimum and award classification wages for juniors, trainees, apprentices and employees with disabilities. Minimum and award classification wages will be protected at the level set after the increase from the 2005 safety net review by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Contrary to much of the malicious misrepresentation in the public arena, the Industrial Relations Commission will remain; it will not be abolished. The AIRC will certainly have a different role under the new regime. Its altered role will reflect the original purpose for which it was established, namely, as a dispute resolution body. The AIRC will also have the important role of simplifying and rationalising awards as well as regulating industrial action, right of entry, unfair dismissal and registered organisations. Let us ask the question: where do small businesses in this country, certainly the busibe nesses in the Ryan electorate, stand? Australian small businesses have stood up to be counted on this bill and strongly support these changes. There are 1.2 million small businesses in Australia employing 3.3 million workers-a third of the Australian work force. In the overwhelming number of cases, small business employers and their employees have great working relationships as they both strive towards common goals, namely, business profitability and job satisfaction. Employers and employees today know that they depend on each other and have mutual responsibilities and shared needs. Small businesses and big businesses in my electorate of Ryan are certainly very supportive of the legislation. Imagine what it must be like if you are a businessperson trying to grapple with the maze of awards, award systems and state regulations that abound in the field of industrial relations. Imagine if your business operates across more than one state or some of your employees are covered by federal awards and others are not. What sort of nightmare must surely ensue from having to be familiar with countless regulations, complying with them fully and still having to meet all the needs of your business on top of that. A central feature of this legislation is the provision for further use of workplace agreements. With this legislation, there will be greater scope and flexibility for agreements to be negotiated directly between employers and employees. Over half of all small businesses have already implemented AWAs and the majority have been happy with the improvements in workplace productivity and flexibility. On average, employees on AWAs get 13 per cent more than those employed under collective agreements. No wonder there is satisfaction with AWAs. The unions and the federal Labor Party seem to locked into this ideological mind-set that, no matter what, the needs of employers and employees are diametrically opposed. According to the ALP, employers will always want to drain every last drop of blood out of employees. This is dinosaur thinking. This is the thinking of the modern Australian Labor Party, but it actually reflects prehistoric thinking. It is outdated and just shows how out of touch the opposition is with the modern marketplace and the modern business world. Everyone has moved on except the unions and the federal Labor Party. Everybody-all the relevant stakeholders-has moved on except the federal Labor Party. It is no wonder that the Australian people at successive elections have voiced their position very clearly and have confined the Labor Party to opposition, because that is where they deserve to be. The union view today does not reflect the reality of the Australian work force today. More Australians than ever before are operating small businesses and small businesses are becoming major employers. Some of the most significant provisions in the bill for small business are the unfair dismissal provisions. I know these provisions are welcomed by those in small business. I have certainly had many of my constituents in Ryan contact me to explain the terrible experiences they have had in not being able to dismiss staff who totally deserved the sack. The provisions in this bill allow employers with up to and including 100 employees to be exempt from unfair dismissal claims. The qualifying period before which employees can make unfair dismissal claims will be extended from three to six months. Everyone in business knows that the Keating Labor government's unfair dismissal provisions unleashed a terrible burden on Australian businesses of all sizes and varieties. The fair dismissal laws currently on the statute books are not serving their purpose at all. A small number of unscrupulous employees who are dismissed for obvious issues such as stealing or lying about their qualifications experience have brought the whole system into disrepute, tying up businesses in court proceedings and unleashing massive expenditure on those small businesses. The Ryan small business community support this bill very strongly, because they know that these changes have the capacity to transform our economy and the business environment for greater efficiency and prosperity. They also know that these reforms will set up greater job security for their staff like few other reforms will. Disinformation and misrepresentation by the Labor Party and the unions continue without limit, but this has not stopped small business owners from giving their perspective, and it is a very accurate one indeed. Today the Australian economy ranks as one of the most successful in the developed world, thanks in no small measure to the policies and leadership of the Howard government. But of course this has not always been the case, and I want to remind the people of Ryan, and especially those who made it clear to me that they did not support these reforms, of how the economy looked under the previous Labor administration: record high unemployment, massive government debt, record high home and business interest rates and, of course, ‘the recession we had to have'. The people of Australia and the people of the Ryan electorate will remember the phrase ‘the recession we had to have' under a Labor Prime Minister. As for the economy under the Howard government, what a contrast: unemployment at three-decade lows of five per cent and un- over 1.7 million jobs created. Labor's massive government debt of $96 billion as of today has been almost repaid. Interest rates remain at five and six per cent. Interest rates are one-third of those under Labor. Today, or everyday Australians can actually invest in and own their own home. Real wages growth is in excess of 14 per cent. The Australian budget is in cash surplus. The Australian economy continues to perform very strongly and robustly, in no small measure due to the leadership of the Howard government. Today, we can even enjoy tax cuts that were only a dream under Labor. Remember those days when there was just a faint hope of l-aw law tax cuts? I am sure all Australians remember that; indeed, the people of Ryan remember that. How can it be that the workers of Australia have fled from Labor? How is this possible for a political party that purports to represent the working class of this country, the workers of Australia? They have deserted Labor. They vote for coalition members because they know that the federal Labor Party offers no hope, no policies and no ideas and remains in policy fatigue, in a policy deep freeze. It is disappointing that I have only a few minutes left. Unfortunately, the Chief Opposition Whip has deprived me of my democratic right in this chamber to speak for my full allocated 20 minutes. I am highly flattered that he thought I was giving such a terrific presentation that he called for more members of the parliament to come in here. It is a shame that he is taking the step of depriving me, the member the Ryan, of my right to represent the constituents who elected me. But no doubt there will be opportunities in the adjournment debate for me to continue this very important presentation. I wanted to quote two former Labor prime ministers about their support for the ideas in this bill. Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, two Labor Prime Ministers, no doubt deep down believed that opening up the economy through deregulation was critical to this country's future prosperity. Unfortunately, time is running out for me. I strongly support this bill because it secures our productivity for the future. This legislation before us is critical, it is vital, secure Australia's future economic prosperity and it transforms our industrial relations system for the better. This nation is currently enjoying prosperity that would have been unimaginable in the early nineties under a Labor government. If Australia does not act, this generation of leaders will stand accused of doing nothing to protect our nation against the greater competition and the greater efficiencies of other economies which will be looking to steal a march on us. This legislation presents this country with the opportunity to take our economy to the next level, to improve our productivity, to attract more investment and to guarantee a more secure job environment well into the decades ahead. This is generational reform that takes great courage to implement. This is generational reform that takes a great government to produce. This is generational reform that is in the national interest. Indeed, this is generational reform that only a coalition government could introduce into this country in the national interest. Of course I commend the bill wholeheartedly, but I implore those opposite-the federal leader of the Labor Party and his colleagues sitting on the other side of the chamber-to be more in tune with what this country needs. They ignore the reality that there is an inescapable link between prosperity and production. This is what it is all about. Productivity is vital for securing the prosperity of this country. Until those opposite come out of their deep policy freeze, until they decide to engage in reform that is in the interests of this country, they will be confined to opposition. The people of Australia fully appreciate that this government is engaging in vital and essential reform that will take this country into the decade ahead. Until that happens, I am delighted to say that this government, the members on this side of the to chamber, will continue to enjoy the confidence of the Australian people. I say to the people of Ryan: it is a great pleasure and privilege to represent you and I will continue to dedicate my efforts and my talents in this parliament to representing your concerns. It is a great honour to have spoken on this bill. We on this side of the parliament will be voting for this legislation in the national interest. (Time expired)",48
16,Mr RIPOLL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Today I rise to speak on the government's misleadingly named Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. It is anything but that, and it is completely removed from truth. As its title suggests, the bill proposes amendments to Australia's industrial relations laws which will, by the government's own admission, effect the greatest changes to Australia's industrial relations framework for more than a century. Mr Johnson-You're not a shadow minister, get back to your spot! What are you doing at the table?",52
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,The member for Ryan has completed his speech.,52
18,Mr RIPOLL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Today I want to outline why Labor is opposed to these changes by highlighting the very simple fact that these legislative measures have absolutely nothing to do with offering working Australian families real choices in the workplace, and least of all to do with providing a platform for future growth and expansion of the Australian economy. Today's debate also provides an opportunity for me to spell out to the House and to the people of my electorate my commitment, and that of my party, to ensuring that working Australians have good and fair employment conditions. This is one of Labor's foundation principles, and a principle which the party has held central to its existence during its long and illustrious history as a political force in this nation. It is one built on the community. Labor has, in the words of one of its finest parliamentarians and one of our nation's great prime ministers, Ben Chifley, been a movement committed to ‘bringing something better to the people'-‘better standards of living' and a ‘greater happiness to the mass of the people'. This bill does none of these things. In fact it is contrary to these exulted ideals and will fundamentally affect our Australian way of life. It will affect it for the worse. Greatest of all, it will not do it immediately but it will be a slow burn that affects people for the rest of their lives. At this point I would usually look at the bill in detail and offer my support to the measures being proposed or explain my reasons for opposing any of the changes to Australia's laws that this government might be seeking to implement. But here I have got the 1,252 pages that were dumped on the table yesterday-giving the opposition no time to examine these complex and difficult changes. They are the most radical changes in 100 years and we were given no time to examine them. We had barely 24 hours to digest this complex 1,252-page bill. The government had an army of lawyers-11 law firms-on top of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the government's own lawyers, working on this complex legislation that it calls simple. If it is so simple, why is it so long and why did it take 11 law firms to get it right? The government has introduced a bill which will implement laws that will have a profound impact on Australia and our way of life. But instead of offering those here, who have been elected to represent their constituents, the chance to debate this legislation in a considered, proper and democratic way, the government has chosen to ride roughshod over Australia's parliamentary process. This is a contemptuous display of arrogance by an out of touch, out of date and out of control decade-old government that is more interested in pursuing tired and outdated ideological measures that have no relationship to a modern Australia, and that certainly have no relevance to advancing the industrial relations system in this country. And the government has the audacity to speak about choice-or even use the word ‘choice'-in relation to this despicable bill! Nevertheless, the best way I can comment on the content of this bill is to draw on what the government has been saying over and over, in a numbing performance of government advertising. It is over-the-top, outrageous Liberal Party propaganda which has been masquerading as government advertising. In pursuing this ideological attack on rights and conditions of Australian workers and families, the government has embarked on one of the most outrageous, costly and wasteful advertising campaigns in modern history. This government has an impressive track record, though, of wasting taxpayers' money on shameless party-political advertising. For instance, who could ever forget the so-called ‘Strengthening Medicare' debacle? The federal government wasted more than $20 million of taxpayers' money promoting their scam safety net. This money would have been enough to cover every bulk-bill consultation in my electorate of Oxley and half of those in the neighbouring electorate of Blair for a whole year. But, before the ink was even dry on the election writs, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing broke a key election promise by raising the cost at which the so-called safety net cuts in. They broke this so-called ironclad, rock solid guarantee. It was an ironclad, rock solid, never-to-be-broken guarantee. The government literally sprayed $20 million worth of taxpayers' hard-earned money up on the wall. But wait, there is more. As always with this government, the devil is in the detail. Last financial year alone the government spent $137.7 million on advertising. Since coming to office in 1996, the Howard government has wasted more than $1 billion on campaign advertising, much of it political propaganda that should have been paid for by the Liberal Party. The government has admitted it has already spent more than $55 million in just over a month on mindnumbing as that people cannot bear to look at anymore and that tell you absolutely nothing about what is contained in these 1,252 pages of disgraceful so-called reforms. The Senate estimates this week have shown that the the government will spend more in the coming months. We were not far off when we said that it will probably spend close to $100 million. Advertising legislative changes when there has not been legislation passed in the parliament, and when there is not even a bill in the public domain for debate, is not the action of a responsible government. It is all hubris. It is arrogance, and it is just not on. The reality is that the Australian people expect better and deserve better-they deserve better than what the government are giving them. This is a complete and utter waste, and the public knows it and is sick of it. If anything, these as have actually backfired on the government. The government think they are really clever. They are treating people as though they are stupid. These mind-numbing as that they have put on television, on radio and in print media over and over again are straight out of the Goebbels propaganda handbook. If the government think that that is all it takes to convince ordinary Australians and working families that the government are not deceiving them on these issues, they are wrong. The government may have actually twigged that people are not that stupid, that they have some idea of what the government are about. I do not think anyone out there in the community is fooled. All these changes-everything that is contained in the two volumes-are not about giving anybody a pay rise or making anything fairer or simpler. It is simple: it is all about cutting wages; it is all about taking conditions off people. The government will talk about all sorts of rubbish in this place and attack Labor on a whole heap of fronts and they will talk about the so-called economy-they will talk about all these things-but where is the structural reform in our tax system? Where is the reform in infrastructure? Where are the building blocks to deliver the next 15 years of economic growth and prosperity in this country? The building blocks were not delivered by the government; they were put in place during the eighties and nineties under successive Labor governments. We put in the building blocks and we will have to do it again when this mob here wreck the economy. They are doing everything except dealing with the future-the next 20 years of economic growth. Just last week the federal member for Fisher, Peter Slipper, let it slip-the slipper let it slip-when he said that the multimillion-dollar as were a dud. Just like the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and just like this government on this issue, they were a complete dud. This is what Mr Slipper had to say: I don't think the as are as effective as the ernment would like them to be. In other words, people are not buying the absolute rubbish being walloped out to them. They do not buy it. He went on to say, ‘I hope that we are going to change the as'not stop them, not give people real information, but just change the as. Maybe there will be a different colour and a couple of different words, but that is it. The as are going to keep coming-but do you think they will fool people? Mr Hardgrave-Ha, ha!",52
19,Mr RIPOLL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The minister at the table laughs. You can laugh all you want. Government members can snicker. They are not laughing at me, they are not laughing at usthey are laughing at ordinary Australian families. They are laughing at the workers of this country-the people who are the backbone of this country. Mr Hardgrave- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I claim to be misrepresented. I simply say to the member for Oxley that I am happy to encourage him in his speech, but I will not be misrepresented in that way.",54
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Mr Quick)Order! There is no point of order.,54
21,Mr RIPOLL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"This is what government does when it does not like hearing the truth. Do not worry about what I have to say, Minister-worry about what Australians have to say. I can tell you that the phone calls are coming thick and fast. Maybe they are not coming to your office and maybe you do not even know they are coming, but let me tell you that people are just starting to wake up to what you are on about. A commentary by Glenn Milne published in the Australian this week summed up the whole sorry saga. Milne argued that the as have rewritten political history at an excessive cost and are clearly ineffective. You cannot keep telling Govrubbish and lies to the Australian people, because they will figure out what you are doing. The government's agenda should be about improving the nation's health care system. That is what they should be doing. In just two days, the government's spending spree on advertising could have paid for the annual wages of 80 registered nurses and 92,000 bulk-billed GP consultations. It could have covered the cost of employing 1,700 nurses in a hospital for a year. Investing in the next generation of skilled workers would have been a better spend, instead of wasting this huge amount of money. When I talk to employers in industry, the first thing they ask me is: ‘How do we get more skilled workers?' They do not ask: ‘How do we lower wages?' They want to work with their work force; they actually want to work with people. They want to look at the building blocks. What is government doing for industry? What is government doing for infrastructure? Nothing. All we get from this government is ideologically driven rubbish. Skilled workers is the answer for the next 15 years of growth. That is how you spur on the economy-not by introducing rubbish legislation that will lower wages and knock unions on the head. That is all this government is about. John Howard gave up the ghost when he said the industrial relations plan is ‘an article of faith'. It has nothing to do with common sense, nothing to do with the economy, nothing to do with any rational examination of what this country needs. He just said that it is an ‘article of faith'. It is ideologically driven. It is his ing legacy, his last hoorah as a Prime Minister who wants to be remembered for having introduced the most extreme, radical industrial relations changes in this country for over 100 years. What about investing in our children, our education and those sorts of things? Our neighbours are investing in education. While we are decreasing funding to universities and university places, our neighbours are increasing funding. The OECD average is going up; ours is going down. They are creating more university places because they understand where future growth lies. It is not in producing 1,252 pages of absolute garbage to attack ordinary families; it is about improving our creaking and crumbling infrastructure. Where is the roads infrastructure to have better delivery of freight? Where are the railheads that we need? Where are the efficiencies in our ports? Those matters are not being dealt with. The government are not even interested in delivering efficiency in our ports. They do not even talk about it. It is not on their agenda. On their agenda is a simple little phrase by the Prime Minister giving away what this is all about-‘an article of faith'. It is pure ideology-the worse thing in politics you can possibly ever have. Where is the taxation reform? Where are the things that the government need to do? People, business, employers, employees-everybody is screaming out for the real taxation reform that they need. Those are the things which will deliver the growth that we all need. Even the Business Council of Australia would have chosen a whole range of things instead of these as. They have put out their own as, and while I may not agree with everything that the BCA might say, they are certainly right on the need for a whole heap of reforms. But the government are simply not up to the task. We see these as being shot with people who do not even know what lastthe as are about. They have to pay the boss six grand. He does not know what they are about, either. They do not even tell the workers because, if they told them, the workers would say, ‘Go to buggery, we're not going to let you film us doing this sort of stuff.'",54
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Order!,55
23,Mr RIPOLL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"We have had a range of incredible things. This legislation will simply destroy the working conditions for ordinary Australian families. John Howard and this government want to take away the rights that underpin family life in this country. We hold those things sacred. It is about our lifestyle. We already are the hardest working nation in the world. A lot of people may not know this statistic: we actually beat the Japanese last year-we worked more hours than the Japanese. We are the hardest working people in the world. What does this government want to do? Make us work harder? It is not about working harder; it is about working smarter. Isn't that the call? It is about working smarter. You do not deliver growth by lowering wages and trying to compete with India or China. We will never beat them on wages, but we will beat them on ingenuity, innovation and technology. All the growth in First World nations and all the things that deliver prosperity to us were never built on driving down wages; they were built on innovation, on using our brains and on working smarter, not harder. Squeezing people, hurting people, does not deliver better outcomes for this country or for anybody else. We oppose what this government are trying to do. They have taken ‘protected by law' as the mantra, the spin-protected by absolutely nothing! We have already got laws that protect these things. In fact there are 20 lowable matters currently protected under the law. The government are saying, ‘We're going to protect five.' Gee, that is an increase! The government are responsible for slashing the tax act from 3,500 pages to 9,500 pages! It stands this tall. That is the complexity the red tape introduced by this government. They are going to reduce people's sick leave entitlements, have annual leave, make you work harder and give you fewer holidays. People already do not take enough holidays. People should be encouraged to actually spend some time with their families. You do not develop a strong economy and a strong Australia by breaking up families. Divorce and family breakdown costs this country billions of dollars. We need to be out there encouraging better workplaces, better innovation, better technology. These are the things that Australia needs and demands. People deserve this; the country deserves this. And we are getting nothing. Taking away people's unfair dismissal laws is absolute rubbish. The government talks about protecting people's unlawful dismissal. Be careful about the words this government uses: there is a big difference between ‘unfair' and ‘unlawful'. Unlawful is already protected-that is why it is called ‘unlawful'-but this government will carry on with a whole heap of rubbish. The last thing that this bill is about, as with most bills this government introduces, is the short title. Just look at the short title on the front: Work Choices. It is not about work choices; it is about less choice. I did as best I could to go through this mass of information and see what is in there. There are jail penalties for people revealing what is in an individual workplace contract. Jail? You are going to send somebody to jail for six months for doing that? What sort of a country are we living in? There are $33,000 fines for people. Even if you are a represenal- tative of workers and you ask for, say, an unfair dismissal law to be included in a contract, you can be put into jail. It is a jailable offence to ask for it-not to put it in but to simply ask for it. Incredible stuff. If it were an Orwellian fiction, you would get a good and laugh out of it, but then you realise this is actually going to be Australian law. It is certainly not a laughing matter. I cannot find anyone laughing. The only people I see laughing are this mob opposite. This mob keep laughing, but they forget they are not laughing at us here. We are the representatives of people in our electorates. Every time you laugh, every time you snicker, every time you ridicule-like you did with shearers-you are laughing at good strong Aussie workers who have built this country: shearers, truck drivers and ordinary people out there earning a decent living, earning minimum wages. When you laugh at us, you are laughing at them. When you belittle us in this House, you are belittling them, and they do not appreciate it. Shearers do not appreciate being laughed at at all. The simple question we have to ask of this government and the Prime Minister-and we have asked it many times-is: will you give a guarantee that no-one will be worse off under these radical, extreme industrial relations laws? The Prime Minister is not prepared to do it, because he cannot-he knows he is taking away the no disadvantage test. Not only is he getting rid of the fair umpire, its arbitration and conciliation, but he ing to get rid of the no disadvantage test so that you can be disadvantaged. Why else would you get rid of a no disadvantage test? So you can be disadvantaged. He will not give a guarantee to the Australian people that they will not be disadvantaged. This government is taking us down a very dangerous road-a low-wages, low-economic path of trying to compete with our neighbours and the rest of the world on wages. We will never compete on wages. We will never be able to compete with China on wages. We know where we can compete: we will only ever compete using our brains, using innovation and using technology. What we are enjoying today is a historically significant period of economic expansion. We have had low inflation, productivity growth, low unemployment-well before this government came to office just over nine years ago. They did not build that 15 years of economic growth. They did not build it; they had no hand in that. All they have done is use up the goodwill and the good economic measures that we introduced-the very painful, very hard reforms that we put in placefor the future, for the next 20 years, when we were in government. That is the work of a government-you have to make the hard decisions. This is not a tough decision about trying to produce good productivity and economic growth. Take a look at Queensland. If you were an employer in Queensland, why would you trade the lowest unemployment rates, the lowest inflation rates, the lowest tax and the best industrial relations system in this country for the federal system, which is worse by half? Why would you do that as an employer? There are more disputes under the federal system than under the state system. We in Queensland have actually enjoyed a decade of one of the lowest dispute levels in this country because we have put in place is gosomething called enterprise bargainingenterprise agreements, collective agreements-simple quality backed by awards and backed by minimum standards. That is what the government should be doing instead of trying to- (Time expired)",55
24,Mrs MARKUS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Greenway) (11.43 am)I rise today in support of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. Before I talk specifically about my electorate and how this legislation is going to benefit Greenway, I would really like to focus on some of the comments made by the members opposite. Let me remind the members opposite that the Howard government's guarantee is its record; I would like to bring to the House's attention and remind the House of the opposition's record. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, talked about his skills during his speech. The member for Jagajaga spoke at length about apprentices. The member for Brand was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training from 1991 to 1993the minister for jobs and skills. When he was minister for jobs and skills, his record in relation to apprenticeships was-and let me remind the House that I was a social worker working in the community at this point, and I saw first-hand these impacts on familieshaving youth unemployment reach a postwar record of 34.9 per cent. Between 1991 and 1993, the number of people in apprenticeships in traditional trades fell from 151,000 to 122,600-a decline of 23 per cent. Let me remind the House that in Greenway apprentice numbers have grown by over 100 per cent since this government has been in. It was only in 2004 that it returned to the level it had been at just before the opposition leader became minister for jobs and skills. When the current Leader of the Opposition was minister for skills-in an age when there were several hundred thousand long term unemployed and youth unemployment was at 34.5 per cent-he was unable to get young people to take up opportunities to be better skilled. In fact, the number of apprentices fell by 23 per cent. The opposition leader and the member for Jagajaga also stood by, silent, when the labour movement was trying to limit apprenticeships and training opportunities. Last year, after several years of proceedings, the Industrial Relations Commission finally varied the building industry award to allow for school based apprenticeships. This application to vary the award had been supported by the government and opposed, tooth and nail, by the CFMEU. Where was the Labor Party? Where was the Leader of the Opposition? Where was the member for Jagajaga? Why didn't they support this application to provide more opportunities to young Australians to become skilled? They supported provisions in awards which limited the number of apprentices because unions were in favour of them. Provisions in awards which place limits on apprenticeships are just one of the absurdities of the old workplace relations system. Provisions such as this illustrate a system that more interested in protecting those in work than in creating job opportunities for those out of the work force. This government is committed to doing both. Let me address the members opposite who talk about family breakdown. Having worked to ensure that families remain together, I saw at first hand the impact of Labor's policies on families during the late eighties and early nineties. The loss of jobs, high interest rates and many other impacts led to family breakdowns and families losing absolutely everything. Let me remind the House and the people in the electorate of Greenway of these facts. As Australians, we have come to value a great many privileges which many around the world do not experience. I will focus now on the positives: where we are going, what this government have already done and the direction that we are taking to build a better future for this nation and for our young people and our families. We are given opportunities to pursue an existence that provides access to quality health care, an excellent standard of education and the right to speak freely. We are also afforded the right to choose what we do with our working lives. That is what the changes in this legislation are fundamentally predicated upon-the right of Australian workers to choose and their right to negotiate working arrangements that suit them, their families and their employers. Those on the opposite benches would have you believe that that is not the case. Instead, they have run a scare campaign to try and convince Australian families that a change in legislation will lead to the destruction of Australian society as we know it. Let me remind members opposite that they have asked: ‘What is your guarantee?' Again, look at the Howard government's record. The opwas position and the unions are using the same tactics that they used in 1996 when the government passed industrial relations reform. And the next day communities, families and businesses carried on without collapsing. In fact, people's conditions and lifestyles have improved. Businesses, job creation, growth and real wages have flourished. Far from being draconian, these reforms offer a real opportunity for Australian workers to tailor working conditions to individual and family needs. This will allow women to negotiate with their employers about having shorter hours-maybe leaving earlier or starting earlier and working around the needs of their child carers and their children. It enable people on shiftwork, when both parents are working long and different hours, to negotiate with their employers and work one on one. Nothing ever moves forward by standing still. Our industrial relations system is overly complex and burdensome. With more than 4,000 awards, the system is confusing and cumbersome. We cannot expect that Australia can move forward and remain competitive so long as we are weighed down by this system. Let us face it: we live, work and relate in a very global economy. Australia has been the envy of many economies for several years. This is a government that has earned its stripes by consistently producing strong economic growth for Australian families. Our interest rates are low, our unemployment rate is low and people are earning more than they ever have before. Let me remind the House that in the electorate of Greenway the unemployment rate is now well below five per cent, and I anticipate that with some of the developments that are happening out there that will drop further. And that is because over the past 9½ years the Howard government recognised that providing a platform for people to achieve and to be prosperous involved making adjustments to the economic system to stay competitive and to ensure that conditions for Australians improve. Of course, the irony of the situation is as much as the Labor Party and the union movement cry foul over these reforms, it was their own Prime Minister that set the wheel in motion. Mr Keating recognised a need to make the workplace more flexible and productive. He was the Prime Minister who, in 1993, described his ideal model of workplace relations. He said: It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framewill work of minimum standards ... Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards with fewer clauses. He said: We need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards ... to being full substitutes for awards. Labor goes wrong by focusing only on collective agreements. It does not allow for individuals. It does not allow for unique situations and environments. Mr Hardgrave-It doesn't trust people.",57
25,Mrs MARKUS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"That is right; it does not trust people. I remind the House that we have a very intelligent electorate, and I am sure they will see through the fear campaign of the union movement and the Labor Party. The opposition has not wanted to acknowledge those statements by the former Prime Minister Paul Keating because the reform he spoke of was very similar in nature to the legislation that is before the chamber now. The Industrial Relations Act 1993 introduced reforms that had two streams of agreement making. The second stream was the groundbreaking measure-enterprise flexibility. This allowed employers to override the award system by reaching an agreement with a group of employees without union involvement. But there were some limitations to that legislation. Unions retained the right to intervene in any agreement that came into their view. Unsurprisingly, this became a that broad and vague definition of which matters were of interest to unions. But what about the individual workers? Something very significant happened in 1996 with the change of government. What came with that change of government was a real commitment to sensible economic management, job creation and growth-giving Australians the opportunity to really prosper. The industrial relations reforms of 1996 were a natural extension of those that occurred in 1993. In brief, the changes included reducing the scope of third parties to intervene in agreement making and clarifying where the responsibility for this lay. The government also introduced the Australian workplace agreement. The introduction of the AWA has allowed employers and employees to have a direct relationship with each other, giving credit to both their ability to express what they need and to work in cooperation in a way that is mutually beneficial. Mr Hardgrave-Building trust.",59
26,Mrs MARKUS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Exactly! It is all about trust. The current reforms seek to enhance those relationships. There is no reason why dealings between those two parties should be adversarial. It is untrue to say that employers and employees are unable to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. The needs of employers and employees are not mutually exclusive, as those on the other side would try to have us believe. The additional flexibility in the workplace that was brought about by the 1996 reforms has been widely credited for underpinning the strength and, indeed, growth of the Australian work force. In its midyear survey on Australia, The Economist magazine underlined this factor and indeed argued that further reforms were in fact necessary to ensure that the Australian economy continued to provide the best conditions for job creation. Ultimately, it is critical that we create jobs in this country. There are still too many people who want to work but do not. There are still too many children in families where neither parent works. This legislation provides a framework where parents can negotiate flexible workplace arrangements to try and strike a balance between work and familyone of the great challenges of our time. It provides a basis upon which we can finally recognise that people have different needs in the workplace. A one-size-fits-all system simply does not allow the necessary flexibility we require in our contemporary situation. We also need to recognise that the most critical job creation and growth in our country will come from small and medium businesses. Many of these businesses are run by mums and dads who are seeking to achieve and provide opportunities for others. A young man who runs an electrical engineering company in Greenway has five apprentices. He is looking to expand his company nationwide but has held off because having to understand the complexities of six different systems is beyond a small company. But, with these workplace changes, he will be able to plan for job creation, expand his business experience and increase opportunities for apprentices. A flexible workplace system minimises the costs, risks and uncertainty involved in workplace negotiations. This means that, instead of job creation being frustrated, there is the opportunity and capacity for employers and employees to come to a suitable arrangement for both. Our country faces significant challenges, especially when we consider that our labour force for the next 20 years has been set. This government is not afraid of facing those challenges and making the tough decisions required to overcome them. The global community continues to move forward. Australia has established itself as a power that keeps pace with and, indeed, leads international trends. We cannot afford to allow Australian families to feel the pinch of being left behind. Additionally, we face external challenges that we cannot control-challenges such as rising oil prices and natural disasters. To believe that these events do not have an impact upon the Australia economy is naive. It is essential that we have a workplace system that can adapt to those challenges and provide the best possible situation for Australian families and workers so that they are not negatively affected. Our current system is far too complex and intricate to continue to be workable and provide the flexibility that I have discussed. Industrial relations in this country is like a eign language to most people, and it is no surprise that it is confusing and frustrating when we consider that employers and employees are grappling with 130 pieces of individual legislation and more than 4,000 awards-and small business is expected to grow! For most people it is completely inaccessible, written in complex, legal language that requires expensive interpretation-and, I suspect, some headache tablets. Simplifying and unifying the system means that the legislation will be far more accessible to people on both sides of employment. Instead of having documents hundreds of pages long, we will have the ability to provide employers and employees with sensible, fair and accessible agreements that do not require their own postcodes. This is about ensuring that we have sustainable growth in this country and that we continue to grow jobs. The Australian people have come to expect no less of their government and, frankly, nor should they. Members opposite have decided instead to engender a sense of fear amongst Australian people. Their scare campaign is untruthful and unfair. Rather than intelligently discuss reforms to the workplace and look at ways to ensure job creation is sustained, the opposition and union movement have opted to create a climate of fear. It is about time that the record was set straight. The government is not about dismantling unions. Unions can have a relevant and meaningful place in the workplace, and that is when the employee requests their presence and intervention. It should not be assumed that a third party can insert themselves into anyone's workplace negotiations unless requested. To disagree with that statement assumes that workers are incapable of deciding upon their own priorities or of making a decision for themselves. These reforms provide that third parties forcan act in negotiations when requested. That option is clearly available to all workers. The union movement, however, has decided that this is an attack on its very existence. Perhaps the union movement should instead be trying to find creative ways to make itself relevant to its members by providing highquality services rather than resorting to aggressive tactics. In my own electorate, union scare campaigns have been suggesting to workers that unions will be abolished, awards will be abolished and everyone will be forced to work in slave-like conditions. Nothing could be further from the truth. Awards will remain. No-one can be forced to enter into an Australian workplace agreement unless they consent. But awards should be subject to review to ensure that they meet the needs of our modern work force. Unfair dismissal laws will continue to protect people from termination on the grounds of race, religion, gender and family responsibilities. That is the way it should be: all workers must be protected from unlawful dismissal and this government is committed to that protection. Annual leave, parental leave, carer's leave, annual leave loading, public holidays, penalty rates, redundancy pay and the like will all remain in awards. Any changes to those conditions can only occur where the employee consents. The opposition has tried to renew a longended class division amongst Australians, but we left the ‘us versus them' mentality behind many years ago. Australian workers are intelligent enough to be able to speak for themselves or ask for assistance if they feel it is needed. The opposition has attempted to argue that vulnerable people will be left to fend for themselves and will be forced into archaic employment arrangements. That might have some validity if the government was not providing facilities such as the Office of Workplace Services to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards and protections in place for those who require assistance. The dirty tricks campaign has extended to Greenway as well. The unions have been circulating petitions to workers with my face printed on them without my consent. Workers Online have resorted to childish tactics gain attention for their cause. On 28 October they published a conversation that I had with a constituent-now clearly a union plantabout the reforms. As my responses did not give them ammunition to attack the policy, they resorted to trying to attack my credibility by suggesting that I had made disparaging remarks about my electorate. While I appreciate the publicity, I am extremely disappointed that the union movement have chosen to ignore debating the issues at hand and have resorted to this kind of base personal attack. I can only hope that in future they will actually engage in policy debate. It wonder that union membership is at its lowest when this is how unions choose to respond to the need for reform. I want to draw the House's attention to what happens when labour markets are overregulated. We do not need to look any further than Europe. In Germany the unemployment rate currently sits at 11.8 per cent; in France it is 10.2 per cent. Australians remember what it was like to have unemployment at those levels. The unemployment rate has halved-thanks to members on this side of the House, who recognise the need for flexibility in the workplace. Other countries with less rigid employment systems have had a similar experience: in Britain the unemployment rate is 4.7 per cent; in New Zealand(Time expired)",60
27,Mr SWAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Labor rejects the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 because over the years ahead it will erode wages and conditions, turn many lowand middle-income earners into battlers and create an army of working poor. That is not a future that I want for Australian families, nor a future that I want for my children or grandchildren. We reject this bill on economic grounds but we also reject it on behalf of all hard working to Australians in the government's sights, who deserve some fairness. They are not going to receive that with this bill. The Prime Minister and his cronies have made mainstream working Australians their political target, ripping away at the living standards and working conditions of our people. They want higher taxes and lower wages and all the financial pressure they bring. They want an Americanised, dog-eat-dog, survival of the fittest society-a course that Labor and the vast bulk of the Australian people reject absolutely. This government wants to undermine colis no lective bargaining and the important role unions play in protecting workers' rights and conditions. We have a Prime Minister with the gall, indeed the audacity and arrogance, to call himself the workers' friend. Friends do not drag you away from your kids at weekends and at night for no extra pay. Friends do not take away your hard-earned long service leave. And friends do not make it easier for you to be sacked. To all of those already busting their guts to feed, house, clothe and educate their kids, this government says, ‘Work harder and work longer.' I cannot believe how out of touch this Prime Minister has become. Thanks to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer many people who just a few years ago considered themselves middle-class are now struggling, working harder and harder just to keep their financial heads above water. No government has done more to turn Australians into battlers and no government has done less to help them than the Howard government. Labor believes our priorities should be to create national wealth and to spread opportunity. This country desperately needs a new economic agenda that lifts productivity by putting incentive into the tax system. We need investment in education and training, national leadership on infrastructure, good federal-state relations and cooperation, and a welfare system that works-one that puts initiative and resources towards research and development and commercialisation, and one that provides new competitive and regulatory models. To do all of this in a small country like ours we need to harness as many workers as possible, not marginalise them with these extreme ideological changes. John Howard and Peter Costello essentially want to create an army of working poor who pay record taxes and are forced to choose between worse conditions or the sack. This is simply unacceptable in this country, which once prided itself on the resilience of the Australian way-on reward for effort and a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. There are compelling economic reasons for Labor's opposition to this bill. It is a bill that represents lazy policy making and rampant blind ideology, not rational economics. It will do nothing to address the critical challenges we face. The government has not even attempted to put a credible economic case, because it lacks one. This bill is flawed because it will not lift productivity, jobs or wages. It will not lift work force participation. It will not address skill shortages. It not ease work-family tensions. The Prime Minister is right to remind Australians to judge him by his record. If this government had got its way, the lowest paid Australians would be $50 a week worse off, and he is now seeking to gut the independent arbiter that stood in his way. On Monday, in this place, the Deputy Prime Minister was a good enough to inform the House about Labor's position on proposed changes to workplace relations. He quoted from a speech I delivered last week to business leaders in Sydney, in which I said: Labor has an open mind to constructive proposals that will lift productivity. I stand by that statement 100 per cent. Unfortunately, as the Deputy Prime Minister well knows, he cited only half of my statement. In full, I said: Labor has an open mind to constructive proposals that will lift productivity but there is no evidence that the government's current narrow IR policy will do so. Let us be crystal clear: Labor is not opposed to changes in workplace relations; it is opposed to the government's proposed changes. Labor is opposed to the government's changes because they are the wrong changes. They are flawed on economic grounds, they will not lift productivity, they will not create jobs and they will not lift wages. This is all pain without productivity gain. The authors of the reforms do not appear to understand how the labour market works and how it is influenced by tax and welfare arrangements. It is not just Labor that is saying this; labour market experts are saying this, including experts who, in the past, have been favoured by the government. Professor Mark Wooden of the Melbourne Institute believes these are the wrong reforms and that they will not lift productivity, wages or jobs. This is the same Professor Wooden whom the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Employwill ment and Workplace Relations have cited as a labour market expert in the last two years. I challenge the deputy leader, or indeed any member of the government, to lay before the House an independent analysis that supports the government's claim that their reforms will lift productivity and create new and ter paid jobs. Let us examine the main changes and explain where they are wrong. First of all, let us look at penalty rates. There are 2.9 million Australian workers who work overtime. They stand to lose hundreds of dollars if their penalty rates disappear-as they can do under these plans. We are talking about a significant amount of money for average workers-$234 a month. This is a hit on the family budget which is comparable to a 1.6 per cent interest rate rise. For many Australians, penalty rates give them the means to pay off their mortgages and to withstand financial catastrophe. If these changes go ahead and people lose their penalty rates, it will have devastating consequences for home owners. To make things worse, the government's plans will hop into pensions as well. Around 3.5 million Australians rely on pensions, which are tied to average wages. To the extent that the government's industrial relations agenda lowers wages or reduces real increases in wages, it will also reduce pension increases that flow to millions of Australians. So it is not just Australian workers who are in the government's sights, but the poor, the elderly and the disabled as well. That brings me to the minimum wage, which is currently $12.75 an hour. Let us call a spade a spade: the government wants to slash the minimum wage. As Professor Wooden states, the objective of changing the arrangements for setting the minimum wage is to reduce the minimum wage, in real terms, in the mistaken belief that a lower minimum wage will create employment. The so-called conventional wisdom that increases in the minimum wage stop jobs being created has little or no empirical bases. On the contrary, research by Card and Krueger, in the United States, shows that moderate increases bet- in the minimum wage add slightly to aggregate employment. The IMF itself admits that ‘the theoretical and empirical literature is often inconclusive'. This is because lowincome workers tend to spend more, if not all, of any increase in their wage than do better-paid workers. This is borne out by the Australian experience. While the minimum wage has increased in line with safety net wage decisions, unemployment has fallen to 30-year lows. The increases in the minimum wage in Australia have been by no means excessive. Indeed, the minimum wage has fallen, relative to both median and average weekly earnings. Yet the government wants to cut it further. Rather than being priced out of the market, minimum wage earners have become more affordable, relative to other employees. Professor Wooden is dismissive of the simplistic argument that a decline in the minimum wage will reduce unemployment. He argues that it would result in the minimum wage converging, over time, with inflation linked welfare payments. This would further increase the already significant disincentives to move from welfare into a minimum wage job. How do the government respond to the problem that Wooden has identified? They respond by making it worse! They want to poke a hole in the welfare safety net and worsen the incentive to work for many people on benefits. They slash benefits for sole parents and new DSP recipients by up to $46 a week. That is what the government is doing as part of its ill-considered ideological crusade. Their objective is to cut those benefits. If the government were serious about moving people from welfare to work, they would reform tax and social security to lift incentives for those who want to work. They would fix the very high effective marginal tax rates in the system. This is precisely what Labor proposed in our welfare to work tax bonus in our tax package, in May, for lowincome earners. We proposed a bonus that would result in a 34 per cent reduction in marginal tax rates for those on the minimum wage with children. That is how we would address the participation problem that the government has created. We would do it with our work bonus. Let us look at the government's welfare reforms. They attack not only DSP recipients but also sole parents. Some time ago, back in 1999, the former workplace relations minister, Peter Reith, in his famous letter to the Prime Minister, proposed that: Discounting wages would also likely require complementary action on the social security entitlements … So now it comes to pass, six years later, that this government will implement these very proposals-cuts in benefits, with a minimum of $29 a week less for sole parents whose youngest child is over five and $46 a week less for people with disabilities. The combination of lower payments, less-generous free areas, sharper tapers and less-generous tax offsets result in significantly lower takehome incomes compared to the status quo. The losses are up to $119 a week for those with disabilities and up to $98 a week for sole parents. Steeper effective marginal tax rates mean that the returns from extra work are significantly lower. Effective marginal tax rates are up to 65 per cent higher under the proposed changes. For 15 hours of work, the effective take-home pay for sole parents will be just $3.40 per hour and for the disabled it will be just $2.40 per hour. So what the government is doing is taking down the minimum wage and, as they take down the minimum wage, they are poking bigger holes in the social security safety net. That is how they go about creating an army of working poor in this country. And they do not, through that process, address the problems with participation in the Australian work force. On top of that, they are increasing the tax burden, particularly on lower income earners in this community. The Howard government, far from lowering the tax burden on low-wage workers to boost their take-home pay, have actually ratcheted up the tax that they pay. In 1996 a worker on the minimum wage faced on average tax rate of 13.3 per cent, but today they face an average tax rate of 14.5 per cent. Under the Howard government there is no indication that this trend will be addressed, leaving the low-paid with the double whammy of lower wages and higher taxes. As I said before, this is a recipe for taking us down the low-wage road of the United States, where minimum wage work offers no protection from poverty. We cannot compete with China and India on wages. We must go down the high-skill, high-productivity, high value added road. This government's path to the low-wage road goes like this: you erode wages by getting rid of the no disadvantage test, you get rid of the unfair dismissal laws and then you criminalise unions so that workers are left without bargaining power, an umpire or a union to protect them. They are left on their own and they either accept the conditions or they get the sack. That is why the government has put in place its new unfair dismissal laws. Let us also look at the case that is put forward for abolishing unfair dismissal laws. The government's rhetoric is that letting employers sack people means they will hire more people. That is, they will create new jobs. Professor Wooden again disagrees. He argues that removing obstacles to sacking employees will not-I repeat: will notincrease total employment. It will simply increase labour market turnover. More people will be sacked and more people will be hired, but there will not be any increase in total employment. This is consistent with business surveys which report that few firms intend to create new jobs after the unfair dismissal laws are abolished. Peter Costello, who has made a career of picking on little old ladies working in lolly factories, wants all unfair dismissal laws abolished altogether-not just for firms of up to 100 employees but for all firms. Now, as we examine the detail of this legislation, we can see that the government is going to do it through the back door for those firms which have more than 100 employees. This brings us to the government's approach to individual contracts, because the abolition of the no disadvantage test is the mechanism by which the government allows individual contracts to fundamentally undermine the basic conditions that workers expect. The no disadvantage test has been the bedrock, if you like, of the protection ing standards and working conditions of Australian workers. The government argues that AWAs will enable employers to agree to new flexible working arrangements with employees and that that will boost productivity. AWAs, it argues, are not intended to pare back wages and conditions. If this is the case, why is the government abolishing the no disadvantage test? Why refuse to guarantee that no worker will be worse off? The government also argues AWAs will boost productivity, but here again the evidence is to the contrary. New Zealand underwent the most dramatic shift from collective bargaining to individual contracts with the passage of the Employment Contracts Act 1991. In the decade prior to the change New Zealand enjoyed similar rates of productivity growth to Australia. From the time the changes were introduced to the end of the decade, Australian labour productivity grew by 2.6 per cent per annum, compared to just one per cent per annum in New Zealand. In the years following the move to individual contracts, when Labor in Australia introduced enterprise based bargaining, New Zealand's productivity performance fell well In spite of this, behind ours. As we know, the Treasurer is keen to selectively quote the OECD. In 1993 the OECD was an enthusiastic supporter of New Zealand's reforms, but a decade later, under the heading ‘Have the economic reforms paid off?' the OECD said in its New Zealand economic survey: The reasons why past reforms have not yielded larger productivity gains are not fully understood. Some further increase may still be in the pipeline, but it would be unwise to assume that it will be large. In 2000 the IMF, another frequent source for the Treasurer, expressed similar doubts in its New Zealand staff country report, saying: An assessment of the effect of the ECAof livthe New Zealand Employment Contracts Acton productivity is particularly thorny and there is no agreement in the literature as to the success or failure of the ECA in this regard. So the conventional wisdom on which the government relies says that flexibility in the labour market goes hand in hand with higher productivity. That is the basis for its claim that the reforms will deliver more jobs and higher wages. But there is no evidence to back that up, as we can now see from looking at the OECD and the IMF. Just as business needs a level of certainty and stability to thrive, workers are more productive when they feel a measure of financial and job security and a measure of control over their lives. What this government's bill seeks to do is to introduce more insecurity, which will not have the productivity benefits the government is claiming. So the conventional wisdom that the government is citing is not backed up by the empirical evidence that is required for the ernment to make such claims, and that is why it cannot produce the evidence on jobs or on productivity to back its case in economic terms. In the assessment of an increasing number of eminent economists, this government's reforms simply do not stack up. The objective evidence is simply not there. It is not there from the IMF; it is not there the OECD; it is not there from people like Professor Wooden. It is simply not there. What we have from this government is nothing more than an ideological crusade, nothing based on sound economics, on sound business practice or on an assessment as to how we, as a small country located where we are, must lift our productivity to meet the challenges ahead. Labor have a much more balanced approach. We have a balanced approach with a new economic agenda which is much broader than that of this government and one that will produce the level of productivity, growth and wealth creation we require. It is one that invests in the skills of our people and in their education, one that looks seriously at innovation, one that looks at putting incentive in the tax system and one that looks at getting rid of the buck-passing between federal and state governments-a balanced economic agenda that invests in the future of this country. So the government should reconsider these so-called reforms. They are not based on logic and they are not based on evidence, and they will not deliver higher productivity, more jobs or higher wages. There are also moral reasons why the government's destructive workplace agenda is wrong and unfair, and just as importantly there are hard-headed economic reasons why Labor opposes the reforms. Labor, not the government, has the track record of making sensible changes to workplace relations in order to lift productivity. Labor engineered the shift to enterprise gov- bargaining in the 1990s, which underpinned rising productivity throughout the 1990s. But, as we know, there is no evidence that this government's current proposed narrow changes will deliver the productivity gains or the prosperity that workers deserve. This bill is all pain for hard working Australians and no economic gain. That is why Labor stands from with the vast majority of Australians, who are right to reject these extreme changes and this extreme bill. We want an economic agenda designed to lift our productivity, our economic horizons and our fairness and a fair go in this society.",62
28,Mr CADMAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Mitchell) (12.23 pm)Australians are doing increasingly more with their minds and using technology more than they have ever done before, and at the same time they are increasingly voting less for the Australian Labor Party and are leaving the union movement. There must be a reason for this process. What is happening is that Australians are thinking for themselves. They do not need the union movement to think for them. They do want to take charge of their own affairs and they do want to look after their own families. They do not want Big Brother telling them what is best for them in the workplace through some paid official who has often never done a day's work and who is likely to finish up in the federal parliament as a member of the ALP never having worked at a real job in their life. So Australians using their initiative and their minds makes me wonder where the Australian Labor Party in this House have been for the last 10 years. They appear to have observed nothing-no changes in the workplace and no changes in Australia. They appear to have analysed nothing. They appear to have derived nothing from either analysis or observation. They are arguing nothing. They are going right back as if there has been a hiatus for 10 years and a continuation of the Keating government, for a change of the Keating government's policies are the arguments I am hearing today. There is no vision and there is no opportunity. They have developed nothing in the whole 10 years. I think it is a great shame that the tralian Labor Party have consistently said, ‘We think that the opportunity that exists in Australia is an opportunity to continue to hand over the rights of Australian workers to the union movement.' There has been a change and a realignment in the relationship between unions and the members of political parties in this process, and I think that will continue. Ten years ago we were used to the conciliation and arbitration process-ambit claims, then arbitration and an outcome that was resolved by court process. The bigger the claim, the higher the compromise was likely to be. There was nothing heard about individuals or individual businesses in that process, and it is no wonder there is a declining number of people saying they want to be represented in this process. They want to withdraw from it and establish their own processes, their own lives and their own futures. This could be the last hurrah for the union movement or the greatest opportunity it has ever had. These changes will really test the imagination and commitment of the union movement to the people it claims to represent. There has never been a better opportunity for looking after workers than there is at the moment. These changes will provide opportunities for intelligent representation and encouragement in the workplace. What the union movement needs to do is accept the challenge of change and become relevant in this process, not irrelevant. It needs to accept the fact that it has to break with the outdated and backward-looking ALP or wait for perhaps another 10 years for the ALP to come to office. That break must occur for representation of workers in Australia. As is the case elsewhere in the world, union movement representatives must be able to stand free and firm, as do the employer representatives, and say: ‘We want the best deal. We are looking to our political representatives for the best Ausdeal.' That is the process we are undergoing now and that is the challenge for the union movement. The union movement needs to accept the excitement of what it can do for the future workers of Australia. The people the ALP claim to represent are probably the people that the Labor Party in government punished the most. You have only to look at the results of the changes that have occurred in Australia to realise that, since 1996, 1.7 million new jobs have been created and unemployment is at its lowest for almost 30 years. This is the record; this is where we are building. These parties, were they to win government, would never stay in government if they were to deliver all the things the Australian Labor Party proclaims they will deliver. If we look back over the past 10 years we will see the best record of employment and opportunities for families to pay their mortgages. No wonder the housing industry has gone gangbusters-people have certainty to commit themselves to mortgages and to their future. No wonder the birth rate is starting to rise, a sure indication that people feel secure that they can manage their affairs and know their commitments can be fulfilled, that their children in the home can be managed, loved and nurtured. We have had real wages growth of 14.9 per cent over the 10-year period of this government, compared with 1.2 per cent during the 13 years of Labor. That is why people are confident. That is where the Australian Labor Party need to reassess where they are up to. We have had the lowest level of industrial disputes since records were ever kept. Does that not say that these parties really understand what the work force wants, what their aspirations are and the way in which they think Australia should develop? It is not the backward-looking stuff that we hear about in here, not the fact that there has been no observation or examination. I say again: I believe this is a great opportunity for the union movement to move ahead, away from the Australian Labor Party, and become a relevant player in representing the workers of Australia. You have only to look at some of Greg Combet's statements to see an illustration of the exaggerated claims that are being made about this legislation which are dishonest, untrue and manipulated so as to create an emotional reaction in the work force of Australia. We will tab these and we will refer to these over the next two years, because they will be proved to be absolutely wrong and we will go to the next election quoting the incorrect, inaccurate and exaggerated statements that the Australian Labor Party and union movement have made in order to frighten Australian workers. I quote Combet: For the better part of 100 years Australia has an industrial relations system which ... has ensured that in times of economic downturn there have been solid protections for Australian workers ... A heavily regulated system operated by the Australian Labor Party produced unemployment of over one million people. That is where that system led us. That is where the process of conciliation and arbitration of 100 years led us-no flexibility, no leadership capacity to be able to deal with economic downturn. One million unemployed thrown on the scrapheap! The very ones that the Australian Labor Party claim to represent the most were the ones they damaged the mostthe young, women and older workers. They did nothing for those people. Take the 55year-olds who were booted out of a job because they were too old, the women who did not get a start and the youths who were never put on: what about those? They made up the one million unemployed in Australia created by the Australian Labor Party. So what for a hundred years of a better system? Combet, get the facts straight: your party and your organisation brought that on Australians, and they never want that again. Combet again: The Government has made no case for the WorkChoices legislation. The IMF, the OECD, Access Economics and the Reserve Bank of Australia have all made the economic case for further reform. Bring out the experts, not some associate professor at a Melbourne university against the OECD, the IMF or the Reserve Bank or any of these well-qualified managers of the Australian economy. The only people who do not seem to be listening appear to be the ALP and the ACTU. Another Combet statement: ... you can be sacked for no reason, with no right of appeal and no recompense. Unlawful termination still remains for all employees. Protections will still be there under state and federal occupational health had and safety and equal opportunity legislation. They cannot be sacked for no reason. That is not true; that is a blatant lie. Combet again: Protection against redundancy is also attacked for all Australian employees. It will no longer be a ground for claiming unfair dismissal, even in big business in the circumstances that the employer no longer needs you. That will put redundancy pay at risk. Redundancy pay is determined by awards and workplace agreements. All employers' obligations to pay redundancy pay will remain, regardless of whether they are subject to an award or unfair dismissal laws. Those redundancy obligations are not changed. Redundancy and dismissal are two different things. Don't try to confuse Australian workers-they know the difference. Redundancy pay is a completely separate legal entitlement. It is unrelated to unfair dismissal. Combet again: There is no guarantee in the legislation that real value of minimum wages will be maintained. There is no guarantee at the moment. In fact, the Labor Party cut wages. They had this brilliant accord: ‘Let's accept superannuation instead of a wage rise. Fellas, what do you think of that?' Some of the people in the House at the moment said it was a great idea and forced it on the Australian work force. So what! Under the accord a small superannuation pie in the sky when you die, instead of employers being able to pay your wages or you keeping your job. That was an absolutely unrealistic approach and it produced one million unemployed people in Australia. There is no way that policy of the accord produced any results beneficial to the employers and employees of Australia. Combet says: There is no guarantee in the legislation real value of minimum wages will be maintained. There is no guarantee now, and we have seen that there is no guarantee. The Australian Labor Party proved that when they were in office. There was no guarantee under Labor from 1983 to 1996 when the minimum wage actually declined-and you agreed with it by getting together and saying, ‘We've got an accord; we'll let the wages fall.' The ultimate guarantee of higher minimum wages is a strong economy-and I think that the Australian Labor Party, in some weird way, are acknowledging that, although Combet is not. He says there is no guarantee, but there never has been one under Labor or anybody else. He says: The government's real intention here is to allow minimum wages to fall in value over time, and that is what is going to happen. The UK Low Pay Commission, a body similar to the one that we are proposing, has awarded minimum wage increases of over 30 per cent since 1999. I am not claiming that the Australian body will do the same, but the the fact of the matter is minimum wages in Australia have risen and will continue to rise. The Fair Pay Commission will look at the whole structure of the economy and what Australia can afford. Minimum and award classification wages will not be able to fall below the levels of the 2005 safety net review. We have had that review. It is in place. Minimum wages cannot fall below that. That is law. That is what we are looking at today. But Combet can still make the statement that minimum wages will fall over time. The last government to have a policy to reduce the real value of minimum wages was the Hawke government during the accord with the ACTU. That was the only government that we have seen that reduced real minimum wages in Australia. Combet also speaks of a $66,000 fine for that the asking an employer to protect someone against unfair dismissal, a $66,000 fine for asking an employer to commit to collective bargaining and a $66,000 fine for asking for the right for employees to attend a union training course. This is no different in principle to current provisions related to prohibited content in collective agreements. These provisions are designed to prevent union standover tactics and nothing else imposed by union-friendly clauses on employers such as the anti-AWA provisions, compulsory union training leave and attempts to force employers to ignore the unfair dismissal exemptions. Combet rails against employees allegedly being forced into agreements, but he has no qualms about unions forcing employers into agreements-a one-way street. Let us make it fair: let them both have choices. Combet says: It will not be duress under the law for an employer to force an employee onto an individual contract-something the Government has been claiming falsely of course in its advertising and its public comments-but that will not constitute duress, so employers will be able to force people onto individual contracts on inferior conditions. The bill makes no amendments to the provisions of section 170CK(2)(g) of the Workplace Relations Act which makes it unlawful to terminate an employee-that is the law now, that is the law in Australia at the moment; that has not changed-for ‘refusing to negotiate in connection with, make, sign, extend, vary or terminate an AWA'. They are protected now. That is not going to change. How can Combet make those statements? He knows that is not true; he knows that is designed to scare people and to make them unsure of their future. Clause 104(5) of the bill is very clear: A person must not apply duress to an employer or an employee in relation to an AWA. It is very clear. It is there in the legislation: will be unlawful to apply duress. Combet goes on about pattern bargaining. One of the most common things that boards of directors do in this country is market rate surveys of CEOs' salaries and directors' fees and then determine their own remuneration on that basis. Combet says that is pattern bargaining. Pattern bargaining occurs where unions use industrial action to force agreements with identical terms and conditions on all workplaces regardless of the circumstances. That has happened in the building industry, the industry condemned by Commissioner Cole. In his royal commission he said pattern bargaining is enforced no matter what the circumstances and what the conditions. People in the building industry work hard and they work unusual hours under difficult conditions, but those conditions change depending on where people work in Australia, whether they work in a hot part, a cold part, a wet part or a dry part. It varies with the type of construction they are undertaking. So there should be flexibility for those conditions to be covered instead of this forced thing that Commissioner Cole so rightly condemned. Combet says that AWAs are pattern bargaining. All AWAs must comply with the fair pay and conditions standard; that is all. The rest of it is up to employees and employers to decide. That must be the foundation. There is a legal foundation to the whole process that must be complied with which guarantees certain conditions for all workers in Australia. All AWAs must be freely agreed to. It will remain unlawful for employers to force employees onto AWAs, but this is the kind of behaviour Combet would like to force on workers himself-to force them into pattern bargaining in the building industry. There is more, and I am going to use future occasions, maybe at the consideration in detail stage, to raise these issues. With the it union movement representing a decline in opinions and smaller groups of people, it is really significant that they and the Australian Labor Party have not taken this opportunity to go ahead and take advantage of what is being offered. I believe that together-after all of this carry-on is through, as with other measures of reform this government has adopted-we will be able to work for future growth in Australia. This government is not about to give up office by doing something crazy. As I have always said to the Australian Labor Party, if our policies are so bad or so poorly thought through, why don't you let it go through without opposition? Then you would see us quickly destroy the nation that you want to represent. But the fact is that you make a noise and the louder the noise the opposition makes the weirder the arguments and the more likely we are to be right because you are trying to prevent the process from going ahead. Those issues that you think we are going to lose on you let go through to the keeper. This is one of those issues the Australian Labor Party are making a noise about because they do not want it to occur because they know it is right. They would not be opposing it with such strength if they thought it was so destructive. If they thought it was destructive, they would pass it here and in the Senate without opposition and then claim, in their speeches and subsequently, that they had always said that these parties do not represent the workers of Australia. The fact is the workers in Australia have been represented well by this side of the parliament in job availability, wage and salary rises and permanency of employment. That is what the families of Australia want and that is what they need. That is what this government is offering and will continue to offer as it goes ahead with the changes which are most important to everyone in Australia.",67
29,Mr CREAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise to oppose the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 and to support the amendment moved by the member for Perth. This bill represents the most retrosince grade step in industrial relations since Federation. I know it will be bad for families I fervently believe it will be bad for the economy because of the impact it will have on productivity in the workplace where we have to develop cooperation and get the team working together. I notice that the member for Mitchell, who just spoke, has left the chamber but he urged the trade union movement to move forward in this debate-to look forward. The trade union did, in the eighties. I was privileged to lead it. But it was able to move forward because it had a government that was prepared to work with it to try to address the pressing needs of the nation-in particular, how to get inflation under control, how to become more export oriented and how to drive productivity through the workplace. As President of the ACTU, I remember talking to the then industrial relations spokesman for the Liberal Party, one John Winston Howard. He came to see us about the accord and never came back after we had taken him through what it was we were trying to achieve for this nation. The current Prime Minister never embraced the accord, but he now wants to claim credit for the lasting benefits that the accord introduced. That is just sheer hypocrisy. And I might just say it is not the trade union movement, as Mr Cadman would have it said, that is steeped in the past",72
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Order! The member will refer to members by their seat.,72
31,Mr CREAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The member for Mitchell. It is this government that is steeped in the past. This bill is steeped in the past. It is built on obsession and it is built on ignorance. It is an obsession that is blind to the experience and blinkered to the opportunity of this nation. This bill involves the most massive legislative reweighting of power to employers Federation. It gives the minister unprecedented powers to intervene. It destroys and collective bargaining. It makes it easier to sack people. How do you increase employment and job security by making it easier to sack people? Yet that is what this bill does. It also guts the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It can, through ministerial intervention, abolish the right to strike and it massively limits unions in carrying out their legitimate role. The Prime Minister calls this the Work Choices bill. I call it the no choice bill. If anyone has any doubt about that, just look at clause 104 as an example. It is headed ‘Coercion and duress'. Clause 104(5) states: A person must not apply duress to an employer or employee in connection with an AWA. That is unremarkable and, indeed, is commendable: no duress by either side. It would be fine if it stood alone, but it does not stand alone. I urge the House to look next at subclause (6). It says: To avoid doubt, an employer does not apply duress to an employee for the purposes of subsection (5) merely because the employer employee to make an AWA with the employer as a condition of employment. I repeat in a more succinct form what that provision says: an employer does not apply duress merely because he requires the employee to make an AWA. Give us a break. The message in that provision, writ large to all employees in this country, is take the AWA or take the sack-take the AWA or you do not get a job. That, according to the bill, is not duress. Despite what the explanatory memorandum has to say, the bill makes no distinction between new employees and existing employees. Also, it is something the employer can insist upon at any time, including unilaterally, even when the collective agreement is in existence. Think too of the double standards inherent in this bill. Littered through it are penalties, fines-call them what you like-on employees and unions for being engaged in duress. But employers, coercing their workers by insisting on AWAs, not only are encouraged to do so by this legislation but are specifically exempted from any penalty. What is fair about that? What is fair about that fundamental dimension of this legislation? Collective bargaining is essential to protect people's living standards because, simply put, an individual up against the boss is not a fair match. I ask those parents that are listening to this today: do they really think that their young son or daughter going to their first job is a fair match one out against an employer who has been in business for yonks? Does anyone really believe an individual, vulnerable because a company is restructuring, is a fair match for an employer prepared to demand anything of the employee? Of course they are not. That is why unions were formed, because there had to be a representative role by which you could reweight, in a sensible way, the balance in requires the the workplace. If anyone has any doubts about that, I refer them to the Bakers Delight case. Everyone knows Bakers Delight-a baking franchise all around the country. I have previously raised in this House the issue of Deanna Renella, a year-10 student employed by that company. The judge in the case remarked that it was ridiculous to suggest that she was in an equal bargaining position with her employer. Do not just take my word for it; look at what the judge said in this case. What did Deanna have to do to get a job? She was given a two-page pattern AWA that gave her a flat rate of $8.35 an hour. It provided for no annual leave, no annual leave loading and no sick leave. She was underpaid, according to the judge, by 25 per cent. The judge in her case was able to order restitution to get her her entitlements because the AWA was not properly filed. It was a technical breach, but the fact is that there were 50 other employees in that company paid under precisely the same AWA conditions for whom restitution could not be ordered because, in their cases, the AWAs had been validly signed. All of those other 50 employees remained on a pay rate 25 per cent lower than the award provision. There is another irony in this of course: this bill says that a union cannot insist on pattern bargaining across businesses, but the employer in Bakers Delight can insist upon an AWA being a pattern, being identical, across all-if they want-Bakers Delight outlets. I ask again, what is fair about that? Why have we got this bill so heavily weighted against the unions and so favourably weighted to the employer? Another interesting thing is that this 25 per cent underpayment occurred while the Prime Minister's no disadvantage test was in existence. If a person can be paid 25 per cent less than the award with a no disadvantage test supposedly protecting them, imagine what is going to happen when the no disadvantage test is abolished. Of course, the Prime Minister has abolished it. He promised before the last election that there would be a no disadvantage test; now he will not stand by it. Anyone who thinks there is not going to be exploitation and reweighting against poor, vulnerable workers in this country should think again. It has happened with the no disadvantage test. The no disadvantage test has been stripped away and this bill enables any employer to rock up to an employee at any stage of the game and say, ‘That's your AWA: take it or leave it.' Not only is section 104 a mechanism that gives the employer the whip hand but nowhere in this bill is there a requirement for the employer to bargain in good faith. Think about that too. I think this is a very revealing circumstance. If anyone has got any doubt, have a look at the Morris MCMahon dispute. I attended a meeting of the workers back in 2003, from memory. That was a circumstance in which the work force, collectively, wanted to bargain with the employer. The employer simply said, ‘I refuse to bargain,' and under the conciliation and arbitration act there was no requirement-because the government had taken it out-for the employer to bargain in good faith. This bill does not prohibit that refusal to negotiate. I ask to reflect on this seriously, because we all know that disputes can only be resolved by negotiation, not by intransigence. But this protects an employer's intransigence. Collective bargaining is also undermined in this legislation, with the huge array of new powers in the hands of the minister to intervene. He can intervene to overturn decisions and to declare certain matters out-I think they call it ‘prohibited content'. He can intervene to suspend industrial action and he can be backed by heavy penalties, $33,000 fines, for circumstances in which unions merely ask for something to be included in negotiations. Make no mistake; this bill destroys collective bargaining in this country. Labor will emphatically insist on the rights of workers to collective bargaining. We will ensure that right in legislation and repeal those provisions which undermine it. We will also legislate to require employers to bargain in good faith. There is also a claim that this bill is good for the economy because it is encouraging the focus at the enterprise level. This claim is fatuous in the extreme. Let us understand the history of this-and I ought to know because I was heavily involved. Labor introduced enterprise bargaining in 1987. I think it was in Accord Mark III. The collapse of the Australian dollar at that time-the banana republic time; everyone remembers thatnecessitated moving away from a centralised wage-fixing system to one based on the enterprise and on productivity. Wages were required to be linked to productivity. We as a trade union movement and a labour movement understood that and we developed a response of smarter, more efficient ways of doing things and of building those into the negotiations to create smarter workplaces and more efficient workplaces. It was a hard adjustment, particularly for those industries which had been protected, where the tariff people levels were coming down, and which were being exposed to greater international competition. But this was a brave, bold and selfless decision that the trade union movement took together with the political wing-the government of the day-in the interests of securing this nation. The end result was the biggest step up in productivity that this country has ever seen. This is what the government now wants to ditch. It is very interesting that New Zealand has gone down the path of the individual agreement. Labor and this current government have up until now embraced collective agreements based around the enterprise. That is what has delivered this country the big step up in productivity. If there is any doubt about that, I have a reference here to a Professor Peetz from Griffith University, who did a study on this that showed that the productivity of the Australian system was superior to that of the New Zealand system. That is the legacy of a sensible approach, yet it is not a system that the government proposes for us. Productivity has already fallen back in this country because the government has failed to invest in research and development and failed to invest in the drivers of economic growth such as skills and infrastructure. The productivity of this nation will fall again. Why? Because the government is creating an environment of division, fear and insecurity, all leading to non-cooperation in the workplace. There has to be a circumstance where this government creates an environment for genuine negotiation and genuine sharing of the benefits of the business. That is a smart way to drive this economy forward. Cohesion and partnership in the workplace have delivered for this nation and for its people. The Prime Minister, of course, wants to break that. I go to the Prime Minister's claim about real wage growth under him. This is his catch cry whenever people say, ‘What about the no disadvantage test?' He says that real wages have grown under him in every year. That is true-but, as the member for Reid says, they have grown despite him. The truth is that real wages growth did not begin when he became the Prime Minister. They began before that, in 1991. What has allowed this country to deliver real wage growth each year for the past 14 years is the fact that this nation, through the accord, broke the back of inflation. This country, through the accord, locked in low inflation. Unions and their members selflessly accepted real wage reductions to lock in that low inflation. They then committed to lifting productivity by linking future wage growth to productivity. That remains a magnificent commitment. Yet this bill attacks the very best of the organisations that helped to deliver it. Despite economic difficulties with its rank and file, this was a trade union leadership through its organisational structure that understood the importance of doing this for the nation. That selfless act has been rewarded in the most disgraceful and ungrateful of ways. We know from bitter experience that you cannot believe a word that the Prime Minister says. Now, with control of the Senate, he shows that he is beyond showing a scintilla of gratitude. We need to understand what we are facing with this legislation. This is a radical step back to the past. This will entrench division. This will make people insecure in the workplace. This will lead to a cutting of their wages. This provides for no effective underpinning and no effective security. Of course we have to have a profitable economy, and we have to drive enterprise and productivity. But there has to be fairness in the system as well. As I have said on previous occasions, there is no point in joining the race to the bottom. If people really think we should compete with China and India by driving wages to the bottom, I will disagree with them any time, fervently. But I also know that, if we cannot compete on the basic wage structure, we have to compete on a smarter basis. But you are not going to get a commitment to that smart approach-a commitment to doing things differently, creatively, intelligently-unless you take the people in the work force with you, rather than divide them, play one off against the other and try to have some cute excuse where they turn up one day and are presented with a piece of paper and someone saying, ‘Sign up to that or you've lost your job.' We are a better society than that. I have led a trade union movement and I have been part of a political party and part of a government that has been proud to work in unison with the working people of this country to advance the interests of this country. I am damned if I am going to put up with government coming in here and recreating the division. The country does not need it, and the bill should be opposed. (Time expired)",72
32,Mr HARTSUYKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I very much welcome the presentation of the legislation before the House, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. I believe it represents an important step forward for the economy of this country and therefore for the people of this country. The economy has made great strides in recent years, and these reforms will ensure that the economy continues to grow and that we continue to meet the challenges ahead. In the time. I have available to me I wish to look at the need for these reforms and the safeguards for employees that will be put in place and to challenge the notion that these reforms are somehow un-Australian. It is important to stress the safeguards because this coalition government policy has been the target of a systematic campaign of distortion and misinformation by the Labor movement, whose main tactic has been to say that black is white and to scare working people about what the future holds. Apart from the obvious distortions-let us be frank; apart from the obvious lies-such as the claims that awards and the right to union membership will be abolished, I have had trade union officials tell me that the Low Pay Commission in the UK has not met for years. Their clear implication is that the minimum wage in the UK has not been increased for years and that the proposed Fair Pay Commission, and as a result the minimum wage set here, will meet a similar fate. It took just two minutes on the internet to debunk that lie. In April 1999 the UK adult minimum wage per hour was £3.60. It has increased annually since that time and at the beginning of last month rose to £5.05. The commission has already recommended an increase to £5.35 in October next year. That will result in an increase of some 48.6 per cent since 1999. Just whose interests do these trade union officials think they are serving when they peddle this sort of stuff? Don't they realise that their members can see through it? Don't they realise that their members do not like being conned? It is tactics like that that go a long way to explaining the declining level of membership of trade unions, to the point where now only in the order of 25 per cent of employees belong to a trade union. Workers of Australia do not feel they want to pay their good money for representation like that. Why do we need these reforms? Since 1996 we have seen higher real wages, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, more Australians in work, the lowest level of strikes, higher productivity and higher standards of living. No doubt some union official could explain to me why that is all bad for the Australian worker, but I cannot fathom it myself. I cannot see why higher living standards are somehow so bad. To be fair, in the context of talking about reform, I do not just mean reforms by this government. Our reforms go back to 1983 and include the reduction in trade barriers, privatisation, work force reforms that have been done to date, tax changes, floating the dollar and so on. In 1983 when these reforms started we were ranked as the 18th most prosperous country in the world in terms of GDP per capita. Now we are eighth. But what does that mean for the worker? The average Australian worker is better off by some $83,000 as a result. If we can sustain the sort of growth we have enjoyed in recent years for the next 20 years, the average Australian worker will be better off by a further $74,000. Without the reforms put in place since 1983, it is estimated that our unemployment rate for 2003-04 would have been 8.1 per cent compared to the actual 5.8 per cent. Of course, our unemployment rate has fallen further since that date. But there is the rub. The average Australian will only be better off into the future if we can sustain economic growth. All the signs are that we can only do that if we continue the reform process. If we can sustain growth of four per cent per year over the next 20 years, the average Australian will be a further $74,000 better off. However, current forecasts predict a growth rate of only 2.4 per cent. On that basis, by 2025 Australia is likely to fall back the 18th ranking in GDP per capita, precisely back to where we were in 1983. If we can achieve through reform a growth rate of four per cent over the next 20 years, the economy would be 40 per cent bigger and Australia would rise to third in GDP rankings. Growth at four per cent as opposed to 2.4 per cent would result in an increase in Commonwealth revenues of nine per cent of GDP by 2025. The extra tax revenue could be used to cut personal tax rates by 30 per cent and pay for future projected health and education funding. On an individual level, the wealth of the average Australian would be 25 per cent higher. These statistics provide compelling evidence of the need to change for anyone who may care to say, ‘If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' We are facing new challenges at home and abroad. Our population is ageing, more people are becoming entitled to the many benefits we rightly provide our senior citizens and there are fewer people entering the labour market and creating the wealth to pay for those benefits. Our work force normally grows in the order of 170,000 a year. But indications are that, with the ageing population, work force growth will only be 190,000 for the whole period 2020-30. That is in the order of one-tenth of the current rate. Productivity is falling. The rates of growth that we have seen in current times are beginning to slow. What about challenges from abroad? Yes, we do need to think about what is happening abroad. I am frequently told by people that they do not care about what happens in other countries. They should because, if they had not noticed, Australia may be an island but it is certainly not a fortress. I will have more to say about the island mentality later. Let us remember that we have a population of only 20 million. We are disadvantaged by our size to and our distance from major centres of population around the world. We are disadvantaged by the distance from potential markets. We are no longer cushioned by the Commonwealth. We compete with countries with far bigger populations and the advantages of far larger internal markets. The growth of the internet and better communications generally mean that there is no hiding place from the global market. Of course we have to care what happens in other countries. It does not mean that we have to be like other countries, but we do have to be aware of other countries, we have to work with other countries and we have to compete with other countries. The European Union, with its 25 member countries and its population of some 459 million, is actively working towards harmonising its 25 different systems of employment legislation because it makes economic sense. If the European Union is moving that way, how can it make sense for a relatively smaller economy of some 20 million to cling to the notion of having six different employment relations systems? In short, we have to care substantially more about what happens in other countries because our prosperity depends on it. We either compete and maintain our place amongst the wealthiest nations with a better quality of life or we ignore what is going on around us, fail to compete and become a secondor third-rate economy. That is the ‘She'll be right' mentality, the mentality peddled by the ALP-just leave it the same and run the economy through the rear-view mirror. Mr Albanese-You just went through all the reforms we did!",76
33,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Order! The member for Grayndler is warned!,78
34,Mr HARTSUYKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"That is the context of these reforms. That is the big picture with some idea of what we stand to lose as a nation unless we press ahead with reform. Yes, individuals often feel lost in the big picture and may ask, quite rightly, ‘What's in it for me?' Another thing that has baffled me about the labour movement in this day and age is their apparent failure to grasp that what is good for the Australian economy is good for Australians generally and that it is possible for employers and employees to work in a way which is mutually beneficial. These simple concepts clearly have not yet dawned on the members opposite or the members of the union movement, who cling to a simple fundamentalist concept such as ‘workers good, employers bad'. I have news for them: unless you have an employer, you do not have a job; unless you have a healthy, profitdependent able company, you do not have any workers. At least Greg Combet sometimes knows a good thing when he sees it. As he told the National Press Club in July: Australia is currently in its 14th consecutive year of economic growth - a historically significant period of economic expansion, low inflation, productivity growth and low unemployment. Mr Bowen-Why's that?",78
35,Mr HARTSUYKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"My advice to him is: spread the word amongst the brothers and sisters, Greg, and tell them how we got to this historically significant period. Mr Bowen-Thank you, Paul Keating.",78
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,The member for Prospect will remain silent.,78
37,Mr HARTSUYKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"We got there through reform. He might also have a word with the current leader of the Labor Party, who in this House in June 1996 said that the then Workplace Relations Act would turn Australia into a ‘low wage, low productivity industrial wasteland'. How sad he must be that he has been proved wrong. Mr Albanese interjecting",78
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Order! I remind the member for Grayndler that he has been warned. Any further interjections will see him exit the House.,78
39,Mr HARTSUYKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I said I would talk about safeguards for the individual in the context of this legislation. There are four I would like to begin with, for Greg's sake. Let us talk about the safeguards offered by economic expansion, the safeguards offered by low inflation, the safeguards to workers offered by productivity growth and the safeguards to workers offered by low unemployment. As for the safeguards specifically mentioned in the legislation, the bill will set up a Fair Pay Commission, which will be an inbody. There will be for the first time statutory minimum standards for pay and conditions covering minimum and award classification wages, four weeks paid annual leave, 52 weeks unpaid parental leave, 10 days paid personal and carers leave for employees with more than 12 months service, and a 38-hour ordinary working week. Workers covered by a federal award will have their minimum wages and basic entitlements guaranteed by law under the Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. If the award is different from the standard, the more generous will apply. If a worker is currently ered by a state award or agreement and is moving to the new national system, the current arrangements will be protected until placed by a new agreement. The following award matters will be protected: public days; rest breaks, including meal breaks; incentive based payments and bonuses; annual leave loadings; allowances; penalty rates; and shift and overtime loadings. But there's more-and I am going to list these safeguards, because I have heard time and time again from members of the labour movement and read letters in the local paper casting doubts on these additional safeguards. I want to refer here to unlawful dismissal and the protection that this legislation provides. You cannot be subject to unlawful dismissal in relation to temporary absence from work due to illness or injury; trade union membership or participation in trade union activities; non-membership of a trade union; filing a complaint or participating in proceedings against an employer; race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family sponsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin; refusing to sign an AWA; absence from work during maternity or other parental leave; or temporary absence from work due to carrying out voluntary emergency management activity. It is right and proper that the protection should be in place, just as it is right that this legislation will exempt smaller companies from unfair dismissal provisions which have acted in so many cases as a deterrent to firms putting on new workers. The unions talk about the victims of this aspect of legislation, yet the World Bank has found that the more restrictive the country's firing regime, the greater the black economy. Under a black cov- economy there are more people who are working without any job security. Under a black economy there are people working re- without a wage safety net. Under a black economy there is no workers' compensation. holi- Under a black economy there is no sick leave. There are certainly no safeguards whatsoever. According to the World Bank, it also means that fewer jobs are created and that there is a lower average income, more female unemployment, more youth unemployment and more unskilled workers without a job. I know that many in the labour movement refuse to accept anything that appears to come out of the World Bank. So let me remind them that the World Bank's mission is to fight poverty, that it has 184 member countries, that it is providing debt relief to 27 countries, that it is the largest external funder of education projects and that it is a major player in the fight against HIV-AIDS. On the basis of the material put forward by unions in their campaign against these measures and the material which has been shown time and time again to be based on misinterre- pretation and mangled facts, right down to falsehoods, I would rather trust the material coming from the World Bank than the rubbish that we have seen on our TV screens from the labour movement. Let me remind the unions that this is about fighting poverty, lifting living standards and providing jobs. If you do not have a job then any increase in the minimum wage is going to be of little assistance. In fact, it may even work to price you out of the market. No amount of increase in the minimum wage is going to increase your living standards if you do not have a job. The best safeguard against poverty and social problems in our community is providing jobs for people. However, there is one thing that this legislation does not seek to set in stone, and that is the role of the trade unions. Under this legislation, trade unions are basically going to have to seriously compete in the market and provide better representation than they have done to date. They have been prepared to tell all sorts of lies about the government's intention and about what is going on in this bill because they know their membership is declining. It is a scare campaign. It is the roll of the dice to try to pick up a few members by scaring them. Finally, let me deal with the notion that this reform package is somehow un-Australian. In a lecture in Sydney, Bob Hawke went further. He said: ‘It's wrong. It is unfair. It is un-Australian. It is immoral.'(Quorum formed) To my mind, it is wrong, unfair, un-Australian and immoral to conduct the kind of campaign run by the labour movement. It is wrong to imply, as I mentioned, that the UK minimum wage has not been increased for years when by next year it will have been increased by almost half since 1996. It is wrong to tell people that they will lose their lunch breaks or to tell mothers that they will lose their jobs if they have to care for a sick child. I think it is wrong and immoral for Sharan Burrow to say in the context of the ACTU campaign: ‘I need a mum or a dad of someone who has been seriously injured or killed. That would be fantastic.' I think that is a pretty immoral statement. It is not wrong, unfair, un-Australian or immoral to set out measures that will help to ensure the continued success of this country's economy and that will help to provide more jobs, higher wages, more opportunities and greater prosperity. This government recognises-and so do the members opposite in their weaker moments-that there are good and bad employers and that there are good and bad employees. But there is a balance in this package, providing what is best for both sides and what is good for our country. These reforms are not un-Australian if, by that description, they mean unfair. As I have said, the aim is to increase prosperity and opportunity but against a backdrop of safeguards. When people sometimes say that something is un-Australian, they often mean that it is something different, something they last are not accustomed to. We have been doing things differently in recent times. It is important that we continue to change, and it is important that we keep reform going, because we have to compete in the global economy. It is all right to say that we are going to manage very nicely just as we are but, unfortunately, staying just as we are is not an option in a changing world. We need to keep abreast of our competitors, and we need to keep working hard to ensure that Australia maintains a great world economy. These reforms are a major part of that program. The Australian Labor Party want to run this economy through the rear-view mirror. Their policies are backward looking. This government is very much focused on moving this country forward. A more flexible labour market provides great benefits for employees and employers. It is great for our nation, and it will build a stronger Australia. I am committed to these reforms; the ALP may not be.",78
40,Mr BOWEN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, you bet we are not committed to these reforms; they will take the Australian workers to a place they have not been to in many decades. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 is the most important legislation that I have spoken on in my time as a member of this House, and it is likely to be the most important legislation that I speak on for a very long time. It almost goes without saying that industrial relations legislation has a massive effect on people's everyday lives. It affects the salaries, the conditions and the balance between work and family for millions of ordinary hard-working Australians and, of course, it also affects the economy. We heard a bit about the economy from the member for Cowper, who outlined Labor's reforms in the period after 1983. This government mount the case that this bill is necessary for the economic health of Australia, but they failed to successfully prosecute that case. It is certainly true that economy cannot afford to rest on its laurels, and Australia needs to continue to reform. The government's reforms, however, show an obsession with driving down wages rather than driving up productivity. They are obsessed with slashing working conditions instead of improving the education and skills of the work force. They are driven to compete with other countries on the basis of low wages instead of high skills-and the member for Cowper came very close to admitting that in his address. This economy is in desperate need of reforms that improve research and development levels which have suffered for much of the last 10 years from this government's changes in 1996. Only now has Australia returned to the level of research and development that we had when the Keating government lost office in 1996. Mr Albanese interjecting",80
41,Mr BOWEN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"As the member for Grayndler quite rightly points out, now they are turning their attention to trashing the CSIRO. Instead, the government is obsessed with racing countries like China, Taiwan and other trading competitors to the bottom when it comes to wages. The most galling thing about these changes is that at this time these nations are racing us to the top. Nations like China are taking their universities to being the best in the world. They are reforming their education sector and have enormous amounts of research and development. Thomas Friedman, in his latest book The World is Flat, makes the point very clearly and compellingly that when a nation tries to compete with countries like China on wages it is kidding itself. Successful nations will be the ones with a world-class tertiary education sector, innovative and entrepreneurial industrial sectors and first-class communications. The government claim that we need a more decentralised bargaining system to an drive up productivity, which has been disappointingly low in recent years, but they have not provided any evidence to support this contention. I am drawn to the conclusions of the 17 leading academics in the field of industrial relations who issued a paper earlier this year dealing with the ramifications of the government's proposals. The experts wrote: The Government's claim that the individual contracts deliver higher productivity is highly questionable. These experts did a very interesting comparison of productivity growth in Australia and New Zealand over the 1990s, when Australia had a comparatively centralised bargaining system. They found superior productivity growth in Australia-not in New Zealand with the punitive industrial contract system that the New Zealand government implemented but in Australia. These experts pointed out that productivity growth for the two nations had been similar up until that point. Promoting economic growth and productivity growth is not the primary motivation for this legislation; the primary motivation is ideology. I am going to do something very unusual in this debate, particularly for a Labor member: I am going to pay the Prime Minister some credit-and I know the member for Grayndler is going to be surprised to hear me pay the Prime Minister some credit. But to give credit where it is due, in the 1970s, John Howard identified industrial relations as an area that needed to be reformed. He was almost a lone voice in the wilderness in the Liberal Party. There were only a few of them-John Howard, John Hyde, Peter Shack and Gerard Henderson-and they argued in the Liberal Party that industrial relapropriate tions needed reform, but they could not deliver it. Even though John Howard was Treasurer at the time, he could not deliver It took Labor to deliver industrial relations reform, to bring an enterprise focus to bargaining and to deliver industrial reform, which led to increased productivity. The government might not like to hear it, but it is true-they cannot deny it-it was Labor that introduced enterprise bargaining. John Howard argued that it should happen when he was Treasurer and he could not deliver it. But now the world has moved on, and we have seen massive reforms in industrial relations-the enterprise focus that we could not have dreamt of in the 1970s when John Howard was arguing as a lone voice in the Liberal Party that reform was needed. But he stuck to the same ideological agenda. The ideological agenda that was laudable in the 1970s is laughable in the 21st century. He is like one of those sad, pathetic Russians you see on television clinging to a photo of Joseph Stalin, longing for the old days, sticking to the old ideology as though the world has not moved on and saying, ‘If only Joseph Stalin could come back; if only we could have the return of Father Joe, everything would be all right.' John Howard is stuck in his ideological time warp of the 1970s. It is the Australian people who will pay the price for this Prime Minister's ideological obsessions and his foibles. This is a very big and important bill. It runs to 687 pages, and it will be impossible for me to deal with each aspect, but I am going to deal in turn with what I regard as the bill's major ramifications. Let me start with Australian workplace agreements. This government introduced Australian workplace agreements in 1996. In 1996, it put into its legislation a much trumpeted no disadvantage test, meaning that a contract could not have conditions worse than those in the apaward. It did not do this voluntarily. It did it because the Senate of Australia insisted on it, because the Australian Labor it. Party and the Australian Democrats combined to insist on a no disadvantage test. This bill rips up the no disadvantage test. This is what we get for having a government with control of the Senate. What is worse is that this bill makes AWAs very close to being compulsory where an employer chooses to make them so. Section 104 of this bill states quite clearly that an employer can make an AWA a condition of employment. At the moment, due to Federal Court interpretations of the Workplace Relations Act, an employer can make an AWA compulsory for a new employee or for an employee who receives a promotion within the firm. This bill takes that a lot further. It says that it shall not be duress if an employer makes an AWA a condition of employment. It does not say ‘at the beginning of that employment'. It does not say ‘in the case of a promotion'. It merely says that an employer can make an AWA a condition of employment. Therefore an employer, at a time of their choosing, can make an AWA a condition of employment. This is a terrible pincer movement. We have the government abolishing the no disadvantage test, ripping up the test which says that AWAs need to be equal to or better than the award and at the same time effectively giving employers the opportunity to make AWAs compulsory. It is offensive to call this the work choices bill. There is no choice when you make a contract compulsory. This is not about choice. How can government members say with a straight face that this is about choice when the bill enables employers to force individuals onto contracts. The no disadvantage test, as I mentioned, was installed by the Senate back in 1996. This government, with its arrogant control of the Senate, is now in the process of ripping up the no disadvantage test. I believe that this is the most pernicious part of this This is the most pernicious clause of a bill which is pernicious in many ways. Why are we seeing this double attack on AWAs-this pincer movement-in abolishing the no disadvantage test and at the same time effectively making AWAs compulsory? It is because the government is so disappointed with the take-up rate of Australian workplace agreements that we are seeing. I think four per cent of Australian workers are currently on Australian workplace agreements. Many of these are in the federal Public Service. Many others are in the mining industry. If you look across industry generally, you will see very few AWAs. This government trumpeted them as the answer for the Australian economy, but the take-up rate has been appallingly low. The government have gone away, scratched their heads and thought about how they can improve the take-up rate of AWAs. Instead of saying, ‘Let's make the conditions better; let's make them more attractive,' have effectively said, ‘Let's make them compulsory.' What an outrage. This government pay $55 million-not of their money but of taxpayers' money-for as on television saying that this is all about choice and they introduce a bill which takes choice away. Let me turn to other aspects of the bill. The next most pernicious aspect of this bill is the unfair dismissal clauses. With the laws regarding unfair dismissal gone for employers with 100 or fewer employees, the employers now have the right to unfettered hiring and firing of their enterprise. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that this leaves 3.7 million Australians without protection from unfair dismissal. It is worth stressing that there will still be protection from unlawful dismissal. When the various antidiscrimination acts come into bill. play, unlawful dismissal stops employers from removing employees for discriminatory reasons. That would be unlawful. According to official figures, only 147 unlawful termination claims have been lodged in the Federal Court since 1996. Over the same period, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has processed more than 50,000 unfair dismissal applications. Unlawful termination cases are much more costly, complex, time consuming and difficult for employees and employers than the much simpler unfair dismissal claims. I want to stress that these unlawful claims are just as complex and costly for employers as for employees-and especially for small businesses. Small businesses do not have the resources to go off to the Federal Court and defend unlawful dismissal claims. Labor has long proposed sensible, reasonable reforms to unfair dismissal provisions to make it easier for small businesses to deal with them. This government has rejected the they opportunity to take up Labor's reforms. It would have been easy: Labor would have joined with the government in this House and in the other place and passed sensible reforms to streamline unfair dismissal legislation to make it easier for small businesses. The government has rejected that opportunity and has instead gone down the ideological road. It has gone down the road of abolishing the rights of employees in firms with fewer than 100 employees. The government says that this is necessary to create jobs. Again, it fails to prosecute claim. We have seen all sorts of claims about small business creation. The most outrageous claims have been based on a telephone poll, hardly the most rigorous of analysis. I refer the House to the study by Associate Professor Rowena Barrett, one of the 17 academic experts who I referred to earlier. Associate Professor Barrett finds: There is no clear and convincing evidence that shows that an exemption of small business from UFDunfair dismissalwill generate new jobs in small business (whether this is 50,000, 53,000 or 77,000). Associate Professor Barrett says that there is not clear and convincing evidence. This is not about job creation; this is about ideology-that same ideological obsession that we saw from the Prime Minister in the 1970s writ large in the 21st century when he now has control not only of this place but of the other place. I now wish to turn my attention to the so called Fair Pay Commission, which the member for Cowper lauded so eloquently in his speech, which will introduce the land of milk and honey-everything will be okay now that we have a Fair Pay Commission. I cannot put it better than Ross Gittins, the well-respected economics writer in the Sydney Morning Herald, who wrote that, if a nation has ‘Democratic' in its title then it is certain to be undemocratic. You can be certain, with the government having put ‘Fair Pay' in this commission's title, that it is about anything but fairness. Because the Prime Minister has failed in persuading the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire which has existed for 100 years, to follow his extreme views about cutting the minimum wage, he is now going to remove the umpire this and appoint a commission of five handpicked commissioners to set the minimum wage. Why is he doing this? Because John Howard has made a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission every year for the last 10 years on the minimum wage. If his submissions had been adopted, the minimum wage would now be $2,600 lower than it is now. If the government had had their way over the last 10 years, the minimum wage would be $50 a week lower than it is now. So, of course they are outraged that the Industrial Relations Commission has shown some independence-that the Industrial Relations Commission has weighed up their application, considered the application of the ACTU, considered the applications of the state governments and come up with a fair ruling, quite often halfway between the two. So they are taking away the power of the Industrial Relations Commission and giving it to the Fair Pay Commission, which will have five handpicked commissioners and remove 100 years worth of involvement in the minimum wage by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Like so many aspects of this bill, the government is attempting to achieve what it has failed to do over the last 10 years because it has not had control of the Senate. It certainly has not had control of the Industrial Relations Commission, despite the fact that it appoints all its members and it appointed a handpicked president, His Honour Mr Justice Giudice. Even he has said the minimum wage should be higher than the government has said. The government has reacted to this by abolishing the Industrial Relations Commission's role in setting the minimum wage. I would like to spend a few minutes referring to the right of entry provisions in this bill. This is not perhaps the most fashionable part of the bill to talk about but it is a very important part. This bill further restricts the ability of trade unions to represent members and sort out their problems. The government come in here and say that unions need to do better-unions need to represent their members better. At the same time they introduce this pernicious bill, which handcuffs unions in representing their members. I saw first hand the impacts of the government's 1996 changes to right of entry, which made workers reluctant to call in their union and get union into sort out any problems. The vast majority of employers are good employers who never need to have the union come onto the site and intervene to fix a problem-the vast majority are. But, as even the member for Cowper acknowledged, there are some employers who cut costs, who cut corners, and their employees need the assistance of a trade union. This bill means that unions now not only have to give 24-hours written notice of the visit-which they have always had to do; it is a legitimate thing that a union should give notice of their visit to a workplace-but they need to give the employer in writing the reason for the visit before they have had the chance to come and discuss with the employees their concerns and before they have had the chance to investigate the concerns. So the union might have to write to the employer and say, for example, ‘We have concerns over your pay books. Members are telling us that you're not keeping adequate records of your pay.' The employer then has 24 hours to fix it before the union comes into go through the pay books. Even worse is that there is now no access for trade unions in workplaces where there are only Australian workplace agreements and no access for unions to check nonmember records. So you might have a union member ringing up and saying, ‘I don't think my records are being kept correctly.' The union can go out and check their records but can do nothing to assist those people who have not made the claim who are not union members. Of course, now the union representatives visiting the site can be confined by the employer to a particular room. The act even goes into so much detail as to say-and I was surprised to read this-that the employer can choose the route that the union the official takes through their workplace from one room to another. That is how restrictive this bill is when it comes to union access to workplaces. I am going to conclude by quoting Professor Mark Wooden of the Melbourne Institute-not an institute particularly close to the Australian Labor Party, and one which has made many findings in the past in favour of the government. Professor Wooden says: If the aim of the government's agenda is to provide employees with real choices, then I am on Greg Combet's side-the right to bargain collectively needs to be protected. Further, the Government should have a vested interest in ensuring collective bargaining continues to flourish if it believes, as it has stated so often in the past, that enterprise bargaining has been fundamental to the productivity gains of the 1990s. That is the Melbourne Institute-not Kim Beazley, not Chris Bowen, not Anthony Albanese, not a card-carrying member of the Australian Labor Party; it is Professor Mark Wooden of the Melbourne Institute, a respected think tank which the government has often relied on. (Time expired)",81
42,Mr BARRESI,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,This is a historic debate! There is no question about that. It is a debate that has been much anticipated by the Australian public. It is also a debate that is taking place on a policy program that this government has never shied away from. It is a policy position on industrial relations on which every member on the other side knows full well where the coalition has stood for the last 10 years. So for them to say in their contributions sudden this has been sprung upon them is an absurdity. Even the members on the other side have acknowledgedMr Bowen-You didn't promise this! Why didn't you put it in the policy speech?,85
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Order! The member for Prospect will refrain from interjecting, otherwise he will take an exit trip from the chamber.",86
44,Mr BARRESI,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"that the Liberal Party and the National Party have long advocated industrial relations reform, and industrial relations reform is taking place today. What they have failed to understand on the other side is that our national prosperity and our global competitiveness depend on our ability to encompass flexibility and to engage in this reform program. We have had to weather some very vocal opposition from the union movement right across Australia throughout the last 12 months as a prelude to this debate. The government's measures introduced in parliament yesterday and debated today really began back in 1993. Members of the opposition do not like us reminding them of the fact that the debate took place in 1993. The previous speaker, the member for Prospect, lauded the Labor Party for having introduced the changes in 1993-changes that the current Prime Minister, John Howard, could not introduce when he was Treasurer. What the member for Prospect failed to disclose was that those changes in 1993 took place with the support of the then opposition: the Liberal and National parties. We are going through an evolutionary process. This is not a revolution, and this is not extreme. One thing about the Labor Party is that they have been consistent throughout the last 10 years: they make an allegation, they use very inflammatory language and they repeat that language over and over again in the hope that people will believe it as a point of fact that all of a when it is not. Paul Keating introduced changes in 1993. The Howard government introduced further changes in 1996. A third wave of reform is now taking place. It is reform that is much needed by the Australian community. Let us remember what Labor's much lauded Prime Minister had to say back in 1993. The Labor Party do not like this being thrown back at them, but let us go through it. Mr Keating said: Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards with fewer clauses. We need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreement from being add-ons to awards to being full substitutes for awards. The statement by Paul Keating that we need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-on to awards to being full substitutes for awards is precisely where we are today with this third stage of reforms. We are seeking to make agreements full substitutes for the choking, award based system. Awards will still remain. They will remain in place; they are certainly not being abolished. We supported those changes back then. The then Prime Minister wanted to go further, but he was stymied by the union movement. He did not have the guts to stand up to the union movement and go further. This government has no such qualms. We are introducing reforms that are good for the economy, good for business and good for employees. Unlike the Labor Party, we will not be beholden to the interests of the union movement, whose membership is so much in decline-now at a miserable level of 17 per cent of the private sector. The great irony of this debate is that we supported Labor but they refuse to support us at this time. Interestingly, during the last eral election the ALP did try to feed off some of Hawke and Keating's so-called economic legacies. Here is a perfect opportunity for the Labor Party to grab some credibility in the workplace reforms debate, but they are backing down under the strong instructions and pressure that has been exerted upon them by the union movement. The debate about these vital reforms has demonstrated where the centre of workplace relations vision lies in Australia. On the one hand the government recognises that further reform is needed to ensure that our employment system is flexible enough to adapt to the needs of the 21st century. On the other hand the Australian Labor Party, which claims to be the party of progress and social justice in Australia, has demonstrated their inability to make a constructive contribution to such a vital issue and has instead resorted to fear tactics and inflammatory language. Only yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, claimed in an absurd contribution to the MPI that the divorce rates would go up as a result of our industrial relations reforms. He has claimed that kids would be dragged out of school and would not be able to have full education as a result of this industrial relations reform. This is the sort of inflammatory language that we heard in 1996. Since then, unemployment has dropped, the inflation level is at its lowest, interest rates have remained at low levels and there has been growth in full time employment in this country. There was doom and gloom back then and there is doom and gloom now. But, of course, the doom that they are talking about these days is even more absurd, with claims that the Family Court will be clogged with divorces next year and it will all be attributed to industrial relations reform. The real opposition to these reforms has fedcome from the trade union movement. The ACTU and others are running a political scare campaign. The ALP and the Leader of the Opposition are providing a vehicle for that campaign to the trade union movement, which is strongly in the hands of people such as Greg Combet and Sharan Burrow. While the two waves of reform in 1993 and 1996 have set the stage for the economic prosperity of the last 9½ years, there is more to be done. The Australian public expect the government to do more rather than to simply rest on its laurels. We do not have reform fatigue on this side. They may have reform fatigue on the other side, as espoused by their current leader, but certainly on this side we recognise that reform is necessary. There are others in the community who also recognise that reform is necessary. The Business Council of Australia has estimated that the government's 1996 reforms led to an additional income per person of $4,200 in 2004 and $80,000 in additional wealth per person. The University of Sydney's research concluded that the federal minimum wage increased from $349 in 1996 to $484 in 2005. While I am on that subject, members on the other side say that this government has opposed every wage claim in the Industrial Relations Commission and that it is only because of the union movement that there has been a wage increase of 14 per cent in this country. Certainly, that is not the full story. I will not say that it is deceitful, but it certainly ignores the fact that, to have a claim in the Industrial Relations Commission, a dispute is needed. What better way to have a dispute before the Industrial Relations Commission than to put in an absurd claim and have employer groups dispute it. That is the process that has been in place; but now, with the Australian Fair Pay Commission, it will no longer be in place. Members on the other side also say that we have not made out a case that these reforms are good for the economy. The case is there. I have cited the Business Council of Australia's figures and its comments about the changes that took place in 1996. Many other employer organisations over time have made similar claims. Only the other day, the IMF said: ... further reforms of industrial relations are needed to expand labour demand and facilitate productivity gains ... The OECD has said: Further unfinished business includes harmonisation of federal and state industrial relations and the streamlining of regulations which minimise the incidence of unlawful industrial action. Finally, the cost of dismissal procedures, including for employees who have been with firms for only a short period, is often cited by small businesses as a disincentive to hiring. Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank, has said: I think industrial relations reform is valuable it does contribute to higher economic growth ... And it needs to continue. This is being said by us and also by other groups. The community out there, within our borders and overseas, have all recognised that further industrial relations reform certainly is required, and we are going about that process. The people standing in our way are those on the other side, who are strongly controlled by their union masters. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 represents the implementation of the government's ongoing workplace relations reform agenda. Its very size is indicative of the obstructive attitude that the ALP has taken in blocking many of our reforms in the Senate. Australia's workplace relations system is still based largely on the archaic and antiquated industrial relations system from the time of Federation. But we are no longer a disparate collection of colonies, where conflict and disputation were the key pillars of the industrial relations system. In addition, back then, we did not have a strong welfare system in place and there was the need for an industrial relations commission to come down with deliberations, protections and award decisions. This country now has a very strong welfare system. It is a system that is certainly going to continue and that is very much supported by this government. Our modern workplace is set in the everglobalising international economy and much more still needs to be done. Only last week, I was in Ireland and I saw the economic revival that had taken place there. Countries like Ireland and those to our north in Asia certainly will leave us far behind unless we also modernise our workplace system. The Australian workplace relations system is still rigid with many inefficiencies. Employees and employers are still facing an overly complex and bureaucratic system of agreeand ment making. Across six different industrial relations systems, there are over 130 pieces of legislation and more than 4,000 awards. This is particularly taxing on small business, with many hundreds having to comply simultaneously with different awards and state and federal laws. This bill seeks to lessen the burden by drawing workplace relations into a single national system. To give an indication of the need for workplace relations reform, particularly for small business, last year I brought the Prime Minister out to my electorate to meet with local small business representatives; that meeting took place at the Whitehorse Business Council. At that time, those representatives raised many issues with the PM, ranging from taxation to trade and infrastructure. However, the issue that raised the greatest level of concern was the impact of draconian unfair dismissal laws on small business. The removal of this burden is critical in achieving the full benefits of a strong economy flowing on to the employment sector-and this also has been cited by the OECD in its comments. A comment often made by those on the other side is that we are taking the industrial relations system to a level akin to that in the United States and we are wiping away all protections. Let us have a look at some of the other countries. Members opposite carp on about these reforms being an extreme attack on workers' rights; that is an absurdity. One would think that it is all doom and gloom and the sky is about to fall. One would think that we are going to see divorce rates go up and kids being taken out of school, as stated by the member for Brand! The ALP and the trade union movement conveniently neglect to inform the public that, even after the implementation of these reforms, Australia will still have a comparatively highly regulated system of workplace relations. For example, we will still have more regulation in place than the United Kingdom and New Zealand, which are presided over by Labour Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Helen Clark, respectively. The industrial relations system in New Zealand is largely predicated on workplace agreements and there is no scope for awards. Much of the deregulation that took place in New Zealand occurred in the 1990s, under the former National Party government. Its 1991 Employment Contracts Act was a broad, sweeping reform in which awards were abolished and all conditions of employment were made negotiable and subject only to minimum statutory entitlements, including leave entitlements and a minimum wage. This act affords no formal recognition of trade unions in the bargaining process, although employment contracts can be collective as well as individual. Despite pledging to roll back many of the 1991 reforms, Labour Prime Minister Helen Clark has retained many of the necessary reforms-and rightly so. In the five years to 1996, employment growth in New Zealand was the highest in the OECD; unemployment fell by 11 per cent; and, by December 2004, unemployment stood at 3.6 per cent. Broadly speaking, even after Helen Clark's partial reregulation, a small list of minimum entitlements still remains. I will make my comments about the United Kingdom when I resume my remarks after question time. Certainly, there we have a Labour Prime Minister who has also deregulated his country's industrial relations system and has accepted the reforms that took place under his predecessor. If only we had a Labor opposition in this country that was similar to Labour in the UK and in New Zealand.",86

58,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today the New South Wales Premier, Mr Iemma, announced that New South Wales would mount a High Court challenge to the workplace relations legislation. Naturally, that was enthusiastically endorsed by the union movement. This morning on the radio in Sydney, the Secretary of Unions New South Wales, John Robertson, said, ‘Our legal advisers, who include former Justice of the Supreme Court, Jeff Shaw, are telling us that there are good grounds for a High Court challenge to these laws.' I was interested in the comment and the reference to Mr Shaw. Mr Shaw has had a long standing interest in a national workplace relations system. Indeed, in the past he has expressed some strong views on the subject. In 2000 Mr Shaw delivered a paper to a Business Council of Australia seminar on a national workplace relations system. He said: … the corporations power has been liberally interpreted by the High Court and can sustain legislation designed to regulate the employment relationships between a corporation and its workforce … It seems that Mr Shaw had no problem with the constitutional validity of a national system in 2000. But, more importantly, this is what Mr Shaw went on to say: … Industry and commerce increasingly crosses historically determined state boundaries. The wages and conditions of employees are relevant to national economic considerations and it will often be convenient for both employers and unions to have uniform national conditions. So Mr Shaw not only had no problem with the constitutional validity of a national workplace relations system but, more importantly, was saying in 2000 that there are substantial and significant economic benefits to Australia. That is what Mr Shaw was saying in 2000. This is important and significant because it is those national economic benefits that underpin the Work Choices legislation. This talk about constitutional challenges and all the talk coming from the Labor Party and the union movement is nothing other than a political stunt. They know-and even the adviser they refer to knows-that this is a constitutionally valid way for legislation to be enacted by the Commonwealth. The member for Perth himself conceded as much on the Sunday Sunrise program on 20 February this year when he said, about a national workplace relations system: It's not a novel policy idea, and you can contemplate a whole range of efficiencies that would occur in the economy and in the system if that were to take place. ‘It's not a novel idea. You can contemplate economic benefit for Australia and for the working men and women of Australia and their families'-that is what the member for Perth conceded in February of this year. The reality is that these changes are good for Australia and they are good for the working men and women of this country. Workplace Relations",90

Isn't it the case that section 88B(2) of the current law requires the industrial umpire to have regard to fair minimum standards for employees when setting the wage safety net-fair minimum standards? Prime Minister, yesterday in question time, didn't you deny that you are ripping away the protection which ensures the minimum wage must be fair?

102,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This was precisely the same scare campaign that the Leader of the Opposition used when he opposed economic reform in relation to the GST. In relation to the GST he said that it was ‘a cloud hanging over the people of Australia-a cloud that will become a deluge and wash away the conditions of many Australian families'.

Workplace Relations",94
113,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Leader of the House. Has the minister observed the TV record covering the early proceedings in the chamber yesterday? Does the TV coverage provide any evidence as to why copies of the workplace relations bill were not in the usual place when the member for Perth raised a point of order related to the availability of such documents? Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is no element of that question that comes within the ministerial responsibility of the minister to whom it is directed. It is a backdoor way of questioning the answer which you gave to the member for O'Connor yesterday, and on both grounds he is out of order.",94

Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, the question having been reiterated, let me add to my point of order. The Leader of the House is responsible for the government's business in this place. You are responsible for the parliamentary proceedings in this place to the extent that there is accountability to this chamber.

The display and distribution of them in this House is a matter for you and your officers. That is the first point. The second point is that this matter has already been raised as a matter of dispute in this place and you have ruled on it. It would be perfectly legitimate at the end of question time for Mr Tuckey to stand up in this place and ask you a question about whether or not you had observed proceedings in the House and whether you had satisfied yourself about certain matters. But this bunch here are traducing the forms of this House all the time, and for them to be allowed to get away with a question like this would fatally undermine your authority.

Perhaps to the chagrin of the people on this side of the House, not only did you make a determination from the chair but the House determined in support of your determination. The inference of the question to the Leader of the House is clearly to revisit the substance of that motion and the substance of the events yesterday that have been determined by the House. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on the point of order. The standing orders relevant to the question that has been asked are standing orders 98 and 100.

127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note the views of the member for Denison, but I do not think they are related directly to the question. The tion is directed to the minister. He has not been asked a question on this before; therefore, the question stands. I call the Leader the House. Mr Wilkie- Mr Speaker, further to the point of order that was raised, I refer you to page 52 of yesterday's Hansard. When the member for O'Connor raised this matter you said, ‘I do not intend to revisit it.' words, you had ruled on this matter. You said that it did not have any relevance and that you would not revisit it-and here we are with the member for O'Connor trying to revisit the same matter.",96
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Member for Swan, I have listened carefully, and this question is being directed to a minister and not to the Speaker, and therefore I have ruled it in order. Mr Bowen- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Can I draw your attention to page 63 of House of Representatives Practice, which makes it clear that the office of Leader of the House is a position created without legislation and without a formal decision of the House, and it is therefore an informal position. I also draw your attention to standing order 98, which makes it clear that questions can only be addressed to ministers. The position of Leader of the House is not a ministry.

Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I am obviously of the view that the question is clearly out of order, but, if you are going to allow the Leader of the House to answer, in the course of his answer he made a grossly unparliamentary remark when referring to, I think, the member for Perth.

The footage shows that shortly after nine o'clock yesterday morning, during a division on a suspension motion, the member for Perth approached the ministerial table. He took copies of the workplace relations bill, handed them to an adviser and then the adviser exited the chamber. There is nothing wrong with that, you might think. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I raise two points of order on this matter. Firstly, if the Leader of the House has an allegation against the member for Perth, then he ought to be putting that by way of a substantive motion. Secondly, anybody could tell you that the Leader of the House is about to engage in an act of gross disorder by holding up a photograph.

163,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to proposed section 104(6) of the government's extreme industrial relations legislation, which says: … an employer does not apply duress to an employee … merely because the employer requires the employee to make an AWA ... as a condition of employment. Prime Minister, doesn't the ordinary meaning of ‘duress' include ‘coerce', ‘compel', ‘force', ‘threaten', ‘intimidate', ‘menace' and ‘bully'? Prime Minister, don't your laws enable employers to do all these things to force employees onto unfair AWAs?",98
164,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the situation, through a combination of the continuing provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and the amendments, is as follows: as has been the case since 1996, an employer is entitled to say to a new employee, ‘As a condition of your employment, you must sign an AWA.' That has been the law since 1996. It remains the case that it is unlawful a lie, to terminate somebody's employment because they refuse to sign an AWA. That is the situation; it is not as represented by the member for Perth. Zimbabwe",98
165,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the situation in Zimbabwe?,98
166,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I know how concerned she and a lot of her constituents-and people in Western Australia generally-are about the situation in Zimbabwe. The government continues to be appalled by the egregious breaches of human rights perpetrated by President Mugabe's regime. As a result of his mismanagement and negligence, over four million people in Zimbabwe require food aid urgently. Rather tragically, the regime of President Mugabe has this week confirmed that it has rejected a proposal of the United Nations to provide $US30 million worth of aid to provide temporary shelter, blankets and food for victims of what is called ‘operation clean-up', in which the Mugabe regime bulldozed the homes of thousands of people. This simply disgraceful action by the Mugabe regime is symptomatic of the performance of his government over a very long period of time. The seizure of farms has been legitimised by recent constitutional changes which prohibit court challenges and prevent critics from travelling abroad. The fact is that, in the short term, there is little chance of the situation improvPrime ing. I noticed in today's media that the deputy minister for agriculture in Zimbabwe has admitted that the country has run out food because land had been given to people with, as he put it, ‘no passion for farming'. Land has been stripped from professional farmers of all different colours and races. Much of it has been handed to cronies of President Mugabe who have no interest in or knowledge of farming. This, of course, has now been exposed by the honest statement of the deputy minister for agriculture. The Australian government, along with other governments-and I particularly mention the New Zealand government; the former New Zealand Foreign Minister, Phil Goff, and I talked a lot about this-will continue to do what we can to pressure the international community to take further action against Zimbabwe. We will pressure countries like South Africa to be more robust in standing up to President Mugabe. We will pressure members of the Security Council to consider a referral of President Mugabe's regime to the International Criminal Court. Indeed, bearing in mind Zimbabwe's economic performance and the ravages that President Mugabe has brought to the economy and livelihoods of his people, I would like to see Zimbabwe expelled from the International Monetary Fund. I know that the member for Pearce will be pleased that we will vigorously continue to stand up to the regime of President Mugabe. Workplace Relations",98
167,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, where in the government's 1996, 1998, 2001 or 2004 election commitments was the proposal to abolish unfair dismissal rights for the nearly four million employees in companies of up to 100 employees? Is it not the case, Minister, that this unfair proposal only emerged after the government realised it had total control of the Senate?",99

Can I say to the member for Throsby, at my recollection of the last document, there was no reference made in either the 2004 policy or the 1996 policy to a particular number. In other words, both in 1996 and 2004 there was a reference to getting rid of them altogether. Private Health Insurance",99
172,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister update the House on the government's strong support for private health insurance? Is the government aware of any threats to this essential part of our health system?,99
173,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the member for Makin for her question. I appreciate her strong support for measures such as the private health insurance rebate, which the Howard government put in place and which has helped to rescue private health insurance from the oblivion into which it was sinking thanks to the policies of the former government. This government obviously does support that rebate, but I have to say I am not so confident about all members in this parliament. I was reading a very interesting book over the sitting break. I found some quite interesting words in that book, and I am going to quote them to the House: ‘I like Gillard because she has a go-feisty, irreverent, good sense of humour, the closest thing we have to charisma in the caucus.' Mr Speaker, you can understand why Mr Latham said that when you look at the front bench. Ms Gillard-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker: I am always happy to get a compliment from the minister for health-and they are quite rare, I would have to say-but the question was about private health insurance.",99
174,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will come to the question.,100
175,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This very interesting book contains a lot of information about the attitude of members opposite to private health insurance. As the member for Lalor said when extracts from this book first came out, the author of it, Mr Latham, was ‘a thinker', ‘a formidable parliamentarian' and ‘a moving advocate'. It was quite a mutual admiration society. And she said that this book is a ‘very truthful book'. This truthful book says",100

The minister's answer has already been drawn to your attention. You allowed him to continue on about subjects not directly linked to health. He has ignored any restraint and continues on. Is he going to answer the question about private health insurance?,100
177,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I think he heard just prior to my giving him the call, I have asked the minister to come back to question.",100
178,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The book says on the subject of health and the private health insurPerth ance rebate that Medicare Gold was ‘my plan for killing the private health insurance rebate'. This truthful book went on: ‘It required a lot of work to model the private insurance implications and to secure the cooperation of the states, all handled by Gillard.' So this very truthful book, which praises to the skies the member for Lalor, also reveals her participation in the giant Labor conspiracy to get rid of the private health insurance rebate. The member for Lalor said on the day the book first started to appear, ‘I suspect that the truths in the book will be ignored.' I can assure the member for Lalor I will not ignore the truths in the book, and those truths will come back to haunt her from now until polling day.

179,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not the case that pages 355 and 359 of the bill allow employees in workplaces of more than 100 to be unfairly dismissed without remedy for so-called ‘operational reasons'? Is it not the case that ‘operational reasons' is so broadly defined it justifies an employee's dismissal for almost any reason? Prime Minister, does this now mean that unfair dismissal rights have effectively been abolished for all employees? Mr Abbott-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I distinctly heard the member for Batman make a reference to belting women directed toward someone on this side of the House. It is a highly offensive reference and it should be withdrawn.",100

189,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The member for Fowler will remove herself understanding order 94(a). The member for Fowler then left the chamber.,101
190,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the proposed changes, an employee will be able to challenge in the Industrial Relations Commission the employer's claim that the termination was for a genuine operational reason. The commission would then make an assessment on the termination. This means that an employee would be able to make an unfair dismissal claim if the commission found that the employee's dismissal was not on the basis of genuine operational reasons. The mere assertion by an employer that a termination was for operational reasons will not be sufficient. In addition, when terminating for operational reasons, because the employer no longer requires the job to be done, they must of course give the required period of notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice as prescribed by the legislation. All employees will continue to be able to access unlawful determination provisions, regardless of the size of their employer's business. This means that an employee would be able to seek redress if they were terminated for a prohibited reason, including discriminatory reasons such as race or age. When making a claim for an unlawful termination, the burden of proving that the termination was not for a prohibited reason falls on the employer. Under Work Choices, redundancy pay in cases of genuine redundancy will continue to be in awards. Provisions on redundancy pay and agreements will also continue to apply. Redundancy pay will remain a matter that can be included in an agreement. It stands to reason that, in any fair industrial relations system, redundancy for a bona fide operational reason cannot be regarded as an unfair dismissal, and these changes are not going to alter that.

191,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the government's reaction to the Mehlis report into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr Rafik Hariri?",102
192,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question and his interest. As the House will know, the government was appalled by and condemned completely the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri of Lebanon in Beirut in February. It was a car bombing that killed 22 other people at the same time. As members know, as a result of international pressure and in a growing environment for democracy in the Middle East, Lebanon was blessed not only with free elections in May-June but also with the withdrawal of Syrian forces in April. So some good came out of a terrible thing. On 21 October, the United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission led by Detlev Mehlis, a German lawyer, submitted its report on the assassination to the UN Security Council. The investigation found: Given the infiltration of Lebanese institutions and society by the Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services working in tandem, it would be difficult to envisage a scenario whereby such a complex assassination plot could have been carried out without their knowledge. On 31 October, the UN Security Council unanimously passed resolution 1636, calling on Syria to cooperate fully in continuing investigations to clarify unresolved questions. For the record, Australia very strongly supports that resolution. It is essential that the perpetrators of this vile act of terrorism be brought to justice. The resolution sets up a United Nations committee to list individuals designated by the UN commission or by the Lebanese government as being involved in this act of terrorism, and all states will be obliged to prevent their travel and to freeze their funds. The Australian Federal Police assisted the Lebanese authorities in the early days of this investigation, and anyone in Australia with any relevant information should certainly share it with the Australian Federal Police. Can I say in conclusion, and I know the honourable member for Kooyong will agree with this, I completely condemn the outrageous performance by the Syrian foreign minister at the United Nations Security Council where he made what I thought was a grotesque and insensitive comparison between Syria's relationship to the Hariri assassination and the British government's to the 7 July bombings. I thought Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary and a good friend of this country, responded with great dignity and effectiveness. It is time for Syria to stop all equivocations and for it to recognise that it constitutes a real danger to peace in the region and that its support for terrorism is completely unacceptable. As for the democracy that is now flourishing in both Iraq and Lebanon, on either side of Syria, those democracies will not be intimidated. Workplace Relations",102
193,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it relates to the one that he just answered from this side of the House. I refer him to comments made by the Treasurer in the industry newsletter AB News in August: You could have an exemption for everyone. He said there is no ‘magic' in the 100 limit. And: It shouldthat being the removal of unfair dismissal lawsbe extended to all companies. Prime Minister, isn't the case that, despite the technicality you tried to hide behind by constant reference to unlawful dismissals, the Treasurer has basically got his way in practice: abolishing unfair dismissal rights for all employees?",102

195,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister update the House on the government's plan to directly assist Australian schools with their capital works projects?",103
196,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for his question and his very strong support for public education. The Prime Minister announced during the 2004 election that a re-elected Howard coalition government would invest an additional $1 billion over the next four years in Australia's government and non-government school infrastructure. Seven hundred million dollars of that would be specifically for government state schools across the country but, unlike with the usual clipboard carriers that turn up from education departments, this money would actually go specifically to the projects developed by parent communities, P&Cs and school councils and signed off by school principals. I am very pleased to inform the House that the first $105 million of projects in the first calendar year of this program have been announced. Those round 1 projects are now rolling out around the country. The member for Bonner has worked very hard to get money for the Wondall Heights State School in his electorate. It is very intersacrifice. esting, when you read in part the application by the parents from Wondall Heights State School, that it gives you an idea of how state governments are neglecting public education. The parents were after $15,200. They said: Existing toilets have been in use since school opened and have become very run down. The toilets are smelly, urinals are rusted, pipes need replacing, flooring in disrepair. They said children will not use them because they smell. Similarly in the state of Queensland, at the Upper Barron State School in the electorate of Kennedy the parents had to fill in an application to us that said, ‘We wish to replace existing broken desks and chairs and equipment.' The member for Lindsay, for example, has contacted the Glenbrook Public School in her electorate to inform them that they will receive $22,000 to replace carpet which is 20 years old. Now we have 2,600 government schools that have been funded for 4,000 projects of this nature this year-that is $105 million. There are another 6½ thousand schools that have applied; they are on the government's help list. So this government has a help list; we have a list of schools that we want to help. It will extend to more than 8½ thousand schools. We have members who ring schools and inform them, for example, that they have got $45,000 at Bermagui for play equipment. In the Labor Party world, if the Leader of the Opposition wins the next federal election, on the first day after his election the member for Jagajaga will ring the Ivanhoe Girls Grammar School in her electorate and say, ‘Jenny here; I am the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia'-a scary thought-and then she will say, ‘I'm ringing to tell you we're cutting your money.' This government believes in helping Australian schools and their parents; the Labor Party believes in hit lists and punishing parental Skilled Migration",103
197,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I refer to the minister's answer of Tuesday where the minister referred to the new visa for imported apprentices. Does the minister understand, despite his answer, that new apprentices from overseas are not skilled migrants but are coming here to take up these places to acquire skills? Minister, isn't it true that if an imported apprentice refuses an AWA they will miss out on the job, the apprenticeship and the visa? Given the abolition of the no disadvantage test, how will our young Australians compete for apprenticeships, given imported apprentices will accept any wages to get the visa? You are driving wages down-and you know it.",103
198,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! In calling the minister, he will ignore the last part of that question.",104
199,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Despite the government's best efforts at encouraging higher participation by apprentices-and that includes lifting the living away from home allowance, giving an allowance for tool kits and other inducements-country Australia is where the highest shortage of skill levels and apprenticeships exists. There are many instances of employers and contractors who have had to put contracts on hold and put on hold their expansion ideas. The government has put together this visa with a great deal consideration. This visa will not-I repeat: will not-disadvantage any young Australian wishing to become an apprentice. This visa will not disadvantage any young Australian wishing to become an apprentice in country Australia. Employers are bound and have to make every attempt to get an apprenticeship locally-in fact, they have to prove that they are unable to get an apprentice locally. That means also that local bodies, like councils, have to agree that they are unable to access an apprentice locally before they are able to get an apprentice from overseas to fill the position. Mr Burke-That's wrong; you're misleading the parliament.",104
200,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Watson has asked his question.,104
201,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would be a wonderful thing if apprenticeship vacancies in country Australia were side by side with people wanting to fill those positions. But the reality is that, with Australia's record low unemployment, it is simply not the position. I must repeat that no employer will be able to disadvantage any young Australian or Australian permanent resident who wishes to have an apprenticeship in country Australia. This government sees no reason why the prosperity of country Australia should be disadvantaged because the union movement runs the Labor Party. Airport Security",104
202,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House of continuing activities the government has in place to increase security at Australia's regional airports?,104
203,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to inform the House that the federal government has announced another round of funding to support of the upgrade of regional airports and to improve their security, including $292,000 for the Ceduna airport in the electorate of Grey. The honourable member for Grey takes a particular interest in aviation issues, especially the challenging situation to provide air services in his electorate at the present time. He has been very effective in representing the needs of that area. But there are another 10 airports that have been included in this round of funding under the program totalling $2.3 million. I was pleased to be in Cooktown in the honourable member for Leichhardt's electorate last week where the Cooktown and Coen airports have been included in this round of the program. Indeed, we now have 52 airports around Australia in regional areas that have participated in this upgrading program which is providing some basic security measures such as fencing, lighting, CCTV and the like. It helps to make a difference in ensuring that our regional airports are secure. I have listened quite a bit to the Leader of the Opposition complaining that this government has done nothing about airport security or that we have neglected it-‘sitting on our hands' I think were the exact words that he used. It may be of interest to the House to note that this government has committed close to $500 million to airport security activities and to upgrade the security in aviation around Australia. I went back and looked at the Labor Party's election promise in 2004 about what they would do in relation to airport security. There were lots of pictures on the front of the former Leader of the OppositionMr Bowen- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Grey did not ask about alternative policies. I ask you to bring the minister back to the question.",104

I refer to the $300 million the government allowed to be funnelled to Saddam Hussein-$300 million that the regime could use to buy guns, bombs and bullets now in the possession of the insurgency. Has the minister read the Jordanian trucking company's statement today that the Wheat Board contract ‘was not with us, it was between Iraq and the AWB', that ‘None of our company's trucks ever transported any Australian wheat' and that ‘We just collected the fee for Iraq'? Minister, why did your government in November 2000 give an unqualified green light to the Wheat Board to pay money to Jordanian trucking companies when fully 49 months before that the United Nations had directly and formally raised with your government concerns about the legality of the Wheat Board's dealings with Iraq?",105
207,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, the premise of the question is manifestly not only wrong but utterly untrue.

Our officials, as I understand it, spoke to the Wheat Board.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",108
243,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The industrial relations debate is now well under way and substantial contributions are being made by members on this side of the House in exposing the unfairness of this legislation. It is an iterative unfairness, as one clause relates to another basically to deprive ordinary Australians of their standing in the Australian workplace, making it easy to crush their wages and conditions and leaving them cowered in the workplace. Particularly in a period of time when there is any form of economic softening or downturn, many will then find themselves in a situation where they will not be able to sustain their mortgages and will not be able to sustain those things that make them happy in life, especially the relationships that they have with their families, so essentially served by decent hours of workand decent holidays-and a capacity to have those hours reflect the fact that there is time for children and time for spouses. We have been demonstrating that amply and clearly over the course of the last part of this day. I am going to focus a little later in these remarks on what has been discovered, to the surprise of many, about the character of the unfair dismissal laws, which of course lie at the basis of the capacity of the worker to be intimidated by the employer in any bargaining that takes place with regard to AWAs and-it has to be said-in any general conduct in the workplace. I am going to concentrate on that somewhat. But what I want to concentrate on before I do that is going to the heart of what seems to be the ‘answer' being offered to our side of the House by our political opponents as to why they do the things they do. Their election campaign is a cloud of deceit. The campaign around their advertising is a cloud of deceit-a pretence that there is protection going on of workers' rights. But in the end they know in their heart of hearts that is not true, so they go to the last trench. last trench and the last ditch in every one of the contributions I have heard so far is that somehow or other what is being done here is essential for the Australian economy. I want to nail that in five quick minutes here before I get on to the unfair dismissal issues. The simple fact of the matter is this: to improve the productivity of the work force, the Reserve Bank, the OECD and all economic commentators have had the following to say about our slowing rate of labour productivity growth. They have said it is a matter of skills-the skilling of the Australian work force. The finger is firmly pointed at the fective collapse of the resourcing of skills training which has occurred in our schools, TAFEs and universities over the last decade-not simply by the Labor Party but by all those relevant bodies that commentate on the Australian economy. The second thing which is pointed to by those who analyse our economy is the absence of decent central direction and central leadership of the development of Australia's infrastructure and, in particular, the removal of bottlenecks to exports. That has also drawn the attention of everybody who analyses the character of the Australian economy. The third thing that is raised is innovation, particularly business investment in research and development. Until very recently, most of the massive burgeoning of the foreign debt of this country-which in itself places pressure on interest rates and our international competitiveness-went into borrowings for consumption here and not for business investment in research and development, which absolutely collapsed when this government came to office. These commentators also point in particular to the fact that we have a very substantial burden that arrives on judgments about our economy because of our balance of payments. Finally, there is a discussion of the export performThe ance, particularly the export performance related to value-added production in manufacturing and new services. When the Labor Party were in office those exports were growing at a rate of 10 to 15 per cent per annum under very effective industry plans to encourage Australian businesses to go down the road of world's best practice. We added one thing to this when we were in office-there was also a much better picture on all these fronts when we were there, which produced the substantial growth in labour productivity in our economy through the late nineties and into the early ef- part of this century-and that was the changes we made to the industrial relations system, which were not related to the exercise of negotiation of individual contracts by businesses in this country but were related to the possibility of enterprise bargaining. This means collective agreements arrived at at the level of the firm or the enterprise and where every few years employers and employees sat down and bargained productivity based wage rises. It is precisely those productivity based wage rises that have produced the relatively good figures on real wage increases over the course of the last decade. But the truth of the matter is that all that fell in a hole a couple of years ago. The government's answer is not to go down the road of improving the skills of our work force to improve our performance and our international competitiveness. It is not to deal with our infrastructure problems or to deal with problems of innovation. It is not to deal with its shocking export performance, when despite the best terms of trade this nation has ever had we have the worse export performance since World War II. No, it does not go to deal with that. The Prime Minister comes into this place and tries to bamboozle the Australian public with this statement: ‘The only thing we can do to compete with India and China is to suppress our wage rates so that we come down somewhere near where they are. We hope to meet them on the way up, coming down. We race to the bottom and they race to the top and at some point we will intersecthopefully with a basic capacity to sustain the necessary calories for daily life. But, apart from that, we are not interested in anything else.' This is an absolutely monstrous deceit, and the Australian public are getting sick of this tricky Prime Minister and his tricky Treasurer. They are getting alive to this tricky Prime Minister and this tricky Treasurer, even to the point of disbelieving them on occasions when perhaps they ought to be believed. But I do not talk about that in the context of anything related to the industrial relations act, as they ought not to be believed about anything there. You saw the example of that trickiness in question time when the Prime Minister, with a smirk, got up today. He was asked a question by the member for Throsby-a former President of the ACTU, and we are very pleased to have her within our ranks. Indeed, she was the first woman to be President of the ACTU and is a great servant of the needs of ordinary people in this country. She asked the Prime Minister-going through each of his election manifestos-in which of them did he talk about making it easy to sack people or removing unfair dismissal laws from employers of a particular number of employees in a firm. At what point did the Prime Minister, in his election campaign propaganda, say that the size of the firm that would determine the application of the removal of that unfair dismissal law was 100 employees? He got up in this chamber and said, ‘If you look really hard at what we had to say in our manifesto, we didn't actually put any number there.' And he smiled, with that little smirk: ‘Ha, ha, tricked you! Ha, ha, we tricked the Australian people again-whacko, we got ‘em!' ‘We might have moved 30 times in the House, in the run-up to the election, in relation to a bill which put the limit at 20 employees. We might have done that, but we did not put it in the fine line in our election propaganda'-it is all very tricky! It was the ‘kids overboard' in the previous election and this time it was the ‘employees overboard', by sleight of hand, as far as this government was concerned. It is important to focus on this issue, and I conclude on one point. What this is all leading to is a set of work practices and relationships in our industry which will do major damage to the Australian economy. How do we know that it will do major damage to the Australian economy? Because we have the comparative basis of the New Zealand legislation from 1991 that the government is so fond of quoting and the changes that the Hawke-Keating governments put in place. We addressed the productivity issue on the basis of collective agreements, organised on the basis of the firm. In New Zealand, they eliminated collective agreements, awards and the like and reduced everything to individual contracts. Until that point in time, the rate of productivity growth in the work force in New Zealand and Australia had been exactly the same for 15 years. We have a decade's comparison on the period since then, and the rate of productivity growth in the Australian work force has been twice that in New Zealand. New Zealand, in addressing the problems that emerged in their economy, went back to look at their acts-and the Clark government has changed the basis of these acts, having seen the appalling performance, in terms of productivity in the work force, that the road the previous government chose to go down managed to produce. This government will poleaxe the Australian economy with what it proposes here, not enhance the Australian economy. It will effectively eliminate from firms that process by which workers and employers sit down collectively and talk through the productivity needs of a firm, and it will replace it by a race to the bottom by employers around this country, as they compete to see how much they can deprive their individual workers on an individual basis of what it is that they have. At the heart of all of that lies the unfair dismissal laws-the capacity to make it easy to sack somebody. The deceit that we have seen in the advertising campaign was repeated by the Prime Minister here today. On reading the papers, from the comments from various legal experts, we discovered that the 100-employee figure probably does not mean much, either, and that in fact you can do things artificially in a way that means that people employed in every type of firm can effectively be subject to unfair dismissal laws. We discovered that as a result of those very careful pieces of analyses. In his answer, the Prime Minister went back to the same mechanism that the government have used in their advertising campaign to answer the ACTU's ‘funded by the workers' advertising campaign-to answer the union's proposition that your rights against being unfairly dismissed are no longer protected by law-and that is to the very difficult to prove unlawful dismissal process. This requires proving in a court an issue of discrimination on ethnic, racial or whatever grounds. That being protected by law is the cover-all for a massive change on the unfair dismissal front. The Prime Minister retreated to that today by instantly going off an argument based on unfair dismissals for operational purposes to unlawful dismissals for discrimination purposes. It is a complex point but with a simple outcome, and the simple outcome is: everybody is now easy to sack. It is essential to make everybody easy to sack because, unless they are easy to sack, they are likely to seek protection from a union or may even stand you up in an AWA inquiry. I thought one of the quotes from a lawyer from Blake Dawson Waldron-one of the 11 companies that was set down to draft this legislation-was terribly interesting. I will conclude with this quote, in which she said: The legislation appeared to allow employers with existing certified agreements to offer AWAs that overrode existing employment arrangements. The legislation is making it as easy as possible for employers to directly set the terms and conditions of employment. It is a deceit that the Prime Minister went on with about redundancy payments or whatever. Redundancy payments can go from your individual agreements, and ‘operational' means that the boss can sack you if he has found somebody who will work for a few bucks less. It is all right to sack you operationally because it is getting near Christmas or it is after Christmas and the business is quiet. It is all right to sack you because you would not go out and buy your boss's lunch operationally. It is all right to sack you because the boss does not like your attitude operationally, and it is all right to sack you because the boss just does not like you. (Time expired)",108
244,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.38 pm)-There is no greater irony than when we see the previous speaker in this debate-the man who was part of a government that drove one million Australians into unemployment-come here and talk about the threat to the employment security of Australians. This is the man who was part of a government whose economic record included the reduction of real wages for ordinary men and women working in Australia-and he walks out of the chamber, of course. He does not want to hear his record repeated to him: the reduction in the real wages of the ordinary working men and women of Australia. That is what the Leader of the Opposition was partly responsible for when he was a senior minister in the Hawke and the Keating governments. Not only that, when he talks about employment security, that was a government that brought about the ‘recession we had to have'-to use the infamous words of the former Prime Minister, Mr KEATING - and, in doing so, drove into unemployment one million Australians. That is the record that ought to be brought back to the Leader of the Opposition when he has the gall to talk today, as he did, about the threat to the employment security of working Australians. The reality is that the only person who has been in government in this chamber who has had something to do in historic terms with driving down the economic security and the employment security of Australians is the Leader of the Opposition when he was a senior minister in the Hawke and the Keating governments. What gall! The reality is the record of this government, in the face of tooth-and-nail opposition day after day in this parliament for the last 9½ years, which has brought about a situation in which we have seen the creation of 1.7 million jobs-a fact. Look at the Australian Bureau of Statistics in relation to the creation of jobs in Australia. It is a fact out by the national accounts. As the Treasurer said today, we have seen a 15 per cent increase in real wages for the working men and women of Australia. That compares with a miserly 1.2 per cent increase in real wages under the 13 years in which the Labor Party was in government-and the Leader of the Opposition talks today about economic and employment security for Australians. His track record is abysmal, and he cannot come in here and lecture us about the economic and employment security of Australians when we are the government that have actually seen the creation of those jobs and, through good economic management, have seen an increase in real wages of some 15 per cent over the last 9½ years in Australia. The reality about this campaign from the opposition this week is, as we said at the outset, that it has been a hysterical campaign in which we have seen increasing desperation on the part of the opposition-highlighted by some of the antics that we saw in question time today with I think nearly two dozen, at last count, Labor members being thrown out of this House for the disorderly conduct which they were engaging in. This is a desperate measure by the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party. We see this hysterical campaign highlighted by grubby little antics-by the member for Perth removing copies of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 from the table yesterday, giving them to people to take out of the parliament and then complaining and making a point of order that copies of the bill were not here. He was caught out on that. He knows it. Even his explanation today gave it away when he said, ‘There weren't 60 copies.' What was pointed about that, and what he did not say, was how many copies he actually removed. He knows that he removed copies, yet we had this grubby little antic yesterday. This shows once again the borne desperation that the opposition has engaged in and the hysterical sort of campaign that we have had from the Leader of the Opposition and others in relation to these particular measures. Let us turn to the detail of some of the things which the Leader of the Opposition has been raising. Even in terms of the detail, he is wrong. Yesterday afternoon, within hours of the Work Choices bill being tabled, he had to retract. The Leader of the Opposition was out saying that, if a worker spoke about or disclosed to somebody else the fact that they were on an Australian workplace agreement, there was a penalty that would apply to them under the legislation of up to six months imprisonment. He was wrong. He had to come out yesterday afternoon and concede, on the first point he raised in relation to detail of this legislation, that he wrong. We see continued misrepresentation of the legislation today by the Leader of the Opposition. For example, we had this point about the question of whether somebody has to take an AWA as a condition of employment. In parliament the member for Perth, Mr Smith, said, ‘Either you take the AWA as a condition of employment or you do not get or keep your job.' That is totally wrong. There is no amendment to section 170CK(2)(g), if the member for Perth would like to look at it. The act makes it clear an existing employee cannot be forced-it is unlawful to force an existing employee to take an Australian workplace agreementyet speaker after speaker from the Labor Party in the debate in this House has been making that wrong point about the legislation. That is two things that they are wrong on. Today we had this question about dismissal for operational reasons. There are in the existing law provisions that a person can be made redundant for what are generally known as operational reasons, and that has been replicated in this legislation. But let just put forward the contention that in effect has been advanced by the opposition. They are saying that you could be made redundant for genuine reasons-as you can be now, as you will be in the future-and you can get a redundancy payout under your award or under the agreement under which that redundancy provision is. Yet the opposition are contending that, further to that, a worker should be able to double-dip in the system and also claim further compensation for an unfair dismissal. That is what this amounts to. The moral of this is that the opposition is saying that a worker can get their proper entitlements under redundancy provisions but then come back and double-dip from the emwas ployer by being paid out under unfair dismissals as well. That is the reality of the contention which is being advanced by the opposition in relation to this. I believe-as the government believes-that ordinary Australian workers would say that if you are entitled to redundancy payouts and redundancy provisions then that is fair; that is appropriate. But beyond that you should not have the right to come back and say, ‘I should get an unfair dismissal on top of that,' effectively double-dipping from the employer. What would be the effect of that? The effect of that that would be to take money from the employer that could be used for other purposes, including possibly an increase in wages for other employees of that particular firm or putting on somebody else in the future to do some other job where there is a demand for that job. That is the contention that is being advanced by the opposition in relation to this today. On the first three matters of detail which the opposition raise in relation to this legislation they are wrong. They are wrong on those three matters of detail. The Leader of the Opposition has had to concede that the me first matter he raised was wrong. He ought to come out now and concede that the other two matters of detail which he raised were wrong. The opposition ought to actually look at the bill and look at the act which it is amending before they come out with further nonsensical claims. Otherwise one could only come to the conclusion that the reason for advancing these claims has nothing to do with the debate about the bill; it is simply furthering the scaremongering campaign that has been undertaken by the opposition and the labour movement to date. The reality is that these reforms are important to Australia. One of the things which the Labor Party does not seem to have learnt-and which, to his credit, Paul Keating learnt in the early 1990s-is that a rigid labour market in Australia will not protect people from unemployment if the economy is not strong. We had a rigid labour market in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Australia but that did not stop the recession at the end of the 1980s. It did not stop one million people being driven into unemployment. Belatedly, Paul Keating recognised that and started the process which we are continuing today-that is, the move away from the rigidities of the old award system towards the agreement-making system. As I told the parliament yesterday, it really pays to read the speech that Paul Keating made to the Australian Institute of Company Directors in 1993, when he said that the model which he envisioned for Australia was one which placed the primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards. He went on to say: It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wages increases would be there only as a safety net. The safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees, but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employers. He went on after that. That was what Paul Keating set out, and what he started to enact back in 1993. As I recall it, he did that against the opposition of the then labour movement in Australia. We all remember those scenes at the Sydney Town Hall, when Laurie Brereton, as Minister for Industrial Relations in the Keating government, advanced those propositions and was shouted down by the labour movement. Keating and Brereton and others at that time had the courage to move on some of these things. What we are doing is taking an evolutionary step based on that which was begun in 1993 and continued in 1996. We are taking further steps in that now. The Leader of the Opposition said today, ‘Nobody of any economic note makes out a case for further economic reform.' I am not sure whom he has been reading or not reading, and whom he has been listening to or not listening to, but the IMF, the OECD, the Reserve Bank of Australia and Access Economics-a whole series of people whose views on this matter are not only creditable but based on detailed analysis of the situation-have said that there is a case for further economic reform in industrial relations because that will contribute to an increase in productivity in Australia. If the Leader of the Opposition wants the latest piece of evidence he should look at the 2004-05 annual report of the Productivity Commission, which was issued just a couple of days ago. In summary, the Productivity Commission says that further reforms to industrial relations in Australia are necessary if we want to increase productivity. The Productivity Commission has already pointed out that we will have to rely over the next four or five decades on increased productivity if we want to sustain economic growth and therefore the economic prosperity of this nation. In this latest report it says that if we can raise our productivity it could be worth as much as $22,000 a year in the pockets of householders in Australia. Gross average household income could be 20 per cent or some $22,000 a year higher. What Australian would not want the opportunity to have an increase in their gross household income of some $22,000? Yet the Labor Party, because it is dominated by the vested interests of the unions in Australia, stands against what could be to the advantage of the ordinary men and women of this country. When the Prime Minister and others on this side say that we are supporting the men and women of Australia, and that we are doing it in the face of the opposition of the Labor Party, it is only too true. The other matter is that what seems to have escaped the opposition in this entire debate is the simple moral principle that all Australians who want to work should be able to get a job. We heard the Leader of the Opposition banging on in question time today about fairness. He was asking where the word ‘fairness' was in relation to the Australian Fair Pay Commission. In relation to the objectives of the Australian Fair Pay Commission the bill says it should have regard to the following: (a) the capacity for the unemployed and low paid to obtain and remain in employment; The first step in fairness is to be able to job. That is something that a modern Labour leader like Tony Blair recognised. And he had the courage to tell that to the Trades Union Congress when he was first elected as Prime Minister of Great Britain. Fairness surely starts with the capacity of someone to get a job in this country. What is so difficult with that proposition that this Labor Partythis party which has its historic roots in representing the working men and women of Australia-cannot see that today? Surely that moral principle, which stands at the base of fairness, ought to be one which is accepted by everybody in this House and everybody throughout Australia. Beyond that, the objectives include providing a safety net for the low paid. Isn't providing a safety net for the low paid a fundamental principle of fairness? Yet, the Leader of the Opposition banged on in this place in question time today in the overly desperate, increasingly desperate and hysterical way that he does that somehow there is no fairness in this system. The moral principle which was outlined by the Prime Minister, which was outlined by Tony Blair when he spoke to the Trades Union Congress, is a very fundamental one. We on this side of the House will support it and continue to support it. For those 700,000 kids who are in homes across Australia where no-one has got a job, I would say that fairness would be getting a job. That is something which they would want, which their parents would want and which we are on about. It is a great pity that the Australian Labor Party has lost any sense of representing the working men and women of Australia and that it has totally abandoned those who do not have a job. It is shameful.",111
245,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is something especially obscene about the government's $55 million get a propaganda campaign being paid for by the taxes of the very people it intends to hurt. There is also something particularly perverse about a government punishing the very people who have built the country's economy and who have ensured economic growth for 14 consecutive years. Although I should be surprised, I am not surprised that there is something duplicitous and dishonest about the government's depiction of the Work Choices bill and its consequences for the working men and women of this country. I am not the least surprised that there is something ultimately tragic about the government's willingness to tear apart workplaces, to pit worker against worker and to demolish decent employment conditions in order to annihilate the trade union movement in this country. We on this side of the House are not surprised, because this has been the Prime Minister's ambition for more than 30 years. The modus operandi of the government is to tell lies, repeat the lies ad nauseam and, if possible, use the taxpayers' money to do it. That is effectively what the government has done with this legislation: say one thing, do another. The opposition leader today quoted George Orwell's description of political deception. But the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005, which has been introduced into the House, is not the first time that Orwellian language has been adopted to lie to an unsuspecting public. For nine years, the government has bent and turned the English language upside down, on its head, to deceive Australian working families. One example of that is a term in a bill introduced in 1996 called ‘Australian workplace agreements'. Australian? What is intrinsically Australian about Australian workplace agreements? Nothing. They are in fact foreign to the intrinsic nature of the industrial relations system in this country. Then there is the word ‘workplace'. How can an AWA be a workplace agreement? It is an individual contract. Finally, there is the word ‘agreement'. How many AWAs are actually made genuinely by agreement? They are usually imposed upon the employees of this country. Indeed, after nine years of deception and coercion, having failed to achieve pushing more than four per cent of the Australian work force onto AWAs, the government has decided to create a set of laws that will expressly allow for employers to require employees to sign AWAs. Effectively, employees of this country have said no to Australian workplace agreements. That is why such a negligible proportion of the Australian work force have chosen to take those contracts. The government will force them by putting in the proposed legislation that it is not duress for an employer to require his or her employee to sign an AWA-the government calls that an agreement. The government calls that set of laws ‘work choices'. We know that there is no choice in the Work Choice legislation being proposed to this House. The MPI today, proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, is about the threat of this legislation to the employment security of ordinary working Australian families. Already this country has the most casualised work force amongst OECD nations and, under this government, that trend is likely to continue unabated. Many people in casual jobs have permanent family responsibilities. Many people in short-term jobs have long-term mortgages. The Work Choice bill seeks to undermine the certainty and security of Australians in their workplaces. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 is moving the pendulum so far in favour of employers that it is designed to make workers afraid. It is designed to make workers afraid to stand up and say, ‘I want a say in how my working conditions can be applied every day in my workplace.' Over the days, weeks and months ahead, the pernicious nature of this bill will become known to millions of Australians. There are many examples that I could cite to underline its unprecedented extremism, but I will confine myself to one. Under this legislation, if enacted, an employee could be told that they have to accept moving from, say, an eighthour day shift from Monday to Friday to working Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The employer could say: ‘Now that's your five-day week and, while we're on it, we might as well move you to the evening shift. We'll make you work Saturday to Wednesday. We'll make it an evening shift.' Would the employer have to provide a penalty? Ms George-No.",115
246,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Not at all. Would the employer have to offer any compensation to that employee? Not at all. By the way, that is not even an extreme example of what could occur in the event of this bill being enacted. What we have in this legislation are very extreme laws. I know that it is sometimes customary in MPIs for us to use hyperbole to make a point, but I can tell you that it is very difficult to exaggerate the consequences of the Work Choices bill introduced into the House this week. The fact is that, by removing the no disadvantage test, by removing the capacity for employees to be protected, employers in this country will be able to remove the conditions of employment-the standards that have been accepted over many decades in this country. I would like to refer to an example used in the government's 65 pages of propaganda on Work Choices. Indeed, the Prime Minister himself raised the example of Billy. I think we are all beginning to get to know Billy a little. Billy is an unemployed job seeker who is offered a full-time job as a job assistant by Costas who owns a clothing retail store in Canberra. … … … The AWA Billy is offered provides him with the relevant minimum award classification wage and explicitly removes other award conditions. … … … The AWA Billy is offered explicitly removes award conditions for public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates and shift/overtime loadings. Effectively, somebody who is currently unemployed can be offered five minimum conditions, and the Prime Minister boasts about it. Let me say this: I know there will be some in this community who may think that providing an unemployed person with a job is a decent thing to do. I know there might be some people in the community who would say it is better than being unemployed. But let me examine that example of Billy. Say the employer offers that set of conditions to Billy and Billy takes up employment as a new employee in that retail store. What do you think then happens to Billy's workmates? What sorts of pressures do you think are on them to undermine their own conditions to keep their work? If an employer is willing to impose such an unfair thing on a vulnerable person like an unemployed worker, then he is just as likely to do it to his existing employees. Once Billy is in that workplace, that will be the benchmark for the future, particularly if the economy is suffering a downturn. And what happens to the honourable employer who has the shop up the road and competes against that company? That employer, who gets on well with his employees, will call a meeting of his workers and say: ‘I'm terribly sorry, but the fact is this: the competitor down the road has a bloke called Billy who is employed under a certain set of conditions. As a result, his workmates have chosen to take his conditions rather than lose their jobs. I don't want to lose my store, so to ensure that you are employed you will have to do the same.' That is basically the story of Billy. That is why all workers in this country should be worried, because this legislation is about a race to the bottom. But it is a race we cannot win against China and India, as the Leader of the Opposition said. So we must instead focus on skills, on training and on ensuring that our greatest asset in this country-our work force-is looked after. We need to ensure that we work collaboratively with employees, not turn them against each other, and that we do not turn honourable employers against their own employees. That is what this government is choosing to do. This Prime Minister has had a 30-year obsession with destroying workers' conditions and trade unions in this country, and we will not let it happen. (Time expired)",117
247,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have listened with interest to the arguments that have been made in the chamber and I must say I have heard a lot of huffing and puffing but not much substance. If we look at what this argument is truly about, it is a disagreement of philosophy. It is a disagreement between those who want to see individuals succeed, the nation prosper and wage control centralised, and those who want to see total control of individuals by a would be collectivist government. That would mean they would have under their control the workplace environment that has gained them some $47 million from trade unions between 1995-96 and today. This argument is not really about employment security but about pocket security for the ALP and a strong trade union movement which delivers money into the coffers of the ALP. When I look for the views of other Labor figures, I see that Steve Bracks, the Victorian ALP Premier, supports in principle the concept of a single national system of industrial relations and always has. He said: It can deliver benefits to both employees and employers by creating a uniform national framework for dispute resolution and the application of minimum employment standards that can be more easily complied with and enforced. Even Stephen Smith, the member for Perth, said as latterly as 20 February: It is possible to consider, in the abstract or thetically, a single or a unitary system. It's novel policy idea, and you can contemplate a whole range of efficiencies that would occur in the economy and in the system if that were to take place. What happened that he changed his mind between February this year and today? It is because of the loss of control by collectivist governments of individuals who want to work in a way that suits them. The concept of an employer and an employee negotiating together for an outcome that suits them is one that has been a long time coming but is one that will serve this country well. It was only after we saw the first workplace reforms in 1996 that productivity started to grow in Australia. We had been behind the OECD productivity growth figures for decades. The thing that always held us back was a rigid work force situation, where we did not get the best productivity from individual workers and they did not get their best rewards. We have heard statements made again and again by this government and they are worth repeating: since we have been in office and seen the first tranche of workplace reform put in place, 1.7 million jobs have been created. We have seen wages rise by 14 per cent. We have seen statements made by the Labor Party that they were proud of the fact that while they were in government they pushed wages down as a percentage of GDP. We have seen that individual workers were worse off under a collectivist centralised wage-fixing system. The government has created 900,000 full time jobs and 800,000 part-time jobs. In the ALP's 13 years of government, they created only 707,000 jobs-that is, 707,000 jobs in 13 years as compared to this government's 1.7 million jobs in nine years-and only 188,000 of those jobs were full time; the rest were part time. By freeing up our workplace relations environment, we have been able to hypocreate new opportunities for people. With the not a sustained growth in our economy, we are able to offer real workplace security to people-that is, a real expectation that you will get a job when you leave school. I recall that, when I was in the Senate, there were something like one million unemployed people. School leavers looked with hopeless eyes at the prospect of getting a job. For young school leavers, the prospects were dismal. For young school leavers now, there is hope. The policies we have put in place allow the economy to be buoyant. They allow people to use their skills, and we see a greater participation of people than ever before. For the first time, we have more than 10 million employed people. The participation rate for women is at its highest-something like 65 per cent of women are participating in the work force. We have put enormous investment into women's education, and the country needs a return on that investment. That occurs when women participate in the work force and use their educational skills to add to the productivity of this nation. We have often heard that we are an ageing population-and we are. We are an ageing population because we are living longer and healthier lives, which is terrific, but also cause our birth rate has gone down to 1.7 children per family. Since the introduction of the baby bonus, that figure has gone from 1.73 to 1.77. But still we need greater participation from our people if we are to continue to see our productivity grow and to pay for the continuation of all the things that we consider to be our right in a society with such a high standard of living. That means paying for our pensions, for our health care system and for our education system. It means paying for all the things we regard as precious. In 1999, the International Year of Older Persons, I commissioned some research from Access Economics which showed that we can afford to do all of those things as long as we continue to see growth in our economy and increases in productivity. There are two things that will mean GDP will grow: an increase in the number of employees and an increase in productivity. Those are the two things that the Howard government has delivered in the nine years it has been in office. These are the two things which have sustained our economy and have led to a turnaround of the boom-bust mentality that we saw for so many years. When we had a bust, we would see a loss of jobs so great that, even when we saw a boom, employment did not catch up and the number of unemployed people continued to escalate. By freeing up workplace relations and putting in place this historic new system, we are giving this country the opportunity it needs to continue to deliver the services we all need and expect. It will enable people to enter the job market and have the fulfilling experience of working within the economy and contributing to it. It will give hope to people who have never had a prospect of a job-they too will be able to participate. When we bring together our policies to change and free up the workplace we will besee higher wages, a greater rate of participation by our citizens than ever before and more households with someone working, as distinct from households where children have been destined to live with a welfare mentality. These things all hinge on the reforms that have been put in place. At the beginning of the debate, Mr Beazley said the legislation was all about sacking. It is not. It is all about employing. It is all about hope. It is all about flexibility. It is all about being able to negotiate something that suits you. It is all about recognising that the individual is the most precious asset in our society and about freeing the individual to work in a way that suits that person, making a contribution to their family and to the nation. It is about ensuring we see productivity grow and that we are able to provide all the services that we will continue to need. It is all about showing people that this government is prepared not to look at a collectivist ideal where the individual is sacrificed, but where the individual is the most invigorated part of our society and is successful, bringing about that dual outcome-success for themselves and success for the nation.

248,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The discussion is now concluded. ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (No. 2) 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",120
249,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Yesterday this House passed amendments to clarify the terrorist act offences in part 5.3 of tion the Criminal Code. As I informed the House yesterday, the government would like all elements of the anti-terrorism legislation package to become law before Christmas. This second bill contains the remaining provisions to ensure that we have the toughest laws possible to prosecute those responsible should a terrorist attack occur. Second and of equal importance, the bill ensures we are in the strongest position possible to prevent new and emerging threats, to stop terrorists carrying out their intended acts. This bill has been the subject of extensive consultation. The Prime Minister first announced the proposals to strengthen Australia's counterterrorism laws on 8 September in advance of a special COAG meeting. The following day senior officials from the Commonwealth met with their state and territory counterparts to discuss the proposals. The special COAG meeting of 27 September provided an opportunity for the Prime Minister to discuss the proposals with premiers and chief ministers who agreed that there was a clear case for laws to be strengthened. The COAG agreement was followed by extensive consultation with the states and territories at officer level as well as directly between the Prime Minister and premiersand the chief ministers. This consultation process of almost two months has been very constructive and has yielded the positive result of an agreed position on the text of the bill introduced today. Control Orders and Preventative DetenMuch of the discussion has focused on the control orders and preventative detention regimes and their extensive safeguards. Firstly, in considering whether to apply for or issue a control order the personal circumstances of an individual will need to be balanced against the threat to the community. This does not mean that personal circumstances will outweigh the assessment of the threat, but it is recognised that both issues need to be taken into account. Under the control order regime: - an “interim” control order is made initially. The person the subject of the order may attend the court and make representations when the court decides to confirm, void or revoke the order; - the control order does not come into effect until the person is notified. - the person can apply for the order to be revoked, varied or declared void as soon as the person is notified that an order has been confirmed. - the person and their lawyer may have a copy of the grounds for making or varying the order; Under the preventative detention regime: - the order, as well as the treatment of the person detained, would be subject to judicial review. There is also built in merits review including when the police seek a continued preventative detention order. - At that time the person detained or their legal representative can provide the police with additional information concerning the preventative detention order. - The issuing authority is required to consider afresh the merits of making the order and to be satisfied, after taking into fence. account relevant information, including information provided to the police by the person subject to the order, that the ditions for the order are met. This includes any information that has become available since the initial preventative detention order was made. - the person detained may contact a lawyer, a family member… their employer… and another person at the discretion of the police officer; - each year, the Attorney-General would report to parliament on the operation of preventative detention orders - the regime will not apply to people under 16 and special rules will apply for people between the ages of 16 and 18 and people incapable of managing their own affairs. A number of members of the government have suggested that questioning of a person in preventative detention should be permitted-subject to normal safeguards. This was not the subject of COAG agreement reached in September but the government will examine this issue prior to the next COAG meeting and, if anything is to be considered arising from that, it will occur then. Advocating terrorism and sedition The bill also addresses those in our community who incite terrorist acts. It does this by expanding upon the Australian government's ability to proscribe terrorist organisations that advocate terrorism and also updates the sedition offence. The updated sedition offence will address problems with those who incite directly against other groups within our community. The sedition amendments are modernising the language of the provisions and are not a wholesale revision of the sedition ofHowever, given the considerable interest in the provisions, I would like to assure this conHouse that I will undertake to conduct with my department a review of the sedition offences. I would also note that honourable members will be aware that I announced on 12 October 2005 the establishment of the Security Legislation Review Committee. The committee will be chaired by the Honourable Simon Sheller AO QC, a recently retired NSW Supreme Court judge. As required by the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, the review will focus on the existing counterterrorism laws. I would note here that it is possible for other matters to be referred to that committee, and I will be asking that committee to examine some issues relevant to individual advocacy which have been raised with me. But to return to today's matters ... the bill bolsters the existing offences dealing with funding terrorist organisations and financing individual terrorists. The new measures will facilitate the tracking of terrorist funds and also make it harder for terrorists to transfer funds across international borders. Law Enforcement and ASIO Powers Finally the bill extends the powers of police to stop, question and search, to all Commonwealth places and prescribed security zones to safeguard against terrorism. The AFP will be provided with a new notice to produce regime to ensure compliance with lawful requests for certain types of information. Finally the bill strengthens the regime relating to ASIO's powers, including enhancing various aspects of ASIO's special powers warrant regime … access to aircraft and vessel information … the offence for providing false or misleading information under an ASIO questioning warrant … and amends the relevant Customs legislation to broaden Customs powers for security and intelligence purposes. These measures complement others taken by the government to ensure that agencies are appropriately equipped and resourced to protect the Australian community. I can confirm that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, will move today to support a reference of the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for consideration of the bill upon introduction in the House and to report on 28 November 2005.

253,Mr BARRESI,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"As I was saying prior to question time, after winning office the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, partially re-regulated the labour market. Even so, only a small list of minimum entitlements were included: a minimum adult wage, three weeks annual leave, 11 paid annual holidays, five days sick leave, three days bereavement leave and up to 13 weeks paid maternity leave. With this slight re-regulation, New Zealand still has a far less regulated system than the Australian system will be after our reforms come into place. If we go across to the other side of the world, to the United Kingdom, where the Labour Prime Minister inherited a system from a Conservative Prime Minister, we hear a similar story being told. The United Kingdom industrial relations system is also far more deregulated than ours will be, and they are reaping the benefits of those reforms, which the Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair, accepted upon winning office. In 1997 Tony Blair said in his first speech to the United Kingdom Trade Union Congress: We are not going back to the days of industrial warfare, strikes without ballots, mass and flying pickets and secondary action ... … … … ... fairness at work starts with the chance of a job in the first place, because if we ... do not make Britain a country of successful businesses, a country where people want to set up and expand and a country that has the edge over our competitors, then we are betraying those we represent ... The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, recognises that a job is a great start in life and, through a job, people can work their way out of any potential welfare dependency. By getting that first step into the labour market, various other career options can emerge for the person who was originally unemployed. In the United Kingdom the state has largely kept out of industrial relations, under the principle of ‘voluntarism'. Relatively recent changes have made a range of workplace relations matters subject to statutory regulation. Unlike Australia, the United Kingdom has never had awards. Since 1997, the Low Pay Commission has set the minimum wage in the UK. In many ways this body is a forerunner to the proposed Australian Fair Pay Commission included in this bill. There is, however, one major difference: the British government reserves the right to reject decisions made by the Low Pay Commission. This government through our reforms will not be able to reject the decisions of the new Fair Pay Commission. It is obvious that throughout this debate a lot of huff and puff has taken place-(Time expired)",123
254,Dr LAWRENCE,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It does seem a rather bizarre way to begin my contribution, but it will take only a minute for me to say that I am amazed on another matter to see the Attorney-General come into this place, introduce legislation of profound import and take just 10 minutes to read his speech into the Hansard. I must say that, given the importance of that legislation and the debate it has generated, it is consistent with the pattern that we have seen in this Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 that the parliament is treated with such contempt. When you are making momentous changes of this kind, it is incumbent upon ministers to take the parliament seriously, at least for public display, even if they do regard the parliament as a rubber stamp for the executive. We have seen this pattern repeated over and over again, and it is becoming very galling not just for members of the opposition but for the community at large to see their elected representatives held in such disdain. I believe that Australians generally would want to see this government held to account on this bill, as on others, for setting aside the usual procedures and protocols of this parliament. NA",123

256,Dr LAWRENCE,ADJOURNMENT,"I was not, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was speaking to the bill. Government Advertising",124
257,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"We learned this week that the bill for taxpayers from the government's industrial relations advertising campaign was $50 million, not the $30 million or $40 million the Prime Minister had fessed up to on radio$50 million and rising; over a million dollars a day being spent. With apologies to Winston Churchill, never before in the history of government advertising has so much money been hosed up against a wall by so few in so short a time. Fifty million dollars to produce full-page as which say, ‘Australia cannot afford to stand still'! This is not information: information would be something like telling Australians how to recognise the symptoms of bird flu; this is propaganda. And with the government so cheerfully taking a cigarette lighter to taxpayers' funds have come the stories of excess, like the man who was paid $6,000 just for a morning's work as an extra on a set. He was only going there to drop off his kids, he was not even used, and he says there were nine others like him-$60,000 of taxpayers' money straight down the gurgler. Then there were the call centre operators who were also paid to do nothing because they were rostered on a full six hours before the government's as even went to air! Taxpayers around Australia are no doubt wondering how such excesses can possibly happen. In the case of the advertising agency fees, it is all too simple. The ad agency get a percentage of everything they spend. In the case of this contract, the amount is a secret. But typically it is 10 to 15 per cent, so the more they spend the more they makebeautiful! And just who is the advertising agency with the contract for this $50 million IR campaign? It is none other than Dewey Horton, one of whose principals, Ted Horton, also does the Liberal Party's campaign advertising. Did the contract go out to tender? No. Could other agencies bid for it? No. Is the contract secret? Yes. Who awarded it? That would be the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications, a committee of Liberal Party MPs and ministers located deep within the bowels of the Prime Minister's department. Ted Horton is making a great deal of money from this campaign, as he no doubt has done from his previous work. And some people who make a lot of money sometimes do not want to pay all the tax that is owing on it. I am aware of reports that a Melbourne based advertising agency has provided documents to the tax office following a query by the tax office concerning payments to Mr Horton. I have also heard reports that Mr Horton has made payments to international accounts when working for overseas clients. The government must investigate this matter and tell the Australian people whether the Australian Taxation Office has sought documents from Ted Horton or any of his former employers or former or current clients as part of the high net worth individuals investigation or other routine inquiries. Were any of those queries or documents related to the issue of offshore payments to Mr Horton for work done either in Australia or overseas? Has Mr Horton been investigated by the tax office as part of its high net worth individuals investigation? If so, what are the results of that investigation? The Australian people are also entitled to some transparency surrounding the awarding of advertising contracts by the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, criticised the lack of openness concerning these contracts and said they contained the potential for corruption. He was absolutely right to do so. It is too cute by half that this massive, lucrative contract given out by Liberal Party insiders just happens to go to the Liberal Party's own advertising team. This week we also learned that Ted Horton had taken on Mark Pearson for the IR  ton work together on Liberal Party campaigns. Mark Pearson is no stranger to Liberal government largesse: he made a handy little $400,000 out of the GST ad campaign. The public are entitled to know how much  of taxpayers this time. The public want to know how these contracts are awarded. They want to see the documents. They want to know what checks the government has to ensure contracts do not go to tax avoiders. It is time to clean up this rotten insider dealing. Make the advertising contracts subject to the government's procurement policy and put them out for open tender and assessment on their merits, not on the basis of who has done the most to help the Liberal Party. Workplace Relations Ryan Electorate: Tourism",124
258,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Today in the parliament I spoke on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. I was very delighted to speak on that because it is all about securing the future prosperity of this country and bringing jobs to the young people of Australia and indeed all Australians, particularly those Australians who live in my electorate of Ryan. It is a momentous bill and it is all about business. I want to continue that theme this afternoon but particularly in relation to the tourism industry-and I am delighted to see that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism is in the chamber as I speak. We have just heard the shadow minister for public accountability give another antibusiness diatribe. His contributions in this parliament are always wrapped in grubby attacks and below the belt verballing of companies that are doing legal business in this country. Tourism in this country is all about jobs and I want to refer to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary in Fig Tree Pocket, which employs many Australians; indeed, many young Australians are employed there. Those at the sanctuary were delighted by the news this week about the prospects of receiving more Chinese tourists from mainland China, the People's Republic of China. Earlier this week the government announced that a significant number of Chinese will be able to come to this country, consistent with an agreement that the Australian government and the Chinese government have signed. The new agreement between the two governments, through the China National Tourism Administration, approved potentially 850 million to 900 million Chinese visiting this country. Of course, we do not expect that many to come here but we would be delighted with many hundreds of thousands coming, because they will continue to provide jobs in this country. The Approved Destination Status scheme-the ADS scheme-is a bilateral scheme which enables Chinese tourists to visit Australia on group tours. Australia was the first Western country to be designated as an approved destination for tourists from China. The new agreement was announced in China recently by Senator the Hon. Amanda Vanstone and very strongly supported by the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and her department: “This new agreement will mean an additional 855 million Chinese citizens will now be eligible to apply for a tourist visa to Australia, growing the pool of potential tourists considerably,” Fran ley, Minister for Small Business and Tourism, said ... This country is experiencing enormous growth. China is a nation that we consider very important to our bilateral relations and, with a free trade agreement being discussed at the moment between the two countries, this further reflects the enormous potential for business and for commerce to grow between our businesspeople and those entrepreneurs in a mainland China. The minister for tourism went on: China is the new tourism tiger in the playground. Millions of middle class Chinese with cash to spend are looking to travel. Within three years, the Chinese market is forecast to be our second largest in terms of its contribution to the Australian economy. I am delighted to play a small part in fostering exchanges and visits between our two countries in terms of Chinese businesspeople coming to this country and also to provide opportunities for Australian businesses, including those in my Ryan electorate, to engage in commercial relationships in China. China is currently the fifth largest source of tourists and it is forecast to be the second largest by 2013-14. Visitor arrivals from China are forecast to grow from 286,000almost 300,000-for 2004-05 to in excess of 1.1 million within the decade. This is an average annual growth of 16.5 per cent. The real market value of Chinese visitors in 2005 is forecast to be some $1.5 billion and it is forecast to increase to $5.9 billion by 2014. This is good for Australians because it is going to contribute to providing jobs throughout the country for our young people. It is going to provide opportunities for those in hospitality and in retail. I am sure that the opposition would support the government in this endeavour, because it is all about providing jobs for people in this country and, in my Baicase as the federal member for Ryan, providing as many opportunities as possible for people in Ryan to take on jobs. The hospitality sector, the retail sector and the tourism industry are very significant to this nation's economy. I encourage all members of the parliament to speak very strongly about this policy, about this initiative and about this agreement because it is in the interests of all Australians. (Time expired) Skills Shortage",125
259,Mrs ELLIOT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to speak on behalf of the very many young people in this country who face a very limited choice because of the Howard government's refusal to address the skills crisis in this country-a skills crisis that is worsening all the time. This is the week in which we have seen the Howard government introducing its extreme attack on our industrial relations system. They want to strip workers of their rights and conditions and leave the most vulnerable unprotected in the workplace, and young Australians will be particularly at risk. I am very much concerned, particularly for the young people and, indeed, all the families within Richmond. The Prime Minster wants us to compete with low-wage economies like China and India by slashing Australian wages. This is economically irresponsible and will undermine our very way of life. Instead we need to compete with these economies by addressing our skills crisis and building the skills of Australian workers-that is where our focus should be. We are facing a skills crisis because we have been subjected to nine long years of a Howard government that refuses to properly invest in vocational education and training. This incompetence is affecting so many people within my electorate of Richmond. Many locals have been telling me that they desperately want to get employment, they want to get skilled but they cannot as the courses are not available for them because the federal Howard government will not properly fund our TAFEs. This decline in funding over the last nine years has meant that TAFEs-including those in my electorate of Richmond-are often forced to turn away potential students because there are no courses to place them in. I want to talk about some local examples, in particular Gregory Watts and Michael Gray. Both fellows want to upskill and get welding qualifications and, currently, the North Coast of New South Wales is suffering a skills shortage in metal fabrication and welding. Nearby there is a first-rate welding school at Wollongbar TAFE. So far, it sounds like Gregory and Michael are on the right track and making a good career decision. But they cannot actually get into a course longbar TAFE. Members might ask why it is they cannot get in there. They cannot because the Howard government is starving TAFEs of funds and, consequently, the welding school can open only during the day and not at night. Locals like Gregory and Michael, who have to work during the day to support themselves and their families, need to train at night and they cannot because that particular course is not available at night. I understand there are at least another 30 locals in this same position, many of whom have spoken to me because they really want to be able to do this welding course at Wollongbar TAFE and they are not able to. I understand there are also many local businesses that actually want to pay to have their workers upskilled in this course at this TAFE and they cannot. So what is the situation that we find ourselves in here? We have a shortage of welders in this area. We have local businesses that are willing to pay for this particular staff training. On the North Coast, we have youth unemployment at over 30 per cent, which is a huge amount. We also have one of the best welding schools in the state. We have this absurd situation where this school is sitting idle at night because of a lack of funding from the short-sighted Howard government. These locals are unable to access that course. Instead this government wants to bring in apprentices from overseas to satisfy the skills crisis. What are we supposed to be saying to locals like Michael and Gregory? What we are saying is, ‘We're not going to bother training you; we'd rather give your job to someone from another country.' This is an absurd situation. I believe we need to train Australians first. In Richmond we need to train locals first, such as Michael and Gregory, who desperately want to do this training. We should not be importing apprentices and workers from overseas to be filling these positions; we need to be training and at Wolskilling our young people first. In contrast, federal Labor has a blueprint for the training of young Australians. This blueprint will improve the competitiveness of our nation by building the skills of our young people so they can reach their potential, rather than removing their rights at work, as we are seeing the Howard government doing at the moment. Federal Labor will invest in schools and vocational education to offer young people better choices. We will help young people access better and more training more easily. We will create more real apprenticeships. Australians deserve a government that is serious about addressing our skills crisis and serious about investing in vocational educational and ing. There is only one way to give Australians real choice-by taking Labor's highskills road, not the Howard government's low-wage road. It is outrageous in an area like Richmond, as I said, with over 30 per cent youth unemployment. We need to be training our young people. (Time expired) Korumburra Primary School",126
260,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT,"I had the great pleasure of attending Korumburra Primary School only a few days ago. It is a great school-this school rocks. Its award-winning choir was there on the morning to greet me at a major assembly for the whole school, as were teachers and parents. Its musical program was incredible. The choir sang I Had a Dream, led ably by Mrs Paproth. The choir came to a crescendo in I Had a Dream-and I know the member for MCEwen would remember the ABBA song I Had a Dream of 25 years ago. Fran Bailey-I do.",128
261,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT,"It was a great song, beautifully presented by these very young primary school students, and when they went into the key change you just had to grab hold of the moment and feel a part of it. Mrs Paproth was thrilled to bits. Because of a part of my background, I recognised the key change and that they went up a semi-tone. It was absolutely magnificent to be there. When I say this school rocks, they really did rock. It was just fantastic, as was the enthusiasm of the teachers. For what reason was I there? I was there as the federal member to praise the Reading Challenge of the Premier of Victoria and to make a few presentations. We talked about Investing in Our Schools, but then what did they do? The whole school sang I am Australian, with harmony coming from the choir and with five teachers playing guitar-it was trainabsolutely sensational. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the member for MCEwen, did not believe me when I said Korumburra Primary School rocks! It really does, and they are academically great achievers. Every member of one class completed the Reading Challenge set by the Premier. However, my difficulty was that the children then asked me in front of everybody what my favourite childhood book was. My favourite-I know every member here, joining us in this parliament this evening, will remember this one, and I thank all the members for joining us this evening as we wind up the week-was Little Toot. I explained to them why mine was Little Toot. Little Toot had three or four goes at getting where he was going. He got to the mountain a couple of times and fell back, and had another go and fell back, and had another go and fell back. I was explaining to the young students how important it is never to give up and to be persistent and to always keep trying. Even if you are not the best book reader, it is important to have a go at reading a book, and they did. Of course these children-and I know every member in this House feels exactly the same way as I do-are our future. The teachers who teach them have a heavy responsibility for what they do. Especially the mums who are in this House tonight, and perhaps the future mums who are in this House tonight, will feel that responsibility and know the challenges that their children went through, be they health challenges or academic challenges or just growing-up challenges. So a heavy responsibility has been given to Korumburra Primary School, their principal and their teachers, and they are working through it. This government also has provided money right across Victoria for Investing in Our Schools. It was a tremendous pleasure for me to go to Elizabeth Street Primary School and deliver some money to them. It has been a difficult school in Moe for years. They were just absolutely beside themselves to get their money. At the Nyora Primary School I was able to sit under a 100-year-old oak tree and think of the generations that have gone through the school. I was able to congratulate them on a citizenship program that they had invested in. I have already told the House about Korumburra Primary School. The other day the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, visited the Blackwood Annexe and took some Investing in Our Schools money down there. The Blackwood Annexe is absolutely sensational. So sometimes members of parliament have great days, and the great day I had was when Korumburra Primary School rocked. Capricornia Electorate: Murray Lagoon",128
262,Ms LIVERMORE,ADJOURNMENT,"What a delight it is to follow on from a member talking with such enthusiasm about something that happened in his electorate. I too would like to use my time this afternoon to talk about a project which, while it has not yet taken place, I have very great enthusiasm for and to which I wish to give my strongest possible support. I am talking about an application that is currently with the government, under the Community Water Grants scheme, to rejuvenate and revitalise the Murray Lagoon in Rockhampton. Visitors to Rockhampton, and indeed the residents of Rockhampton, know that the botanical gardens area of our city is an absoidea lute jewel. It is a very special place, of which we are all very proud. The Rockhampton Botanical Gardens is bordered by Murray Lagoon and it is also adjacent to the Rockhampton Golf Club. The application currently before the government seeking $50,000 from the Community Water Grants scheme is a joint project between the Rockhampton Golf Club and the Central Queensland University to do a feasibility study into the harvesting and filtering of stormwater and recycled water through the wetlands and into Murray Lagoon. As I said, the botanical gardens, the golf club and the Murray Lagoon area is a real jewel in Rockhampton city; but over the last few years, because of the extremely dry conditions we have been experiencing right around the country, the wetlands, the Murray Lagoon area, has become seriously depleted of water and has deteriorated significantly. In this once beautiful area that was an important habitat for fish, turtles, native birds and other forms of wildlife-it was a very important ecosystem-the water has gradually receded until it is now almost totally dry. It is really just an area covered with noxious weeds, introduced plant species and feral animals. The poor pelicans, native birds and other species are being forced into a smaller and smaller area, and it is a very sad thing to see when this is such a special and beautiful place. The application that is before the government at the moment is a fantastic project. It is a classic win-win situation which has the support of a great number of stakeholders in Rockhampton. I have already mentioned the project partners CQU and the Rockhampton Golf Club, but it is also supported by the Environmental Protection Agency, the department of natural resources and the Rockhampton City Council, among others. The is to design a best-practice system to harvest and filter stormwater and treated effluent through artificial and enhanced natural wetlands. Now we have a situation where Murray Lagoon is dry and the Rockhampton Golf Club would like to have access to a source of water to do its own irrigation. We have got a situation where stormwater and treated effluent is being pumped back into the Fitzroy River by the Rockhampton City Council. The Fitzroy River empties into the Great Barrier Reef, so anything that we can do to divert that stormwater and treated effluent going to be helping the water quality in the Fitzroy River and also on the Great Barrier Reef. We are looking at the feasibility of verting that water into wetlands and into Murray Lagoon. It will reduce effluent discharge into the river and supply irrigation water to the golf course and the botanical gardens, and the publicity that this fantastic project will receive from local media outlets-who have indicated their very strong support-will get the message of water reuse and water conservation throughout the whole community. There is also an opportunity for Indigenous youth to be involved through a training project in conjunction with this project. So give this project my very strongest support. It is a fantastic example of the kind of munity spirit we have in Rockhampton, where people get together to collaborate on something that will be good on so many levels and once again return Murray Lagoon to being a fantastic asset to our city. (Time pired) Second World War: 60th Anniversary",129
263,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"We have been considering in the course of this week some of the very real challenges that confront Australia today, in the shape of terrorism and of disease in the form of avian flu. But the greatest challenge that our nation has ever faced and the greatest threat that there has been to its security and the liberties of Australians was during the Second World War, which ended 60 years ago in August. This year we have been celebrating and commemorating the end of that war. Tomorrow, 95 veterans and widows of veterans of the Second World War will be presented by me and General Peter Cosgrove with the World War II commemorative medals which the Commonwealth government is has struck and which are being presented to approximately 250,000 veterans of that war. This ceremony will be held at Victoria Bardiracks in Sydney, one of the oldest military establishments in Australia. The Australian Army band, under the directorship of Major Andrea Davey, will be playing, and in addition to the 95 veterans and widows there will be another 300 family members and friends. It will be a wonderful occasion and a very fitting way to remember the sacrifice of all those whose served Australia in the Second World War and to honour those who have survived the 60 years with the presentation of the medal. The veterans and their widows will be I joined by representatives from the Rose Bay RSL, the Bondi Junction-Waverley RSL, the com- Paddington-Woollahra RSL and the Clovelly RSL, which are the principal returned servicemen's organisations in my electorate. Earlier this year the federal government made funds available to the Bondi JunctionexWaverly RSL and the Rose Bay RSL under the program Saluting Their Service 2005, which gave the means and the wherewithal to many community organisations to hold their own celebrations-mostly in Augustto commemorate the end of the Second World War. At the ceremony tomorrow we will be presenting these medals to the veterans, many of whom are very old friends of mine. Winston Summerhayes-better known as Buster Summerhayes-a great doctor in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, was for many years the honorary medical adviser to the City Tattersalls Harriers in Centennial Park. Buster Summerhayes will be there and fitter, probably, than most of the younger people. He is a great athlete. My father-in-law, Tom Hughes, who is of course a former member of this parliament, will also be there. Tom served in the Air Force in the Second World War and he is still at the peak of his forensic powers as he approaches his 82nd birthday at the end of November. It will also be a great honour for us all in Wentworth to have General Peter Cosgrove at our ceremony. He retired as Chief of the Defence Force in 2005 and is one of the most distinguished servicemen in Australia in modern times. He became a national figure following his appointment as Commander of International Forces East Timor, where he led the Australian force that ensured the safety and security of that fledging nation. He was responsible, along with the men and women who served under him, for overseeing East Timor's transition to independence during what was a very tense and uncertain period both in East Timor and, more widely, in Indonesia. Tomorrow, Wentworth will remember the men and women who defended Australia in the Second World War. Their example of heroism and commitment will be in the forefront of our minds, as I am sure it has been in the forefront of the minds of all Australians, especially during this year, the 60th anniversary of the end of our greatest struggle-the end of the war when we were most at threat and the end of the war when many Australians paid the greatest sacrifice in our defence.
