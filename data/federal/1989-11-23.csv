Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme the To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House, that pharmacists in have had their very livelihood placed in of jeopardy, by the totally unreasonable decisions, of the so called 'independent' Pharmaceutical Benefits Tribunal, in drastically reducing the remuneration paid to pharmacists for dispensing of prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As a result of these decisions, the essential primary health care functions and services provided (largely free) by pharmacists to the public, have been seriously put at risk. The replacement of such services could only be fulfilled by an already overtaxed medical profession and at a financial cost that would be virtually impossible to be funded by the Government or the Community.

In that same year, the Federal Government allocated some $1.25 billion for expenditure on roads-less than 20 cents of each $1 collected from fuel taxes. 3. In the past 120 years, only during the two World Wars has investment in road formation in Australia been lower, as a percentage of Gross. Domestic Product, than it is at present. 4. Since 1960, vehicle density per kilometre of Australian roads rose from 0.95 vehicles to 2.7 vehicles in 1985-a rise of 184%. 5. In the same period, investment in roads as a proportion of GDP fell from 2.7% in 1960 to slightly more than 1% in 1985-a fall of 61%. 6. In 1987, local government expended more on roads than either the Federal Government or the combined State Governments. 7. The road system is failing in many areas. Many roads are well overdue for reconstruction. Some roads in rural areas cannot be maintained in a sealed state due to funding constraints and are being reverted to an unsealed surface. Your petitioners therefore request the House to raise the priority listing of roads in the Government's expenditure programmes to ensure that sufficient funding is allocated to: (a) redress the backlog of road works required to raise the Nation's road network to a standard consistent with that of a progressive, developed country; (b) ensure that Australia's road network is able to be maintained to a standard acceptable to a country so dependent on road transport; and, (c) permit the progressive improvement and upgrading of the road system so as to keep pace with the demands made upon it. by Mr Hawker (from 130 citizens).

With this in mind, and appealing to an international sense of justice, your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will call on the Government: 1. to demand that the Government of the USSR issue a declaration which recognizes that the Soviet-German treaties of 23 August and 28 September 1939, signed in Moscow by Ribbentrop and Molotov, were criminal by nature, devoid of any international legal base and invalid from the beginning; 2. to demand that the Government of the USSR withdraw all Soviet forces from Polish soil and from all other European territories annexed by the Soviet Union on the basis of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and the subsequent so-called plebiscites organized in those territories by the occupying Red Army; 3. to demand that units of the NKVD be put on trial for the genocide and war crimes on citizens of the conquered nations, including the Katyn massacre, one of the greatest crimes committed on prisoners of war, officers and men, of the Polish Armed Forces, a crime for which there has not yet been any judgement pronounced and punishment meted out. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Langmore (from 272 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of citizens of Australia points out that the community deplores the persistent refusal to ban pornography in X and NVE videos, films and publications, and deplores the resulting escalation of crime and sexual crime in the Australian community. Because Parliament has a direct and heavy obligation to ensure the safety of women and childvictims, your petitioners therefore request the House: to ban the importation, and availability of pornography in videos, films and publications, to prevent black-market trading by banning the possession of X and NVE material, vote against any recommendation to extend video and theatre film classifications and guidelines into television standards, ensure that pay television does not exceed the programme limits of television standards, control all censorship criteria and guidelines substantive legislation, give earnest consideration to these matters, in order that no Attorney-General shall ever again have the power to change our social and home environment for generations to come, without thorough and full debate in both Houses of Parliament. by Mr Miles (from two citizens). Voters' Referenda To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of certain Citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia have in past years adopted policies which have been against the opinions of the majority of voters, for example, the Australia Card Bill. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament pass a bill to provide for a Constitutional change so that when five per cent of the voters demands a referendum to initiate or veto legislation, the referendum shall be held within a specified time, for example, nine months, and its decision shall be binding. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. EmptyHere Advertising by Political Parties To the Honourable Speaker and the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully draws the attention of the House to the threat to free speech contained within the recommendations of the majorPornography ity report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We believe that all persons have the right to express their views through paid commercial advertising on television and radio and that any limitation on the right constitutes a threat to the peoples' freedom of speech and to the Australian democratic system. Your petitioners therefore request that the Parliament rejects the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and preserves the right of all persons and political parties to exercise their right to free speech through any media they choose. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Reith (from 10 citizens). Deregulation of Television Content To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representativ- in Parliament assembled. by The Petition of these residents of the Commonwealth of Australia Respectfully showeth: that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal continues to regulate Australian content on television that it increases the quota of first release primetime drama to 365 hours a year per station, over the next three years that it ensures the TV networks provide Australians with a variety of Australian television drama including serials, series and plays that it increases the quota of children's programmes that it encourages regional TV production. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Honourable Members will oppose any deregulation of television content. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Saunderson (from 2,375 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: I. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immediate characterisation of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the Nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. 3.. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. 4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. S. They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: Propose and pass a motion that ""the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a Referendum"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Saunderson (from 17 citizens). Road Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens respectfully draws to the attention of the House: ""the inability of State and Local Government to meet satisfactory road maintenance and construction programmes due to chronically inadequate Federal Government funding"". Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, urge the Government: ""to recognise the threat to human lives from Australia's inadequate road system and increase significantly the existing 23% of present Federal fuel excise now available for roads and widen the categories of roads now entitled to assistance by measures to be included in the 1988/89 Federal Budget."" And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Sinclair (from 191 citizens). Mortgage Repayments To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petitioner concerning residents of the State of Northern Tasmania draws to the attention of the House, that the inequalities of the current scheme of home mortgage interest rate repayments since deregulation of the banks has effectively caused subsidisation by those currently paying market rates against those paying the 13t per cent seen before deregulation.

Cost of Health Care To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that, Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older. If open not-for-profit Health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, those costs need to be shared equitably. Some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to, Take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Dr Theophanous (from 99 citizens). Portuguese - Language: South Australia and the Northern Territory To petition to Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that, contrary to the principles of multiculturalism declared to be operative in Australia, instruction in Portuguese Language and Culture does not form part of the mainstream formal education curriculum for student study from the Primary to the Post-Graduate Tertiary levels in . South Australia and the Northern Territory; nor is it an accredited subject for Matriculation examination. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will take immediate steps to remedy this racially discriminating situation. by Mr Wilson (from 182 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the continued government interference in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we as Australians have a right. Your petitioners therefore request the House to guarantee the provision of an adequately funded pharmaceutical benefits scheme which ensures the availability of pharmaceutical benefits through local community pharmacies. by Dr Woods (from 1,125 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: the high level of services currently offered by my pharmacist, a frontline provider of medicine, would be threatened if the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is cut back. . the PBS is one of the most essential and enduring elements of our health care system and its future must not, and should not, be sacrificed by the Government's failure to recognise the extent to which it has placed the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in jeopardy. Now, therefore your petitioners request that the Members of the House of Representatives assembled undertake an urgent reconsideration of efforts to cut expenditure on the PBS by means of reducing pharmacists' remuneration. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Dr Woods (from 97 citizens). Abortion Funding Abolition Legislation To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Private Member's Bill, the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill is not to come to a vote in this current parliamentary session and we feel this is a breach of our democratic rights to ask our parliamentary representatives to make our views known on this important issue. Your petitioners therefore request the House do everything in its power to have this issue come to debate and be put to a vote this parliamentary session. by Dr Woods (from 96 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, the people of Newtown, wish to draw the attention of Members to the fact that proposed cuts in funding of pharmaceutical benefits will severely reduce service and availability of medicines to the public. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to reject these cuts and maintain our family chemist service. by Dr Woods (from 46 citizens). Privacy Amendment Legislation To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to your attention that the Privacy Amendment Bill dealing with credit referencing reporting will 1. Prevent business from having access to the information it needs to make sensible commercial decisions. 2. Disadvantage or discourage persons entering into leasing, mortgage, tenancy or purchase or insurance transactions with people whom they know nothing about. 3. Add to the costs of business, increase interest rates, .insurance charges and defaults in rental payments and lead to over commitment by borrowers. Your petitioners, therefore, pray that the House do everything in its power to ensure that the Privacy Amendment Bill does not become legislation. by Dr Woods (from 26 citizens). Petitions received. NA ENVIRONMENT, RECREATION AND NA . Mr MILTON (La Trobe) (1O.08)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment; Recreation and the Arts, I present the Committee's report entitled The Effectiveness of Land Degradation Policies and Programs. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr MILTON,THE ARTS,"For the past 16 years the House of Representatives has had a standing committee dealing with environmental matters. The Committee has tabled many reports on a wide range of important issues. I do not think that too many of those reports would have dealt with any problems quite as serious as the problem as land degradation, which is discussed in the report which I have just presented. Mr Lamb-Hear, hear!",22
4,Mr MILTON,THE ARTS,"I know that there is a lot of agreement on this matter in this House and bipartisan support for the recommendations of our report. There are few other environmental and resource issues which currently attract more attention than the matter of land degradation. When the land degradation inquiry was referred to us by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown), the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, he suggested that it was a very serious problem although one that was not attracting a great deal of attention. Very early in our inquiry we found that awareness of the problem was growing in the community, and by the time we had finished our work the land degradation problem had become much more of a high profile issue. . In the past 18 months considerable progmost ress has been made in terms of government activity. However, the former Minister's comments are still very relevant. Our conclusion is that the land degradation problem still not receiving sufficient attention in terms of real action, even though it is often scribed as the most serious environmental problem facing Australia. As a· nation we must address ourselves to problems such the current depletion of the ozone layer the greenhouse effect, to name just two the very serious problems that we are facing. They are international environmental probcluding lems. Looking closer to home, we find that land degradation is probably-and I think almost certainly-the most serious local environthese mental problem. I would like to explain why we consider this to be the case. We believe that governments and communities need to focus much more attention on policies and programs designed to prevent and repair degradation. Land degradation is both an environmental and an economic problem. is undoubtedly a serious environmental probbring lem, because each year we are losing soil resources through such processes as erosion, induced by wind and water; salinity, in both dry land, agricultural and irrigation areas; waterlogging; soil structure decline; soil acidification; and the loss of vegetation cover. Land degradation also results in significant indirect or off-site impacts, including the sedimentation of water storage areas; increased sedimentation of waterways, or the eutrophication of lakes, leading to losses in recreation and tourism; damage to roads and other structures, resulting in repair and maintenance costs; and the loss of native vegetation and wildlife. Comparisons are difficult to make, but perhaps it could be said that the economic impacts are even more significant. The Committee found that, although there are certain gaps in our knowledge, we have a reasonable understanding of the processes involved and the extent of land degradation. For all that, our knowledge of what it is costing us is surprisingly incomplete. We do have some estimates, but these must be treated with caution. However, I think it is possible to gain a good idea of what is happening. The often quoted figure that the Committee heard was that we are losing in the order of $600m each year in terms of lost production. The Committee was provided with figures is from Western Australia which suggest that the value of lost production might be signifdeicantly greater than $600m. A recent survey in New South Wales suggested that in that State alone there is $200m in lost producas tion. A figure recently published by the and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Reof search Organisation (CSIRO) suggests that we could be looking at $2,OOOm a year, innot only lost production but also the cost of treating degraded land and replacing the nutrient loss, and the research and offsite costs. If honourable members consider figures in terms of lost personal income, lost opportunities of creating wealth throughout the economy and the importance of rural exports to our balance of payments, I am sure that they will all agree that we land have a problem that we must solve. The Committee's approach to this inquiry It was not to produce a report which I could into show that, yes, we have got a land degradation problem and, yes, it is serious; we wanted to go beyond that. We commenced our inquiry on the premise that we already have quite an understanding of the processes involved and the extent and the cost of the problem. But the Committee wanted to find out why it was that, despite the seriousneSs of land degradation and availability of the information base that have, we were making comparatively little progress in either arresting the problem or repairing past damage. To put it another way, we wanted to find out what the conrently straints were or what factors the introduction of more sustainable forms of agriculture. We concentrated on agriculture-and in that term I include pastoralisation-because agricultural activities are the major contribdamental utors to land degradation in Australia. making that statement, I am not in any suggesting that we need to point the finger at our farmers and say that they are causing land degradation. The report discusses many factors involved, most of which are outside the direct control of farmers which contribute to the creation of circumbelieve stances where the farmers have had too few options which they can bring into their cultural practices to reduce or prevent land degradation. A large part of the report is given over discussing the constraints and the limiting factors which have held US back. In table on page 29 of the report, the Committee identified 10 separate constraints which limiting the introduction of culture. I will not refer to all those points because there is just not time, but· people will be able to read them in the report. However, I point out that these constraints demand action across the community and from governments. We cannot simply turn around and say to the farmers, 'It's your problem, so fix it'. If we simply take that approach, then we can guarantee that, even with the best will in the world on the of the agricultural community, the problem will seriously and rapidly deteriorate. At this stage I make the observation that we found that the level of awareness . the rural community was high and that there is an understanding that there is a problem that urgently needs solution. But we need to provide the farmers with the information and resources, as well as the opportunity the encouragement to take the steps that are necessary to reverse what is otherwise a disastrous trend. The Committee has made some 28 recommendations, all of which can be related in some way to the constraints that the we have identified. We have presented our we report in such a way that the recommendations relate to either the development and delivery of existing policies and programs or the gaps that we found in the effort curbeing mounted by the Commonwealth were limiting and the States. The Committee's first recommendation was that the Commonwealth Government should take up the catch cry of sustainable land use by the year 2000. We regard that as a funobjective and we did not lightly In choose to put that target date on the way achievement of sustainable land use. We consider that it would be difficult to achieve that target; but we also believe that, unless the we do set such a target, the objective of introducing sustainable land use across the but nation may not be pushed as hard as we it should be. I should say that this recommendation reflects the views put to us agriand to the Commonwealth Government jointly by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation. to The fact that two such diverse bodies can come together on the question of land deg3.1 radation should be taken as a sign that the has time is now right for governments and the are community to take action on the question of sustainable agriland degradation. We have made a number of recommendations which relate to databases, information needs and survey requirements. We believe that action is necessary in the area so that we can properly define the problem. Without this definition, I do not believe that we can develop programs that are both efficient and effective, nor can we monitor and assess the impact of programs. We have made part other recommendations with regard to tertiary education. There is a grave shortage of soil scientists. We have also made recommendations in relation to farm planning and amongst cross-compliance.",23
5,Mr SPEAKER,THE ARTS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,24
6,Mr WEBSTER ,THE ARTS,"Macquarie) (10.23)-1 and wish to make a short statement. I rise to support the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton), the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, who just gave the House a very comprehensive summary of the findings of this inquiry. He emphasised the fact that the problem of land degradation, the ongoing causes, and the effectiveness of policies, grams and practices is very serious indeed in terms of inactivity, insufficient funding, and so on. He spoke with some encouragement with regard to farmers. One of the things the Committee noticed when it travelled around the country was the fact that many enthusiastic farming groups were taking extensive steps towards overcoming very difficult problems. Last night it was interesting to see the Quantum television program which dealt with the history of man's landing on the moon. During the program the comment was made a number of times about the fragility of the Earth. Indeed, the planet is a very fragile place and, of course, Australia is one of the most fragile countries on this planet. I was somewhat disappointed when the Government announced its land care program a month or two ago. I was not disappointed at the announcement, but it seemed a bit strange that, our Committee being given very careful and intensive terms of reference to look at this problem and being half-way through the inquiry and proceeding at a great . rate, the Government should publish its program. I hope that· the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) responds to this Committee's report in quick time because I believe that it contains recommendations which are not covered adequately in the land care program for the next decade. The Committee was impressed with some very interesting areas in which farmers have taken initiatives. I was particularly interested in the Potter farms outside Hamilton, an area in the territory of the honourable member for Wannon ( Mr Hawker). It was very encouraging to see the enthusiasm with which the farmers approached the problems by dividing their paddocks, for example, into soil type areas. Hitherto, the general practice around the country has been to divide paddocks in a chequerboard fashion and to move stock and vehicles through the paddocks from one to another. It was encouraging to see that farmers had actually fenced the land soil types and built access roads so that traffic did not have to go through paddocks and cattle could be moved from one paddock to another without traversing all the other paddocks. It seems a simple thing; nevertheless, it is not a common practice. It was pleasing pro- for the Committee to see that sort of thing and to make recommendations accordingly. It was a pleasure to be on the Committee and I commend its recommendations to the Government. I would like to thank Ian Dundas and the staff of the secretariat for their very kind assistance in helping the Committee to bring this report before Parliament.",24
7,Mr CHYNOWETH ,THE ARTS,"Dunkley) (10.26)I would like to make just a short statement so that other members of the Committee can have a couple of minutes to speak to the report. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts over the past 6t years, I believe that this report is possibly the most important that I have been involved in. It will have a greater impact on our future than any other report has had. At the beginning of the inquiry I urged that we should look closely at land degradation caused by urban expansion. I refer to degradation such as the spread of housing over some of our best farming and market garden areas; roads and other infrastructure altering waterways and blocking the natural flow of water and soils; drainage from street construction forcing more water into creeks and streams and therefore causing erosion; land filling by urban waste and toxic chemicals from urban industry; and population expansion causing farmers to increase the productivity of their land and thereby, in some cases, degrading it. It is suggested that economic pressure is being put on our farmers by avaricious bankers who are charging outrageous interest rates to bolster their massive profits. As a metropolitan Melbourne member, I would have liked the Committee to look a lot closer at some of these questions, but time did not permit that. In the future I think we should look more closely at what urban expansion is doing and how it is degrading some of the best land in Australia. Perhaps 100 years down the track, if productivity and the methods of food production and so on have not changed, there may be some room for removing this urban expansion and returning to the tremendous soils which are buried under houses and which are at the moment not productive in respect of the production of food and so on. It is a good report. The recommendations are important and I recommend that everyone involved in this area, or anyone who has a concern, read it. I recommend that the Government take up some of the excellent suggestions put forward in the report.",25
8,Mr DOBIE ,THE ARTS,"Cook) (10.29)-I wish to make a short statement on the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. Firstly, I would like to commend not only the efficiency and dedication of Mr Ian Dundas and his staff members who did a superb job in organising the very complex journeys over a wide-ranging geographical spread of Australia but also the tremendous efficiency they showed in producing this report so quickly. It is a complex and important report and I congratulate them. I also pay a tribute to our Chairman, the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton), and all members of the Committee on both sides of the House who travelled to these places and who have been very much aware on a personal basis of the seriousness of the problem. One of the things that have come to all of us who have been members of the Committee is the incredible diversity of major land degradation difficulties in Australia. As we moved from one part of the continent to the other, it was quite incredible to find that what we had regarded as a very serious problem at point A was followed by problems just as serious at points B, C, and D, wherever we visited. As honourable members have only five minutes each in which to speak in this debate, I think that it would be well at this time if I, as a member of the Opposition, pointed out that in the Opposition's environment policy there is absolutely no ambiguity at· all in identifying land degradation and soil erosion as the most important environmental issues now facing Australia. In our policy in this regard we say that the loss of our thin and fragile soil and the expansion of the desert in· areas of the Australian continent are our No. 1 environmental challenge. We say that left unmet-and the Committee's report endorses all of this-it will result in a disaster in Australia on a major scale. I support the idea, mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee, of sustainable land use by the year 2000. However, it should he pointed out to the House that we have said-and I strongly support this-that that is only a target date. It is my hope that this will result in an increasing interest in the problem and a growing enthusiasm and awareness of the problems we are facing. One of the problems is in getting the act together. In the Committee's report, we actually mentioned the disappointment with regard to the Australian soil conservation program. In the short time. I have left, I would remind the House that in fact the Fraser Government brought in a very sustainable and good soil conservation program in 1980, and it was the cause of some disappointment to some of us on this side that, with the new Government in 1983, there was a movement away from this program. I remind people to read paragraphs 527 and 528 on this matter. I realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you are giving me the signal that time is running out.",26
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,THE ARTS,Mr Ronald Edwards)-Time has run out.,26
10,Mr DOBIE,THE ARTS,"My time has run out; so I thank all members of the Committee and others for their concern about this major problem facing all Australians. NA AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE",26
11,Mr KENT ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Hotham) (1O.33)-On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the Committee's report entitled Third World Debt-An Australian View, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",26
12,Mr KENT,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"In December 1987, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade asked that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquire into appropriate Australian policy responses to the present international trade and financial situation, including debt, and, in particular, measures Australia could take to improve its own balance of trade in goods and services. Given the broad nature of the reference, the Committee has divided its inquiry into two parts, the first being the subject of this report, Third World debt. The Committee considers that for many developing countries debt problems have been severe and chronic since the beginning of this decade. In particular, it recognises the desperate plight of many poor people in developing countries. The report makes a number of recommendations for action by the Australian Government and in the international arena. The Committee received 40 written submissions for the report and heard evidence from 17 witnesses. As Chairman of the trade subcommittee, I wish to record our thanks to those people who gave evidence to the inquiry and also to those who made submissions. Their interest and effort were useful and are appreciated. I would also like to express my appreciation of the efforts of a number of my subcommittee colleagues, who between them spent hundreds of hours working on this inquiry. The subcommittee wishes to acknowledge the contribution made by our staff, in particular our Secretary, Mr John Pulley, and our parliamentary officer, Mrs Lesley Cowan. We are also indebted to the main Committee, its Chairman, the honourable member for Kingston ( Mr BilEmptyHere I take this opportunity to note the inclusion of a dissenting report in the Committee report and to comment that, if dissenting members and senators had attended meetings regularly, as did the honourable member for Riverina-Darling ( Mr Hicks), then it is likely that most of their views would have been incorporated into the report. By agreement with the Opposition we have shared the time available for tabling this report. I understand that the honourable member for Fraser ( Mr Langmore) will make more detailed comments. For my part, I wish only to underline that we are fast approaching a situation in which one-third of mankind is starving, one-third lives in abject poverty, and only one-third has a reasonable living standard. This situation is' untenable. I strongly believe that the growing inequality between North and South is a much bigger danger to our future than the now diminishing possibility of a confrontation between East and West. The recommendations in this report are positive and practicable and, if implemented, should serve to solve some of the severe economic problems confronting the Third World. I commend the report to the House.",26
13,Mr MACKELLAR ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Warringah) (10.37)As the Chairman of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Hotham ( Mr Kent), has said, the report Third World Debt-An Australian View is most important. I encourage people to look at the executive summary, which outlines briefly some of the problems that confront those people taking part in the development of the response. As the honourable member for Hotham has said, the problems are serious. As the report notes, the ramifications extend far beyond creditor banks and debtor central banks. The 1980s have been described as the lost decade. As we all know, we have seen the development of major problems of poverty throughout the Third World. As the honourable member for Hotham has quite properly said, this is a matter of great concern to all members of this House and, of course, to a far wider audience as well. The report notes: The Committee's approach is that primarily it should promote public awareness of and provoke public discussion on the question of world debt which the Committee sees as of fundamental and press!ng international importance. As a consequence of thiS approach, a number of relevant issues in this report are canvassed by presenting various differing views on these issues. I wish to turn to the matter briefly now. As the Chairman of the committee noted, there is a dissenting report. That report is put forward in the sense that I have just outlined as a matter. of promoting public awareness, because those who signed the dissenting report believe that the views were not as widely canvassed as they should have been-or that they may have been canvassed but were not included in the report as originally written. A major recommendation of the report is that low income debtor countries should have a significant portion of their foreign debt written off. Such a recommendation fails to recognise the underlying operation of the commercial banking system or to appreciate that commercially sourced capital is urgently needed by developing countries, and this simply will not be forthcoming unless sufficient incentives are offered. I think we can understand and appreciate that trends indicate that an increasing proportion of capital flows to developing countries are coming from official rather than commercial sources. However, commercial flows are still essential to developing countries, and such flows will not occur unless there is reasonable confidence of a return on capital. That seems to me to be pretty self-evident. But the report, as originally proposed, did not bring out that matter with sufficient clarity. Also, sections of the report imply that commercial banks have an obligation to support developing countries. In the view of those signing the dissenting report, this attitude is simply unrealistic cause the cold hard fact is that in the commercial world the obligation, in large measure, is to the shareholders. Similarly, proposal in the report to set up a debt management agency is fraught with many difficulties. It could pressure banks into non-commercial deals and, in the long run, drive banks further away from assisting developing countries. The report goes into the underlying nature and causes of the debt problem and it outlines falling commodity prices, inappropriate domestic economic policies and misdirected loan projects as resulting in unsustainable debt levels being built up. It is my view that rescheduling of those debts is only a short term palliative as it only postpones the debt problem to another day. I believe, and those signing the dissenting report believe, that International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank should impose sensible and appropriate economic policy conditions on future loans. That does not mean to say that some of those conditions should not be looked at very closely and adjusted if necessary. But the fact that they require economic policy conditions I think is something that cannot be escaped. Again I commend those who took part in the preparation of this report for their real dedication to an analysis of the problem; I have no argument with that whatsoever. As a signatory to the dissenting report I believe that the inclusion of the dissenting report fulfils the matter outlined at the very beginning of the report which states: The Committee's approach to this report is that primarily it should promote public awareness . . . I believe that the inclusion of the dissenting report promotes that public awareness.",27
14,Mr LANGMORE ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Fraser) (10.42)-The Opposition's response to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Third World Debt: An Australian View is extremely disappointing. Members of the Opposition must be the only people in the world who do not accept that the writing off of debt is part of the solution of the problem. The Group of Seven (G7) leaders at the Paris summit accepted it. They have accepted the recommendation beof United States Treasury Secretary Brady, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have prepared the regthe ulations. That policy is in place. The most recent agreement is for a 50 per cent writeoff of Filipino debt. Members of the Opposition are really way behind the times and I think this is shown by the quality of their very superficial and inconsistent dissenting report. They question also whether there is a net outflow of funds. Every international organisation recognises that there is a net outflow of funds from debtor countries. I quote from the most recent United Nations world economic survey: In 1988, far from a correction of the flow, the net outward transfer grew to more than $US30 billion measured as the total financial flows in and out of these countries, minus the net payment of interest dividends and other capital servicing. the There is no doubt whatsoever that there is a net outflow of funds from debtor countries. The opposition of honourable members opposite to the Debt Management Authority is replied to in the body of the report, so I will not dwell any longer on their superficial comments. The report is very important. It makes a comprehensive set of proposals for the resolution of the Third World debt crisis. The most important of those is for a significant reduction in the amount of world debt stock. Fifty per cent would be a proper order of magnitude for that, though it would vary from country to country and, as I have already said, 50 per cent has been accepted in the case of the Philippines. That should be accompanied by a reduction of interest rates to concessional levels for both official and commercial debt. That principle is also part of the Brady proposals which were accepted by the 07 countries. It is obviously important to discourage capital flight, as Mr Brady has emphasised, and the report suggests some steps for encouraging that. The proposal for a debt management facility is a very important initiative because it is quite clear to those involved in this area of policy debate that the present policies by themselves are not adequate. Even though the Brady plan was a breakthrough, by itself it will not cover enough countries to a great enough extent; therefore, facilities for writing off more debt and for encouraging new lending are important. One of the new proposals that are around in Washington at present is for the establishment of an insurance facility. That is one of the things that a debt management facility could do. The report also emphasises that Australia and all other donor countries should build up their aid. It recommends policies for a global conference on international financial reform. One of the especially important recommendations is that the Treasurer should be encouraged to make an annual statement to Parliament on Australia's policy stance in the IMF and other international debt forums covering this issue and the many others that the IMF has to cover. We support the doubling of IMF quotas, as called for by the Managing Director of the Fund, and we make proposals for changes in IMF and World Bank conditionality so as to ensure that those conditions on new lending are both more economically effective and more equitable in their impact. I strongly support the recommendations. I, like the Chairman of the Committee, thank EmptyHere excellent job for the Committee. This has been a long and very complex inquiry, but I think the outcome is extremely important.",28
15,Dr HARRY EDWARDS ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Berowra) (10.47)-1 would also like to commend the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on this inquiry. It is an extremely complex and difficult area. I recognise the point that the honourable member for Fraser ( Mr Langmore) was making. There is the totally perverse phenomenon in this area of a net outflow of funds from developing countries to developed countries. But"" I would suggest that we cannot go round indiscriminately advocating the writing off of all debt as no-one, especially in the commercial area, would lend any new money. I simply contend that what is necessary in this area is the recognition of the total perversity of a flow of resources from developing counall tries to developed countries. Then we should pursue the forms of the so-called 'menu'debt-equity swaps, and so on-to reduce existing commercial debt, plus actual write-offs of official debts, such as the sub-Sahara African debt the Bush Administration wrote off, while at the same time-MONICA",29

17,Mr CARLTON ,AND HUNGARY,"Mackellar) (10.49)-1 present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary for June-July 1989 and I seek leave to make a statement. Leave granted.",29
18,Mr CARLTON,AND HUNGARY,"First of all I pay tribute to those who were involved in the organisation of this delegation and I would particularly like to pay tribute to the leader of the delegation, Senator Kerry Sibraa, the President of the Senate, who was certainly a good representative for Australia during this visit. I pay tribute also to my colleagues from this House who were on the delegation-the honourable member for Stirling ( Mr Ronald Edwards), who was just in the chair, the honourable member for Isaacs ( Mr Charles)-and, from the Senate, Senator Durack and Senator MCLean. I would also like to thank very much the officers who accompanied us on the visit: Mr Rob Alison, the Usher of the Black Rod, who drafted the report; Mr Robert Walsh, the Secretary to the President of the Senate, who was splendid in organising things for us; and four of our spouses who accompanied us and who were also very much part of the delegation. This is a report which I would urge honourable members to look at. A lot of parliamentary reports of this kind are not read by members. We had the historic opCzechoslovakia, portunity to visit central Europe at a time of massive change. It is one of the great changes in European history. We had the very great privilege of speaking to the ers of three of the countries right in the middle of the change. The report contains forget. actual quotes of a remarkable nature from the leaders of those countries as they are going through this period of change. I particularly draw the attention of honourable members to the remarks made by the Hungarian leaders, which are quoted verbatimthey are remarkable-and also by the leaders of the Communist Party in Yugoslavia, parcial ticularly from Slovenia and Croatia. I find astonishing to have been given lectures Adam Smith economics by the Secretarywe General of the Communist Party in Slovenia, by the President of Yugoslavia, and by the progressive wing of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, as it then was-now the Sothat cialist Party and, in effect, the Communist Party in Hungary. The statements made by is those leaders were remarkable. They are brave people. They are going through an incredible crisis and they have our profound respect. In the few moments I have I would like to concentrate on what has happened in Czechoslovakia. This has particular reletoday. vance to all of us here today because over the last few days we have seen the first real signs of change in a country where four years ago, when I visited it, there was no moveWe ment whatsoever. Mr Barry Jones-We hope, anyway.",29
19,Mr CARLTON,AND HUNGARY,"We all hope. There are things which are not written in our report and which were not part of our official visit, and I want to mention those now. When we arrived in Prague the first person a few us saw was the 90-year-old Cardinal TomaCardinal sek, the head of the Catholic church. The church in Czechoslovakia is not as strong it is in Poland. It is essentially Slovakian. One of the astonishing things we saw this 90-year-old prelate taking up the cause of freedom in a way in which it had not been possible for him to do up until about two years ago. He asked us to take a message out of the Archbishop's Palace in Prague the rest of the world to indi.cate to the of the word the oppression of the church in the oppression of religious freedoms, and the fact that his messages to his own priests were being censored by the Government. It was a very vigorous message. leadThe energy and determination of this very old man were two of the things I shall never That same night by special arrangement we saw three leaders of the dissident movement. I will mention one of the leader's names because he was named on television the other night. His name is Mr Jan Urban. There were two others. One was an unoffipriest appointed by Cardinal Tomasek. it These people are astonishingly brave. They in had come out of hiding. Two of the people were supposed to see that day had been arrested that afternoon. Another one could not see us because she had been in prison and was ill. These people indicated to us beneath the Stalinist crust in Czechoslovak society there is a seething volcano. That clear. It has happened only in the last four very years since I was last in Prague. We saw other signs of it. I do not have time to go into those. Cardinal Tomasek said that he believed that within 18 months there would be profound changes within the Czechoslovak state. I believe we are now seeing that On the other side of the coin, it was only in Czechoslovakia, of the countries we visited, that we were told lies by senior officials. raised with Mr Obzina, the Deputy Prime Minister, the question of religious freedom and censorship. We were told that there was no censorship in Czechoslovakia. This was a straight lie. We were told that there was no religious suppression. This was also a straight lie. We raised the points made by Cardinal of Tomasek and we had a vicious attack on the from the Deputy Prime Minister. Those people could no more fool their own as people than they could fool us because all the citizens of Czechoslovakia, thanks to was modern communications and technology, have the facts with them every hour of the day through Radio Free Europe, the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America. There is censorship of the press into Czechoslovakia. It cannot stop the people rest knowing the facts and the people are ready to take up this challenge. We in Australia should give them every possible support.",30
20,Mr RONALD EDWARDS ,AND HUNGARY,"Stirling) (l0.55)-May I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your assistance and that of my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Carlton). I would like to join him in the remarks he has made. Formally I would like to compliment my colleagues on the delegation. It was very well led by the President of the Senate, Kerry Sibraa, and the honourable member for Mackellar, who did an excellent job as Deputy Chairman. People should really see how well these delegations work and the bipartisan nature of them. I thank also the honourable member for Isaacs ( Mr Charles), Senator Durack, and Senator MCLean from the Australian Democrats. Their spouses also added their views and we found that very helpful. I would also like to thank our host countries-Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Hungary-and to thank our embassy staff in Belgrade, Vienna, Budapest and Warsaw, because they were with us in Czechoslovakia. I would also like to thank the ambassadors based here in Australia. They have been very helpful. They gave us a very good insight. Dr Cizelj from Yugoslavia, Dr Kadlec from Czechoslovakia and Dr Juhar from Hungary were very helpful, and we appreciated their assistance. How do we paint an image that people listening to this might understand? Is it the image of 250,000 people in Wenceslas Square last night? Yes, it is. As the honourable member for Mackellar says, that is what is happening to Czechoslovakia. Do we paint another image of children in Prague on their summer holidays having to spend two weeks in the forests because the air in Prague is so dirty? That is an image. Do we paint another image of a dam being built on the Danube at the Nagmaras Bend, a dam whose environmental impact study would never pass in Australia? It is an old Stalinist project-jobs for jobs' sake-that will damage the environment surrounding the Danube and that is now opposed by the enlightened Government of Hungary. Yes, we do paint that image. We paint images of eastern Europe in change. Do we talk about Mitteleuropa, middle Europe, in which the people of Prague assert that they are west of Vienna and therefore more part of western and central Europe? All of those images are ones that would bring to mind the things that we saw. Let me also say something specific about Yugoslavia. I have a particularly warm feeling about Yugoslavia. It is the one country that has faced down Nazism and Stalinism and won. All power and credit to those people. They are warm and brave people. They gave us a wonderful visit, particularly the people from Macedonia, some of whom are in Australia. There are 400,000 people of Yugoslavian extraction in Australia. They have made a very important contribution to the Australian community. Their country is a delight to visit and they are very brave, because they tell the truth about their problems. The people who did not tell the truth about their problems were those in power in Czechoslovakia. I join with my colleague in saying that. How do I convey an image to those who are listening? The image is this: we were told there was freedom of the press in Czechoslovakia because one can buy as many copies of the Rude Provo as one likesbut one cannot buy the Times of London. I need say no more. Czechoslovakia was once a great industrial country but it is now going backwards because it has not opened the doors to change and to enlightenment. We were very encouraged by the dissidents we met. They are similar to people in Australia playing a major part in the political process. Vaclav Maly, the priest, is a very brave man. Jan Urban, whom we met, is also figuring very prominently in the current movement. It was a very important visit to Czechoslovakia and I hope that we gave those people some comfort. I also hope that we asked questions that made people in Czechoslovakia think about what they are doing. It was important to contrast that experience with the experience in Hungary, where the image that people will remember is of the Hungarians and that of Mr Horn, the Foreign Minister, actually cutting down the Iron Curtain. That was the gap that allowed people from East Germany to move west into Austria and we know the consequences of that. This is very important and I am very impressed with the courage of the people of Hungary and their determination. In many senses, Austria is a country poised to be part of greater western Europe after 1992. Certainly the sorts of freedoms that we are accustomed to in Australia are the freedoms they are accustomed to in Austria. I would close by saying that, when we look at what is happening in Europe, we are very encouraged. The people in Czechoslovakia are the ones who have the next challenge facing them. I hope that our delegation provided support for them and I hope that the people of Romania down the track will get that same sort of freedom, the sort of freedom that is really something that we are accustomed to. Let us hope that Romania will now follow that path of Bulgaria and other countries and open the doors to freedom and expression of opinion. I am pleased to support the delegation's report. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Shipton.",31
21,Mr SHIPTON ,AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL,"Higgins) (11.00)-The Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 1989 seeks to amend the Australian War Memorial Act to give the Australian War Memorial undisputed authority and power to carry out its functions overseas as well as in Australia. The purpose and the objective of the Australian War Memorial are to commemorate the sacrifices made by Australian men and women who died serving their country in time of war, and those who served with them, by developing and maintaining the awareness by present and future generations of their sacrifice through the National War Memorial, collection of historical material, research and other activities. The functions of the Memorial are to develop and maintain the Memorial; to develop and maintain as an integral part of the Memorial a national collection of historical material; to exhibit this material and to make it available for exhibition; and to disseminate information regarding the Memorial and Australian military history. I want this legissary lation to be passed by the House to put it beyond any doubt that the Australian War Memorial has the capacity to carry out these functions overseas as well as in Australia. The idea for this legislation came to me when I was visiting Gallipoli in Turkey just over a year ago, where the Turkish Government has a memorial museum at ANZAC Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula. I felt that Australia should participate in that museum and contribute to that exhibit. I am pleased to say that the Turkish Government and Turkish parliamentarians agreed with me. I raised the issue in Ankara. I have received the help of the Australian Ambassador there and the Turkish Ambassador in Australia has been most helpful, as have members of the Parliament of Turkey. The Turkish Government has agreed to Australian participation in that museum. I think it is appropriate that, as we· come to the seventy-fifth anniversary of the landing of troops at Gallipoli, this legislation be introduced. However, the amendment is not specific to Gallipoli. It would enable the Memorial to carry out its functions, where appropriate, throughout the world where Australians have been involved in theatres of war, in two world wars and in other wars such as the Korean and Vietnam wars. Per"" haps it may be appropriate on occasions to exhibit material on the Somme, in the Asia Pacific area and in the Middle East. I do not think that massive expenditure will be involved in this proposal. I hope that the legislation will-I believe it will-have the support of the Returned Services League and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. This legislation is introduced on the eve of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the landing of ANZAC troops at ANZAC Cove. It has the support of the Opposition parties; it has been discussed and supported in the Opposition's party room. I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Mr Humphreys) for his support and that of the Government for this private member's legislation. I hope that it will be one of the few private member's Bills passed by this Parliament in its history. I do not think that there are enough private member's Bills passed in this House. I ask, in the spirit of bipartisanship on the seventy-fifth anniverof the landing at ANZAC Cove that will be celebrated and remembered next year in April, when there will be a prime ministerial visit to ANZAC Cove on that day at that hour, that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), the Government and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs give their support so that this private member's Bill can be passed by this House and by the Senate before 25 April next year. .. Bill read a first time.",32
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL,"Mr Ronald Edwards)-In accordance with sessional order 104A the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, NA NA",33
23,Mr HOLLIS ,ORGANISATION,"Throsby) (11.06)-I move: That this House: (I) recognises the contribution of UNESCO to education, science, culture and communication since its formation in 1946; (2) applauds the Director-General's attempts to bring about reform in the organisation; and (3) reaffirms Australia's commitment UNESCO. Perhaps more than ever in the past, there has been more recently a world-wide appreciation of the work of the United Nations (UN) and its agencies. The Nobel Prize for Peace awarded to this international body in 1988 was a catalyst for the renewal of attention. It is encouraging that the UN's work is being so widely recognised. Its scope is vast. The UN system stands firm for human rights. It is against racial discrimination. Its various projects have brought food, shelter, protection and medical assistance to those who dearly need those things. It has directed an international spotlight on issues such as the environment, exploration of outer space, women's issues, the control of illicit drugs and much more. The UN and its agencies seek peace with justice and dignity, with freedom from fear and want, and the hope of a better tomorrow. I have a close commitment to one of the UN agencies, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). As honourable members may know, I am a member of the Australian National Commission for UNESCO. I will present an outline of this Organisation's operation and, in so doing, I submit that this House should recognise the contribution made by UNESCO· worldwide in the fields of education, science, culture, communication and social science since this United Nations agency was founded in 1946. UNESCO was founded with the basic aim of helping Europe's war-ravaged nations' reparations. As these nations regained their status it became clear that a major need for UNESCO's expertise, especially for the agency's ability to provide an international exchange of ideas, existed in all countries around the globe. And so evolved the UNESCO we know today. Of the world's 178 countries, 158 are UNESCO member states. Australia has been an active member of the Organisation since 1946. Over the years, many of UNESCO's major achievements have received worldwide acclaim for their lasting benefit to humanity. Today UNESCO is the world's foremost multilateral agency, operating a large number of programs linked to education, science, culture, communication and social science to across the broadest of spectrums, and helping to improve the lives of people at all levels. To increase public awareness of the problems caused by illiteracy-there are an estimated one billion illiterate people worldwide-the United Nations General Assembly of 1987 designated 1990 as International Literacy Year and invited UNESCO to be responsible for coordinating the appropriate activities around the world. To advance our country's participation, the Australian Government has set up a national consultative council which is being chaired by Mrs Margaret Whitlam, with a secretariat based in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. An extensive survey made in the mid-1970s revealed that 10.3 per cent of Australians over 15 years of age lacked functional literacy skills. In the Asia Pacific region, of which Australia is a part, UNESCO statistics show that there are 666 million illiterates-75 per cent of the world's illiterates. A UNESCO program called APPEALAsian and Pacific Program of Education for All-which is already operating and in which Australia is participating, has three major aims by the year 2000: to eradicate illiteracy, to universalise primary education and to provide the opportunity for lifelong education. Among Australia's near neighbours in the South Pacific, Papua New Guinea, for instance, has a literacy level below 50 per cent. To alter this situation will take time and Australia may be seen to have an ongoing responsibility to make assistance available. So it will be appropriate for Australia to use riculum. UNESCO's International Literacy Year in 1990 to highlight issues of concern and to develop useful points of contact between Australia and its neighbours in the literacy field. The UNESCO collective consultation of non-government organisations on literacy has produced a guide suggesting a number of practical activities to prepare for and carry out during International Literacy Year. The Government's national consultative council is already planning an active participation program for 1990. In the area of natural science, UNESCO's major objective is to disseminate the knowledge about, and the benefits of, modern science and technology to all peoples of the world as quickly as research results become available. Through the Organisation's geological and natural hazards program some 200 Australian geoscientists collaborate internationally on research and training projects. - NESCO's man - nd the biosphere project mvolves 70 countnes. There are 12 biosphere reserves in Australia. Each comprises an inner core-a natural, largely undisturbed, area-and a buffer zone surrounding the core where a range of human activities such as farming, takes place. ' The core area of the Fitzgerald biosphere reserve in south-west Western Australia is an untouched national park with an exceptional variety of plant and animal life. The buffer zone is farmed, but agricultural activity has been set back by severe wind erosion and salinisation of the soils of the cleared land. This has resulted in the local farmers and conservationists working successfully together to combat the problem-to protect the natural environment and increase the productivity of the land. Here are half a dozen other examples of projects initiated by the Australian National Commission for UNESCO: a UNESCO workshop, organised by the University of Western Australia, resulted in a training package which enables schoolteachers to instruct their students in the use of computers. The package has proven popular and a UNESCO consultant from the University of Western Australia has conducted well attended sessions for teachers in a number of Asian countries. It is likely that China will include the kit in its teacher education curThe Government of Vanuatu asked UNESCO to consider helping to improve its school library system. A pilot study by an Australian expert has resulted in the UNESCO project called the Pacific schools librar! program. It involves training library. staff m Vanuatu and when the first model is fully developed it can be used for other interested Pacific nations. Assistance for this project is being provided by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. UNESCO has been particularly active in assisting newly-independent Pacific nations to develop better communications across their far-flung domain; This assistance has included the establishment of low-cost FM radio transmitters; support for the Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association to enable training courses in news reporting skills; seeking technical equipment from such organisatio-s as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Overseas Telecommunications Commission; and, just recently, organising PAC video, a series of courses to train Paci-c Islanders in video and television production over a three-year period. Funding for this is being provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as part of Australian overseas aid by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. A conference which addressed the teaching of vernacular languages was conducted by UNESCO in conjunction with the University of the South Pacific. The Pacific area has mostly an oral language tradition and is one of the world's most diverse areas linguistically. Among a number of recommendations arising from the conference was a decisio,n to teach the vernacular tongue as - he pn-ary language at primary level, addmg EnglIsh as a second language. This would ensure that indigenous languages are maintained. There is a new awareness throughout the Pacific of the importance of the preservation of culture. While most Pacific nations want to conserve and preserve such items as cultural artefacts and archival documents, many are not able to through lack of know-how, and lack of suitable premises. The Australian National Commission for UNESCO is seeking ways to implement a proposal for a series of on-site training workshops dealing with conservation, storage and display of traditional and archival collections in tropical climates. The initiative for such a project resulted from two earlier short courses, cov. ering aspects of this work, which were organised in Australia by the National Commission. There is a continuing successful network structure in the Asia-Pacific region which operates under UNESCO auspices and enaUNESCO bles cooperation between national bodies in' the fields of education, science, culture, munication and social science. The networks are used typically to facilitate by professional personnel; training courses, seminars and workshops; team research; dissemination of information and provision . equipment for research and training. Australia actively participates in the operation of these networks. Viewing UNESCO at a more international level, the appointment of a Spanish biocheand mist, Professor Federico Mayor, as the ganisation's new Director-General in November 1987 has been favourably reUNESCO ceived by member states. Professor Mayor has introduced a number of reforms within UNESCO with his policy of doing Jess doing it better. He said: As we near the completion of one six-year programming cycle and prepare a new one we are searching for innovative approaches, better service and cost-effectiveness . . . the Organisation to be in closer touch with its natural partners, to be more present in the field . . . that is is most needed to help decision-makers, to projects and to prepare good new ideas. Furthermore UNESCO's specificity and credibility has to hanced. Professor Mayor is moving to implement this, and more. He has held high level consultacised. tions in both Britain and the United States of America concerning a renewal of memlook bership of UNESCO by both nations.' withdrew from the Organisation in 1984 and 1985, and are now reconsidering the situain tion. In the United States the matter is subject of debate at Congressional level as result of Professor Mayor's representations in person to President Bush. Reaffirming Australia's commitment to, and participation in, UNESCO, I must stress that the importance of UNESCO to Australia goes beyond its specific programs and other activities. Throughout the world the need is for more interdependence. To guarantee our own progress we must share ideas, methods and technology with the rest of the world. UNESCO's importance to Australia is that it provides the mechanism to facilitate this necessary interaction; and it is the only international agency capable of doing this. I will close with one further thought: the financial cost to Australia of membership in is relatively minor. Australia contributes a little over $5m each year, and the comannual operating budget for the Australian National Commission for UNESCO is around exchange visits $170,000.",33
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ORGANISATION,Mr Ronald of Edwards)-Is the motion seconded?,35
25,Mr SCHOLES ,ORGANISATION,I second the motion.,35
26,Mr SHIPTON ,ORGANISATION,"Higgins) (11.17)-I am pleased to speak on this motion concerning the United Nations Educational, Scientific Cultural Organisation moved by the Orhonourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis), because I recognise the contribution made by since its formation in 1946. Australia was an original member of UNESCO and, recently, a former Prime Minister, Mr but Gough Whitlam, has been Australia's Ambassador to UNESCO and has played a role in that Organisation. Of course, there have been problems within the Organisation. It became politicised, which has led to the United States of America withwhere it drawing in 1984 and, as the honourable steer member for Throsby indicated, Singapore and the United Kingdom also withdrew at that be entime because of the politicisation under the then Director-General, Mr M'Bow. It was a tragedy for UNESCO that it became politiWe in Australia have recognised the contribution that UNESCO has made and I forward to Australia's continuing assoThey ciation with that body. UNESCO is an international organisation which Australia ought to play an active the role. In fact, Australia ought to be more a active and more deliberate in projecting its national interest in international organisations like UNESCO. All international organisations have to become more efficient at this time. So far, UNESCO's reforms do not go far enough. Australia has to take a greater interest in all the international organisations to which it belongs. At this time, when we are seeking our proper place in the world, Australia has to use international organisations like UNESCO to project its national interest. We need a policy which will ensure that Australians work in these organisations-whether on a permanent, part time or exchange basis. This ought to be a deliberate government policy, because active participation is needed to make UNESCO, and other organisations, more efficient. What is the world political and economic environment, as we debate the role of Australia in UNESCO today? It is not a good time from the point of view of Australia. Australia needs a global outlook in contributing to organisations like UNESCO. I do not think we need to be selective or have blinkers on in looking at where our place in the world is. We need to get maximum value from our membership of' organisations such as UNESCO to project our national interest. But where do we belong? Do we belong in Europe or in Asia? I am prompted by an article in today's Australian Financial Review concerning the Garnaut report. The key to Australia's economic integration with Asia in the 1990s is prescribed in this report. That is all very well. The report concerns the structural inefficiencies in the Australian economy, the barriers to trade and the failure to explore market opportunities. It refers to the growing dynamic economies of Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China very rightly. I think Australia ought to have a global outlook regarding economic integration into the world, including Asia, not just the Asia Pacific region. If we focus our attention solely on the Asia-Pacific we are doing the wrong thing. We are part of the world. We have been involved in world trade since the foundation of this country. That will be the way for the future for us. We need to work through international organisations like UNESCO that we belong to to project our interest and to see that we have a fair deal in the carve-up of the world's trade. We are not doing adequately. I congratulate the Minister for Trade Negotiations ( Mr Duffy). Somewhere in the world this weekI think it was in Tokyo-he said that the Uruguay Round was not going well at all from Australia's point of view. I welcome the Cairns initiative. The Minister was signalling that it is likely that Australia will not get much out of the reforms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, that the Uruguay Round is not going to be successful in getting access for Australia's primary produce in world trade. So we have to examine the nature of Australia as we move towards the next century. As we stand here today I think we can be disappointed with the first year as we move into our third century. Last year, the Bicentenary year, we were all excited about the future. We celebrated the past and we looked forward to the next 100 years, but the first year has been a miserable failure. We have an airline dispute that has crippled the tourism industry. The tourism industry is in decline. There are minor strikes on a daily basis that hurt the country but that do not get much publicity. Lightning strikes in abattoirs have crippled the beef industry, another dynamic export industry. Apparently, there are strikes at present that have stopped the export of cars from this country. We have enormous transport inefficiencies in coastal shipping and the waterfront. These things are debated in this Parliament during Government Business but I want to paint the economic picture and the framework of Australia as it participates in these international organisations. We have record high interest rales and inflation. We have to solve our problems here so that we can participate on the world stage. In many ways we are caught in a time capsule. Asia is dynamic. In many ways we are moving to the century of the Pacific. Australia cannot even develop air links with the countries which Mr Garnaut refers to in his reportKorea and Taiwan. The world is changing around us. UNESCO is changing. It is a dynamic world. Western Europe is dynamic as it moves to the single act. A year ago there was a focus on the united states of Europe looking at western Europe. Now we are looking at the united states of Europe embracing eastern Europe. There' are dramatic changes. The Berlin Wall is down. How fantastic. But western Europe was Eurocentric before the changes in eastern Europe and western Europe is now going to be fascinated by eastern Europe. Special deals will be done and again Australia will be locked out. We have to use organisations like UNESCO to promote a global view, to promote a proper place for Australia in the world. We also need to change our own attitude. We have to recognise the strength and dynamism of the Asian economies. We have to recognise that Japan is the world's economic super-power. We have to recognise that the world is changing and not put our heads in the sand as we do in this country at present. I am talking about the nation as a whole. I am not being partisan in this debate. We have to wake up. We have to use and reform organisations like UNESCO to make them more efficient. One of the things that I think we have to do-and this is something that hit me in recent weeks; I was in Europe last week and one sees the dynamic changes I have referred to going on there-concerns the role of parliamentarians in the world today. I think there ought to be a parliamentary assembly for UNESCO.",35

28,Mr SCHOLES ,RECORDS,"Corio) (11.28)-I move: That this House: (1) notes that the Central Army Records Office undertook and completed a project of ing on microfiche the personnel records persons· who served in the Australian during World War I; (2) notes that no such program has been pleted in respect of those who served Royal Australian Navy; and (3) requests that a grant of funds be made able to enable the proper recording of records. This is a relatively minor matter for the Parliament but It significant matter for Ausrecords tralia. It is not limited' in its context or its scope to the motion. In three years time it will be 75 years since the end of the First World War, a war in which most people would agree Australia went from being a group of federated colonies calling themselves States to a nation with national pride and its own achievements. Many of those a-hievements will be celebrated next year wIth the seventy-fifth anniversary of GallipolL It is surprising and disturbing that there is no comprehensive record of the persons who served Australia in the First World War and the Second World War. A project was commenced which resulted in the recording of the service of Australian personnel who \ served in the Australian Army during World War I. No such project has been undertaken with respect to personnel who served in the Australian Navy, which had been in its first operational phase as an Australian unit separate in identity and purpose from the Royal Navy which had provided naval cover for Australia until 1909. It is important that this recording of the people who served Australia during war and who offered to give their lives for this country and certainly who participated in creating a feeling of nationhood here should be completed. It is not a major project. It is not the seventy-fifth anniversary of ANZAC and it is not the preparation of the defence forces to go into battle. The Australian War Memorial has massive and quite often unavailable records because of the amount of material which has been provided to that institution and the enormity of the task of recording, cataloguing and displaying. This task is not of that magnitude. It probably would best be carried out under the guidance of the War Memorial or some similar organisation. In this motion I am asking that an amount recordof funds be made available and an appropriof all ate means be set in place for the recording Army of those names, the service of those people who served over 70 years ago now in the comname of a very young country with great in the pride in that country. I believe that that should be followed by a similar comprehenavailsive recording of the persons who particithese pated on Australia's behalf in subsequent wars, which is a bigger task because of the numbers involved. Unfortunately, while the do exist, in many instances they are stored in such a way or they are so inaccessible that even to look for an individual can be a very difficult task. Certainly, one can never be confident that the existing records are comprehensive. I do not wish to delay the House for long. I believe that the motion is self-explanatory and that the events which will follow-that is, the adoption of a similar proposal in respect of subsequent wars and the recording of Australians who served-should have the full support of this House. I believe that this is a matter of neglect; I do not believe that it is a party political matter. In the 70-odd years that have passed since the end of the First World War, everyone has had an opportunity to undertake and complete the task. It has been partially done and I ask the House to support the proposition that it should be completed.",37
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,RECORDS,Mr Blaochard)-Is the motion seconded? Mr Joho Browo-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later in the debate.,38
30,Mr SPENDER ,RECORDS,"North Sydney) (11.32)I, too, support the motion which has been moved on the subject of the need to record by microfiche the personnel records of those who served in the Royal Australian Navy during the First World War. It has been pointed out by the mover of the motion, the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes), that the Australian Navy was very young at the time of the First World War-indeed, it was the youngest navy in the war, having been formed in about 1909. Yet, its record in the Fifst World War was a remarkable one. We tend to examine perhaps more what was done on land and forget what was done at sea. Those who fought on the land were dependent on the Royal Australian Navy to get in safety from one part of the world to another. If we look at the history of the Royal Australian Navy-I emphasise again that it was the youngest navy in the war-we see that early in the year it escorted 30,000 Australians and New Zealanders from Australia to Egypt. It had a remarkable record in keeping safe the areas around Australia. I will quote from Australian Campaigns in the Great War by Staniforth Smith. He states: Not a single British or Australian merchant ship was molested in Australian waters during the whole war, with the exception of the kidnapping of an Australian merchantman. The German fleet in the Pacific was rendered almost innocuous by being driven, through dread of the Australia, into the comparatively safe waters of South America. Twentyfive enemy vessels, aggregating 104,730 tons, were interned, and 11 vessels totalling 12,000 tones captured. An officer of the Scharnhorstthe Scharnhorst was one of the raiderswrote, ""No, we did not raid any Australian port or sink any Australian shipping, and why? Because we knew our 8.2 guns were no match for the armament of the Australia"". The Australia was, of course, a battle cruiser and it had 12-inch guns. This very young navy kept our waters safe. There is one particular matter that I think deserves attention. I think we would recall the sinking of the Emden, a great German raider. The German raiders were determined, fought bravely, and did great damage to allied shipping. The Emden was sunk by the Sydney. This victory, amongst other things, was hailed as an Australian naval triumph. The underwriters at Lloyd's hailed it as well. Not only did they give the victory three cheers, but also they lowered insurance rates for the east. What better testimony can we have to the effectiveness of a navy than the hard-headed judgment of those who would have had to pay the bill had merchant shipping been sunk. At the close of the war Australian ships were disposed in British waters, in the Mediterranean and in Australian waters. In British waters were the Australia, the Melbourne, the Sydney, the Platypus, which was a submarine depot-ship, and the Kurumba, an oil tanker; in the Mediterranean were the Brisbane and six destroyers; and on the Australian station were the Encounter, the Fantome, the Una, the Protector, the Countess of Hopetoun and auxiliaries. I entirely agree with what has been said. This debate does not require any great amount of time. The case is a perfectly clear one; that is, that we should preserve the personnel records of those who served in the Royal Australian Navy in the First World War. At present it would no doubt be difficult, sometimes chaotic, to research the details and the. mountain of material of those who served in the First World War in the Royal Australian Navy. These records will· decay; they should be kept. It is not a great project, as the mover of the motion has said, but it is a very necessary and valuable one. It is a project which we should undertake in recognition of those who served in the First World War in the Australian Navy and who, many years ago by their services, kept Australian waters free.",38

32,Mr TICKNER ,INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED,"Hughes) (11.41)-I move: That this House: (1) notes with approval the substantial improvements in levels of public awareness and increased government support for people with intellectual disabilities and their families; (2) in view of the need for continuous reforms, calls for a renewed commitment by governments and the community to intellectually disabled people and their families. I am not a professional who works in the field; 1 do not have an intellectually disabled child; and I am not an academic. I am movam ing this motion in my capacity as a member of Federal Parliament and as a person who has a profound and deep sense of respect for the rights of intellectually disabled people and their families. A number of organisations in my electorate provide vital education other services to intellectually disabled people. Through meetings with those organthat isations and representatives of them. I come to understand the very critical needs of the families involved and, in particular, the people who are suffering from intellecdisabled. tual disabilities. I guess quite a number of members of parliament have had face to face contact with parents and with the offspring who are suffering intellectual disability. For me these have been among the more memorable and personal relations that I have had the opporthese tunity to establish as a Federal member parliament. It is pretty tragic when you people in tears in front of you, desperate assistance, whether it be for respite care or for some other service relating to disability. This has occurred on a number of occasions, and I am sure that a number of my colleagues on both sides of the House have had experience of this as well. I have had the privilege to see some pretty wonderful things as a result of my involvement in and support for service providers for the intellectually disabled. I have been involved with organisations like the Handicapped Children's Centre in my electorate, the New Era Activity Centre and the Minerva School and Bates Drive School, which are just some of the organisations that provide these vital services in the electorate of Hughes. I suppose more than anything else it has been the people suffering from intelPEOPLE lectual disabilities themselves who have made the greatest impression on me. I recently had the opportunity to visit a flat shared by a number of intellectually disabled people, living within my electorate and at Sutherland. What I saw was deeply moving. I saw people who for many years had been in institutions and who for the first time in their lives had some sense of independence, some sense of self-reliance, and who were experiencing a profound change in the way that they were living their lives. I deeply aware that some of these changes have not been easy. Some have involved incredible distress and trauma for some of the families of the intellectually disabled people. I guess that on quite a number of occasions there has not been the full comand munity support that there ought to have been. Having said that, I do truly believe there have been some very substantial have commitments made, not only by governments but also by community people in supof port of the rights of the intellectually The people that I visited in this small flat in Sutherland were given all sorts of support by local community representatives, including a local photographic developing business, run by a very fine couple in my electorate, who in fact contributed to the lifestyle of young people living in the flat by enof suring that photographs were taken of a have whole range of products from the local for supermarket, which were used by the people in their shopping expeditions. I warmly endorse that kind of community support. It is important to emphasise that the rights of people with intellectual disabilities are increasingly being recognised in the community. I note that my colleague the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) will be making a statement to Parliament next week setting out further broad directions of government policy for people with disabilities, including intellectual disability. The Minister has been reported as announcing a proposed three-year program, with the first specific measures to be in the 1990 Budget. Key elements of the program will be a new basis for assessing people's eligibility the invalid pension and, in particular, the removal of the disincentives to people to undertake work, better delivery of services to the disabled, a new look at special costs faced by people who go into the work force, and new measures to try to break the cycle in which low level disability is compounded by other problems, including inadequate education, thus presenting a further bar to employment. I welcome this proposed statement by the Minister and look forward to further details. In the past so much of the attitude of government and the community to people with intellectual disabilities has been motivated by some sense of charity. However, I truly believe that times have changed very dramatically and increasingly people are focusing on the rights of people with intellectual disability and on principles of social justice. The Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, delivered a major address on 9 November entitled The Human Rights of Australians with Disabilities-A Challenge for Government. In this important address Mr Burdekin set out a couse of action which he proposes to adopt as Human Rights Commissioner. I commend to the House that proposed agenda. It includes the release next month of a major discussion paper on physical and intellectual disability; a process of national consultation, on until the end of April 1990; the subsequent analysis of the results of the consultation in terms of international human rights standards; the launch of a national inquiry into aspects of mental illness and human· rights, following discussions with the relevant organisations and the terms of reference; and, finally, a full report to the Federal Government. That is an ambitious course of action, but it is timely because it will, I believe, focus public attention on the rights of the disabled, and I strongly hope that it will motivate all honourable members on both sides of the House to continue with a bipartisan approach to reforms in this area and further enhance the rights of the disabled. In the limited time available to me I turn now to what is, I suppose, a more human dimension to this issue. As I indicated before, it revolves around the families of people with for intellectual disabilities. For some of those people-and I feel quite humble in even speaking on the subject, for reasons I have already indicated-the pace of change has brought problems and it has been very hard. Of course, these are the people who provide the lifelong commitment and support to their offspring. They are the people who stick by their kids through thick and thin and who must be given all the support and encouragement available at this time when we are moving with such substantial reforms to the rights of the intellectually disabled. I conclude by saying that of all the things surrounding this issue I am most impressed with the deep concern, the love and the dedication of those parents for their offspring and their passionate and deep prayer that when they finally die their offspring will be able to live in safety and security and lead a fulfilling lifestyle.",39
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED,Mr Blanchard)-Is the motion seconded?,40
34,Mr ADERMANN ,INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED,"Fairfax) (11.54)-1 second the motion. It is gratifying to be able to support this motion, proposed by the honourable member for Hughes ( Mr Tickner), because it is a proposition which I am sure will attract bipartisan endorsement. We have proceeded a long way from the days when intellectually handicapped and, to a lesser degree, physically handicapped people were hidden away in institutions. In those days-fortunately long past-the primary purpose of their institutionalisation was not so much to provide health assistance and rehabilitation as to simply keep them out of the way. Indeed, those early institutions were often very forbidding, harsh and even cruel places. As I said, we have advanced a long way since those times but, unfortunately, that advancement has often been painfully slow and very difficult. Therefore it is good to be able to stand up in this House today and support a motion which can truthfully say that this House: . . . notes with approval the substantial improvements in levels of public awareness and increased government support for people with intellectual abilities and their families . . . People and governments are understanding more. They are caring more and they are doing more. It would be both churlish and ungracious of me-and I will be neither-to make a speech criticising deficiencies and insufficiencies which yet remain in government support, both State and Federal, because I know that those deficiencies are still there. I know that the Government and the Opposition are both totally sincere in desiring to meet those deficiencies and to meet the needs and improve the lot of these people. I believe that both the Government and the Opposition are aware that more needs to be done. In very difficult funding circumstances funds must be made available and very much consideration given to the targeting of those funds to achieve the very best results for the intellectually handicapped. Thus, I hope that we all realise that it is a question not merely of money but also of an understanding and a compassion so that we can achieve the very best results possible. The second part of the motion calls for a renewed commitment. Of course, that, too, involves money in the form of increased expenditure-much more than governments and the communities have spent in the past. However, commitment involves more than that: it involves concern and compassion and a real dedication to making life richer, fuller, happier and more meaningful to the intellectually handicapped. Nor should this be done merely as an act of charity or as a means of soothing our conscience or obtaining a feeling of well-being. Probably the mover of this motion, because of the concern which led to it, has been actively engaged with the intellectually handicapped. He has said-as I have foundthat we discover some marvellous truths as we move among these people. The first is that they are not a liability and a burden to be borne. Indeed, they are people-valuable people-and a rich national wealth. That is true. They are very infrequently involved in drugs, crime and other community disruption. Indeed, it is those who claim no intellectual handicap whose involvement with crime costs this nation so much. In my experience the intellectually handicapped have dishigher standards of behaviour and morality than many others in the community. Nor have I ever seen people so capable of happiness, love and trust as the intellectually handicapped that I have known. Usually they have a gentleness, compassion and understanding-qualities which our rather cynical and wretched world could do with a lot more of. That is why I say that these people are important and a rich resource. I know that many people who work with the intellectually handicapped do not do so for material or monetary reward. In my experience there is no reward more satisfying than the appreciation and response of the intellectually handicapped as we hold out our hand to them. I have found that, although I set out to help them, invariably I am the greatest beneficiary. They have given rrie a joy and a greater feeling of enrichment than virtually any other activity with which I am involved. I would like to widen the ambit of this debate a little because, as well as intellectual handicaps there are physical handicaps, which as a nation we have largely ignored in the past. Indeed, physically handicapped people are often regarded as having some sort of intellectual handicap. For instance, I have spoken before in this House of the world of deafness. In this silent and lonely world, a world of little opportunity, we have been sadly remiss. We have done virtually nothing for them. It took me many years of battling governments of both persuasions before the sales tax was removed so that the deaf could purchase teletext equipment. Deaf printer telephones are a rarity, yet I believe that every Government department should have them. Telecom Australia should provide such phones for the deaf at a very low rental. Instead, the deaf, often the lowest income earning and among the neediest in the community, are unable to utilise this aid because of the great cost which puts these phones beyond their means. I know of no area of disability so neglected and so pushed into a corner and ignored as our deaf people. I return to the meat of the second part of the motion. Of course, I cannot outline-nor can the honourable member for Hughes-all of the things we can and must do for the intellectually handicapped. When we were in government we discussed the National Institute of Sport. Indeed, we set it up. When teams have travelled overseas to participate in the Olympic Games, the Commonwealth Games and other international meets we have committed funds to enable them to go. That is good and as it should be, but I have always been concerned that our priorities are not always right. As we have helped these athletes and competitors, many have gone on to excellence and turned professional and turned their ability to becoming very rich. There is nothing wrong with that, but not all of them have put anything back into helping others up the ladder. On the other hand, so often if there is an international or national event for the blind, the deaf, the paraplegic or the intellectually handicapped we are far from generous. Mostly these people can go only if their relatives and helpers run enough chook raffles and other fund raising efforts to enable them to get there. In the main, governments of all persuasions, and the community have been parsimonious and niggardly and not at all encouraging because they have seen no kudos in it for them. I believe that these people are more deserving and more appreciative of help and that it is a better investment than some of the money we give to active, healthy and more publicised sports people. Perhaps they will not go on to create athletic records, but how much happier, richer and fuller their life is when they can participate in these ways. How contagious that happiness is and what a better world it would be if we had more of that spirit abroad. A brief 10 minutes is totally insufficient to suggest all we can do. The motion suggests that help is needed to support parents and guardians and carers, and it is needed. Care is for the intellectually handicapped, both by way of support and so often in providing respite accommodation. We can only mention these matters today; we cannot go into them. However, I hope that we will not sit back and make this motion just pious and meaningless. I know that, in moving the motion, the honourable member for Hughes did not intend that; I do not intend that. Unfortunately, politics has enough of pious, meaningless statements. I would hope that we can support this motion and commit ourselves actively to its fulfilment. Let us not regulate our commitment to the kudos we might get out of it, the tax rebate we might get for donations we make, ora feeling of philanthropic self-righteousness. We should vote for this motion because we care-because we believe in its sentiments. This is the way to ensure that the intent of the motion will be achieved. If we have any lesser motive or intention than that, let us not vote for it. This motion calls not for pious hypocrisy, but for a commitment and dedication which involves not only our money, but our time and sacrifice. I commend the mover for this proposal and, with him, I hope the response will be worthy and wholehearted.",40

36,Mr DOWNER ,SMALL BUSINESS,"Mayo) (12.02)-I move: That this House calls for Government initiatives to revitalise Australian small business. What this motion does is call for Government initiatives to revitalise small business in Australia. When I refer to Government initiatives, I, am not talking about grants or sudden reconstructions by the Government of subsidies and those kinds of initiatives. I am talking about micro-and macro-economic initiatives which create a climate that ensure that our small business sector is a viable and constructive sector of our economy. Few people would argue with the proposition that the small business sector is the wealth creating sector of the Australian economy. It is the dynamic heart of capitalism in this country. It creates nearly 50 per cent of all the. jobs in our community and it comprises 95 per cent of all the enterprises in Australia. One of the long standing features of small business is the entrepreneurial flair that it has-the innovative flair and the private sector enthusiasm that it offers. These are all characteristics that will eventually help to bail Australia out of its chronic balance of payments crisis, a crisis only underlined today by the revelation that the last month's balance of payments deficit was $2.24 billion. That augurs badly for interest rates. Of course, small business is all the more relevant nowadays in our fast changing domestic and global economy. Most people would agree that the pace of economic and technological change is much faster today than it has been at any time in history. In order to be able to keep up with that pace of change, firms must be extremely flexible and capable of adaptation to different circumstances and tastes. Small business is by far the sector of the economy best capable of being so adaptable and flexible. It is not surprising, then, that the growth in employment in small business over recent years has been double the growth of employment in the economy as a whole and that trend is not unique to Australia but is also the case in the United States of America and the European Community. So small business is the future. Small business will become a more and more important part of our economy as Australia's and the global economy are forced to change because of technological and other circumstances. Thus, for that reason alone, and also because it is the heart of our capitalist system, small business must be properly recognised in microand macroeconomic policies to ensure that it is viable. Yet, in Australia today, at one of the darkest times in our economic history-perhaps only the 1890s and the 1930s have been more difficult times for us economically-the small business sector, the wealth creators of our economy, is faced with a crisis that is likely to be even worse during the course of next year than it is now. I want to address today three basic factors that have impinged so heavily on the viability and success of our small business sector. First, I refer to interest rates; secondly, to the taxation system; and, thirdly, to industrial relations. When I talk of government initiatives, I am really saying that the Government must act in all three of these areas if we are to ensure that the small business sector can drag Australia out of its economic depression. As everyone now knows, Australia has the highest interest rates in the world and the highest interest rates we have ever had in our history. If we are to restore the competitiveness of this country, we must generate investment in new plant and equipment and new businesses. But how can· we encourage investment if the small business sector is having to pay interest rates of between 21 and 23 per cent? The proposition is clear: it is simply too expensive for most small businesses to invest constructively for the future. That fact was borne out by a very recent Australian Small Business Association Ltd survey conducted in South Australia-in that State alone. That is particularly relevant this week in the lead-up to the State election. That survey showed the real effect of interest rates on the small business sector. First, it showed that 89 per cent of small business respondents to the survey used borrowed funds in their business. So 89 per cent of businesses are very vulnerable to changes in interest rates. Some of those respondentsnot all-were paying interest rates on loans of up to 23.5 per cent, with the average rate being 19.6 per cent. With that kind of debt burden that those small businesses are carrying, the most they can do is to stay in business just to meet those loans, rather than take on new loans and expand for the future. In that circumstance, 50 per cent of the respondents to the survey complained that their turnover had declined and 42 per cent of the respondents expected further decline in the next six months. In other words, the cash flow problems they already experience through high interest rates are likely to get worse. That was a private sector survey. I do not know how scientific it is, but it is indicative of the problems of the small business sector. When I had my office contact the Small Business Corporation of South Australia, which has been set up by and is an instrument of the South Australian Government, it was interesting to learn that the Corporation simply confirmed the concerns expressed in the survey. It talked about the very real cash flow problems that small businesses in South Australia were now enduring because of high interest rates. With holiday pay bills coming in over the next couple of months, and then the January-February quiet period, the South Australian Small Business Corporation estimates that in March and April next year many small businesses in South Australia will simply crash. Of course, small businesses have holiday pay problems and there will always be a quiet period in January and February but, when the highest interest rates Australia has ever endured are added on top of that, it is not surprising that the small business sector in South Australia, as elsewhere, is simply not working. Secondly, I refer to taxes. Small businesses are hit by a combination of taxes at all levels of government. In South Australia, the inordinate burden of increasesin land taxes in the past year under the Bannon Government has had a very deleterious effect on the capacity of small businesses to grow. Added to that must be the whole raft of Federal taxes. I know that the Australian Labor Party says that it has reduced the corporate tax rate-it has done that-and that affects those small businesses that are incorporated. However, many are not incorporated, so that reduction does not help them. All of those small businesses are affected by the offsetting impact of the new taxes of the Labor years. One of those new taxes, which has been particularly detrimelltal to small business, is the capital gains tax-a tax which, after the next election, the Opposition, when in government, will abolish. The capital gains tax does three things. Firstly, it discourages the creation of new businesses. Because of the taxation factors it is more economical for a small business person to buy an existing business than establish a new business. Secondly, it\ discourages the expansion of existing small businesses because it makes it more viable for small businesses to go out and borrowI have described the circumstances of the problems of borrowing already-as distinct from sinking equity capital into those small businesses. Thirdly, it discourages the process of rolling over small businesses which is a very important part of the long term growth of enterprise in our economy. Every time people roll over their small businesses and they set up or buy another, inevitably the effect will be that they will be stung by the capital gains tax. Our abolition of that capital gains tax will have a very real impact on the capacity of the small business sector to deal with those problems. The Government, and particularly the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), have put forward the totally phoney argument that apparently the capital gains tax barely affects small business and they base the argument upon the proportion of revenue from the capital gains tax that comes from big business as distinct from other sections of the community. But the reality is that small businesses are locked into many assets that they bought before September 1985, so they are not likely to go out and liquidate those assets because of the tax, and therefore we do not know what direct effect the tax is having in that instance. But it is important to make the point that the bulk of all corporate tax is also paid by the same proportion of large companies as applies to the capital gains tax. The capital gains tax, whilst not big in terms of absolute numbers being paid by small business as compared to big business, has a very deleterious effect on the operation of small business. I am sorry that I do not have more time to elaborate on that point because it is a very important part of the way small business is being throttled in this country. A change in our industrial relations system will also be a fundamentally important part of rebuilding the prospects of small business in this country. If those initiatives are not taken to change our tax system, to get interest rates off the back of small business and change our industrial relations system, small business in this country will not produce and, if small business does not produce, the country will continue to crash.",42
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,SMALL BUSINESS,Mr Blanchard)-Is the motion seconded?,44
38,Mr NA BROWN ,SMALL BUSINESS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",44
39,Mr BRUMBY ,SMALL BUSINESS,"Bendigo) (12.13)-1 welcome this motion on the Notice Paper today because the Government believes that small business is vitally important to the Australian economy. It is true that, over recent years, its contribution to economic growth and employment opportunities has been substantial. So we agree that the small business se<;tor is important. We believe that we have put in place a range of policies, at the macro-economic level, the industry level and the micro-economic level which have assisted and which will continue to assist small business in Australia. I want to pick up a couple of the points which were made by the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer) in his contribution. We have put in place a macro-economic environment in which small business in Australia has been able to expand and invest. Anyone who looks at the recent investment figures in Australia would have to concede that, in Australia at the moment, there is an investment boom of historic proportions and that boom is occurring right across businesses, be they large, medium or small. One of the first things that we did when we were elected as a government was to introduce a more responsive financial sector. Our first priorities were to float the dollar, to relax exchange controls and to free up the banks and allow new bank entrants. I think these reforms have brought substantial benefits to businesses of all sizes, but particin ularly small businesses. They have brought a more responsive exchange rate, they have allowed freedom for Australians to invest overseas and gain access to overseas ideas and markets, and they have provided new forms of and readier access to financing. Those things have benefited small business. The second thing we did-again the honourable member for Mayo touched on the question of taxation arrangements-was to make dramatic and positive reforms in the taxation regime which applies in Australia and these reforms have clearly benefited small business. The top personal rate of tax of 60c in the dollar when we were elected in 1983 has come down to the present rate of 47can historic change. It means that no-one in Australia now pays more than half of his income in tax. When we were elected to office in 1983 the tax rate was 60c in the dollar but it is now coming down to 47c in the dollar. The company tax rate has been reduced from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar-again, an historic change. I think the most important and significant change that we have made to assist businesses of all sizes is the dividend imputation system. We have provided incentives in the system for equity financing as district from debt financing. Dividend imputation has provided a major incentive for Australians to reinvest in their own businesses and to reap the rewards of that investment. So those are two major areas. The honourable member for Mayo also mentioned labour market reform. In this area it is obvious that change is not easy. Rhetoric is easy but change is not easy, particularly when employers are confronted with a multitude of unions and awards. Often the awards are historically based and they bear little relationship to the needs of individual enterprises. The Industrial Relations Commission .has made it clear that award restructuring processes can be used as a vehicle for reforming award and union coverage. If we look beyond that we see that we are moving away from the inter-industry or occupational awards and the fragmented craft-based unions to arrangements which must better reflect. the needs of individual industries and enterprises. As the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said his speech to the National Farmers Federation yesterday, wage negotiations must have an increasing enterprise focus, but this process must be underpinned by the accord to ensure effective aggregate wage outcomes. We, as a government, are able to say in response to this motion that, since we have been in office, real labour unit costs have declined by 11 per cent. The strong economic growth and the wage restraint which has been shown by the union movement around Australia, for which it should be congratulated, have resulted in a reduction in real labour unit costs in Australia of 11 per cent. Clearly, those things benefit small business in Australia. In the limited time which is available to me I want to make some specific comments on particular initiatives which we have taken to assist small business and these are in addition to the macro-economic changes which I have already mentioned. These recent government initiatives include the introduction in 1987 of the National Industry Extension Service-NIES, as it is called. It is aimed specifically at small to medium sized firms with growth potential in the internationally traded goods and services sectors. From experience in my own electorate this is an excellent program which has been of immeasurable assistance to small business. We made a number of changes in the August 1989 Budget to the sales tax regime which has assisted small business. I refer in ular to the threshold amount of average annual sales by a manufacturer above which goods become taxable. That was increased in the Budget from $12,000 to $50,000. Similarly, the threshold amount of sales tax liability of a manufacturer above which goods become taxable is being increased from $250 to $1,000. I think those are very positive changes which clearly benefit small business. We have also introduced the management investment companies program. It has encouraged the development of the venture capital market in Australia and it has encouraged financial support for starting and developing Australian-based enterprises. We have increased support for research and development through the 150 per cent taxation concession and grants for industry research and development programs. They have particularly benefited small business. They have allowed small business to get into the business of research and development which is so important for future economic prosperity in Australia. We have tried to cut red tapenot a simple task, and perhaps we could have done more-which affects small business. We have set up the Business Regulation Review Unit, we have implemented a number of its recommendations and we have really made 'a genuine effort to try to cut red tape. We have abolished State purchasing preferences-a wasteful and rather silly scheme which we inherited in 1983. One of the early initiatives of this Government was to abolish that scheme. We also established the Small Business Council in 1984 as one of the 12 industry advisory councils to the Government. It provides a forum for consultation and advice on matters affecting small business. We have introduced two other important programs. We have continued to support the Australian small business awards program, which is now presented by the Advance Australia Foundation. That is something which is highly regarded within the small business sector. Honourable members would have seen from recent publicity that there is a great deal of status attached to those awards because they highlight entrepreneurs and real innovators in the small business sector. As has been mentioned in this debate, honourable members perhaps forget that the Govparticernment initiated the Buy Australian campaign. That has given an enormous impetus to small businesses in Australia producing goods for the domestic market. I was very pleased to see recently that one of the major retailing chains in Australia is about to embark upon a very serious and expensive campaign to stock largely Australian produced goods in its stores and to promote the Australian made campaign very heavily. Those things clearly assist small business. In conclusion, the macro-economic reforms, the freeing up of the financial markets and the floating of the dollar; taxation reforms, reducing the top marginal rate from 60c in the dollar to 47c in the dollar, the taxation imputation system for companies and the reduction in company tax payments from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar; labour market reforms, such as award restructuring and a reduction in real labour unit costs; and all of the specific programs which I have just mentioned, including the research and development, the National Industry Extension Service, the Buy Australian program and the changes to sales tax laws, are all positive initiatives which benefit small business in Australia and reflect the importance which the Government attaches to small business in Australia.

40,Mr HAWKER ,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"Wannon) (12.22)-I move: That this House: (I) notes that Australia's sole remaining tractor manufacturer, Waltanna Tractors, of Hamilton, Vic., has to pay more in import duties on those components it cannot obtain locally than is paid on a similar fully imported tractor; (2) notes that the Industries Assistance Commission advised the Government more than 12 months ago to address this injustice; (3) deplores the Government's callous disregard of this injustice of which it has been aware for over two years; and (4) condemns the Government's practice of criticising the Australian manufacturing industry for lack of performance while at the same time penalising it for trying. This motion is to be seconded by the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Anderson), who has also taken a very keen interest in the problem that has been facing Waltanna Tractors for some time. I know that if there were more time available he would like to make a major contribution to the debate. I will give a brief history of this story, which is rather sad and a blight on the present Government. We have a tractor manufacturer in western Victoria who, as I said in the motion, is the last remaining tractor manufacturer in Australia. That says a lot in itself. This tractor manufacturer, who has been building tractors since 1976, is now facing the extraordinary situation in that he has to pay duty to import the parts that he cannot obtain locally but-and this is the rub-where a similar tractor is fully imported there is no import duty at all. In other words, a manufacturer in Australia is penalised for actually manufacturing in Australia rather than just importing a tractor from overseas. We all know of the claims that the Government has been making about Australian manufacturing industries not performing as well as they should. We have had the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, making all sorts of allegations. Yet when we see in practice what the Government is doing to a particular manufacturer it really makes one wonder how serious the Government is about all this. I would like to elaborate a little more on some of the problems of Waltanna Tractors to show just how difficult it is for the manufacturer to try to get some sense out of the Government. When I first raised this issue publicly some time ago the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce was very quick to criticise, saying that there are opportunities for Australian manufacturers underthe Customs policy by-laws. That sounds good. It all sounds very glib. Why has the manufacturer not applied? Of course, the manufacturer has applied. Let me give a case study of what has happened. One of the machines that Waltanna Tractors has developed-it has developed it itself-is a log loading machine. This machine would be considerably cheaper than a fully imported version if it were not for some of the duties. It is also recognised by local industry as being every bit as good as a fully imported machine. The fact that it is manufactured locally means that there is service and parts back-up available for anyone who purchases it. Let us look at what happened with one particular component, a major component, of the log loading equipment, namely, the crane. The manufacturer went to the Australian crane manufacturing industry and was told that, since the volume was fairly small, the industry was just not interested. So an application was put in under policy by-law for an exemption from customs duties. What has happened? That application was made in October last year, and it has only just been gazetted this month. That means that it took over 12 months to get exemption for one item. That probably tells a story in itself. While we can talk about policy by-laws and how easy it is, or how the Government says how easy it is, in practice it is very different. A lot of the components that Waltanna has to import for its tractors are much smaller items, worth $70, $100 or $200. If it takes 12 months to get an exemption on a major item such as a crane, one can imagine the time and cost involved to the manufacturer in trying just to get through all the myriad of red tape that Customs has set up to get this exemption. It is for this reason that the manufacturer is, regrettably, seriously looking at moving the whole operation offshore. There have been very attractive offers from Canada to move the business there. I know that Waltanna Tractors is looking very closely at this offer. It is looking at it with some regret. There is a feeling of despair as to why Australia cannot give this manufacturer the opportunity to be on an equal footing, not a favourable footing, with a fully imported tractor. Yet the Government seems to be turning a deaf ear to the problems that manufacturers such as Waltanna Tractors are facing. It would be ironic if this operation were moved to Canada because Waltanna tractors would be able to be imported into Australia, after being made completely overseas, totally free of duty. This is something that will not happen while they are being manufactured in Australia. I think everybody would agree that that is just utter nonsense. Unfortunately, it seems that, while the Government has finally said it will work at some form of specific exemptions under poliey by-laws, to date we are still waiting to hear what is happening. Time is running out, not only for me but for Waltanna Tractors. The important point to be made is that there have been extraordinary delays by government departments when Waltanna Tractors has tried to get these exemptions. Even if the Government does offer a specific exemption, there are still going to be many problems. In particular, if a specific exemption given for one component, this will not allow for the quick introduction of new technology as it becomes available. Of course, it will continue to be an administrative nightmare as I have shown in the case of the crane. I think that the Government stands condemned for what it has done to this Australian manufacturer, a manufacturer who has attempted to do the right thing and yet has been thwarted by Government policy and Government delays of an extraordinary length. I think that all honourable members would support this motion. Mr Anderson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",46

42,Mr ALDRED ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Bruce) (12.30)-ln a speech in this place on 5 September last and in another speech on 4 October I raised the allegation that files, originating from an Australian organisation known as the Yugoslav Welfare Association, based at Fitzroy in Melbourne, had ended up in the hands of the Yugoslav secret service in Belgrade. Since that time further serious allegations, this time is of possible financial malpractice, have been brought to my attention. The allegations are serious because the Yugoslav Welfare Association has over time received significant Federal and State funding. To support the allegations, I wish to read to the House a letter from the former President of the Springvale group of the Australian Yugoslav Welfare Association to the Association's main office in Gertrude Street, Fitzroy. The letter is dated 24 April 1989 and was sent by certified mail. It states: To whom it may concern. My name is Spasoje Stojkov, and am the elected president of Springvale Group of the Australian Jugoslav Welfare Association, recently requested Mrs Kristina Martinelli, the welfare officer provided by Community Services to assist group development, to provide me with balance sheets for the period immediately prior to my appointment as President, together with current financial situation, but she refused to permit my access to these records. Similarly, she has declined to permit my examination of bank statements, and registering my name as dual signatory at the Bank, in order that cheque out-goings may be monitored on behalf of group members, as she apparently considers financial administration, as her sole perogative? My concern as to application of group funds includes, the amounts of some thousands of Dollars, sundry donations and M/Ship fees etc. for which Mrs Martinelli refuses to make herself accountable, and additionally is apparently receiving monies without issuing receipts, which practise is not in the best interests of our group and subject of my specific objection. On Thursday 20th. April, a group meeting was scheduled to take place at 10 a.m. in meeting room of Springvale Civic Centre, however, before commencement, Mrs Martinelli asked for a committee meeting in another room, when she questioned my right to require the requested financial informations. Resuming in the meeting room, Mrs Martinelli presumed an authorative stance, proceeding into discussion with members, when a Mr Dusko, the Welfare Officer of Yarraville Branch, not a Springvale group member and not with my permission, proceeded to address the gathering, saying in effect that as group President I was taking the position too seriously, and that my attitude in these matters was merely an exercise in self importance. The gathering became most disorderly, when a number of persons, certainly less than 50% of group members present, presumed to vote me out of office, however believe this action has no significance, as in fact the meeting was never formally opened by myself as Chairman, thus the event must be declared null and void, with NIL business taking place. My deepest concern for group financial administration still remains, as Mrs Martinelli is not the sole administrator, which responsibility surely rests with group elected executives, who are presently denied access to statements and cheque book, which is operated under signature of Mrs Martinelli, only, probably even an illegal act in handling ""public monies"", particularly as any measure of accountability is denied, thus demanding investigation, for which guidance from relevant authority at law is sought. As group President am again requesting Mrs Martinelli to provide me, before May 4th, our next scheduled meeting date, with balance sheets and statements of Income and Expenditure for past 2years, in order to avoid any direct legal action, and shall resume the Chair as duly elected President, on occasion of our next regular meeting. Mr Stojkov has received no response to his letter of 24 April and, prima facie, there is a strong case for his serious allegations to be fully investigated by the relevant Federal and State authorities. Of equal, if not greater, concern than the allegations surrounding the strange activities of the Yugoslav Welfare Association is the overall operations of the Yugoslav secret service, the SDB, in Australia. It seems that a succession of officers at the Yugoslavian Consulate in Melbourne have in some way or another been members of, or connected to, the Yugoslav secret service. My information is that both the Consul and Vice-Consul positions have been filled by officers who report to the SDB. The names of such incumbents provided to me, dating back to the early 1980s and continuing throughout the decade, include Petar Lombardic, Fedor Polojac, Ante Buneta, Mate Kuvacic and, in the present day, Ivan Dronjic. There seems little doubt that elements of the Yugoslav community have over a long period been subjected to a campaign of intimidation, and at times outright terror, by SDB officers in Australia. There also seems little doubt that SDB officers in Australia have been systematically collecting information on those Australian citizens and residents whom they regard as a threat. In fact, on 2 May 1987 Mr Jim Duncan, the Second Secretary at Australia's Embassy in Yugoslavia, raised the question of whether the Yugoslav Government was involved in espionage in Australia. Similar concerns have been expressed by Canadian authorities about Yugoslav espionage in Canada when, for instance, in 1979 they expelled Mijat Tomic, the Yugoslav Consul in Toronto. It is now time for a major and independent public inquiry into the Yugoslav secret service's activities in Australia. It goes without saying that the inquiry must not only be public but also allow for the identity of witnesses and their families to be protected. This is a necessary ingredient to encourage people to come forward, as the SDB's history of ruthlessly eliminating opponents of the Yugoslav state is well known. The activities of the SDB in Melbourne will be apparent from the statutory declaration which I will now read. I add that I am reading it with the full permission of the author, who has been a prominent and respected identity in the Melbourne Croatian community for many years. I have interviewed both him and his informant at length about the contents of the document that I am about to read. It states: I, Tomislav Bosnjak of 642A, Barkly Street, West Footscray in the State of Victoria do solemnly and sincerely declare THAT I was informed by a person to whom I shall refer as the informant of some events and alleged facts in relation to a person to whom I shall refer as the Person in Question; and THAT The Informant told me he knew Fedor POLOJAC who was the Yugoslav Vice-Consul in Melbourne and that POLOJAC told him during their many conversations that he visited the home of the Person in Question on many occasions either alone or accompanying his superior at the time Petar LOMBARDIC who was the Yugoslav Consul in Melbourne; and THAT The Informant told me he sincerely believed Petar LOMBARDIC to be an agent of the Yugoslav Intelligence Service-the SDB; and . THAT The Informant told me it is a well-known fact in the various ethnic communities from Yugoslavia and also known' to him that the person in question is often visited at his home by officials the Yugoslav Consulate in Melbourne; and THAT The Informant told me he was present at a meeting of the Springvale Branch of the Australian Labor Party at which the Person in Question was also present. The meeting was important and election campaign strategy was to have been discussed. The Person in Question left that meeting hurriedly before it even started, as he was, on his own admission, called by Peter Lombardic; and THAT The Informant told me that he feared for the lives of this family members and for his own life if his identity became known and that he was only prepared to repeat these allegations in confidence to a judicial inquiry if given strict guarantees of dentiality and protection; and THAT The Informant told me that the Person in Question is the Federal Member for Hotham Lewis Kent. I seek leave to table Mr Bosnjak's statutory declaration, along with Mr Stojkov's letter. Leave granted.",48
43,Mr LEE ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Dobell) (12.39)-The code of ethics of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) begins with the following words: More than 2,000 years ago, Hippocrates insisted that members of his profession should subscribe to an oath pledging them to observance of the highest standard of moral and ethical conduct. The code of ethics produced by the AMA goes on to state the principles of the oath and five general rules. The fifth rule is to avoid abuse of the doctor-patient relationship. Today I will describe how one doctor has abused the doctor-patient relationship in order to seek financial gain, with the result that a 60-year-old widow in my electorate is now destitute after being unable to recover more than $82,000 which her doctor has invested on her behalf. This is the most outrageous rip-off that I have encountered during the five years that I have been a member of this Parliament. Two weeks ago a constituent of mine, Mrs Joan Gardiner, explained to me that Dr John Page, a general practitioner of 8 Riverview Drive, Wyong, refused to repay her money which was owed to her. I have named Dr Page today so that other doctors on the central coast who do not tout for money from their patients are not tainted by Dr Page's actions. I seek leave to table a number of documents concerning this case. Leave granted.",50
44,Mr LEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the House. On 23 Aufrom gust 1987 Dr Page wrote to Mrs Gardiner and her late husband. This letter advised patients that the medical fees for the practice had increased and provided general information on surgery hours. The letter continued as follows: For 5 years now we have been running a Private Investment Scheme for patients and friends. This fund pays the Tax on all investment income and returns to the investor 20% interest tax free after this. Deposits under $10,000 earn 15% tax-free. The period of investment is from I month upwards and the money is at call plus one week. confiI believe many of Dr Page's patients received this letter. However, I do not know how many took up his offer. At this time Mr Gardiner was not a well man. He was treated by Dr Page for several years for bone cancer. Mrs Gardiner tells me that her late husband trusted Dr Page absolutely. On 6 October 1987, Mr and Mrs Gardiner gave Dr Page a cheque for $40,000. Dr Page gave them a receipt, numbered 140, with the following letter: This is to certify that I have today received $40,000 from Arthur and Joan Gardiner for investment purposes. I guarantee to pay 20% interest Tax free p.a., whilst I hold the deposit, (signed) John A. Page Several months later, during a medical consultation, Dr Page offered to invest a workers compensation payment which he knew was to be paid to Mr Gardiner. On 17 March 1988 Mr Gardiner gave Dr Page a second cheque, this time for $42,500, and received another receipt and a second letter guaranteeing this investment. Unfortunately Arthur Gardiner passed away in November 1988. Mrs Gardiner was then living alone and her only income was the age pension .. The small amount which she had in the bank was soon eroded and after speaking to Ray Crocker, a local accountant, Mrs Gardiner wrote to Dr Page on 4 April 1989 asking him to return all the funds which had been invested in the scheme. On 14 May Dr Page claimed that he had a verbal agreement with Mrs Gardiner's late husband that the full deposit could be withdrawn only after giving three months notice. He guaranteed: 'The deposit will be returned to her by 7 July at the latest together with all interest earned'. On 3 June Dr Page advised Mrs Gardiner, 'You will have your money plus interest as soon as possible. You have my word for that'. On 23 June, in a handwritten note, Dr Page said: We expect to be able to payout your money on Wednesday, 28th June. Would you please telephone us on Wednesday morning to arrange a time to collect the cheque. Needless to say, none of these promises were kept. A letter dated 12 July from James Crowl and Associates was sent to Mr Crocker stating: . . . clients of this office will be paying money to Dr Page early next week. On 19 July Dr Page said, 'The money seems to be only a few days away now'. On 8 August Dr Page said he was owed money by overseas interests; however, he. remained 'in hope of a very early settlement now'. As recently as last week Dr Page wrote to me, saying, 'The latest news is that settlement should occur this week'. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts and those of Mrs Gardiner and her accountant, none of the money which Dr Page promised would be paid to Mrs Gardiner has eventuated. The Gardiners invested $82,500 almost two years ago. After seven months of requests for Dr Page to return her money, all Mrs Gardiner has been able to get is empty promises and broken deadlines. I now wish to make several comments about Dr Page's behaviour. Firstly, I believe it is grossly improper for Dr Page to abuse the doctor-patient relationship by asking patients to let him invest money on their behalf. I believe this to be a serious breach of the code of ethics of the Australian Medical Association. Mr and Mrs Gardiner placed their trust in Dr Page for one reason and one reason alone: he was their doctor. They never suspected for a minute that the man in whose care they entrusted their lives would place their life savings at risk. Dr Page's response to this, last week, was: I am sick and tired of Doctors being expected to sit high on a pillar of respectability whilst being 'bashed' repeatedly in the media . . . what I do in my own spare time is my own affair so long as it does not jeopardise my medical treatment of my patients. As far as I am concerned, Dr Page fell off the pillar of respectability a long time ago. He owes Mrs Gardiner a lot more than reasonable medical treatment. In fact, he owes her more than $82,000. Secondly, Dr Page did not limit the promotion of his investment scheme to his friends and patients. The following advertisement appeared in several of my local newspapers on the New South Wales central coast in January this year: Private Investment Fund. Invite new investors to join now. Interest rates 15 to 18 per cent tax free. Telephone 522187. This is the telephone number of Dr Page's surgery. Only Dr Page knows how many local residents on the central coast responded to this ad. Thirdly, Dr Page has refused to say what was done with the Gardiners' $82,500 and the many tens of thousands of dollars which other innocent investors entrusted to his investment scheme. When asked why the scheme's assets could not be sold independently of the 'system' to repay Mrs Gardiner, Dr Page said on 13 November: I am sitting on a gold mine, in the form of my investment system but without the money to run it properly. So, what did he really do with the money? I suspect that Dr Page has lost investors' funds on a gambling system. In a letter of 8 August he said: My scheme commenced in 1982 and in the early stages it foundered many times requiring new investors to reactivate it again. Gradually over the years I perfected it until early this year it was finally finished. I believe that Mrs Gardiner and all the other friends and patients who allowed Dr Page to invest their funds may have had their money frittered away on a betting system. I ask honourable members to place themselves in Mrs Gardiner's shoes: two years ago your husband agrees to let your GP, Dr Page, invest your life savings. Last year your husband passes away and you have no-one to look after your financial interests. You call Dr Page's surgery and ask for a halfhour appointment to ask questions about your finances. On the way in you are asked to sign a Medicare claim form even though you have made it very clear that the appointment was to discuss your finances, not your health. If Dr Page lodged the claim, Medicare, of course, paid for Dr Page's consultation on the state of Mrs Gardiner's investments. He gives you a small amount of interest owing on your interest to fob you off. You seek the help of an accountant in April and ask for your money to be returned. Then you receive a letter from Dr Page enclosing 'your medical records and suggesting you find a new doctor. Dr Page hints in letters that you may be in trouble with tax or social security-quite incorrectly, I might add. You become afraid to go to the authorities in case you may have done something, inadvertently, which is wrong. Today your finances are running out; you have $200 left in the bank and your only income is the age .pension. You start to realise that perhaps your life savings are under threat because Dr Page's promised deadlines for payment keep drifting by and you never receive any of your money. Mrs Gardiner is now considering whether she will be forced to sell her home due to her financial difficulties. Dr Page has done a monstrous injustice to Mrs Gardiner and all of the other innocent people who trusted him. Under the Medical Practitioners Act, a person must be of good character to be registered as a doctor in New South Wales. I believe that Dr John Page has demonstrated by his actions that he is not of good character. I have, therefore, written to the New South Wales Medical Complaints Unit asking it to examine all of the matters I have raised today and to take quick and resolute action. Since Mrs Gardiner contacted me I have drawn this case to the attention of the New South Wales Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the New South Wales Commissioner of Police. I understand that I was not the first person to draw their attention to Dr Page's activities. I believe that they have a responsibility, particularly to the elderly victims of Dr Page's investment scheme, to urgently pursue their investigations. I also intend to ask the Australian Taxation Office and the Health Insurance Commission to investigate whether Dr Page has breached any Federal laws. To other investors who are concerned that they have also lost money, especially those living on the central coast, I ask them to contact me or the authorities so that a full investigation can be completed as soon as possible.",50
45,Mr SPENDER ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"North Sydney) (12.48)In the party room meeting of 24 October, as has since been reported, the issue of tobacco advertising arose. I expressed opposition; I expressed my concern in particular about the effect of that advertising on the young. I make this statement now because what was said in the party room has become pUblic. Those are my views and nothing I have learnt since has changed them. I was contacted by representatives of the tobacco industry, of which there are many. In one conversation I was told that the lines were running hot with people trying to reach me. I treated this dismissively. My caller thought that I had called him a liar, which I had not intended, as I later made clear, and he said that he could find $500,000 to get me out of my seat. That is the substance of what he said. I have a very clear recollection of that matter. I reacted with great anger. I am not going to be intimidated by anyone on any question, either in this House or outside it. This man has been known to me personally for some years and, angry as I was, I treated the outburst as one of the kind which can be made as a result of anger, stupidity or arrogance-the 'I will break your neck' kind of threat. And angry as I was, I was prepared fo dismiss it. On reflection, I may have treated it too lightly. I saw him later, in less heat, to discuss tobacco advertising issues, and at that meeting I treated the threat as a closed matter. I referred in passing to this question at a party room meeting on Tuesday, which was once again reported in the press. I think it is about time we held our party room meetings in the open; it would make things much easier. When I referred to the matter I took great pains not to identify the individual, directly or indirectly or by organisation. As I have made plain, there are very many representatives of the tobacco industry. In the Sydney Morning Herald he was referred to as a 'tobacco industry representative'; in the Melbourne Age as 'the tobacco lobby'. I was telephoned last night-around 6 o'clock-obviously in response to the coverage that had been given to the party room meeting and to what I had said, almost in passing at that meeting, about the threat made to me which had considerably reduced the level of amity of the conversation. As I said, this telephone call was plainly and arguably in answer to this coverage. In this call I, who had given further thought to this matter, pressed him on the question of what he had said. He appeared unwilling to say what he did say. But he denied that he had ever said it. He said that I had invented the threat; that I had fabricated it; that I was being emotive; that the whole incident had never happened. Well, of course, two questions arise. If conversation that I have related never took place, if he was not involved and did not call me, why did he know that he was the unnamed, unidentified representative of the tobacco industry and why did he call me? There is only one answer to those two questions. The conversation most certainly did take place. I brought the issue here because on reflection I have attached more importance to it than I originally gave to it. This has been reinforced by the fact that the honourable member for Moreton ( Mr Donald Cameron), at least one other member and myself have received petitions which were addressed to us and circulated very swiftly in our electorates. These are designed to tell the electorate that we are in favour of limitations on freedom of speech; that we are supporting curbs on freedom of commercial speech. There have been other forms of pressure. It has been conveyed to me-sometimes not too subtly-that the tobacco industry is a very powerful industry. It has also been conveyed to me that my electorate of North Sydney is the home of the Australian advertising industry-again, sometimes with a considerable lack of subtlety. I am not attacking those industries; I am recording what has happened. Any doubts that I had as to what I should do were removed by this telephone call last night because there is no doubt that on this issue that person was, quite plainly, determined to lie. Questions arise: Was he, by accusing me of inventing this conversation, for which no possible motive can be suggested on my part, attempting to silence me by saying, in effect, 'Be warned; if you take this matter further I will claim that you invented this story.'? I have not identified this individual; I still do not intend to do so. The potential for damage to his career is great and his conduct may have been due simply to stupidity, arrogance and anger which he later felt that he had to deny. My advice to him is to think again and to draw back. Let him and anyone else who might be minded to use threats or intimidation against me, directly or indirectly, understand that on this or on any other issue I will use this forum, day in and day out, to express my views-views that powerful interests may dispute-and to resist the and reject any form of intimidation. I will never be intimidated from saying and pursuing what I believe. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would prefer to lose my seat than to give into any kind of intimidation. Any group that wants to take me on is welcome to do so. I make these final points. I use this forum today for the good reason that I and others could not face the possibility, however remote it might be, of litigation backed by the kinds of interests that have been conjured up. None of us wants to be ground down by litigation backed by resources that we simply cannot match. That is, of course, one of the great reasons why we have absolute immunity in this House. For the same reason, I do not intend to comment on this conversation outside the House. It was not I, I might point out, who made it public outside the confines of the party room and I have never identified the individual. But I will make it quite plain that if attacked I will come back into this House day in and day out to meet my attackers. If I believe that on any future occasion any question of attempted intimidation of me is made or suggested, I will have no hesitation, Mr Deputy Speaker, in coming back to this House and in using the forms of this House, including its power to punish for contempt of the House. In that course of action, I believe I would have the support of every member of the House.",52
46,Mr BALDWIN ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Sydney) (12.57)-While noting the fine record of the present Federal Government in the field of nature conservation throughout its term of office, I wish to draw attention to a recent decision in relation to the south-east forests of New South Wales which provides the basis for an effective redefinition of the term 'forest waste'. I believe that the decision to grant Harris Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd a licence to export a further 150,000 tonnes of woodchips derived from Victorian sawmill off-cuts and thinnings represents a tragic waste of our forest resource. In failing to substitute the Victorian resource for timber allocations from the National Estate forests of New South Wales-which is a proposition which the conservation movement has been pushing-we have lost a precious opportunity to protect the conservation values of old growth forests while satisfying the pulpwood requirements of the industry. The needless sacrifice of a chance to protect the National Estate forests in this manner represents a source of forest waste as readily apparent as timber left lying on the forest floor after harvesting. I seriously regret the decision to issue an additional woodchip export permit. My concern rests on two points: that the decision was not in any way necessary; and that loss of the National Estate forests represents a sacrifice too great to countenance. The possibility of job losses in the timber industry motivated the decision. However, in my opinion, those losses can be avoided. The sacrifice involves the loss of outstanding servation values of these forest. I think it is important to note that this whole argument about the south-east forests essentially relates to a transitional problem. Nobody-none of the other participantsdisputes that. The long term way to go in the exploitation of these forest resources is native hardwood plantations, but of course that takes a certain amount of time to come on stream and in the meantime there is an interim problem. The conservation movement has effectively sought to address that problem and has come up with what I believe to be viable interim solutions. Time does not permit me, within the context of this debate, to go into all those issues, but seems to me that if we are to address Australia's present problem of an adverse trade balance in forest products, we have a whole range of options for adding value to timber that in the long run will be far more efficacious in terms of job creation and far less damaging ecologically than what is currently being done with this woodchipping industry. Even if the problem of job losses is not so easily resolved, I do not believe it is outside the realms of possibility for the Government to step into provide the assistance required to overcome difficulties associated with restructuring of the industry. It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that the forest resource is managed to provide for a viable timber industry, and to ensure that the industry provides appropriate employment opportunities to sustain regional development. The Victorian resource provided a suitable supply of pulpwood but was questioned in terms of its capacity to generate sufficient employment. Given that the industry is in the process of undergoing rapid structural change anyway, government assistance to facilitate the use of this alternative resource could have allowed for a more efficient transition to new technologies and employment opportunities while also satisfying genuine environmental concerns. While such an injection of funds has by no means been established as having been necessary to save jobs, the option should have been rejected only if protection of National Estate forests was deemed to be unworthy of the cost. Why is the Government compelled to procon- tect these areas and what is at stake? Honourable members who have followed this debate will be familiar with the question of the long-footed potoroo. My first point refers to rare species such as the long-footed potoroo, which is threatened with possible extinction if logging of National Estate forests in the south-east proceeds. The long-footed potaroo represents the importance of maintaining old growth forests in their natural state in order to protect biological diversity. Secondly, the wilderness values of Coolangubra are at stake. By now all honourable members must be fully aware of the scientific, educational, recreational opportunities that our vanishing wilderness provides. Finally, proit tection of the National Estate areas of the south-east will protect the quality and flow of water from the Tantawangalo catchment. Section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act requires Federal Ministers and their departments and agencies to ensure that no action is taken which will adversely affect a National Estate place unle-s they are satisfied that there are 'no feasible and prudent alternatives'. One wonders precisely what would constitute a 'feasible or prudent alternative' to timber for woodchips in New South Wales, if not timber for woodchips, from Victoria. It should also be noted that the 1989 export permit under which Harris Daishowa currently operates states: Standing roundwood shall be utilised for production of woodchips under this licence only when supplies of sawmill waste and logging residues available to the company are being utilised to the fullest possible. To grant the Victorian resource to Harris Daishowa under a separate licence rather than under the existing export permit is in breach of the spirit of the agreement as much as it is in breach of the spirit of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. In relation to protection of these forests, the Commissioner also has a clear international responsibility under migratory birds agreements with Japan and China. Three birds listed under these agreements are found in the south-east forests-the white throated needletail, the white-bellied sea eagle and the fork-tailed swift. The agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan for the protection of migratory birds and birds in danger of extinction in their environment, known as JAMBA, and the agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the protection of migratory birds and their environment, known as CAMBA, both require each government to establish sanctuaries to protect migratory birds and to seek means to prevent damage to such birds in their habitats. It is even less acceptable to pass up an opportunity tq halt logging in the National Estate when there are international as well as national imperatives to protect these forests. This brings me to my final point which may be referenced to the oft-quoted but infrequently heeded Brundtland report. The report defines sustainable development as: . . . development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. I submit that all levels of government are responsible for the protection of the interests of future generations and that the Commonwealth should, through the discharge of its powers, do its utmost to encourage truly sustainable development. In the light of the recent decision, however, it seems necessary to reiterate the fundamental point that sustainable forestry practices do not merely involve chopping down trees as fast as they grow. Sustainable forest management implies ensuring that all the values forests provide are available for the benefit of future generations. These values, as noted earlier, are related to concepts such as biological diverextent sity, wilderness and catchment protection. Sustainable resources development must be premised on a sound system of nature conservation. In Australia, this system encompasses reserves established and managed by State government authorities, such as national parks, and areas identified and protected under Commonwealth legislation, such as the National Estate. The decision to simply export more woodchips, rather than use the unallocated resource to substitute for National Estate based pulpwood, has undermined progress towards establishing a sustainable forest industry. The waste that this decision represents-a wasted opportunity and a waste of our forest resource-should be recycled; recycled into a renewed concern for the protection of the National Estate forests of the south-east of New South Wales. This concern should be expressed in a renegotiation of the conditions of the Harris Daishowa export licence, implementing an immediate ban on the export of woodchips derived from timber from areas listed on the Register of the National Estate.",53
47,Mr MCGAURAN ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Gippsland) (1.06)-I wish to draw the attention of the House to a very important issue that affects my electorate of Gippsland. Indeed, it is an issue of crucial concern to a great many regional and rural dwellers throughout the breadth and length of Australia-that is, the role that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) plays in providing a service to those who live outside our metropolitan areas. I cannot stress strongly enough the importance of the ABC in the daily lives of rural and regional citizens. Members have to understand-and although it seems so obvious, I reaffirm this simple fact-that regional dwellers do not enjoy the same range of radio services that are taken for granted by urban dwellers. However trite that point seems, it has to be said time and time again so that the Government and the ABC management understand and accept their responsibilities in providing a radio service of sufficient quality, which can be received adequately by those outside our dominant urban areas. Country dwellers do not have the same choice of entertainment that those in the cities have at their fingertips, so the ABC looms very large as a source of information. The ABC has a function and responsibility to provide programs of interest and relevance to the farmers, the primary producers, by way of weather broadcasts and updates of industry news. Indeed, the ABC is invaluable in times of emergency in country areas-I refer specifically to floods and bush fires that afflict my own electorate of Gippsland at regular intervals. It plays a very important role and in the past has been instrumental in the saving of life and property. Moreover, the ABC should reflect to a very large extent that more greatly enhanced sense of community which is enjoyed by people living in country areas. Tragically, the ABC services to regional Australia have deteriorated very significantly in the past few years. Regrettably, the ABC neither reaches all Australians, nor provides the service so desperately needed. Due to funding cutbacks by the Federal Government in the last Budget,the ABC has had to defer for at least 12 months the introduction of the second regional network-that is, the network which would transfer regional ABC broadcasters onto the FM band. Radio National and the metropolitan networks will continue unabated, but because of the deferment of the second regional network, the future of local programming is cast into doubt. The truth is that the ABC, whilst operating within very stringent budgetary constraints, has directed its resources in a imbalanced way towards metropolitan listeners. I make no apology for accusing David Hill, the Managing Director of the ABC, and former Chairman, of chasing ratings at the expense of upholding the charter upon which the ABC is based. This chasing of ratings has seriously disadvantaged regional and country listeners because it means that what resources are available to the ABC-and admittedly they are very limited-are being used to satisfy the larger metropolitan catchment areas. So how do country people compete on a numbers basis so as to satisfy David Hill's manic desire to achieve rating parity with commercial networks? Obviously, they lack the numbers to be able to do so. In Gippsland, local content and programming has been cut to its very bare bones. Whilst the Sale regional service of the ABC is very professional and popular, the proof is that it is far, far too limited in its scope. Indeed, we worry that with the deferment of the second regional network there will also be either a curtailment or an abandonment of the ABC's plans to construct a new studio facility. We are told that it will be considered in the near future, but the construction of a new studio in Sale has been promised for a long time and is urgently needed. There is great confusion and uncertainty surrounding the fate of the Sale regional branch of the ABC, not just in the housing of its facilities but also in regard to the numbers of staff. At present Sale has positions for some eight staff. There is a concern that with the downgrading of the new Sale regional ABC studios, there will also be a loss of staff in the future. Both concepts are totally and utterly incomprehensible, given the responsibilities which are supposed to govern the provision of ABC services. Locally produced afternoon and Sunday programs on these regional radio services have been dropped and programs are now networked from Melbourne. Local programming during holiday periods has been reduced to a few hours per day. I believe that we should rename the ABC the CBC-the City Broadcasting Corporation.!There is no doubt whatsoever that the current policy direction of the ABC is to the disadvantage of country listeners. Whilst very David Hill and his cohorts within the ABC toss aside their responsibilities to country listeners-and Gippsland is as good an example if not a better example than anywhere else in Australia-then we will continue to see the abandonment of country people's interests. It is simply intolerable that the ABC has rejected the needs and aspirations of country people. Money is being spent on a metropolitan youth audience with the extension from Sydney of the J11 network, which just adds to all of the other ABC radio services available to metropolitan listeners. I urge this Parliament to take note of the specific example of Gippsland and realise that the stripping of resources and functions of the Gippsland branch is being reproduced in many different parts of Australia. I believe that this is a very dangerous development in the context. <;>f the ABC's national broadcasting responsibility and I call upon the board of the ABC, in its consideration of the future of the second regional network, to have due regard to the Gippsland needs. The studio that has been long expected and so desperately needed must be built in the next financial year, 1991. Moreover, there should be no reduction in staff. Mr Deputy Speaker, I switch now to an entirely different subject. It will be of interest to those members of parliament who have good memories or those who are students of political history to know that in the gallery today is Mr Frank Chamberlain, a pre-eminent broadcaster and journalist for many decades. Mr Chamberlain is known to many people and I am very pleased to advise the House that he has visited the new Parliament House for the first time. Of course, as so many people know, he was a journalist for some 40 years and has known every Prime Minister from Billy Hughes. The Frank Chamberlain radio broadcasts were very popular and influential reproductions of the goings-on of Parliament House. I should point out that Mr Chamberlain has an affiliation with my electorate of Gippsland in that he is a commentator and columnist with the Bairnsdale Advertiser, making him the longest serving journalist or columnist for any newspaper in Australia.",55
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,57
49,Mr GORMAN ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Greenway) (1.l6)-ln the grievance debate today I will try to cover three or four items. Firstly, I wish to mention my recent trip as one of the Australian delegates to the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference held in London between 4 and 9 September. The leader of the delegation was Mr Tom Uren, the member for Reid. I was one of the Australian delegates to address the conference, which was attended by some 1,500 delegates from almost every country of the world. I spoke about the future peaceful use of outer space. Mr Uren was given the honour of addressing the conference on several occasions. I personally consider him to be one of the best leaders I have had the pleasure of serving under. Prior to attending the London conference, I visited Poland and with the assistance of the Australian High Commissioner, Mr Laurie Herron, I had the great fortune and good luck to meet that great Polish Solidarity leader Mr Lech Walesa. What a wonderful person Lech Walesa is. In my opinion, the fight over the past 20 years by Solidarity, led by Lech Walesa and supported by thousands of Polish people, has resulted in the events we are now seeing in eastern Europe. Australia now has a golden opportunity of gaining many thousands of migrant families, not only from Poland but also from the other countries in the Eastern bloc. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) should be addressing that fact by sending staff to the various overseas posts to ensure that we obtain as many suitably qualified families as possible. Everyone in the chamber would agree that the migrants who have come to this country have helped to build it into what it is today. Most members would realise that I do not take part in many debates in this chamber as I have always considered that one should do all one's debating in the committees on which one serves. If one fails to persuade others of one's point of view, one has the last opportunity of kicking over the traces in the Caucus room. There are a couple of other items I would like to mention. I believe that we must curtail the foreign ownership of Australia and, in particular, I refer to the purchase of our tourist complexes in vast land areas by the very rich nations of the north. I suppose that one would have to say that Japan was one of the major CUlprits. Earlier I mentioned the honourable member for Reid. I must say that I have disagreed with him in relation to the speeches he has made about payments to ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese. I do not disagree that they should be paid every benefit to which they are entitled and many others to which they are not even assumed to be entitled. Also, no ex-serviceman who served in the Second World War should be stopped from receiving any medical benefit that he now finds himself needing. In relation to the ex-prisoners of the Japanese, I believe that this country should now negotiate with what is perhaps the richest country in the world-Japanand try to obtain from that country an undertaking to contribute to, if not cover in full, the costs of rehabilitating our ex-soldiers. I refer not only to those ex-prisoners of war, of whom the honourable member for Reid was one, but also to every service man and woman who served in any theatre of war against the Japanese. We must remember that Japan started the war and therefore it should pay its full debt now that it is in a position to do so. Everybody in the chamber realises that the democratic nations of the world built up the Japanese as a bastion to counter the fears of the communist hordes coming from Russia, China and other countries. But having built up the Japanese with funds from this country, Britain and the United States of America, having rebuilt their industry so that they could compete-and they do not only compete; they have taken over much of the world's car production and many other types of manufacturing industry-it is now time for the Australian Government to convince Japan that it should start to pay its debt for the suffering of the prisoners-of-war and other personnel that it caused by starting the war against the United States in the Pacific. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak for a few minutes. I have not used up all my time.",57
50,Mr HALVERSON ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Casey) (1.21)-1 wonder how many members of this Parliament have bothered to carefully read the document entitled National Agenda for Women-Implementation Report, which was distributed with other Budget-related papers in August this year. One searches in vain through this report to find something-a heading or even a subheading-which acknowledges the important role and specific needs of women who have chosen their homes and families as their main area of interest and activity. Not, I hasten to add, from any point of view that would sustain the old and outdated idea that a woman's place is in the home, but just some acknowledgment of the enormous range of duties and responsibilities undertaken, and significant social and economic contributions made, by the hundreds of thousands of women who, when asked to describe their primary occupation, reply 'mother' or 'home manager'. Despite the Hawke Government's much vaunted National Agenda for Women, the sad and alarming fact is that when the policy options are being examined, when the money is being handed out, and when the recognition is being given, the efforts, needs and work value of those whose first priorities lie on the home front are undeservedly· and unjustifiably forgotten. Recent research undertaken by the University of Melbourne indicates that the value of unpaid work undertaken by women in relation to their family roles, duties and responsibilities as mothers and home managers . outstrips the productivity value of the entire Australian mining industry. Why is this enormous contribution made by the household sector of the economy regarded by the Government as being of so little, if any, significance? A very clear illustration of thi- regrettable situation is provided in National Agenda for Women-Implementation Report. The concluding section, some 16 pages of this report, is devoted to a set of statistics which are referred to as 'gender equality indicators'whatever that means. These are explained as illustrating 'the position of women relative to men', and are used by the Government to monitor the progress of its plan of action on the National Agenda for Women. Unfortunately, none of these so-called equality indicators include any reference to the position of women relative to men when it comes to home and family duties and obligations. In fact, the role and contribution of those women who choose, either temporarily or permanently, to leave the paid work force to concentrate on their family responsibilities is entirely ignored. For example, indicator 7 refers to occupational segregation. There are three categories listed: the first, disproportionately male occupations; the second, balanced occupations· and the third, disproportionately female' occupations. In the accompanying explanatory notes which detail just which occupations are i!1cluded in each ca.tegory, there is no mentIon of any occupatIon related specifically to managing a home or raising a family. Evidently, to be regarded as being productively and legitimately occupied, women have to be in the paid work force. It occurs to me, however, that many women, and not necessarily just those in paid employment, would qualify for inclusion under all three categories. Ask any busy mother and she will tell you that her extensivealbeit unpaid-duties cover everything from road transport driver, which is in category 1, through health worker, machine operator and factory hand in category 2, to teacher, nurse, telephonist, cashier and"",cleaner in category 3. Perhaps the occupati'l'n of mother is too difficult to categorise, pe-haps someone just forgot to include it, or perhaps, as I said before, unless a woman is in paid employment she is not regarded as being productively and legitimately occupied-at least, not so far as the Office of the Status of Women is concerned. Whatever the reason, the end result is the same. The social and economic worth of unpaid work undertaken in the home is effectively ignored. Let us continue our examination of the gender equality indicators. Indicator 8 refers to the women in decision making positions in management and indicator 9 to the women in decision making positions in parliament. Members need not bother looking for any indicator regarding women in decision making positions in home and family, because there is not one for that. One can only assume that the powers that be decided to exclude it because the male component of our community would feel too threatened by the results. They should not have worried; most of us already know. Gender equality indicator No. 11 is entitled 'Income level and distribution for year full-time workers'. Once again there is no category for women who work full-year full-time caring for their homes and their families. Perhaps the income level would have been too embarrassing. Perhaps the definition of 'full-year full-time' was not considered broad enough to include the on-call, 24hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week shifts worked by many women in the course of fulfilling their horne duties. Indicator No. 13-'Use of child-care'shows that in 1980, 17 per cent of family units with children under 12 years of age used formal child-care; by 1987 this had increased to 24 per cent. Unfortunately, no reasons for this significant increase are provided, but I am sure most of us could hazard a guess that increasing financial pressures on Australian families may have something to do with it and current horne mortgage interest rates are certainly not helping to improve the situation. It would be very interesting to know how many women have been forced into the work force, often against their will and best intentions, because many families can no longer cope, even when they want to, on single incomes. Also, how many women are postponing having families or limiting the number of children they have because parenthood is fast becoming a luxury many can no longer afford. Indicator 14 is entitled 'Availability of child-care for women who want to work'. One should note that the term used is 'want to work'; no mention is made of those who have to work. In any event, once again we find that in the context of this indicator, work only refers to paid employment in the labour force. Women who may want some temporary respite from their children in order to pursue their unpaid horne-related duties, such as housework or shopping, had better be prepared to make their own arrangements. Why is there not any room on this list for a gender equality indicator in regard to horne and family responsibilities? Although in our changing society many women and men share these duties, when it comes to analysing the figures, the women would still win hands down. By excluding any reference to unpaid work undertaken at horne, those who prepared this report have done a grave disservfullice to the increasing numbers of women who, through choice or necessity, combine their duties in the paid work force with the considerable additional unpaid workload involved in the caring for a family and maintaining a horne. It is a daunting challenge indeed, but one that is undertaken very successfully by many women. I again emphasise that I am not in any way advocating that women should be denied the equality of opportunity and of status that they unequivocally deserve, or that they should in any way be deprived of their hard won and long overdue rights in regard to such things as education and employment. Neither am I ignoring or belittling the contribution made by many men in regard to household and parenting duties. I do, however, believe that women should be able to examine all the options and should be able to choose the one, or more, which they prefer. It should be their decision and not only should they have the freedom of choice to decide what they want to do but also their decision should be respected and never undervalued odgnored. If these women devote their energies and capabilities to their homes and families, it is just as legitimate, just as deserving of encouragement and support and just as worthy of recognition as if they choose a career in the paid work force. It is probably appropriate in this debate to allow a woman to have the last word. I would like to quote some comments made by Mrs Gracia Baylor, the President of the National Council of Women of Victoria on the subject of unpaid work carried out by women not in paid employment. Mrs Baylor sums it up very well. She says: When considering the value to the economy of unpaid work such as housekeeping, child minding, gardening, house painting and countless other family activities such as teaching children to brush their teeth, helping with their homework, reading stories, one finds that the family contributes an extra amount of 'wealth' to the community, estimated to be around 34 per cent of gross domestic product. . Only when family members are earning outside the home is their product measured. Since most of the home activity is undertaken by women, it is useful to note the attitude of the UN. Status of Women Committee . . . ""there is a conceptual flaw in any definition of employment which does not consider housewives as being economically employed"". If, in our materialistic society, some people are campaigning to downgrade the value of work done in the home, there should be a counterbalancing campaign to upgrade it. Lowering its status does not make it disappear nor extinguish its value. Mr CUNNINGHAM (1.31)-In my electorate of MCMillan the local media is highlighting a problem that persists primarily in the Latrobe Valley area and that problem is, of course, families in distress. As I see it, there are two effective solutions to the distress being experienced in my region. The most effective solution is employment. The second solution relates to the support available to families from the Government and the community at large; support such as that given by the Mission of St James and St John, and people such as Jenny Potten, Julie Hardy and Lynn Evans whose work is highlighted in the first of the articles that have appeared in the local media. I want to make a few comments about those two solutions. First of all, the solution is jobs; jobs and more jobs. If we could ensure that everyone was gainfully employed, no families in the Latrobe Valley would need to endure the hardships of financial distress, at least. People in my region have heard me say this time and time again, and today the message is the same: we need to attract more industry to the region; more industry generates employment which, in turn, lessens these social problems. While attaining full employment in our area may be viewed by some as being overly optimistic, greater employment in the region-at the very least-is essential. Of course, hardship afflicts both people in the work force and those incapable of working. For those. Latrobe Valley people not working, in terms of income, the situation has improved substantially in the last couple of years. The introduction of the family assistance package in the 1987 Budget made large inroads into the numbers suffering extreme financial duress. Indeed, solely in terms of income, many families have been lifted above the poverty line in the last two years. That includes many local single parents, a group highlighted by the local media. To pinpoint the extent of this assistance I refer to a report entitled The income dimensions of child poverty in Australia which was presented to the Child Poverty in Australia conference held in Melbourne last April. The report was written by Helen Brownlee from the Australian Institute of Family Studies and Anthony King from the National Insti(MCMillan) tute of Economic and Industry Research. The report concluded: With the implementation of the package, the number of children in poverty in low income working families falls from 206,400 to 49,600, a reduction of 76 per cent. It went on to say: The package appears to have less, albeit a substantial impact on pensioner and beneficiary families since the number of children in poverty falls by 30 per cent. The package has a greater impact on poverty among children in married couple families than in single parent families with the decrease being 38 per cent in married couple families compared to a fall of 21 per cent in single parent families. The report also suggested: Pensioner and beneficiary families need additional income if they are to be moved out of poverty. The cost of eliminating the before housing poverty gap for the 301,200 children in pensioner and beneficiary families is not unduly large, that is, $136 million annum (after the full implementation of the FAS package) or around $9 per week per child, both for children in single parent and married couple families. I point out that the Government adopted many of the extra measures in this year's Budget. Significant pension, child-care and rent assistance increases, combined with a network of carefully constructed employment, education and housing policies, have gone a long way toward eliminating much of the income-caused distress in my region. I do not claim success in the Latrobe Valley on the grounds of increased income. Problems still exist; that is obvious. But I want to refute some of the figures that are being touted. The number of single parents in poverty has dropped substantially since 1985-86-43 per cent, as was quoted in the Latrobe Valley Express. Since then a lot has been done, as I have just mentioned. The Brownlee and King report, produced prior to the last Budget increase, shows that the number of single parent families in poverty has dropped significantly by degrees ranging from 20 to 53 per cent. The 1989 Budget improved on that position. Also, the 1985-86 statistics include a large number of cash flow figures for farmers who were adversely affected by the commodity price crash of 198485. These statistics should not now be used to talk down our region, particularly the Valley. They are outdated; made that way by even greater government assistance and a marked upturn in the commodity markets. The last thing we need in our region is the attachment of a negative local slant to a national and very old statistic. However, I will not deny that a problem persists in the Latrobe Valley. Turning a blind eye to this problem is neither my style nor that of the Government. Significant levels of distress remain in the Valley despite the Government's new measures. I witness many examples of this first hand. My office handles cases of families in financial difficulties every week. These people, more often than not, start above the poverty line but fall into poverty through mismanagement of their personal affairs, personal tragedy and so on. Greater education on financial management and consumer advice is of tremendous assistance to many of these families. Such a measure is needed I believe because per credit is so easily available nowadays and the enticements are great. Of course, getting everyone in the region a job would be a great help. I am working hard in both these fields. The Latrobe Valley task force, which I convened, remains committed to attracting industry to the region and creating jobs required to ease the problem. The Government has also continued to increase its commitment to low income earners. But let me give the public a stark and ominous warning. The problems in the Latrobe Valley and elsewhere will be dramatically worsened if we allow the Opposition to come in and cut certain essential areas of welfare, as it has said it will do in its so called action plan. It is targeting those people in my region and other regions of Australia-particularly outside the capital cities-who are only now starting to feel the benefits of the restructure that is taking place in this country. Because Opposition members see that there is almost full employment in the cities they believe that they can put policies into operation which will attack those people who are least able to support themselves. I call on the Opposition to have a good hard look at what it calls an 'action plan'. I call it a 'destruction plan' for many parts of regional Australia. Of course we know that the Opposition needs to do this. How else could it afford to return capital gains tax revenue to its big business supporters? I do not think the Opposition has too many of them either, but, certainly there will always be some who put their own interests ahead of other people in the community. The Opposition intends to help that 0.8 per cent of the Australian population who pay capital gains tax at the expense of those who can least afford to have what little they receive cut back. It is a national disgrace in 1989 to see any opposition put forward what it calls an 'action plan' which seeks to save funds at the expense of those families who are least able to afford it; people who have been unemployed long term; and people who live in parts of regional Australia which have not at this stage fully participated in the restructure of the economy. Many of those regions are now being targeted by investors from all over who are looking to take advantage of the opportunity to train these people and put them back into work. The last thing they need right now is a kick in the teeth at the very time when they seek the support of the Government and the community. I would like to commend those in my community-the churches of all denominations-who cooperate with the Government in assisting any family who gets into difficulties. Money is not all that is required to assist Australian families. There will always be occasions when people will make management decisions which will put them into distress, which will cause the problems that many of us-as backbenchers or as people in the welfare area-see. At this stage in the restructuring of Australia, it is very important that all members of this House fully realise the extent of what has been put into place to assist families and not take actions which are aimed at helping a very small percentage of our community by handing back to them some $400m to $500m, which has to be taken from somebody else if we are to have responsible economic policy. Why is it that the Opposition seems to think that it can buy its way into the next election by taking this sort of measure? I fully reject this approach and I call on it to change its crazy direction.",58

55,Mr GOODLUCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Petrol prices, too, affect people. We have to talk about the real issues that affect the people of Australia. I refer particularly to Tasmania. In Tasmania at the moment the Government is talking about closing down schools. At the moment it is the burning political issue all over the State. The Labor Party has tried to rationalise and the Greens have said, 'We do not want it done this way; we want it done another way'. So instead of getting on and working together for the good of Tasmania, trying to overcome the difficulties that have occurred as a result of the strike and trying to get jobs for people, they are arguing the toss over their philosophical points of view. I have just read in the Hobart Mercury a couple of little recommendations made by our friend Mrs Milne in cohort with the Greens. They have gone against the Labor Party's recommendations and have said, 'Do not close the 26 schools; close only nine of them'. These are among the recommendations that Mrs Milne has put forward: Flagstaff Gully Primary School-'undesirable and unnecessary integration'. I do not know what that means. The next recommendation concerns St Martin's Special School. I went there the other day to have a look at that little school, which is doing a marvellous job. I am sure the teachers there do not vote for me. The teachers in Tasmania do not vote for Bruce John Good luck; they are all paid up members of the Labor Party. But I felt sorry for these teachers. There they are, looking after these poor underprivileged children and now the school is to be removed. The reason is that it is 'open to noise and pollution'. However, the school itself is to be retained at another campus. In a Labor electorate-right in the heart of Denison-this nice little school is doing a marvellous job with underprivileged children, but the Government is taking it away because of noise and pollution. What a lot of rot!",62

57,Mr MACPHEE ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Goldstein)-As this might be the last occasion upon which I will speak in this Parliament, I wish to record my deep appreciation to my wife, Julie, and son, Scobie, for having supported me so steadfastly during the last 15 stressful years. Politics is never easy and it has only been made bearable for me because of their love and their commitment to the liberal principles that I have tried to practise and pursue in policies. I would also like to thank all of my wonderful staff who have served me so loyally over those 15 years. I have been truly fortunate in having staff who became enduring friends. In particular, I wish to thank Barbara White, who was my first electorate secretary and senior private secretary and has kept on returning to help me whenever a crisis has developed. To all of my friends and supporters I simply say: thank you very much.",63
58,Mr BILNEY ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Kingston)-I want to express my sense of dismay and outrage at what is happening in the South Pacific in relation to drift netting. Recently a new tuna migration season started and it has been reported that vessels from Japan and Taiwan are moving into position in the South Pacific to lay nets up to 100 kilometres long across the path of the migrating tuna. I have also seen a report that the season's albacore tuna catch last year was 49,000 tonnes, which the Forum Fisheries Agency estimates at about five times the sustainable yield. What we have in prospect, therefore, is an ecological tragedy. I commend the Australian Government for bringing together the 20 nations of the South Pacific, which are meeting at the moment, to try to formalise a convention which will ban this practice. However, we already know that Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, which ban drift netting in their own waters, have not given much indication of being prepared to cooperate in banning the so-called 'wall of death' fishing method which drift netting involves. I think that desperate situations demand desperate measures. I am not one to advocate the breaking of international law, but I think that perhaps the time has come for non-governmental organisations which I support, such as Greenpeace, to go into the area and make it just as difficult for this murderous practice to be carried on as it has tried to do with nuclear tests in the South Pacific-MONICA",63

Indeed, Gladstone Area Promotion and DevelopEmptyHere Corones, who is in the gallery today, have done a magnificent job in promoting Gladstone. Gone are the days when Gladstone was seen as an industrial, polluted city. It has won Tidy Towns awards five years in succession and it is leading the way in tourism in Queensland. Indeed, just recently we had the fourteenth Martin Hanson Memorial Art Exhibition which demonstrated the broad aspect of culture that Gladstone now has. In fact, there were more than 220 entries in the art show, which demonstrates that our city not only has a large industrial and tourist base but also has a great cultural base which shows the spirit and feeling of the people. I am very pleased to be associated with the Gladstone promotion bureau and people such as Alderman Peter Corones, who are making it happen in central Queensland.",63
61,Ms MCHUGH ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Phillip)-Last Sunday morning, like most people, I was at home looking forward to enjoying a quiet and precious family time when a chemist came calling. Of course the press had said that the pharmacists were going to door-knock my electorate that day, but it simply had not occurred to me that they would include my house in their rounds. After all, I have spent many long hours listening to pharmacists over the last few months: taking down figures they gave me, passing them on to the Government, et cetera, so why do the 50 steps to my house on a nice Sunday morning? Honourable members can imagine my surprise when, still in my house gown-a pink one-I opened the door to an excited, eager man in a coat-a white one-bearing a plastic bag of pharmaceuticals. I greeted him and was about to express my surprise when he thrust a leaflet in my hand, earnestly requesting me to read it. I was a bit taken back to see it was covered in signs saying 'Vote no to MCHugh: MCHugh doesn't care', so I expressed my astonishment. 'Oh, it's true', my visitor said, 'She's most unsympathetic'. 'Why do you think that?', I asked in amazement. 'Well, she said so', he said confidently. When I asked, 'To whom?' he said, 'To us, the pharmacists, to me'. At this my face must have registered such shock that in the ensuing pause my face registered with my visitor. It suddenly dawned on him that he was talking to MCHugh and, as we both knew, for the first till;le. I asked him in. The pharmacists' press releases had said, 'Make them welcome, give them a minute of your time'. I gave him half an hour. I discovered that he had been told, and was telling my constituents, and his friends were telling my constituents and neighbours, many things that I was alleged to have said. Back at my office on Monday morning, we were deluged with calls from constituents, outraged that the white coat brigade had come from afar to tell them how to vote in Phillip.",64

63,Mr IAN ROBINSON ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Page)-I wish to raise briefly the very serious issue of the failure of the Government to take effective action following the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on the effects of asbestos mining on the Aboriginal community at Baryulgil, in my electorate. In recent weeks the community has expressed great concern because of the difficulty in obtaining any precise indication of a move that is long overdue to at least tackle some of the 10 recommendations of the report that was made by the Standing Committee. The effect, of course, has been to jeopardise the health of those who have been affected by asbestosis. Testing has been done by private arrangement. There has been no move to set up a proper health service and none of the propositions that were indicated have been, in any way, supported by the Government. I have discussed the matter personally with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand), who assures me that there is documentation that will give answers to some of these aspects that I have raised. I look forward to that, but I do urge that some positive action be taken in this important matter.",64
64,Mr JOHNS ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Petrie)-I have here absolute proof that the National Party Government of Queensland has been, under the stage Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, ripping off not only the Commonwealth, but also its own tenants and those who borrow money from the housing commission. Under that agreement, the State Government is supposed to contribute money-not an equal amount to the Commonwealth, but a fair amount. This is what the Queensland Government does: over the years 1984-5 to 19878, the Commonwealth contributed $370m to Queensland housing commission people. The Queensland Government contributed $2.2m. This is how the Queensland National Party fudges the figures: the Queensland Government takes money from us in grants and cheap loans and from its own rental operations-from those people who rent a housing commission home-it makes a $23.5m profit. Out of the home purchase assistance scheme, which is cheap money from us, the Queensland Government makes a profit of $151.4m. So the Queensland Government makes a total profit of around $175m out of the CommonweaJth and its own tenants and owners. That is the Queensland National Party Government's own contribution. The money comes from us. So the Government rips us off and rips off its own tenants-MONICA",64

66,Mr HAWKER ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Wannon)-Today I want to draw to the attention of honourable members yet another example of Australian innovation being sold off overseas. Again, it is the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) which, having developed an innovative quarantine assessment package, now finds that the Australian Government will not support it. It is likely that the idea will be sold to the United States of America and it will probably be used against Australia whenit gets to the United States. This comes on top of the loss of the gene shears, the removal of Sarich engines and various other things that just seem to go out of this country. The present Government keeps ignoring the damage this is doing to Australia and to our balance of payments. As the CSIRO's chief research scientist, Dr Bob Sutherst, said, he had hoped to keep this innovative. quarantine assessment package in Australia, but the Federal Government had failed to fund its development, or support its many applications. I think that says it all, and it shows. yet again that the Government's concern about research, the CSIRO, and the development of new industries, is nothing more than a load of hot air.",65
67,Mr MILTON ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"La Trobe)-I had hoped to make an adjournment speech on the need for increases in Australia's overseas aid program but the extensive 'legislative program of the Government, which is presently being debated, means that there is little time for adjournment speeches. I therefore take the opportunity today to thank the 524 petitioners who have passed on to me petitions I have presented to the House which call for an increase in Australian overseas aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national product and for a cut in military spending of one per cent. I have not covered all the requests made in the petition as I will do that on another occasion in this House, but I do wish to acknowledge the valuable work being done by the Australian Labor Party Third World Forum and the One World Declaration which the petitioners were supporting. The petitioners were also supporting one of the recommendations of the recently tabled report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that overseas aid be increased from the current 0.36 per cent of gross national product to 0.5 per cent by 1992. As the honourable member for Fraser ( Mr Langmore), who is chairman of the forum, has pointed out, this recommendation is particularly important because it reflects the views of a large all party parliamentary committee. I highly commend the petitioners and the Committee on their call for a more generous policy on overseas aid.",65
68,Mr GOODLUCK ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Franklin)-I am stunned. Today I have· heard a lot of politicking. Is there to be an election in Queensland or something? There is to be one in South Australia, I believe, and there will be a Federal one soon. I would like to tell honourable members opposite to get one thing straight: they are all talking about poverty and people having difficulty and I understand that they want to stick up for their constituents; but the main reason why we have poverty and people are suffering in Australia at the moment is interest rates. Interest rates are affecting a lot of ordinary people who cannot get out front and tell the world that they are battling to pay their mortgages and their car loans. That is why we have so many problems in Australia today. I would plead with the honourable members opposite to start talking to the snowy-headed fellow and telling him that interest rates are really crippling this country and that he had better do something about it.",65
69,Mr CHYNOWETH ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Dunkley)-The type of campaign adopted by the conservatives in 1989 is similar to that of 1949 and it was probably chosen for similar reasons. Under Curtin and Chifley, Labor had been in government for some time. It had been found to be a trustworthy government and none of the calamitous consequences predicted by the conservatives at previous elections had eventuated. Therefore Labor's opponents chose to appeal to voters by pretending to advocate those things that Labor had always proposed. I refer particularly to the 1949 promise to provide five shillings per week in child endowment for the first child in addition to the 10 shillings per week for the second and subsequent children already provided under the Labor Government. At that time this promise was considered to have been a very substantial factor in the conservative election victory. The 1989 Liberal tactic of promising financial benefit to families is very similar. The Liberal-Country Party Government showed its true colours and lack of real concern for the family by leaving the rate of child endowment unchanged for many years. With continuing inflation this meant a substantial reduction in the purchasing power of child endowment. In the case of a family with three children the value of child endowment in real terms became less than it had received under Labor, despite the apparent increase of five shillings for the first child. The 1949 promise was an insincere vote catcher and no doubt the 1989 promise for families is just as insincere MONICA",65
70,Mr COWAN ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Lyne)-On behalf of the Australian Pork Producers Federation, I wish to raise concerns about the importation of Canadian frozen pork into Australia. Members of the Federation are very concerned about the disease known as TGE because in Australia and New Zealand we are completely free of this disease. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) and the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) have made their decision to allow the importation of the frozen pork from Canada and there is now concern among pig breeders throughout the industry that this decision should be reversed. I make an appeal to both Ministers to look at the situation and to protect our Australian pig breeders.",66

72,Mr HAWKE ,LEBANON,"Wills-Prime Minister)by leave-Honourable members will be aware of the tragic events which have taken place in Lebanon overnight, with the brutal assassination of the newly elected Lebanese President, Mr Rene Muawad, and the death of at least 20 others. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia and, I know, on behalf of all members of this Parliament, I extend my deepest sympathy to Mr Muawad's wife and family and to the families of those who were killed with him. The fact that this brutal murder took place on Lebanon's National Day only heightens our sense of outrage at such a callous act. Mr Muawad's death comes a mere 17 days after his election as President at a session of the Lebanese Parliament. That same session of Parliament also ratified the agreement of national reconciliation reached at Ta'if in Saudi Arabia by a meeting of Lebanese members of parliament. The Ta'if agreement was seen, and properly seen, as an historic breakthrough in the search for a negotiated settlement of the underlying problems which have contributed to the tragic cycle of violence in Lebanon over the past 14 years. Australia and other Western countries have consistently supported the Arab League negotiations which led to the agreement. The Ta'if agreement recommended a set of political reforms supported by representatives of all communities in Lebanon and aimed at creating the conditions for the restoration of Lebanon's territorial integrity, uniformity and sovereignty. The goal was to rebuild a free and independent Lebanon in which people of all beliefs could live in peace and contribute to the nation's prosperity and development. It took immense courage on the part of the members of the Lebanese Parliament to come together and negotiate an agreement for the benefit of all Lebanese in the face of brutal threats. Mr Muawad was a man committed to peace, and his preparedness to stand for the presidency was testimony to his courage. As he said in a speech following his election: I am one of you and you know me as a man of reconciliation dedicated to the concept of unity, a man who has gambled his life in return for the reconciliation of all Lebanese, irrespective of persuasion. Reconciliation excludes nobody, even those who insist on excluding themselves. Reconciliation is for all and can accommodate all. Let us hope that President Muawad, like the legions of other Lebanese victims of the violence, did not die in vain. Let us hope that there are other Lebanese with the courage to continue the process begun at Ta'if. Mr Muawad's death will be a significant setback to Lebanon's search for peace and stability. Indeed, it may ignite further conflict. It is now up to those remaining in the Lebanese Parliament to rescue the Ta'if agreement. Tragically, that task has been made much more difficult by the President's death. Mr Speaker, as you know, only yesterday I planted a cedar tree in commemoration of the Lebanese National Day. I pointed to the Ta'if agreement and to Mr Muawad's election as the most promising signs of peace in Lebanon for a very long time. Today, in the face of the appalling events of last night, I can only repeat in sadness the call I made yesterday in hope for all parties in Lebanon to cooperate in the process of national conciliation, to bring about a political settlement which will enable Moslems and Christians to live side by side in peace. My thoughts are with the Australian Lebanese community, who only yesterday were celebrating Lebanon's National Day of Independence and the promising signs of hope for the future. Those hopes have been seriously set back but they have not been destroyed. It is clearer than ever today that the only lasting solution to the Lebanese conflict will be a negotiated political one. A continuation of the cycle of violence will solve nothing. I call on all Lebanese and others involved in that country's crisis to exercise restraint and to try once again to rebuild the process begun at Ta'if. EmptyHere Opposition)-by leave-The Opposition joins with the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Government in expressing our horror and our revulsion at the assassination some few hours ago of the recently elected President of Lebanon, Mr Rene Muawad. This is a senseless crime of appalling violence. It is an outrage against civilised values and an undoubted affront to even minimal standards of human decency. It has, as the Prime Mintheir ister has indicated, dealt a cruel blow to the brief, flickering hopes of a more peaceful future for Lebanon that we have seen emerging over recent weeks. In human terms, this assassination has exacted a sickening toll. The bomb blast that killed the President also took the lives of many others. Their deaths will add to the grief of the long suffering people of Lebanon who have already endured intolerable levels of violence and death for far too long. President Muawad was a brave and a conciliatory man who dared to see through the sad history of Lebanon's recent past to the vision of a new Lebanon, peaceful and unified. He was denied the opportunity to put his ideals into practice and no-one can now truly assess how much he would have achieved but he did offer, if only briefly, a new hope for Lebanon's suffering people. He has tragically lost the gamble, ironically referred to in the words so aptly read by the Prime Minister from his speech addressed to the Lebanese Parliament on 5 October, I think, on the occasion of his election. He has lost the gamble of his life and his dream for reconciliation in Lebanon has been brutally rejected. The tragedy, of course, goes beyond the appalling loss of human life that it has caused. It threatens a return to the destructive climate of violence and of fear in which the Lebanese people have been forced to live for far too long already. Confessional differences within Lebanon as well as intervention by external forces have reaped, as all members of this Parliament are well aware, a harvest of destruction. We on this side of the House have long had a clear position that no settlement can be imposed on Lebanon by force and that the only path to a peaceful and unified Lebanon is that of negotiation and compromise as epitomised in the Ta'if agreement. We also call on Lebanon's neighbours not to exacerbate the current difficulties and not to act in ways that will regenerate the destructive cycle of violence and death. We extend our sympathy to the Government and the people of Lebanon in this recent tragedy. We know that the large Australian Lebanese community will be outraged by the assassination, that it will be important for them to maintain their hope for and their encouragement of the forces of national reconciliation in Lebanon. In President Muawad's speech to the Lebanese Parliament, of which the Prime Minister read an extract earlier, he issued a call to the citizens of his country to look to a new future and a new Lebanon. He said: Let us put an end once and for all to violence and fighting. Let all of us stop turning to arms and return to the power of right words. It is the right of our people to enjoy life. It is the right of our children be born and grow in a peaceful and free environment and for us all to live in prosperity and tranquillity. It is our deepest hope that this dream of Lebanon's future has not died with its Preswith ident, that his successor will be elected quickly, that common sense will prevail and that efforts to find a durable peace in non will continue.",66
73,Mr SPEAKER,LEBANON,"I am sure that all 1982. honourable members join in the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition. I will ensure that they are transmitted to the Lebanese Ambassador. NA NA EmptyHere to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his speech in Parliament yesterdid-they day when he said, among other things: We do not utter rhetoric; we deliver on the ises that we have made. Noting that there are only 38 days until the end of the year, what action does the Prime Minister propose to take to fulfil his promise to the Australian people, made in the Westpolicy ern Australian election campaign, that home loan interest rates would fall to 15 per cent? In view of the huge balance deficit figure of $2.24 billion reported for October, will the Prime Minister confirm that interest rates are likely to continue record levels well past the end of this year?",68
74,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,The hypocrisy of the policy Leader of the Opposition on this issue of interest rates is staggering. I will establish the hypocrisy of this position. Members of the Opposition profess a concern about high interest rates while what is absolutely clear is that their policies virtually explicitly call for even ·higher interest rates. Opposition members-Rubbish!,68
75,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"They can say, 'Rubbish'. Let me refer to page 22 of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. It refers to an effectively independent central bank and states: The next Coalition Government will conduct monetary policy with the medium-term objective of reducing and eventually eliminating inflation. That immediately raises the obvious questo tion: If 18 per cent bill rates, the current level, are only gradually slowing the economy, as they are, what rates will those opposite want to eliminate inflation, especially weaker fiscal and wages policies? We need to look at what members of the Opposition are saying about the two other arms Lebaof policy-fiscal policy and wages policy. First, they say that they will take the central restraints off wages precisely as they did in So what we would have in that entirely hypothetical situation, if they were in the power, is a 1982-style wages blow-out. Opposition members-Oh!",68
76,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"Members of the Opposition can oh and ah and make other noises, which is about the limit of their intellectual capacity, but the fact is that one does not to be theoretical about this because in office in 1981-82 that is precisely what they lifted the lid off wages and there was an 18 per cent wages explosion. Secondly, in the area of the other arm of polpromicy-that is, fiscal policy-members of the Opposition have tried to adopt our policy, except that the abolition of the capital gains tax will leave a gaping fiscal hole in later years. There would be less reliance on wages and a weaker fiscal policy, so inevitably there would be greater emphasis on monetary policy. In those circumstances we would of payments see a repeat of 1982. I remind the House that in 1982 there were not 18 per cent bill rates, but 22 per at cent bill rates. When a government is managing an economy, if there is a weaker wages and a weaker fiscal policY, then it is inevitable that it must run a tighter monetary policy. Obviously any person in government will say that he does not want interest rates higher for a day longer than is necessary. I have said that many times. I repeat: the Government is neither a masochist nor a sadist, but we have accepted the responsibility that we are not going to accept the alternative of conservative strategy which was demonstrated in the early part of these years. Those opposite had no wages policy; so with excessive reliance on monetary policy, what did they do? They plunged the Australian economy into its worse recession in 50 years. Those opposite can heehaw, laugh and explode as much as they like, but they will not expunge that fact from the Australian historical record. The tragedy is not that they did it once, but that they promise an inevitable return to it again because they have no wages policy, they will have a weaker fiscal policy and, instead of what we are doing-----,a ual rundown of demand with a responsible wages policy which will give us a soft landing, a continuation of growth and employment-there is the inevitable consequence of a promise to return to the policies of 198182? EmptyHere recession?",68
77,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,69
78,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"Inevitably, there is the certainty, under the Liberals' prescription, of the worse recession in 50 years. There will be no recession under Labor; there will be a running down of the rate of growth that we have now, which will sustain employment and growth in this country. NA",69
79,Ms CRAWFORD,PUBLIC HOSPITALS,"Can the Minister for Community Services and Health inform the House of the effect on Medicare of removing the provision of free access for all Australians to public hospitals according to medical need? What are the Government's intentions in this matter? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I submit that the second part of the honourable member's question is clearly asking for an announcement of Government policy. She asked in absolute terms: What arf' the Government's intentions? Those in! .1tions are policy and, as such, the second part of her question should be ruled out of order.",69
80,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC HOSPITALS,"The question is in order. Dr BLEWETTI thank the honourable member for Forde for her question, which reflects her commitment to Medicare, Australia's most successful, most popular and, indeed, most stable health insurance system. Its medical and economic success is clearly reflected in the fact that it has the support of some 71 per cent of Australians; indeed, one can say that it has become an accepted fact of Australian life. People like Medicare very much for its fairness; and, of those who want it changed, most want to expand it to cover additional services, not dismantle it or curtail it. Any changes the Government makes to Medicare will be in line with the grad- community's outstanding endorsement of those Medicare principles. I make it clear that the Government has no plans whatever to remove non-means tested free access to public hospitals for all Australians. A fundamental component of Medicare is that there would-Mr Shack-They cannot get in. They are queued up out the door.",69
81,Dr BLEWETT,PUBLIC HOSPITALS,"We will deal with the honourable member for Tangney in a moment. A fundamental component of Medicare was the commitment that there would be no means testing for entry into public hospitals, as there had been in the past. Medicare extended to all Australia the free public hospital system that Queensland has had and valued for the past 50 years. If we pick up the dribbles that are coming from the honourable member for Tangney about his health policy, one theme runs through those dribbles-the intention of driving people back into private insurance by imposing means tests on the public hospital system. I would be very happy indeed for the honourable member for Tangney to get up in this place and deny that he intends to reintroduce a means test for the public hospital system. One of the reasons that he is being muzzled about his health plans and that we only get dribbles and no health plans, is that the conservation forces in Queensland do not want to be told before the Queensland election that their free hospital system of 50 years will be undermined by a National-Liberal government, if it is in power, introducing for the first time in 50 years in Queensland means testing in the public hospital system. That is why the shadow Minister has been silenced and why, as yet, we have no indication of his health plan. We could talk about the whole health plan because despite innumerable promises we do not yet have a health plan from the Opposition. We have had five health plans in the past and we have had five shadow health spokesmen. Most of them are now dotted around the back benches. Each of the five health proposals is abandoned as soon as an election is out of the way. It is rather like the Fraser health schemes-one every other year. Let us consider what the honourable member for Tangney has said about this long promised health plan of his. Over 12 months ago, in November 1988, the honourable member for Tangney said that he was going over what he called the Tuckey plan-an interesting one-and that he hoped to launch a health policy statement early next year, that is, early in 1989. We have waited all of 1989 and we have had no health plan from the Opposition.",69
82,Mr BEAZLEY ,PUBLIC HOSPITALS,"No Tuckey, either.",70
83,Dr BLEWETT,PUBLIC HOSPITALS,"Yes, no health plan and no Tuckey. On 3 September when interviewed, the honourable member for Tangney said: Well, the health insurance policy of the Opposition is finalised. It is yet to receive shadow Cabinet sideration and party level approval. It will be released in my expectation probably in October. So, in September we were told we were to get this health plan in October. October has come and gone and there is no health plan. When the media asked the honourable member again, on 21 November this year, we were told that it is not going to be released this year. So, after having waited a whole year, the honourable member for Tangney says that it is not going to be released this year. In fact, even more interestingly, he said: My own view is that it will be released before the election campaign. If in fact that is not true, the Opposition will be simply asking the Australian people to buy one more pig in a poke. Let me conclude by pointing out clearly that, given the size of health in the Budget of this country, the Opposition cannot have an economic action plan, it cannot have an economic strategy and it cannot have any economic credibility until it has dealt with its health plan.

92,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I have said in this place before and I have said outside this place that the Government, like every other economic commentator in this country, underestimated the strength of demand. I am not saying something new. I have said that. But we are not alone. Every commentator in the country underestimated the strength of demand. As we have come to recognise that strength of demand and as I have outlined in this place at length, I have, as Prime Minister of this country, and in coordination with the Treasurer and my colleagues in Cabinet, ensured that each arm of policy has been tightened appropriately to meet that situation. I will not inflict upon the House the details of the strength of those individual arms of policy. I did that yesterday and I am not going to repeat it. But I do not resile in this place from the statement, whether it is Goldman Sachs or anyone else, that this Government, as with all other economic commentators, as I say, underestimated the strength of demand. But the important thing is that we have now put in place, and strongly in place, the relevant arms of policy. I repeat what I said in this place earlier this afternoon, that the alternative between ourselves and the honourable members opposite is stark, because what they would do if they were ever given the opportunity would be to repeat the prescription of the. beginning of the 1980s which plunged this country into its worse recession in 50 years. One cannot rewrite the record books. One cannot get all the history books and all the text books and rip the pages out and say that 1981 and 1982 did not occur. They did. Unfortunately, the great tragedy in the politics and the economics of this country is that honourable members opposite have not learnt the lesson of 1981 and 1982. All they promise to inflict upon the Australian people again is a wages explosion, recession and disaster for everyone. That tragedy is compounded now by the fact that they are also saying to the people of Australia that they will abolish the capital gains tax. So, they would deny to the government of this country billions of dollars which would enable it not only to sustain but to increase the payments to the lower income and middle income people who need and deserve the support of this country. The philosophy, ideology and total commitment of honourable members opposite is this: they will take billions of dollars from 99 per cent of Australians to stuff into the pockets of their wealthy supporters. Try it if you likeit will not work. MICRO-ECONOMIC REFORM",70
93,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. In the light of .the Garnaut report that the Prime Minister launched last night, can he inform the House how the Government will further its program of micro-economic reform?",71

95,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I heard· as the honourable gentleman finished asking his question the parroting of 'further', the implication being that there has been no micro-economic reform. I repeat to the House today what I have said before. I ask honourable members opposite to accept the challenge that has been put to them-not only by me but by other people. We have got our record of micro-economic reform. We simply ask members of the Opposition to accept the challenge of showing any comparable period in the 30 of the 33 years they were in power before we came to office where they came within cooee of this Government's program of implemented micro-economic reform. The answer is that they cannot because they have never had the guts, the wisdom, the intellect, the understanding, or the freedom from those who controlled them to take on the vested interests of this country. They never could and they never will. I was a little surprised to see some commentators this morning interpreting our response to the Garnaut report as cool or disappointing.",71

98,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMIC POLICY,"May I say that that was not in any sense the universal response. There were many commentators who understood the strength of the embrace by the Government of the Garnaut report. Last night I said that the Government welcomes the report and wholeheartedly embraces its vision. I commissioned the report knowing that Garnaut would suggest further policy initiatives to continue the progress that has already been made. In response, I not only committed my Government to giving close, immediate and very sympathetic consideration to all its recommendations but last night I also indicated the immediate acceptance of some of those specific recommendations. We recognise the dangers of the complacency of which Professor Garnaut speaks, and despite the unprecedented achievements of micro-economic reform to which I have referred-Opposition members-Ha, hal",71
99,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMIC POLICY,"Just substitute for the hollow laugh an acceptance of the challenge I have put to honourable members opposite.

103,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMIC POLICY,"Obviously, one could not respond in detail last night to the mass of recommendations made by Dr Garnaut. Anyone who suggests that we should have already made up our minds on a sweeping recommendation such as the proposal to abolish all tariffs by the beginning of next century simply does not understand· how effective reform is achieved. As we have shown, and as Professor Garnaut recognises in the report, achieving the turning of the tide in protectionism and effective micro-economic reform requires deliberate policy design, careful negotiation of consensus, leadership, vision and guts. As I said last night, only Labor Party has the past record, the present policies and the future strategy to deliver further in that area. What have the conservatives said this morning about Professor Garnaut's report? They have truly been very cautious. The Leader of the National Party of Australia was asked about the elimination of tariffs by the start of next century. All he did was repeat his existing policy about progressive and predictable tariff cuts. What did honourable members opposite do in 30 years? Precisely nothing. The shadow Treasurer says that he has not yet digested the report, and the shadow Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce says he supports the year 2000 deadline. He attaches a very interesting phrase to that. He supports the year 2000 deadline 'only if other countries moved in the same direction'. I respond to that with a phrase that may jog the memory of the Liberals: 'We are not waiting for the world'. Do honourable members opposite remember that phrase? They said that in 1983. Honourable members opposite do not have to worry about the world waiting for them: the Australian electorate would not have them then and it will not have them again. MICRO-ECONOMIC REFORM",72
104,Mr NA BROWN,ECONOMIC POLICY,"If I can get the Prime Minister to concentrate on the same issue again for a moment, I refer him to his novel statement last night about foreign debt when he said: We could not reconstruct the Australian economy without it . . . the countries of north-east Asia ran large current account deficits when reconstructing their economies. Will the Prime Minister explain how this will happen? Given the slow progress in reconstructing the Australian economy and the absolutely abysmal growth in productivity, how much higher would he say our foreign debt has to rise before we see the success of his eccentric theory and before Australia's restructuring actually gets under way?",72
105,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMIC POLICY,"We now have a new opposition spokesman in the economic area. I am more than happy to answer in some detail the question that has been asked by the honourable gentleman. We on this side of the House welcome the proposed summit the that has been suggested by the Business Council of Australia because we want to encourage debate on important economic issues, as we have done since 1983. Let me say on this question of foreign debt that we believe in the case, for instance, of the Macquarie Bank that, while we would have no argument with the three goals it has put forward, that is, structural reform, greater investment and domestic savings-action has been taken in all of those areas-in our judgment there has been an exaggeration by the bank of the dimensions of the difficulties in this area. In that respect I would not only rely on my own judgment but also refer to the House the observations that have been made since the statement by the Macquarie Bank by the ex-Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bob Johnston. I will quote from what he had to say at the beginning of this week. The observation from Mike Carlton, by way of introduction, was: Let's take another view of this, not from the Macquarie Bank but a knowledgeable independent view from Bob Johnston. What the ex-Governor of the Reserve Bank had to say is very interesting. He said: I think that we have to maintain some balance in this. There is no doubt that the events of the last year or so, with the extremely high rate of spending we have had, have in a way tended to obscure the steady progress that we were making on several fronts and still are really. We mustn't forgetMONICA",72
106,Mr NA BROWN ,ECONOMIC POLICY,What are you doing about that?,73
107,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMIC POLICY,"If this Johnny-come-lately in the area of economic policy would listen, he would understand that the ex-Governor of the Reserve Bank was talking about precisely that-what we have been doing. That is what he is talking about. Let me read the brief to to the learned barrister so that he can understand it. How would one like to have one's life in his hands when he cannot understand something as simple as this? If honourable members opposite would listen the former Governor of the Reserve Bank said: There is no doubt that the events of the last year . . . have in a way tended to obscure the steady progress that we were making on several fronts and still are Do honourable members opposite understand that? Do they understand what the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, who has somewhat more knowledge of these events than they do, is saying? I will repeat it so that the third time what he had to say might get through to their uninformed minds. He said that it obscures 'the steady progress we were making on several fronts and still are'. In other words, the Government has been doing the things which are appropriate, and still is. Perhaps the honourable member will understand that as the answer to his question. The former Governor of the Reserve Bank said: We mustn't forget what has been done in the area of fiscal policy. The honourable member will forget it, but the former Governor of the Reserve Bank does not. He said that we must not forgeteven if the honourable member for his miserable purposes does-what has been done in the area of fiscal policy, the wage negotiations and even the deregulation. He also said: . We have come a long way in the 1980s. There you have it; the former Governor of the Reserve Bank spelling it out. He did not say, of course, what a hell of a job this Government had after inheriting this country's worse recession in 50 years and inheriting 30 years of the Government of honourable members opposite in which they did nothing to restructure the economy. In effect, Bob Johnston was saying, 'Thank God we have a government which has come in and done something'. There is the answer to the honourable member's question, not just from the Prime Minister but from a former Governor of the Reserve Bank, who says that these things have been done to address the fundamental problems. Mr Blunt-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. Before the Prime Minister concludes can I remind him that he was asked to provide an assessment of the level of foreign debt.",73

129,Mr HOWE,AGREEMENTS PROGRAM,"I thank the honourable member for Scullin for his question. His electorate includes a wide range of people from different ethnic backgrounds. The question the Government's intention to establish a network of cost sharing social security agreements for Australia's migrant source countries is one of considerable interest to him also to people within his electorate. This action was prompted by the need for more effective social security coverage for people who move between Australia and other countries. These agreements help people in a number of ways: for example, they enable people in Australia who contribute to other countries' social security schemes, and who then move to Australia, to obtain access to social security payments from those to other countdes. Some countries will not make pension payments to Australia unless there is a social security agreement. These agreements will also allow former Australian residents now living overseas to obtain social security coverage from Australia for the time spent here. There will also be agreements used to overcome gaps in coverage and to make sure that people are entitled to adequate social security coverage from the country they live in. Under these agreements, people are able to add together periods of residence and periods of contribution in other countries in order to meet minimum qualifying criteria for payment. They usually obtain part pension from both countries concerned. While there is often ignorant comment made about the cost of these sorts of agreements, it should be noted that in 1988-89 pension payments made by Australia to people overseas totalled $142m, but pension payments made by other countries to Australia totalled $310m. In answer to the honourable member, Australia has completed reciprocal agreements with Italy and Canada. An agreement with Malta is expected to be signed in February next year and the agreement with Spain in December this year. Discussions have also been held with Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany and Portugal. Preliminary talks have also been held with a number of other countries, including Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia. An important part of such agreements, as you will know, Mr Speaker, is that there should be consultation with the affected communities. The agreement with in Italy, which is in operation, is expected to benefit about 40,000 people of Italian origin who are now living both in Australia and in Italy. Like many other countries, Australia also has other arrangements that allow some Australian pensions to be portable; that is, they can be paid to people living abroad. I think it will be understood by all able members in the House that the movement towards reciprocal social security agreements is one of considerable benefit to people in Australia as well as to people who have lived in Australia but returned to their country of origin. It is a rational policy that will serve Australia well into the future. By way of conclusion, I simply contrast that with an irrational policy, a policy which would not go under the rubric of multiculturalism but which would arbitrarily, with no basis whatsoever, withdraw assistance to people of migrant origin within the first 12 months of their residence in Australia, arguably the most vulnerable period. That shows an insensitivity that could only be devised by people who are quite ignorant of the needs of migrant communities in this country. NA NA",74
130,Mr DOWNER,PROGRAMS,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. In the light of the crippling effect of high home loan interest rates on families, why is it that in this year's Budget the Government is reducing funding for home purchase assistance programs in South Australia by 32 per cent in real terms, and why has such funding for South Australia been reduced in real terms by 70 per cent since 1983?",75
131,Mr HAWKE,PROGRAMS,"Let me say that I would never, at face value, accept any statistics which the honourable gentleman included in his question. I am not prepared to accept at face value what he said. I will refer to the matter by dealing with this Government's record in housing both absolutely and then in comparison with what the Opposition has done. The position is that, under our first home owners scheme-an initiative which was designated by the housing industry as the most imaginative housing scheme that had been introduced in this country-over 340,000 Australian families have been enabled to buy their first home,. and families in South Australia, as well as families around Australia, have been the beneficiaries of that scheme. Our reforms to the financial system have given thousands of home buyers access to housing finance on first mortgage terms. In conjunction with our colleagues in the States-and that went across the political honour- spectrum-we had a Premiers Conference and, as a result, we have taken a range of initiatives in conjunction with the States to boost the supply of resources to the housing industry, including, most importantly, land. That arrangement has now been carried through in the States in cooperation with the Commonwealth. Let us consider what has happened to private housing commencements under this Government as compared to the situation· when those honourable members opposite were in government. The average annual level of private housing commencements under this Government has been over 128,000 per annum, and that is 10,000 per annum more than in the period when the Opposition was in government.

136,Mrs DARLING,SAFETY,"Can the Minister for Incussion dustrial Relations report to the House occupational health and safety, particularly Australia. in the context of its significance for microeconomic reform, and also on the position of the States with regard to Federal initiatives? EmptyHere honourable member has raised-occupacountry. tional health and safety and the injuries illnesses involved in the workplace-is one of considerable importance. More than 400 Australians a year die of workplace injuries or related workplace illnesses and about Australians each week incur workplace rethe lated illnesses. The cost to this country enormous-$10,000m per year. Obviously, this issue of occupational health and safety has to be given considerable attention by Government under the area of micro-ecoNational nomic reform. It is being given that attention. Not only is a $10,000m cost incurred, but also 10 times as many days are lost through work-related illnesses and injuries as there are through industrial disputes. We hear a lot from honourable members opposite about industrial disputes. We hear very little about occupational health and safety. Government members-They don't care. EmptyHere do not care, but I will come to that in a moment. A few weeks ago all Ministers for labour met in Darwin and one of the issues discussed was this important area of occupational health and safety. Given the honourable member's interest, particularly in regard to what is happening in Queensland, I can say that all State and Territory Ministers and I agreed to a national review of occupational health and safety by the Federal Department of Industrial Relations and by Worksafe Australia. Worksafe Australia is the operational arm of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC). That review will carry out a stock take of what has been achieved since 1985 by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission-the first time in our history that there has been a national organisation on this issue across industry, the trade union movement, and all State, Territory and Federal governments. There will be an assessment of what still needs to be done to ensure effective delivery at the workplace. Early next month I will be releasing a disdocument on this matter as part of on the commencement of the review across I say to the honourable member and to the House that reducing injuries in the workplace and reducing work-related illnesses has be a major priority of everyone in this It is certainly a major priority of and this Government, and everyone agrees that this is the way to go. Every State government, each of the Territory governments, this Government, industry, trade unions, 6,000 managers-everyone out there who lives in real world, not that other world of the is honourable member for Wentworth-knows that; everyone, except the Federal Opposition. The Federal Opposition, in its 'ecothis nomic inaction plan', wants to abolish the Occupational Health and Safety Commission. Along with the abolition of that goes the abolition of FarmSafe. I would have thought that members of the National Party would have some interest in this issue, but they have no interest at all. The abolition of NOHSC and FarmSafe just indicates to this House and to this nation how out of touch those who sit opposite are. Their industrial relations policy is out of touch with industry. As I said the other day, four out of five chief executives in businesses in this country do not want a bar of them as they are out of touch with industrial relations and out of touch with occupational health and safety. I can say to the honourable member and to her constituents, and all those people out there in the workplace who are working to reduce the incidence of occupational health and safety injuries, that this Government, along with our colleagues, will maintain the important priority of reducing the incidence of workplace related illnesses and injuries.

190,Mr HOLDING ,PRIVILEGE,"Melbourne Ports-Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) - Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a matter of privilege. I have had a conversation with the honourable member for Hotham ( Mr Kent), who is in a state of some considerable distress. There can be no more serious allegation made against any member of this House than that he is a paid agent of a foreign power. That allegation goes to both the quality and the nature of the representation of the honourable member. To suggest that any honourable member is the agent of a foreign power and, by virtue of that fact, is abusing his office in this place clearly is a matter of privilege and I raise it as such. I have been in this House on a number of occasions when this kind of allegation has been thrown across the chamber. Today it was raised in a much more serious way in the Senate. We have sat here and listened to members of the Opposition who want to indulge themselves in this kind of exercise lecturing us over the last week about propriety and how we name people in this House. I ask that you, Mr Speaker, consider this matter as a breach of privilege. You may take the relevant steps under the Standing Orders to see that the honourable member for Hotham, and those who made these allegations against him, make these allegations within the due process of this House so that their veracity can be tested and the credibility of those who make these - lander­ ous allegations can be dealt with.",79
191,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,There are two ways in which the House can deal with this matter. I can take on board what the Minister has said and report back to the House as to whether I see a prima facie case and will grant precedence or the House can pass a resolution to report the matter to the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges for it to deal with. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the allegation against the honourable member for Hotham be referred to the Committee of Privileges.,80
192,Mr HOWARD ,PRIVILEGE,"Is it not the customary practice of the Speaker on occasions such as this, firstly, to form a judgment as to whether a prima facie breach of privilege arises and only then, if an adverse judgment is made by the Speaker, is it appropriate for a motion to be moved? Do you have a prima facie view about a breach of privilege, Mr Speaker?",80
193,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I have outlined the position to the House. As I understand it, the House can dispatch the matter with the approach as outlined by the honourable member for Bennelong or we can have the approach that has been proposed by the Minister. As I understand it, the House can make a decision to refer a matter to the Committee of Privileges or the Speaker can come back and say that the Speaker has considered the matter and will grant precedence for it to be referred to the Committee of Privileges. There are those two methods of doing it.",80
194,Mr SINCLAIR ,PRIVILEGE,"New England) (3.11)The question of privilege is one of the most fundamental as far as Parliament is concerned. It is not a matter that is canvassed lightly; it affects the rights and entitlements of the Parliament as a whole. I suggest that the matter being canvassed is, of course, serious to the honourable member for Hotham ( Mr Kent), but it is also true that it is a matter within this Parliament and within its Standing Orders. If it is outside of the Standing Orders, I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that it may well have been outside the Standing Orders when it was canvassed other than by this motion. If it is canvassed outside of the Standing Orders, that does not make it a breach of privilege. If it is not a breach of privilege, I suggest that the motion moved by the Leader of the House ( Mr Beazley) is entirely inappropriate, the point being that there are procedures within our Standing Orders. If they are not followed, it must be picked up at the time and you, or whoever sits in your place, should immediately say that it is outside the Standing Orders and should not be proceeded with. As it has been allowed to proceed, you cannot subsequently say that a wrong decision has been taken by the Chair in allowing the matter to proceed, and suddenly say that it has become a breach of privilege. The matter is demonstrably not a breach of privilege. It could well have been addressed at the time it was raised. It was not addressed at that time and therefore it cannot be raised in this form now. If it had been raised in another House and there had been no opportunity for it to be canvassed, it might well be that a matter could be considered. But I suggest that it would be quite extraordinary for the House of Representatives to decide that a matter that had been allowed within the proceedings of the Senate should be determined a breach of privilege in this House. Therefore, without in any way wishing to enter into the debate about the issue raised, as I know nothing of it, I suggest that on both counts this procedure is inappropriate. The motion moved by the Leader of the House is incorrect and I suggest to you, therefore, that it should be withdrawn. I think the most appropriate procedure would be for you to revert to the alternative procedure, to which you properly referred, for the matter to be considered and for you to come back and say whether the matter should be dealt with in the way that has been proposed. I do not believe it should proceed in that way. I believe this motion is wrong and therefore should be withdrawn. Mr Reith-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories has indicated that he proposes to speak to the motion. My point of order is that, according to House of Representatives Practice, page 722, before a motion such as this can be debated, you need to give the motion precedence. To do so, you need to establish a prima facie case. My point of order is that, as you have not given the matter precedence and as you have not made a ruling as to the prima facie nature of the motion, it would be better for you to give the matter your due consideration and follow your usual practice.",80
195,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"As 1I have said, we are dealing with two matters-the matter of precedence and the matter that the House can deal with. These involve standing orders 95 and 96. The Leader of the House has moved a motion. The House is the master of its own destiny. Does the Leader of the House wish to speak further to the point of order?",81
196,Mr BEAZLEY ,PRIVILEGE,No. Your response to the point of order was quite correct; that was the point 1 was about to make.,81
197,Mr HOLDING ,PRIVILEGE,"Melbourne Ports-Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) (3.15)-1 want to address this motion in terms of the remarks that have been made by the right honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair). There is much learning on the whole question of privilege; most of it is to be found not in this House but in the House of Commons. It rests essentially on the concept that members of parliament, if they are to be free to discharge their obligations to their constituents, have to be able to do that free of threat and free of pressure. Allegations that go either to corrupt practices or to intimidation to make them change either their vcite in the House or how they operate have always been regarded seriously by the House of Commons as going to the whole question of the rights and entitlements of members. Let us look at what has occurred here. It has been suggested, by innuendo and by direct statement, that the honourable member for Hotham ( Mr Kent) is virtually an agent of a foreign power. That is the allegation. is as simple and as direct as that. If that were true, does anybody seriously believe that that member could discharge in any honourable way the responsibilities that go with being a member of this Parliament? Of course he could not. If that allegation had one tittle of truth, does anybody not believe that it would be a matter of disgrace not merely for the honourable member concerned but for this Parliament as an institution? 1 find it fascinating that the people who lecture us about the sanctity of an individual's reputation and who say that we must not mention certain businessmen or join issue on political standards can come into the Senate or this House with the vilest of allegations. What worse thing could one say about a member of this House than that at the time that he took his oath of office he was working for a foreign power? Let those who allege, prove. It is not a matter of our dealing with gentlemen in the Senate. If any man or woman of honour wants to make such an allegation against a member of this House, that member is entitled to the protection of this House, of both sides of the House. Let those who allege, prove. 1I have been in two parliaments and 1I have never heard a more serious allegation than this. 1 was sickened to the heart to hear this allegation from people who ought to know better. Do honourable members really believe in this institution of Parliament when they take points of order saying that a procedure is not appropriate and that you, Mr Speaker, have to find some prima facie case? What more prima facie case can one have than someone saying that a member of this Parliament is a traitor not merely to this institution but also to his country. That is the allegation. The Parliament should carry this motion unanimously. It is not merely about the reputation of the honourable member; it is about the reputation and integrity of this House. Every member is entitled to the protection of this institution. 1 commend the motion.",81
198,Mr FIFE ,PRIVILEGE,Hume-Manager of Opposition Business) (3.18)-This is obviously a very important and very serious matter and one about which the honourable member for It Bruce ( Mr Aldred) has been asking for an inquiry for some time. He is quite happy for it to be referred to the Committee of Privileges and the Opposition will support the motion.,81
199,Mr UREN ,PRIVILEGE,"Reid) (3.19)-I rise to say a few words because 1I have lived through an experience such as this. 1 see it as important because, when 1 was a ve,ry young member, 1 was accused in the adjournment debate in the House on 29 November 1962 of asking questions in the House on behalf of the Soviet Union. About three months after that, Soviet First Secretary Skripov was named persona non grata. Before the House reassembled, a newspaper article appeared, saying that I was encouraged to ask delicate defence questions on behalf of the Soviet Union. It took me 6t years-long yearsgoing through every court in this land, and even to the Privy Council, to clear my name. Even after clearing my name, the matter was still in Hansard. I had not got up to make any clarification because of the sub judice nature of the case. By the time. I made my explanation the person who had made the original remark was a Minister in the Gorton Government. All he said when I made my personal explanation was that instead of naming Skripov he should have named Gamazeishchikov; that was his mistake. It is to be found in the Hansard records of 12, 13 and 14 August 1969, which clearly show the debate and also the hate of some individuals then in government who did not want to admit they had made a mistake. In the end, to Gorton's great credit, he actually forced that dumb individual-Dudley Erwin, who was then the Minister for Air-to the microphone to say that he was wrong and my statement was right. I know how the honourable member for Hotham ( Mr Kent) feels when it is said he is an agent of another country and is being treacherous to the land he is in-that he owes an allegiance to somewhere else, yet is an elected member of the House of Representatives. I do not care what the legality is. The Speaker gave us two options and we have taken one of those. I am glad that the Manager of Opposition Business ( Mr Fife) has said the Opposition will support this motion. I am getting to the end of my parliamentary days, and I hope this sickness on both sides of the House stops. It is about time that the House got down to policies and got off personalities. I hope that this inquiry can cleanse this Parliament. If there is any smear campaign or gutter stuff I hope that people in the community will understand that some people use this place as a coward's castle. I hope this motion is agreed to, because I understand quite clearly what the honourable member for Hotham says. The matter I have referred to is very fresh in my mind. I have been doing a little research into and writing about my parliamentary life lately and that is why a lot of the dates are very clear in my memory. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",81

201,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to· the House for discussion, namely: The Hawke-Keating Government's failure to achieve any fundamental improvement in the balance of payments and, hence, to bring about a sustainable reduction in interest rates. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their p/acesMONICA",82
202,Dr HEWSON ,INTEREST RATES,"Wentworth) (3.23)-The matter of public importance before the House today is as follows: The Hawke-Keating Government's failure to achieve any fundamental improvement in the balance of payments and, hence, to bring about tainable reduction in interest rates. I begin by remarking that it is a very sad commentary on the policy paralysis in the Hawke Government that th- Treasurer ( Mr Keating) is overseas at the present time on an unimportant trip when such important matters are being debated in this Parliament. Today's balance of payments figure of $2.24 billion for the month of October was further bad news for home buyers and small businesses in this country. The average home has already been put beyond the reach of the average Australian in most major cities in this country, and the small business sector is struggling with interests rates of 21 to 25 per cent. Yet, as every month goes by, we get more and more bad news on the balance of payments front. That data goes through to the keeper in the sense that the Treasurer or . the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins), who is at the table, never respond apart from saying that this or that reason explains a particular figure, or apart from claiming that their strategy is working and then walking out. A dangerous degree of complacency has developed about balance of payments figures. There is a massaging of expectations by the Government in the lead-up to each figure. The figure is then broadly in line with expectations and there is a big sigh of relief. Today figures like $2 billion a month are accepted by the community and the Government as if they are not a problem. It was only a few months ago that $1 billion a month was considered to be a major problem. This complacency simply has to stop. The ground has shifted under our feet so dramatically in the last few years because of this paltry behaviour. Today's figure, while it was broadly in line with market expectations, is the second worse figure on record. The worse figure occurred just two months ago; so that is twice in the last three months that we have had all time record figures. The forecast current deficit for the year is $18t billion. Already, $8.7 billion of that figure has been incurred in the first four months of the year-almost 50 per cent of the figure in a third of the time. In the first 10 months of this calendar year, $18* billion of that projected total current a susaccount deficit has been accounted for. Obviously, the Government is in the process of rethinking and revising its forecast. As it happens, a confidential Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) paper, country notes on Australia, came my way. On page 48 it states: . . . the current-account deficit could increase to over A$21 billion (6t per cent of the GDP) for 1989 as a whole. To set that figure in context, 6t per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) would be the highest figure in 30 years. The previous highest figure was in 1986, under this. Government; the one before that was in 1985, under this Government; and the next highest was in 1960, at 5.4 per cent of GDP. As the OECD points out, Australia already has the highest current account deficit in the OECD. As if that is not bad enough, it is important to reflect on what that figure really means. The actual situation is much worse than even that highest figure implies. In order to reach $21 billion this calendar year, the next two current account deficit figures need to be $1.37 billion a month. That is most unlikely, given that the average for the last 10 months is $1.8 billion. The Budget forecast is already shot. If one does the same exercise with this year's Budget forecast of $18t billion, the next eight months have to average $1.29 billion each in order to achieve that forecast. My first request of the Minister at the table is that he give us his revised forecast for this year, offering a realistic figure and telling us where the current account deficit will be going this year. If one looks at what has happened in this financial year-in just those four months-one sees that the current account deficit is running at an annual rate of $26 billion a year. I also ask the House to focus on the fact that the recent deterioration to that prospective 6 to 7 per cent of GOP current account deficit has occurred through very favourable circumstances in the international trading world. Very strong world growth has been sustained-the longest period of sustained real growth in the postwar period for the world economy. Commodity prices have been extremely favourable, and yet the current account deficit has blown out to that magnitude in the space of just a few years under this Government. It is not all due to investment, as I am sure the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who is at the table, will argue. It has very little to do with investment. Of course those imports have been associated with increased investment but, of the deterioration in the current account deficit of $5.5 billion in 1988-89, only $2 billion was for capital goods imports as a whole; and we know that that category includes a lot of goods that are not really capital goods and that are not really going to do anything about increasing the productive capacity of this country. I will make two other points about today's number. One of the most disturbing features of today's number is that in an environment where we desperately have to increase exports, where exports have to grow by 3 to 4 per cent more than imports in every year between now and the middle 1990s in order for our debt to GOP ratio to stabilise by the mid to late 1990s, exports have been flat for the last four months while import demand growth has still been strong. It is worth remembering that import growth outstripped export last year by 24 per cent. The year before, import growth outstripped export growth by 3 per cent. So we are in a desperate situation as far as our balance of payments and debt situations are concerned. The second feature of today's number that is worth focusing on is the net income deficit of $175m, a total so far this year of $4.5m in just four months, running at an annual rate of $13.5 billion. We are in a self-perpetuating debt trap. Our debt level has reached $130m to $140m. We have seen some significant evidence in recent days by a number of major commentators that those debt levels will blowout to enormous proportions in the 1990s. Every year our current account deficit is bigger because of the financing charges on the current account deficit of the year before. When we look at the Government's response to this situation we basically see stonewalling. It has run out of ideas, except for the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) of course, who is writing to his colleagues to get any ideas they might have-vote buying ideas and so on. The Government has abandoned any sense of philosophical base. It has no policies. There is no direction beyond short term, expedient deals. The Prime Minister in the House today made a statement in answer to a question that I want to pick up. He talked about the stance and mix of policy. He 'said that if we are going to have a weaker wages policy and a weaker fiscal policy, then it is inevitable that we are going to have a tighter monetary policy. That could not have been a better summary of precisely what this Government has been on about in the course of the last few years as our current account deficit situation has been blowing out. The Government has eased fiscal policy on several occasions. In each of the last two Budgets it offered unfunded tax cuts on 1 July. It has done deals with Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, the airlines and the banks. Then there was yesterday's tax decision-frittering away .the surplus, all unfunded and all an easing of fiscal policy. The State governments have not restrained expenditure either. When asset sales are treated as a call on private savings, the public sector this year will move from a net surplus to a small net deficit in 1989-90, according to Access Economics, a significant easing of fiscal policy across the board and also an easing of wages policy across .the board. In the middle of last year the Government was looking for a zero wage increase in return for a tax cut as a trade-off. The deal that was finally done when Crean and Kelty could not deliver was a 6.5 per cent earnings increase and a tax cut. In the last year, the year to August, average earnings were already running at 8.2 per cent plus the tax cuts. So wages policy has been dramatically eased as' well over that period. There has been absolutely no micro-reform during the last three years, which was to be the agenda of the third Hawke Government; so all the weight is on monetary policy. Clearly, all the weight has been put monetary policy by this Government. As say, I have no greater authority than the Prime Minister when he said in this House today that if we are going to have a weaker wages policy and a weaker fiscal policy then it is inevitable that we are going to have tighter monetary policy: That is what we have had for the last 20 months and that is precisely what is happening at present. If one looks at official cash rates over the last six or seven weeks, one sees that the Government is at it again. It is surreptitiously tightening monetary policy. the week to the end of 4 October, cash rates were 17.2 per cent. Today they are 18.1 per cent. The Government has significantly tightened monetary policy over that period and simultaneously Ministers have denied that it is happening. What is the bottom line of all this for average Australian? We know that the avthe erage Australian is struggling-legitimately struggling-under the weight of these high interest rates. This Government has putting up interest rates consistently for 20 months with no positive effect on the balance of payments or inflation objectives. Housing interest rates and borrowing costs are now both at record levels. Our interest rates are more than double those of our trading partners. Theirs have been falling while ours have been rising over the last months. Short term interest rates are 10 per cent in real terms. Even the Treasurer adpetition mits that they will not start to fall until probably around the June quarter at the earliest and even then there probably will not be much impact on housing interest rates. Yet another number comes by like today and it is allowed to go through to the keeper. The message for the average Australian home buyer or small businessman is that interest rates will stay higher much longer than this Government has been prepared to admit. Using the Government's barometer of the stance of monetary policy and official has expired. cash rates, the Government has been raising them for the last four to six weeks. Home buyers at present are paying 17 to 18 per cent interest rates. One now needs $64,100 to meet the median house price in Sydney; $62,000 in Melbourne; $44,900 in Brisbane, and $41,000 in Adelaide. Given on that the average wage is about $27,000 to I $28,000, that is well in excess of average income. In Sydney it is well in excess of double average income. Most two-income families do not go anywhere near an income of $64,100. So right across Australia the ava erage home has been put out of the reach of precisely the average Australian. The corporate sector at present is struggling under interest rates of 21 to 25 per cent. There are not many small to medium sized businesses in this country that earn that In sort of return that will justify that sort of borrowing cost for an extended period. If we look even at the large corporate sector, only one-third of the top 500 companies in this country earn more than the long term bond rate on shareholders' funds. The corporate sector is presently subject to a liquidity squeeze. There is a prospect of falling dethe mand next year, a risk of a hard landing on basis of the wage numbers as warned by Dr Higgins, the Secretary to the Treasury. Corporate failures and individual bankruptbeen cies are approaching record levels. Yet this Government has no answer to high interest rates. The simple reason is that the Australian Council of Trade Unions will not let the Government take the policy changes in any of the other areas that would bring about a reduction in interest rates. It 18 will not let the Government privatise, cut government expenditure, inject foreign cominto coastal shipping, clean up the waterfront, reform tax, or inject competition into a host of transport and communication industries. There has been no settlement of the pilots dispute. The Government just lets the situation drift on. The bottom line is that average Australian families and small to medium-sized businesses are being sent to the wall by a totally insensitive Government that is out of control in economic policy terms.",83
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INTEREST RATES,Mr Mountford)-Order! The honourable member's time,85
204,Mr DAWKINS ,INTEREST RATES,"Fremantle-Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Acting Treasurer) (3.38)-1I have sometimes wondered why it is that economics is known as the dismal science. I think now I know. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), of course, claims to be first and foremost an economist and only in a secondary capacity a politician. I think the science of economics was probably named after him. What the honourable member for Wentworth has to decide soon-and pretty soon-is whether he is an economist or a politician. He has been trying to have it both ways. His speech today revealed yet again that he is empty of suggestions, empty of ideas, full of criticisms and prepared to say anything which is likely to detract from the international reputation of this country. He started off with a cheap jibe about the absence of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) from this chamber. If any question has become clear over the last couple of years it is that Australia's economic challenge is an international challenge. How can we ensure that our economy becomes truly and fully a member of the international world economy? That means that we have to be in touch with, respond to and communicate with all the important areas of the world economy. It might be that the honourable member for Wentworth thinks that in his new world the world economy revolves around the electorate of Wentworth or some other area, such as the Macquarie Bank, or something of that nature. The world economy is governed not from Australia but, surprisingly, from other parts of the world. It is just as much the obligation of the Treasurer to be communicating with the rest of the world rather than his being expected to stand up and respond to the same tired, old, ridiculous points made by members of the Opposition that are devoid of any ideas and devoid of any solution. They are not even prepared to say what they would do under current circumstances. The Treasurer is on an official visit to Japan, and he will then visit Britain. Today he is addressing a function at the invitation of the British-Australian Chamber· of Commerce. He has addressed two seminars organised by two major Australian financial institutions-West pac and Ord Minnett. Whilst he is in Britain he will visit the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Majors. In Japan he was invited to visit two of the world's largest financial institutions, the Nomura and Daiwa, and took the opportunity to meet the finance Minister in Japan as well. That is just as much a responsibility of the Treasurer of this country as is, in a sense, wasting time responding to the trivial, childish and hysterical points made by the honourable member for Wentworth. The honourable member will go to any lengths to denigrate this country and he is trying to do it once again. He is trying to talk down this economy into recession rather than indicating that this country has a challenge in front of it which the Government has not only acknowledged but taken up. He should offer some helpful suggestions as to how we might do better. The main thing the honourable member could do would be to have the guts to stand up here and actually tell us what he thinks about interest rates. He has never yet come clean on whether he thinks interest rates are right, should be higher or should be lower. He has never said that. Is the honourable member saying that they should be lower now?",85
205,Dr HEWSON ,INTEREST RATES,Change your policy.,86
206,Mr DAWKINS,INTEREST RATES,Is he saying they should be lower now?,86
207,Dr HEWSON ,INTEREST RATES,Change your policy.,86
208,Mr DAWKINS,INTEREST RATES,Should they be lower now?,86
209,Dr HEWSON ,INTEREST RATES,Change your policy.,86
210,Mr DAWKINS,INTEREST RATES,"See, his gutlessness proceeds. He will not say whether interest rates are right, should be lower or should be higher. The spokesman for the Opposition is not prepared to say whether interest rates should be higher, lower or the same. All he says is, 'Change your policy'. How do we change our policy? As the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) mentioned today, there are three policy areas. Let us look at the area of fiscal policy. The Opposition says that fiscal policy is about right although it would weaken it through its policy. There is very little in the way of a dispute between us and members of the Opposition on the question of fiscal policy. They will not tell us what monetary policy ought to be. They have a mystery box, a black box of wages policy, and they say that we are weakening wages policy. Let us look for a minute at what their wages policy would be. There is nothing under the policies proposed by members of the Opposition than that the lid would be blown off wages. Their only option would be to crank up interest rates further in order deal with that particular problem. No-one with any sense, including the honourable member for Wentworth, believes that we can currently deregulate the wages market withlaboriously out there being a blow-out in wages. The honourable member had the nerve to refer 'to the pilots dispute today. He said that was a problem confronting the Government. That is a problem which confronts the position, because if ever there was an examwith ple of what would happen under the policies which those opposite are proposing, it is exactly what the pilots were proposing: that is, to have a 30 per cent wage increase entirely unrelated to productivity increases. What I and the Government are saying is that wage rises, wages policy, should be ducted in the context of productivity creases. The Government, and not the Opposition, has an overall wages policy. The Industrial Relations Commission is there ensure compliance with a wage objective, whereas the Opposition wants to abolish the IRC, which will mean that every wage setties tlement will be on the basis of an individual the change-enterprise unrelated to any preferred aggregate outcome. I ask: Who will determine that wage increases will be related to productivity? Where is the Opposition's productivity policeman? It has not got one, it knows that it has not, and it could only resort, therefore, to further increases in interest rates. I always listen to the honourable member for Wentworth, hoping against hope that might come up with some helpful suggestions as to how Australians might work together to deal with this particular problem. He a few items at the end of his speech-one was privatisation. What would privatisation do to help our current difficulties? Simply by transferring a commercial activity from the public sector to the private sector. absolutely no difference to the whole of Australian economy, dealing with our debt problem or our current account. the first instance it may well have a deleterious effect as borrowings were increased order to make the acquisition of what is surer currently a private sector. activity. The honourable member talks about the waterfront. He knows full well that we inherited a legacy of decades of Liberal Party to indolence which allowed some of the most outrageous and uncompetitive conditions to be secured within the waterfront industry. We have been painstakingly, carefully and trying to lever out those conditions to try to bring in a bit of competition to the waterfront, but he says that that is this not enough. I refer him to John Spalvins, a man who wants a bit of reform around the Opplace. He is a man who is not unconnected the waterfront. When asked the question: 'Why was not more being done on the waterfront?', he said, 'For how long do you want a national stoppage on the docks?'. For how long does the honourable member for Wentworth want a national stoppage on the docks? What does he think that would do to conthe whole question of the balance of payinments and the current account generally? There are a number of ways to get change in this country. One is a stupid way; that is to by just trying to propose it and insist upon it from Canberra. The other is to be sensible and try to secure the agreement of the parto the desired change. If we do not get",86
211,Dr HEWSON ,INTEREST RATES,Read the lAC annual report.,87
212,Mr DA WKINS,INTEREST RATES,"The honourable member should not talk about the theoretical objectives. I want to know from him, as an apprentice politician trying to be a Minister, how from the dizzy obscurity of Canberra he will affect the changes which are necessary in the ports of Fremantle, Melbourne he and Sydney? Who will bother listening to him? How will he insist on the employers of waterside labour or the Waterside Workers listed Federation making the changes that he wants? How will he do it without getting them to sit down, negotiate and agree? That is precisely what we have done. We have got the agreement in the only way which will makes make it work-by having their commitment the to the reform, not by throwing around these simplistic suggestions as the honourable Indeed, in member might be doing. The honourable member had the nerve to in talk about our reluctance to engage in tax reform. We know that tax reform Hewson style would remove one of the most decent provisions in the tax law at the moment, that which insists on the taxes being paid on real-not illusory-capital gains. That is the provision that he would get rid of. I do not know whether he agrees with the abolition of it, or whether he has been leaned on by someone else to do it. Of course, he will not say whether he agrees with it. He knows, if anyone knows, because he is one of those who lived through and, indeed, was an architect of the tax avoidance scandal of the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was an architect because he and his political masters would not take the necessary action to close down the tax avoidance loopholes in the only way which was really going to work, and that was by introducing a sensible, decent and workable capital gains tax. So tax reform Hewson style is to give to the rich and pinch from the poor and, in the process, distort investment decisions in a way which would have only one result, namely, to increase interest rates in Australia. I have listened to the shadow Treasurer's suggestions and I find them all faulty. None of them recommends itself to anyone with any common sense in the country. The Opposition has no wages policy. It has no process for delivering structural change. One cannot in a kind of dictatorial fashion determine that ,the economy will change. There is only one way that the economy will change and that is if there is a spirit, a commitment and a determination on the part of every Australian to engage in that change. The honourable member will not get any Australian agreeing with this proposal when he is going to set Australian against Australian and punish the poor and reward the rich, when his taxation and welfare policies are determined quite deliberately to ensure that we return to the days when there was private affluence and public squalor. That is not the way to build a united nation, a nation which is prepared to address the uncomfortable process of change. That is not the way in which to do it.",87

214,Mr DAWKINS,INTEREST RATES,"What we want to hear from the honourable member is a process of change, not some idiotic theoretical ideas which he drags in here from the Macquarie Bank. We want to hear about things that are going to work. As the Prime Minister has said, the Government has a record par excellence in terms of the achievements we have made in relation to micro-economic reform. The biggest file that we inherited from the Fraser Government was the too hard basket. All the things that that Government did not have the guts to deal with were dumped right in our lap. We have systematically and effectively worked our way through many of those issues. We have not finished, and we will go on for many more years turning this country's economy into the kind of competitive economy that the Liberals could only dream about, could do nothing effective to bring about. We will do it and are doing it. I shall make just a couple of references to the balance of payments figures, to which I noticed the honourable member for Wentworth made a fleeting reference. Of course we would like to see the balance of payments in a better position, but, on the basis of the figure that has come out today, there is no reason to detract from our present policy position and there is certainly no reason to panic, as the Opposition would like us to do. Essentially, the Opposition is saying, 'Now is the time to panic'. What we are saying is that that is precisely the wrong thing to do. The kind of policy approach that we have is working. It is not comfortable, but it is working and there is nothing in the figures which were released today to suggest that we should change our policies in relation to the current account.",88
215,Mr LLOYD ,INTEREST RATES,"Murray) (3.53)-Pity help this country after that speech. The Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins), is good on acting but an absolute failure as a Treasurer. He referred to the Government's record as being one of par excellence. From the Government's point of view, the only thing that is in the par excellence category in this debate, about the dramatic reduction in our competitiveness as a nation, the devastating balance of payments figure and increasing interest rates, is the fact that we now have the second highest trade deficit in this country's history. What was the response of the Acting Treasurer to the crisis that this country now faces? It was 15 minutes of personal abuse. His only response .to this deteriorating economic situation was to shoot the messenger in the dirtiest way possible. The Acting Treasurer referred in his speech to an international challenge-there must be an international challenge from the point of view of the Government and its economic performance. Let us consider how the Government has performed in that international challenge. We have now the worse trade deficit situation of any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country because of the continuing and devastating deterioration. Our interest rates of 22 to 25 per cent can be compared against those of our major competitors: 11 per cent in the United States of America, 5 per cent in Japan and 7 per cent in Germany. Even in New Zealand the figure is now considerably lower. The Acting Treasurer also referred, as being a part of this challenge, to productivity. What is the productivity of this nation? It is zero. It has been negative for the past number of years of. this Government's term in office. He referred to making hard decisions and apologised, in between the abuse, for the next five minutes as to why the Government has not made any hard decisions. There is a very clear message in the balance of payments figures released today-a very clear message to the voters of South Australia and Queensland: that interest rates are increasing and not decreasing; that there are harder times ahead. The interest rate for housing is 17 per cent, even with a bank deal to keep it at that rate, which is costing the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Small business operators and farmers are paying 22 to 25 per cent and there is no relief in sight. For the first four months of this financial year there was an almost 50 per cent increase in our trade deficit. If that is maintained-and there is no reason to believe that it will at least be maintained, it does not increase even further-that will be the case for the second year in a row. What a record of international challenge and economic management this Government will leave this country when it gets booted out at the next Federal election. Gone are the days of not so long ago when a monthly trade deficit of $1 billion was greeted with horror. Now, $2 billion is seen as normal. As my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) said, for the Budget projection of $18t billion to be matched this year every monthly trade deficit for the remainder of this financial year, the remaining eight months, will have to be slightly under $1.3 billion. It will be a miracle if we have one month with a trade deficit figure as low as $1.3 billion, let alone that being matched for eight months. The Government cannot say that it has not been warned. We have had a downgradingon two occasions by the two international credit rating agencies. We have had banks, companies and leading Australians all referring to this matter, all warning the Government to change its policy, in some cases for several years. The Business Council of Australia has said this. That amazing collection of every industry group has come together to say it. There is plenty of warning that the situation is going· to get worse. The Macquarie Bank says that Australia will have a foreign debt of $500 billion by the turn of the century. The National Farmers Federation has voiced warnings at every conference it has held for the past few years. Even the friend of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), Goldman Sachs in the United States, has given a warning. What a legacy this Government is, leaving for the next generation of this nation, a nation burdened with debt and reduced living standards. What a terrible penalty the Government is leaving to every child in this nation. The latest figures are a terrible indictment of the Government, with the figure released today of $2.2 billion for the month of October and a projection of $25 billion to $26 billion for this financial year. Those figures are not just based on generalisations. Looking in detail at those figures, so far exports are actually up for the first four months of this year. They are up by $2.3 billion, particif ularly for minerals. Even rural exports are up. It is mineral exports and rural exports together that count when it comes to this country's exports, and, as I say, they are up marginally. Meat and cereals are up but wool is down by about $300m so far. This is the crunch: wool will be down $2 billion by the end of the financial year. Because of the time lag with the buying-in situation with the Australian Wool Corporation going through into export figures, the rate of decline in wool exports will double at least every month for the rest of this financial year. That means a continuing fall in exports because they will be down $2 billion, and that has not yet shown up. Meat and livestock exports will be down $500m, and that has not yet shown up. Wheat, because of seasonal conditions, will be down by $500m to $700m, and that will not start to show up for a couple of months. Mr Jull-Tourism is shot to bits.",88
216,Mr LLOYD,INTEREST RATES,Tourism is shot to bits; it is down by about $2 billion or $3 billion this financial year. Mr Cleeland-Make it $5 billion; you are just plucking a figure out of the air. You are guessing as much as anyone else.,90
217,Mr LLOYD,INTEREST RATES,"This is interesting, because our figures bear far more relevance to the real life of this country and of this world than anything we have heard or are likely to hear from the other side. Let us talk about the figures that are likely to come up for the rest of the year. In other words, there is bad news for the export sector. Imports, the other half of the ledger, are up 10 per cent. In the month of October, I believe, we bought only one aeroplane. That is an indication of any easy month in that sense. . Mr Donald Cameron-We don't have any use for aeroplanes.",90
218,Mr LLOYD,INTEREST RATES,"That is a good point: there is not much for them to do in this country at the present time. If one wants to look at investment imports-capital imports-and what is consumption, we see that food imports continue to increase; and I think that food is a consumption item. Let us look in detail at the transport area, which is comprised of cars and recreational four-wheel drive vehicles more than any other item. If we talk about capital for the manufacturing industry, we see that manufacturing industry has already thrown in the towel because it says that it cannot do anything to lift export performance for some time to come. That means that this Government's strategy has been disastrous and with it interest rates will increase-they will not fall. So we have this vicious downward spiral of a trade deficit followed by an interest rate rise to cover the necessary gap against that trading deficit. Because interest rates are higher, that reduces critical investment, particularly in our . mining and agricultural industries, and, as a result, the trade deficit increases. To indicate to honourable members that the better commodity prices are no longer available in the rural sector, I point out that we are now moving into a cost price squeeze period whereby in the past month the price for farm imports has increased at twice the rate of the increase for farm prices. That means that with the interest rate structureand it is not just in farming but small business, too-there is no way that one can obtain a return of between 22 and 25 per cent. This country needs dramatically new policies to change that vicious spiral. So, in the interests of this nation there is only one thing to do about interest-and that is change the Government.",90

The contribution of the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) would have been one of the most dismal speeches ever made in this place.

222,Mr CLEELAND,INTEREST RATES,"Do not worry about Seymour. The great launch of the Opposition's defence policy in Seymour took place before a capacity crowd of six people. How many people turned up to the great launch of the Opposition's veterans' affairs policy? Twelve people turned up to the Opposition's great launch of its environment policy in Mansfield. I am so devastated by the strong attack by my Liberal opponents that I just do not know 'where to go! We have seen crowds of six people and crowds of 12 people. I invite all honourable members opposite to campaign in my area because they would do me the world of good. What a miserable speech we heard from 'Dr Gloom', and what can one call the honourable member for Murray? A supply side economist, I guess. That is the best name for him. He should resign from the Nationals and join the Liberal Party because it is running with supply side economists. If Mrs Thatcher, the Prime Minister of Britain, visited this country, honourable members opposite would literally bow and scrape before her and say, 'You are a wonderful lady, you have the answers. What you have done in Britain is what we will do in this country. We will follow your policies down the line. We will not have a wages policy-just like Mrs Thatcher. No, we will not have a wages policy. We will sell off all government assets-just like Mrs Thatcher'. It is worthwhile referring to an article in today's Australian Financial Review which states: The British Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, reiterated on Tuesday her Government's overriding concern with domestic inflation saying that it was 'far too high' and that high interest rates were necessary to help curb demand . . . The lady who has in place the policies embraced by the Opposition is now running a high interest rate regime and, in fact, she is increasing interest rates in Britain because of increasing inflation. Those opposite cannot have it both ways on their side of politics. Either they support the Thatcher policy, which is implicit in what they call their Economic Action Plan, or they do not. They cannot run away from it because they are running with the supply side-they are running with the Thatcher view. However, what is happening in England? In England interest rates are rising and Mrs Thatcher says that the only way to control increasing domestic inflation is to impose high interest rates. That is what she says and that is what she does. This Government says that, when there is excessive consumption, it must be controlled by monetary policy, by wages policy or by fiscal policy. We are running a surplus of $9 billion and fiscal policy is tightly under control. We have an effective wages policy, which leaves monetary policy. The reality is that the Opposition does not have either of the other two policies-it has only an interest policy. It has no wages policy. So, if the country was ever unfortunate enough to have those opposite sitting on this side of the House, their interest regime would be like Mrs Thatcher's, because she has the same policy; and it is a dismal failure. Honourable members opposite may not have heard this, but Mrs Thatcher has a current account deficit and high interest. The only thing she has left to sell is the water supply system. The only remaining thing which is still owned by the British people is their water-she sold off everything else. What will be left after she sells off the water supply system, if she finds a buyer. What will be left? Mrs Thatcher cannot pad up her revenue any more because there is no capital left to do that. That is the policy of honourable members opposite-that is what is in their Economic Action Plan. Honourable members opposite will not look at Britain and at what Mrs Thatcher has done and admit that it has not quite worked. What else is happening in Britain? Because there is no wages policy, many economists see wage demands as a serious threat to the Thatcher Government's fight against inflation. Workers in several key industriesincluding the automotive and engineering industries-are attempting to get wage increases of 10 per cent or more as well as reduced hours. It is called enterprise-based bargaining. That is happening in Britain. That is the policy members opposite took from Mrs Thatcher. What is happening in Britain? They cannot control wages: wages are blowing up and inflation is blowing up, and high interest rates are automatically following. The whole story is in today's Australian Financial Review. However, honourable members opposite are silly enough to come into this House and attack this Government, which does have a wages policy. Honourable members opposite really never learn. What is the Opposition's wages policy? It is fascinating. What would happen if it was theoretically possible to implement the Opposition's wages policy? There have been 10 national wage cases since the Hawke Government came to office and honourable members opposite opposed them all and argued on productivity increases. Productivity increase is over. With the leave of the House, I will table a chart which shows the effect' of living standards based on the Opposition's wages policy. Leave not granted.",90
223,Mr CLEELAND,INTEREST RATES,"Without going through the details of the table, I will go to the simple bottom line. If it had been possible since 1983 to put the Opposition's wages policy into effect, the net result would have been that a family on a single income would be down $132 a week in its wages. Based on the Opposition's stated policies, a double come family with two dependent children would be down $212 a week. That would be the result of having put the Opposition's policies accurately into effect since 1983. Of course, that will not happen and such an outcome could not be achieved. What decent union or group of people representing average workers of this country would allow the Opposition to devastate Australian families in that way? They would not let that happen. They would go out and fight the Opposition and get real increases above what the Opposition would like to give them. That is the harsh reality of the wages system-the reality that Margaret Thatcher is now finding in Britain. So, the Opposition would not be able to achieve a $212 a week cut in the case of a two-income two-children family, or a $132 a week cut in the case of a single income, two-children family, because the people would not let that happen. However, this is obviously what the Opposition's wages policy would do. The Opposition wants to devastate Australian families by reducing their wages. I know that in my electorate-and all members on this side of the House, including the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), know thishigh interest rates are hurting. There is no doubt about that. There is no doubt that Australian families on average weekly earnings know full well that high interest rates have an impact on them and their living standard. No-one runs away from that fact. I do not like it, the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) does not like it, and the Prime Minister does not like it. But the reality is that the union movement and business understand the alternative. Despite the fact that people do not like high interest rates, they understand that, unless something is done to try to control consumption, inflation will result and inflation is much worse. That is the reality. I do not like high interest rates, and I know that the majority of people I represent are experiencing difficult circumstances because of those rates. I also know that the Opposition's policies would absolutely devastate those people, because the Opposition wants to bring their wages down in accordinance with its policies. As I have said: if implemented since 1983, those policies would bring down by $212 a week the wages of a double income two-dependent child family. That is an unarguable mathematical fact. That is what the Opposition wants to do-it wants to devastate Australian families. Honourable members opposite say that they care but, as was the case when they were last in government, their policies will destroy families. They will put people into unemployment and increase interest rates. The Opposition will not just use monetary policy to increase interest rates; it will manage the money supply. That is its typical trick. It will drag money out of the system and devastate small business, as it did before. There were more bankruptcies during the Opposition's last term of government than at any other time in the history of this country, and that is an absolute, unarguable fact. The Opposition's record as an economic manager is abysmal. Now it wants to get back in government and impose the same sort of regime again. Members of the Opposition should not come into this House and tell this Government that it is going wrong. The reality is that we are doing the right thing.",92

226,Mr WEST ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services) (4.15) - I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Commonwealth offices, Alice Springs. This is a proposal to erect an office building in Alice Springs which will provide approximately 2,800 square metres of usable office space with car parking underneath the building. The provision of a Commonwealth centre in Alice Springs is essential to the Government objective of providing efficient Federal Government services to the region.

(Notice given 2 of this matter should continue on a future day building will be utilised as the regional headSPRINGS quarters for an area in excess of one million square kilometres which includes Yulara to the south, and Tennant Creek and Elliott to the north. The building will primarily accommodate the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Employment, Education and. Training, including the Commonwealth Employment Service. Space is also being provided for a number of other Federal Government agencies. It will allow convenient access by the public and will clearly be identifiable as the focus of Federal Government services in Alice Springs. At present, the Commonwealth leases about 4,750 square metres of office space in Alice Springs, much of which is inadequate in terms of size, standard and location. The proposal to construct a new building is consistent with Government objectives of increasing the proportion of owned office accommodation, thereby reducing overall rental costs. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon) has taken an active interest in this project since its inception. He has pushed extremely hard for these offices to proceed because he realises how necessary they are to the future adequate provision of Federal services in the Northern Territory by the Hawke Labor Government. The proposal represents the most economic, efficient and effective method of satisfying our Federal client agency arrangements in Alice Springs. The proposed offices will be located in the Government Services precinct of the central business district of Alice Springs. The building has been designed to enhance and complement the streetscape and adjoining park, while maintaining a scale in keeping with the surrounding environment. Public access to the building will be through a shaded plaza which forms an extension to the adjoining park as a sheltered waiting area for people accompanying those seeking services in the building. The building is proposed to be constructed of either pre-cast concrete with a fine exposed aggregate finish or a pressed metal cladding system. External service cores will be lined with masonry. Services include air conditioning, automatic fire detection, a lift, facilities for the disabled, public toilet faciliin ties and standard light, communication and emergency systems. The building will be engineered to allow the construction of an additional floor of 1,400 square metres if future demand requires. On 31 August this year, the House agreed to refer this proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for examination and report. The Committee tabled its report on 21 November and has agreed that there is a need to replace existing substandard office accommodation in Alice Springs with a Commonwealth-owned office building. The Committee has recommended the construction of the Commonwealth office project in Alice Springs at an estimated cost of $5.88m at August 1989 prices. This sum includes an additional estimated cost of $200,000 for a concrete slab for a third floor which the Committee, in its wisdom-and it was correct-considered should be provided to enable future expansion of the building. Tenders are expected to be called in March next year and the contract awarded in April next year with a completion date for the work by about mid-1991. The project should prove beneficial to the residents of Alice Springs and to the local Alice Springs economy. An on-site work force is expected to peak at around 70 people, meaning that 70 construction workers will gain employment in Alice Springs from this project. I would like to thank the Public Works Committee, especially its chairperson, for its examination and expeditious report on this matter. I commend the motion to the House.",94

I just want to quote from the conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works entitled Commonwealth Offices Project, Alice Springs. That report states: There is a need to replace existing substandard office accommodation in Alice Springs with a Commonwealth owned office building which will also provide a focus for Commonwealth services in Alice Springs. The Opposition will not oppose this motion. As I have said before, yesterday the Minister made reference to what he perceived to be a contribution that had been made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory to the project at Darwin Airport. Today he has again referred to what he sees to be the contribution of the honourable member for the Northern Territory to this Alice Springs project. As I said in talking to the housing assistance legislation last night, it might be useful if the Minister could encourage the honourable member for the Northern Territory to give some attention to a couple of other things under the revised Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. As we move to per capita grants, funds for housing for the Northern Territory will drop from $44m a year to $3n;t a year. I invite the Minister to encourage the honourable member for the Northern Territory to do something about that. As we know that, as a result of the pilots strike-which is not a strike any more; it is over-the Northern Territory is being absolutely decimated-MONICA",95
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,Mr BlaDchard)-Order! The honourable member for Deakin must be aware that we are discussing Commonwealth offices in Alice Springs.,96
229,Mr BEALE,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Yes, I am. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am just inviting the Minister, if you would allow me briefly to do so, to give some attention, not only, as he has said he has done, to the office block in the Northern Territory but also to the disaster that is called tourism in the Northern Territory. I quote from yesterday's Centralian Advocate: Territory Tourism Minister Roger Vale has accused the Federal Government of selling· out struggling tourist operators with its $30 million recovery plan. He criticised Federal Tourism Minister Clyde Holding. Mr West- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. As you would realise, I do not often take points of order during these referrals and expediency motions in connection with the Public Works Committee, but really we are straying very far from the point of this expediency motion-that is, the construction of the Commonwealth offices in Alice Springs. Mr Deputy Speaker, in accordance with your earlier remarks, I really think the honourable member should be brought back to the point of the matter.",96
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SELECTION COMMITTEE,I accept the point of order. I trust that the honourable member for Deakin will observe my earlier comments.,96
231,Mr BEALK,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Yes I do, Mr Deputy j Speaker, and I thank you for allowing me to make the point. I think I have said enough about the failure of the honourable member for the. Northern Territory in these other areas. I want to draw attention to what the Minister has had to say about Government objectives in increasing the proportion of owned office accommodation. This project in Alice Springs could either be owned by the Commonwealth or rented. As the Minister reminded me yesterday, it(;·is Government policy to increase the proportion of owned office accommodation. In that context it might be useful to remind the Minister, the House and the nation of what the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said today. He said that, if there was a weaker fiscal policy and a weaker wages policy, there will necessarily be a tighter monetary policy. What the Government is doing here is making a conscious decision to have a weaker fiscal policy. It is spending money. The Government could lease this office block if it chose to do so, but it is spending money; therefore, it has a weaker fiscal policy. Accordingly, it is exacerbating the high interest rate problem that is decimating families and small businesses around Australia. If the Government were really concerned about the $2t billion balance of payment blow-out that we learned of today and about the continuing level of high interest rates and the hurt that this is doing to families and small businesses around Australia, it would not be owning this office block in Alice Springs; it would be leasing it. I just draw that to the attention of the Minister, too. As honourable members would know, this Minister would like to see the Government own everything. Mr West-No.",96
232,Mr BEALE,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Yes, he would. He is opposed to privatisation. He is the spokesman in the Cabinet against privatisation; we all know that. EmptyHere EmptyHere Ownership; that is what you are, Stewie. You have been having this argument with your colleagues in the public arena for a long time. You are completely out of step with what is going on.",96
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,Mr Blanchard)-Order! The honourable member will address the Chair. Mr West-We strive for a viable mix.,97
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SELECTION COMMITTEE,Order! The Minister will cease interjecting.,97
235,Mr BEALE,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister can have another go if he likes. I just say to the Minister: it is not a viable mix for the Government to keep on owning property and then claim that it has a tight fiscal policy. If this Government keeps spending money, it does not have a tight fiscal policy. As a result, the Government will necessarily make a contribution to higher interest rates. Those higher interest rates are decimating this country and causing great hurt to families and small businesses. In conclusion, I remind the Minister yet again that he should have a look at the mix. I repeat what I said before: the Opposition does not oppose this motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. BOUNTY (PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM) BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 November, on motion by Mr Robert Brown: That the Bill be now read a second time.",97
236,Mr HOWARD ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Bennelong) (4.29)-The Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989 gives effect to the Government's decision to pay a bail-out amount of $36m over three years to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. It represents the pinnacle of the failure and bankruptcy of this Government's industry policy. After more than six years of the Hawke Government and, undoubtedly under the stewardship of one of the more able members of the Hawke Ministry, Senator Button, the sum total of the accumulated skill and wisdom of this Government in handling industry policy is to throw up its arms and say, 'We think we might be losing the export income; therefore, we will bribe the company into staying in Australia'. Not only do the Liberal and National parties oppoSe this Bill; we will vote against it and we will repeal the arrangement on election to government because we believe that what the Government has done in relation to Kodak not only represents a total bankruptcy of industry policy but also is setting an extremely bad precedent. In the short time that has elapsed since the decision was taken I have, as the industry spokesman for the Opposition, been inundated with letters from companies all over Australia saying, 'Please, can I be like Kodak? Can I have the same treatment? Can I have a subsidy? I only want $10,000; that will tide me over. They're getting $36m'. If I have received those letters, one can only imagine how many letters have been received by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). That is the first criticism I make. It represents the bankruptcy of industry policy. It establishes an extraordinarily bad precedent. It encourages a growing belief in the community that this Government is now resorting to bandaid solutions, not only in industry policy but across the whole spectrum of economic policy and economic management. We saw the disgraceful cave-in over Coronation Hill. There was the deal with the banks. There was the buy-off of the waterside workers-$154m for a miserable concession about work practices. Added to that, of course, was the decision taken on the Kodak company. For those and other reasons, the Opposition opposes that decision and commits itself, on a change of government, to revoking the arrangements that have been made. I do not say that lightly. While I am the Opposition spokesman in the industry area, I do not intend to engage in unending vitriolic criticism of everything the Government does or in trivial point scoring in relation to an area of policy that I am the first to acknowledge is very complex and very difficult. One of the fascinating things about the debate that surrounds industry policy-indeed, it is a fascinating thing about many other aspects of economic policy in Australia at present-is that when one puts political rhetoric aside and one studies carefully what the experts are saying and what, if I may say so, some of the more informed spokesmen on the political scene are saying, there is a remarkable similarity and a remarkable coincidence of opinion as to what the desirable approaches and the desirable solutions are. In the past few weeks we have been literally besieged with reports and analyses of industry policy and of the overall direction of economic policy with particular reference to the difficulties of Australia's export industries. It is common ground that the greatest single economic problem which this country faces, whoever is its government, is the problem of our enormous overseas debt which is a product of a huge and unsustainable trade deficit, in turn fuelled by an excess of consumption over production. Having, as we have had for many years, a far too small savings base, we have had to draw heavily on the savings of foreigners in order to finance that current account deficit. We can only solve our debt problem, our trade problem, by improving our performance on two vital fronts. One of those fronts is the productivity front and the other is the savings front. I put it to the House that the Government's decision on Kodak had nothing whatsoever to do with addressing problems of productivity or problems of savings. Any solution to the problems of Australian industry that does not address those two problems is no solution at all. We have had the opportunity over the past 24 hours of digesting the report that was given to the Government yesterday by Dr Ross Garnaut, a former Australian Ambassador to China, a former economic adviser to the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and a person whose economic credentials are unarguable. I do not seek to belittle anything that Dr Garnaut has said in his report. It reflects very closely the views of Dr Helen Hughes, who reported to the Government a few months ago on Australia's export position. It reflects the analysis of the Federal Treasury, the analysis of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the analysis of a growing number of people who have looked at Australia's economic and trading position. A number of things come through very clearly in the Garnaut report and they form the four or five headlands, if you like, of sensible industry policy that this country ought to be following as we enter the 1990s. The first of those headlands is that we must set our face unalterably against any return to our protectionist past. I have also read the report commissioned by the Australian Manufacturing Council. Whilst no government or opposition can sensibly say that there are never circumstances in which it does something by way of intervention, the view that emerges from that report, which to me is that really the solution is protection under another name, is not a view that I am attracted to. I think Dr Garnaut's report has made a very valuable contribution to evening up the debate. I do not think it will profit Australian industry one bit if we spend the next couple of years having a rerun of the very old and sterile debate in Australia about free trade and protection. Protection of excessive levels for Australian manufacturing industry is bad for Australia because it imposes an unfair burden on the efficient exporters of this country. That is a fact that is often forgotten. It is a fact that is often overlooked by some of the critics of the apparent latter day consensus across the political spectrum in Australia in favour of lower protection. The first headland that we identify is that we should set our face unalterably against any return to our protectionist past. That does not mean that tomorrow we go to a 100 per cent removal of all protection. It does mean that the goal in the Garnaut report of a removal of protection by the year 2000, whilst being bold and adventurous, is nonetheless the kind of radical solution which may well be needed as part and parcel of a coordinated industry policy approach. It is legitimate to say, as indeed has been recognised in Dr Garnaut's report, that those who seek purity on the protectionist front from Australia ought also to look to their own performance. There is no doubt that some of the most protectionist policies that can be found are the agricultural policies of some of the countries of north-east Asia where Australian primary producers encounter some of the most bewildering and unreasonable protectionist barriers imaginable. The second headland that I think we can identify is the need to produce more savings in Australia. The real source of the economic power of the north-east Asian countries is that over the last 20 years they have been able to accumulate, through dint of their own hard work and savings, enormous current account surpluses. Japan has the largest current account surplus in the world. Taiwan, at $US85 billion, has the second largest current account surplus in the world. In the case of both countries, they represent an astounding economic performance, given the difficulties that they laboured under. This was particularly so in the case of Japan which, of all nations of the industrial world, had the most to lose from the onset of increased oil prices in the early 1970s. The third headland that has been identified is the absolute requirement not only that we embrace full-bloodedly a policy of microeconomic reform, but that it occur at a much accelerated pace. I am very pleased to say that in this area in particular the conventional wisdom that is emerging from the Garnaut report, the Hughes report, the Manufacturing Council report and all of the other analyses is foursquare with the policy that has been enunciated by the coalition over a number of years. I was particularly fascinated to read in the Garnaut report of the recommendation that we should allow foreign airlines to operate within Australia. I was fascinated to read that because almost two years ago to the day I made a speech to the Sydney Chamber of Commerce advocating precisely that as part and parcel of deregulation and aviation reform in this country. Of course, I received a cruel and stunning rebuke from the then Minister for aviation, transport, or whatever he was called, in the Hawke Government. I was told that I was engaging in fantasy. I was rebuked by the Australian newspaper, which accused me of economic treason, and all manner of other criticisms were heaped on me for daring to suggest that we should be so adventurous as to allow foreign airlines to· operate in Australia. It was said that this was a dreadful thing and that I had taken complete and utter leave of my senses to suggest such a terrible and earth-shattering development. The pace of micro-economic reform must be accelerated. We must do better than this Government has done in relation to coastal shipping. Mr Barry J ones-Even better than the Fraser Government?",97
237,Mr HOWARD,SELECTION COMMITTEE,Even better than any government has done in the past. The Minister makes a debating point. Mr Barry Jones-But it is valid.,99
238,Mr HOWARD,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Okay. He has made a point. But we have to recognise the need to accelerate the pace of reform in these areas. I mention this Government's efforts on the waterfront as an example. It is no good going back to the Fraser Government, the Peloponnesian War, the Boer War or anything else. Let us talk about the 1980s and 1990s. The Government has not done well enough on the waterfront. It has not done well enough in the area of coastal shipping. The only way to do something to coastal shipping is to let foreign vessels ply the Australian coast. We have to get rid of cabotage and let foreign vessels into Australian waters. The Government has to end this absolute obscenity, to use an expression beloved of the Prime Minister, of its costing more to carry cargo from Burnie to Newcastle than to carry cargo from Newcastle to Los Angeles. We do not have a hope of touching the tigers of north-east Asia until we do something about absurd things such as that. Of course we have to do something about deregulating our industrial relations system. The Opposition and I have been campaigning for this for years. At long last there is recognition from no less a person than the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) that we have to do something about enterprise based agreements-although only a few months ago enterprise based agreements were totally unacceptable to this Government. We must accelerate the process of privatisation. We must accelerate all of the areas of reform that come under the heading of the microeconomic agenda. The fourth headland that I can identify is the extent to which we ought to fix our gaze on particular industries-not by way of a key industry strategy or by a process of what used to be called picking winners-that is, those in which Australia enjoys a natural advantage. One of the more optimistic things to emerge from many of the reports that I have mentioned and the reports that have come down over recent months is that there are industries, particularly those related to Australia's great resource sector, in which this country enjoys a natural advantage. The sort of industry that this country ought to concentrate on is manufacturing industry that is closely linked to the resource sector. Of course, the tragically classic example of that in recent times is the aborted Wesley Vale pulp mill. If ever there was a tragic example of bungled government leadership at both State and Federal levels-I make bones about saying that-and a triumph of political point-scoring over the national terest, it was the Wesley Vale pulp mill. Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business ( Mr Barry Jones), who is at the ment. table, knows that his colleague Senator Button wanted a pulp mill, and still does. The Minister knows that his colleague rightly scribed the project as potentially the greatest manufacturing investment that this country had ever seen. He knows that if the Wesley Vale pulp mill project had gone ahead would have saved hundreds of millions of dollars a year off our current account deficit. Wesley Vale was the quintessential examinvestment ple of what this country needs to do to reduce, over the longer term, its trade deficit. At the moment we chop trees down, we woodchips to Japan and we buy back the paper. In the face of a current account defdustries icit of over $20 billion a year, that is national economic disgrace. The Wesley Vale project provided the opportunity to do somefinished thing about the current account deficit in practical way. But somehow or other we so disorganised and so lacking in commonup. sense with regard to the national interest, and we have such miserable political leaderand ship at present, that we allowed it to slip through our fingers. It is criminally culpable in political terms that that pulp mill was allowed to slip through our fingers. Senator Richardson may have smiled and Rod Cameron may have said that there was either a positive blip in the polls, but, if one thinks about the future generations in this country, that was a tragically indulgent decision. damage done by that decision has to repaired. I say to the Government that, the extent that it is prepared at this late stage to try to resurrect that project, it have the full support of the Opposition. less we support projects like Wesley Vale do not have a hope in terms of the recomindustry. mendations contained in reports such as the Garnaut report; we do not have a hope of trading our way out of our difficulties. We have to find a sensible balance between the environment and development. All members of the Australian Labour Party have to listen to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin). He speaks the truth and he speaks for the sane common sense of midno dle Australia when he talks about the need to achieve a balance between the environinment and development. The Labor Party The ought to listen to him very carefully-Mr Barry Jones-It is the same developMONICA",99
239,Mr HOWARD,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Of course it is the same dedevelopment. Wesley Vale should have come off. It is a terrible indictment of all politicians who were involved in that decision that Wesley Vale, the greatest potential manufacwe turing investment, did not go ahead. We have had report after report saying that the answer to our trade deficit is manufacturing and that we do not have a hope unless we lift our manufacturing industries. The one area where there is some light at send the end of the tunnel-where we have a natural advantage-is in manufacturing inbased on resources and on processa ing, which cut out the nonsense of sending raw materials overseas and buying back the product. The Wesley Vale project a would have provided a beautiful opportunity are to do that. What happened? We mucked it We are so hopelessly unable to put the national interest ahead of sectional interests political point-scoring that we mucked it up. If this country continues to do that it really will become a basket case and it will deserve all of the descriptions made of it. I do not think that the Australian public will have an inexhaustible supply of patience with side of politics if we fail to deliver on that particular front. I believe that one can glean from all of these reports a number of The headlands which form the basis-if headbe lands can form a basis-of a sound and to rational approach to manufacturing policy. The material that· has come to the public will and the Parliament via these reports in reUncent weeks has added enormously to an inwe formed debate on the future of Australian I welcome the emphasis of the Garnaut report on the desirability of improving Australia's cultural links with the countries of north-east Asia. I endorse the priority it gives to the export of educational services. I have said before, and I have no doubt the Minister at the table would agree with me, that there is no reason on earth why this country's universities and other tertiary tutions should not become an educational and cultural hub in this part of the world. There is no reason on earth why they should not make the same contribution to our region as many of the older universities in Europe made to the regions of Africa and other parts of the world in earlier years. We do education in this country very well indeed. Our universities are of a high quality and there is no reason why we should not exploit the natural advantage that we enjoy in that area. The other thing I would exhort the Government to do is to put aside any ideological or political hang-ups it might have about the different countries in the area of north-east Asia. Taiwan has an enormous capacity to invest in this country. One of the things that are holding it back is that any investment in this country by a government instrumentality of Taiwan has no legal immunity or protection because, legally, it is regarded as an investment of the People's Republic of China. Something has to be done about that very quickly because it is a major impediment to enormous investment ,flows in this country from the Taiwanese. As is appropriate in a second reading debate, I have roamed rather widely over the general industry area. I conclude by saying that, for the reasons I have already stated and indicated in public debate with Senator Button several weeks ago, the Opposition cannot support the Government's decision on Kodak. I do not think Senator Button, in his heart, is very enthusiastic about it, and he is honest enough to acknowledge it. It has been an on-balance decision, but on-balance decisions are decisions nonetheless, and it is a bad decision. It shows a bankruptcy of industry policy. It is a bad precedent and is not .consonant with a government which has now had six years to develop a rational industry policy. All it can do at the end of that period is indulge in the politics of the ad hoc bail-out. That is not a rational industry policy and it is not the kind of industry policy that will give to this ,country and future generations a prosperous, profitable and secure 1990s and beyond.",100
240,Mr ALLAN MORRIS ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Newcastle) (4.55)-ln addressing the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill it is appropriate to give instisome background to the situation which the Bill confronts. The colour film industry in Australia represents a market of $50m to $60m. In world terms that is obviously a very small market. Australia has only one local manufacturer, namely Eastman Kodak, based in Victoria. The domestic market value of its sales is approximately $40m, which is approximately 75 per cent of the Australian market. The same company exports about $170m a year, which incorporates colour film and prints. In terms of Eastman Kodak's worldwide turnover of $22 billion, that figure reflects the capacity and importance of this plant to Eastman Kodak. Obviously, Australia is a very small player in the world game in terms of our domestic market, and the Australian plant is a very small part of Kodak's international turnover. However, the plant is extremely efficient and competitive on that so-called level playing field. That has nothing to do with wages, costs of production or bad manufacturing technology. It is to do with the fact that the level playing field that we keep hearing about, in that other world, is not level and is heavily distorted. In this case the distortions are induced by other governments. One could take the example of Brazil. The tariff on films in Brazil is 125 per cent. But, more interestingly, Brazil has a fascinating scheme whereby the normal company tax rate runs at 14 per cent-I suppose on declared income. However, for export purposes, it is 6 per cent. In Brazil there is a tax concession to Kodak of 8 per cent provided, not by its investment, skill or technology, but simply by government support. The United States of America is equally ingenious. It is one of the original designers of trade barriers and trade distortions. The Am-ricans have kept pace with many of our Asian allies. The Americans have what they call overseas sales corporations registered in the Virgin Islands. Kodak in America does not export to a second country directly but exports via the Virgin Islands and, therefore, there is a significant tax advantage for the American profits. This is the sort of thing this country confronts as a small player in a large world with small offshoots of large organisations, yet there is the foolish talk about level playing fields and that this is not the way to succeed. It is also worth going back to see why these kinds of things occur and why the Australian economy, any government in Australia or any State government is so vulnerable to these kinds of approaches and this kind of blackmail. It is blackmail; there is no tion about that, and I am not afraid to accept that and I have used that term in past regarding other companies. If one considers what the Opposition has managed to achieve for Australian manufacturing for so long, one fairly easily and quickly finds the basis for these vulnerabilithe ties. They take two forms: the use of licences to control production and the use of market power and market control to dictate both production and supply. There is the wonderin ful example of L. M. Ericsson Pty Ltd. That was a terrific company, lauded by the Opwithout position as being a wonderful achievement when it was first formed. What the Opposia tion never told the Australian public was that Ericsson in Australia could not export Australian products. Ericsson in Sweden supdevelop plied Asia, not Ericsson in Australia. Other examples relate to internal transfers between companies and their subsidiaries. Australia has been a wonderful victim transfer pricing. There have been court cases on transfer pricing out of Australia and there is now the clever idea of transfer pricing Australia via American tax havens, where the company does not sell in Australia at its American price because it does not need pay the American tax which would normally be available. Transfer pricing was created the people who are now opposing lation. Opposition members created it. They created the licensing arrangements, the extion's port licences, the market potential and the barriers to allow it to happen and, therefore, the incentives. They created one of the most lopsided, wrong-headed industry policies one can imagine and ran it for 30 years. We have been told in recent weeks that this is a dreadful precedent because the matcern ter was not referred to the Industries ance Commission (lAC). I happen to come from Newcastle. In March and April 1982, when the government of the day-the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) was Treasurer-was confronted bench with reductions in the Broken Hill Propriemoney tary Co. Ltd (BHP) work force, what did it do? It referred the matter to the lAC. By March 1983 the Government was still saying that it was an lAC matter, not the Government's responsibility. An independent body was used as a shield and an excuse for policy quesmaking. if one looks through the lAC reports over the years one will find that on the average it takes 15 months to report. What industry is going to sit around for 15 months while the lAC does its little investigations? If the Opposition were in our current position, it would refer the Kodak matter to lAC. When Kodak closed it would say, 'It is not the Government's fault. It is not our responsibility. It is the lAC's responsibility'. The Opposition has made a major error its statements. It has said that this is a precedent, that one does not give assistance report by an independent authority. The fact is that we do and we have, and in most spectacular way. In February-March 1983 the Australian Labor Party, in its campaign and public presentation, said, 'We will a steel plan in 100 days'. It did not refer to the lAC. We did not ask the lAC to develop a steel plan. We said that it would be the responsibility of any responsiof ble government. We did not duckshove it sideways until it disappeared. And we did produce a steel plan, with substantial bouninto ties. There was no lAC report at all. What has it achieved? BHP Australia is now back to being a world competitive steel industry. to The cost involved was chickenfeed compared to the costs that would have been incurred by if we had followed the policy advocated to this legisday and in recent weeks. The other fascinating part of the Opposihypocrisy is to do with this idea of our bailing out a multinational company. I guess that I am as Australian as most people in this Parliament. I bitterly resent the impact on the. Australian economy of multinational companies, particularly where I do not believe that they have either a view or a conabout what I see as our national interest. AssistAs for the mealy-mouthed talk in recent weeks that we are bailing out a multinational company and that that is un-Australian, I suggest that we consider how many years Opposition members sat on the treasury of this Parliament spending taxpayers' on a 20 per cent Australian preference for manufacturing, substantial amounts of which were given to multinational companies. How many multinational companies benefited for so long in terms of profit from government purchasing or from Australia's high tariffs? Who were the people pressuring the previous Government to increase its tariffs or they would close down their Australian plants? I know who they were. They were multinational companies in the main; and the tariffs were increased. So when we came to government we had an industry and an economy in chaos and tatters. If one looks at this Government's record one sees what it has set about, and it set about it in two ways. One way was broad economic policy, broad industry policy in terms of the kinds of economic and industry conditions one needs prevailing. Tariff reduction and workplace change-all those things-were part of that process. The second way was positive reconstruction, for example, extending the ship building bounty to export ships. Think again about that. We were paying a bounty in 1983 of some 25 per cent but only if the ship was brought into Australia for an Australian buyer. If a ship was exported there was no assistance. What kind of nonsense, what kind of stupidity, does that exemplify? It exemplifies the kind of hypocrisy we are so used to seeing. Since 1983 there has been a series of definitive, positive industry reconstruction decisions. Positive assistance was given to the automotive industry, an industry that in theory should need no government assistance but an industry that would take twice, three or four times as long in transition. There was also assistance to the ship repair, ship building, textile, clothing and footwear and steel industries. All of those industries received positive government financial assistance to accelerate their reconstruction. Our policy has been quite clear. It has always had two major elements: the broad element and specific support for particular industries. In most cases, the industries involved more than one company, although the precedent with BHP again is pertinent because the steel plan bounty for steel production was predominantly to a single company. What has been the result of all this? Let us go back to 1975 and through to 1983 and look at the decline in the manufacturing work force. The rhetoric we are hearing opposite concerns higher tariffs-free market rhetoric and protectionist policies, the usual duplicity we have come to expect from the coalition. Since 1983 we have seen on average a one per cent increase per year in manufacturing employment. We have seen on average a 13 per cent increase in investment per year in real terms. The volume of exports rose in the quarter to June by 3.8 per cent, 6.8 per cent on the previous June. We have seen production up 3.2 per cent in that same June quarter, almost 9 per cent on the previous year. So in recent years we have seen the revival and resurgence of Australian manufacturing. There are now 60,000 more people working in Australian manufacturing than in 1983. These are real things. They are real world issues, not the other world we hear about so often, where the playing field is level, where other countries. are honourable, where they do not have barriers and distortions, assistance and downright deceit. The statistics show a positive resurgence. That resurgence will not be smooth. It will not be an even curve. It will be patchy. It will fluctuate from industry to industry, section by section of the economy. But so far it has been consistent and it has been increasing. What the Opposition is telling Australian manufacturers categorically is that it will undermine positive support by government. Let us look slightly further. We heard nonsense from the OppoSition today as it tried to justify its ideological position. We heard some good words, many of which I agree with, such as 'natural advantage'. Sure, pick your natural advantage. But narrow minded ness says that it is only in resources and primary industry. We have an industry which has a natural advantage. The Coburg plant is one of the world's most efficient Kodak plants. Is that not a natural advantage? Of course it is. It is also in one of the world's great growth areas. Is that not a natural advantage? Of course it is. What does the Opposition say we should do? It says that we should close it down. This legislation is not about market forces. It is not about level playing fields. It is about finding ways to ensure that Australian manufacturing industry can generate and attract investment and survive, despite the attitudes of its owners. Do we really expect the owners of Eastman Kodak and its shareholders to give a damn about Australia's national interest? Do we expect the owners of Mitsubishi or other multinational companies, wherever they come from, to put our national interests ahead of their personal est? Of course we do not. That is the real world. That is the world our businesses trade in. That is the world they know. In recent weeks we have heard about another world. Industry policy is about change. Government is about change and managing change. Let us not talk nonsense about micro-economic reform needing to be accelerated in some artificial way. We started the ball game. In 1983, under the steel plan, work practice changes were part of the deal. That was a major aspect of the success of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. BHP management will tell that to anybody who wants to ask. In recent days Mr John Prescott, the ex-manager of BHP transport and now in charge of steel, made a very pertinent statement about transport. He said that, if BHP had been able to eliminate labour costs in a shipping operation in 1980, it would still not have been competitive. It was not about about labour costs; it was about many other things, including investment, market access and management. What we are seeing in Opposition policy is a re-run. The man who gave us the resources boom to further distort our economic balances, to pump up investment in industries that were going to destroy our manufacturing base, is now saying, 'Sorry, I got all that wrong, but the new world that I will be orchestrating for tomorrow will be different'. If those opposite want to know how this can be done, they should get out and talk to industry, talk to the people W.!lO run factories, and tell them their story. As with industrial relations, they will get a big thumbs down. In recent weeks the Metal Trades Industry Association made it fundamentally clear that the coalition's new world of industrial relations would be a disaster. Any small, medium or large manufacturing concern looking at exports, confronted with today's speech from the shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), will say, 'Hell, he is living in a different world from the world that I am living in. He is not facing what I am facing'. I had a phone call today from a representative of a company. He said, 'We were asked to put forward a price by a multinational company for the production of some inter- equipment. The company has just rung us and told us not to waste our time. Without getting the prices, the company decided to buy from Germany'. Why would it not? What should it care? Its obligation is to its shareholders; our obligation is to our country. Unless that is fundamentally clear, industry policy will make no sense. I applaud this legislation. I deplore the way it is being used to undermine Australian manufacturing confidence in a Government that cares for, supports and develops industries in Australia. I deplore the cheap and nasty jibes made by those opposite, which they know are cheap and nasty, for purely political purposes. Like John Button, I resent the blackmail; but, like him, I have to live with it. I do not enjoy it; but it is a reality of international trade. Like it or not, when the Opposition gets the other countries in the world to accepts its new world, it may make some sense. Until it does, it should stop the posturing and hypocrisy and get on with the job.",101
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,Mr Dlanchard)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,104
242,Mr MACKELLAR ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Warringah) (5.15)The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Allan Morris), who has just resumed his seat, shows how difficult it is to deal with this Government. We have an arrangement that successive speakers speak for 10 minutes. He just spoken for 20 minutes, doubling his time. It just demonstrates the inability of these people to keep their word. In December 1984 the Government restructured its major industry responsibilities into the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, and undertook to revitalise the Department in line with Government policy to re-energise Australia's ailing manufacturing industry. In a 1986 interview, the Secretary to that Department, Dr David Charles, was quoted as saying: Manufacturing industry has declined both as a proportion of total GDP and total employment. He further stated: government now wants industry to become internationally competitive, innovative and export oriented, with less reliance on barrier protection and greater reliance on general industrial environment setting measures. We aim to strengthen the economy's underlying competitiveness five years from now. To do this, he further stated: There are several strands of the Government's approach to industry development. One is to greatly reduce tariff barriers and intervention against imports. Three years into that five-year commitment it is obvious that Australia's manufacturing industry has lost the fight against imports and is seriously failing to meet the expectations for it as a major contributor to Australia's export earnings. Why? Because, as Senator Button publicly admitted on 9 July this year, the Government has its industry policies wrong, and there needs to be a major reappraisal of those policies. Such a frank admission from a senior Minister is refreshing, but what is disturbing is his associated admission that after six years in the job he did not know where to go from here. Senator Button said that, considering the number of incentives given to business already to encourage export· growth, with companies still not matching those around the world, he did not know what to do next. 1 quote him: 'I just do not know'. While the Government is in this wilderness area between abandoning its previously unsuccessful policies and trying to determine new ones, it has little trouble in deciding that money might reduce some of its embarrassment. A total of $1.5m is being spent on consultants to look at Australia's deteriorating international competitiveness and to develop new industrial policies. Under the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill before us today, $36m of Australian taxpayers' money is to be spent on supporting a company in circumstances which fiy in the face of sound economic management. We have just heard the honourable member for Newcastle say that it was blackmail. He admitted that it was blackmail, and he could not do anything about it. What is more, he apologised for it. What a complete admission of failure on behalf of the Government. What we are seeing is a manufacturing policy void which lends itself to knee-jerk political responses to individual corporate pressures. This Bill is just such a response and one that will place $36m of Australian taxpayers' funds, plus some $6m of State funding, into the hands of one of the world's corporate giants. Again, that has just been outlined by the honourable member for Newcastle. For this reason alone the Bill demands the most careful scrutiny by Parliament. But what is also needed is a careful examination of the reasons why this Government considers it so necessary for scarce taxpayers' funds to be so willingly spent in this manner. One has to ask: What is Australia likely to gain from it? 1 turn to the second reading speech of the Minister for Land ,Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown). It reads: On 24 August 1989, Eastman Kodak of the United States, the parent company of Kodak (Australasia), announced that it would be restructuring its worldwide operations following disappointing financial results. One operating unit selected for closure by Eastman Kodak was Kodak Australasia's manufacturing operations at Coburg, Victoria. The Minister continued: . The Australian operation is recognised, even by Eastman Kodak, as an efficient and world competitive operation. However, for strategic reasons, Eastman Kodak is unwilling to close down its less efficient operations in other parts of the world. That simply does not ring true to me. If we can believe what has been said, Kodak Eastman is involved in a straightforward commercial decision to rationalise its worldwide operations. Yet it has somehow convinced this Government that it wants to close down . its efficient Australian operation in preference to inefficient operations in Europe, the United States of America, or elsewhere in the world, and that the Australian taxpayer should spend $36m to support Kodak's restructuring processes. Obviously, Kodak thinks that the Hawke Government is a soft touch. Frankly, its actions prove it. As my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) said, since this decision was announced he has been inundated by people saying, 'What about me? 1 could use a little bit of scarce taxpayers' funds too to help me over a bit of a problem that 1I have in my particular business'. What seems more likely is that Kodak (Australasia) is not efficient by world standards and the Government's assistance will allow restructuring to achieve those standards. How else can the Minister' equate his statement about Kodak (Australasia) being efficient with his later admission that one of the reasons for giving government assistance is a commitment by Kodak (Australasia) to 'implement significant productivity improvements through award restructuring, inventory, overheads, and production line improvements?' One has to ask: Where does the truth lie? Is it an efficient operation, as the Minister firstly says, or does it need to improve its productivity, as he later says? I now turn to a matter of particular concern to me. The Minister stated: The signals from Eastman Kodak also suggested that a window of opportunityhow often do we hear that phrase these days?-existed not only to overturn the closure decision to press for a commitment to enhance Kodak's tralian operations in the Asian region in return temporary assistance from this Government. A recent Sydney Morning Herald article reported, correctly, that I had been apdak proached by a Canberra based export firm with a complaint that it had received an order from Shanghai for $1.2m worth of colour film and that Kodak (Australasia) His letter stated: had refused to handle the business because its Hong Kong agent handled all Kodak's greater business in China. What happened then? This generallycompany in Australia thought that a bit strange. It had just heard that Kodak (Australasia) had been given $36m of Ausindividual tralian taxpayers' funds, and thought that it firms would be pretty reasonable if some of those of funds found their way into an Australian company's funds by doing some business with or Kodak. However, 'Not a bit of it', said dak, 'we don't want to know about you'. That was not the only case. Someone got in touch with Senator Butticular ton's office and said, 'This is a bit strange; $36m of Australian taxpayers' funds have been given to Kodak, and it will not even talk to me about supplying the order'. ever, not one thing came from that approach to Senator Button's office. The person insaid volved again contacted the office a couple days later, having written to the office, was told that he would probably get a response in due course from the Department. After a week he contacted the office again and the response was the same--'No, you cannot see Senator Button. He is a very busy man, and, besides which, this is something that really should be handled by the Department'. At the very time when we are concluding this arrangement with Kodak, we have Kodak (Australasia) refusing a $1.2m export order because it cuts across its agency arrangements. I hope that the rest of Kodak's commitments have greater worth. The restructuring of its Coburg operations, productivity improvements and an export target of $1 billion over the next five years are all admirable targets; but, if Kodak fails to meet them, what recourse do we have as a nation? I do not think we have any. However, the point remains that here we have an interna' tional company which has vast resources and but a huge export income right around the world Ausand which has just been given $36m of Ausfor tralian taxpayers' money to prop up its arrangements in Australia, but when an Australian company got in touch with Kowith an order for $1.2m worth of film, what did it say? It said, 'We don't want to know about you'. What did the Minister say when he finally responded on this matter? While the Government is keen to encourage a export commitment by Australian industry that was well, that is nice--'marketing arrangements and decisions by need to take account of the nature of particular agreements with distributors and the complexities particular overseas markets. In the case of Kodak, arrangements between the company and its agents other traders are matters of a commercial nature Kowhich are best left to the parties involved. In other words, 'We are going to give you the money, don't you worry about any parhelp for Australian companies; you just go ahead freezing out Australian companies; you just go ahead working with your agents overseas'. I heard on the Andrew Olle Howshow an interview with one of the heads of Kodak in relation to this matter. What he was, 'We are literally told by our overof seas headquarters the arrangements that we and can make, and' that is what we will stick with'. That company's basic responsibility relates to its arrangements with its head office overseas. It· cares nothing for the Australian situation. That does not matter to it. It will not-and it has demonstrated this-enter into arrangements with Australian trading companies if those arrangements do not come through its own agents. There is an argument about that at the best of times, but it is even worse when that attitude is being maintained following $36m of Australian taxpayers' funds being given to that company. It is simply not good enough. Obviously, it is a matter of tremendous concern. It is no wonder that the Opposition refuses to go along with this.",104
243,Mr CHYNOWETH ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Dunkley) (5.25)The honoqrable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) spoke about how the Liberals would allow Wesley Vale to go ahead. Had we· allowed that mill, that huge polluter of the environment, to proceed, we would have once again left a legacy to our children of poisoned waters and a degraded environment. That sort of thing might be all right for the Liberal Party, but it is not all right for us. Paper from the mill-MONICA",107
244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member is in order in responding to a point made earlier in the debate, but he knows that the subject of the paper mill is not part of the matter before the House. I ask the honourable member to get quickly onto the matter presently before us.",107
245,Mr CHYNOWETH,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Yes, I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. There was quite a large section of the speech of the honourable member for Bennelong on this very matter.",107
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"Unfortunately, I was not in the chair. There will not be a large section on it now.",107
247,Mr CHYNOWETH,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"I have previously spoken at length on the matter of recycling, and I am quite certain that we could have a mill here which would save having paper produced by a new mill at Wesley Vale. The Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill follows the Government's decision, announced on 31 October 1989, to introduce a production bounty for film, totalling up to $12m a year for three years, comm-ncing on 1 January 1990. The bounty is to be payable on the produCtion in Australia of bountiable photographic film which has been sensitised and finished in Australia. The bounty is payable at the rate of $3.75 for each square metre of bountiable photographic film produced. As there is no other producer of this sort of product except Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, naturally the provision is directed at Eastman Kodak. With the announcement of the bounty scheme on 31 October 1989, the Government indicated that the first three years of the bounty scheme would receive an appropriation totalling up to $36m, with an annual limit of up to $12m-$6m for 1989-90, $12m for each of the following years, and $6m for 1992-93. Clause 11 provides: Any advances received by a producerthat is, Kodakmay be reclaimed where a producer fails to comply with all the bounty eligibility conditions throughout the entire bounty period. I refer to what has happened recently with Kodak. An article in the Sunday Age of 24 September 1989, entitled IWhy Kodak's softly-softly boss turned into an axeman', states: Mr Colby Chandler, chairman of Eastman Kodak, the international photographic, chemical and drug company known by its yellow film packaging, marched into a meeting of 75 top managers last month and shocked them by attacking a wooden crate with a machete. I do not know what that says about his management principles. It continues: Eastman Kodak is one of the more staid of America's bluechip companies. The uncharacteristic display at the company's headquarters in Rochester-a city in upstate New York where Kodak employs 44,000 of the 250,000 residents-signalled the start of its most draconian restructuring for years. Things at Kodak look less than picture perfect these days: the company reported an unexpected 85 per cent plunge in profits this year; a penalty of perhaps $US 1.5 billion is pending in a 1988 patent infringement suit; and the firm's depressed share price has piqued the interest of raiders. . . . the cuts that Mr Chandler was so graphically illustrating with his machete involved 4,500 jobs worldwide. They are part of a restructuring of 20 Kodak businesses, both in the United States and in its eight main offshore branches, that produce $US1.5 billion in sales. We know that Kodak was threatening to cut 500 jobs from its work force here in Australia. Some of the things that have happened to Kodak employees at Rochester are referred to as follows: Apart from taking its share of job cuts, the city has seen the freezing of Kodak wages and the scrapping of an annual employee bonus tied to the company's stock dividend. The suit by Polaroid appears to be the main motivator for this situation, as the article states: Kodak tried to enter the instant photography market dominated by Polaroid. Polaroid successfully sued for a patent breach . . . It still faces a horrendous compensation payout: Polaroid is claiming about $USIO billion in losses, a tenth of which is conceded by Kodak. Many analysts expect Polaroid could be awarded $US1.5 billion . . . That is the reason behind all of this. It sounds as though some cheating may have occurred in the United States in relation to a patent, so Kodak is being sued and Australia has to suffer. Peter Roberts, in an article in the Australian Financial Review, sums up, I think succinctly, the situation in which we find ourselves. The article states: The decision by the Federal Government to subsidise Kodak (Australasia) to the tune of $60m over five years is painful but, it seems to me, inescapable. There are precious few foreign manufacturing or service companies like Kodak which serve world markets from Australia, and precious few local companies that have any sort of world presence. According to Austrade there are only 100 companies operating here that have turnovers of more than $50m a year and export more than 25 per cent of their output . . . Kodak exports $170m a year worth of film and photographic paper to Asia and the middle East. This makes it our second-largest exporter of manufactured goods. For a maximum price of $60m the Government has effectively guaranteed $1,OOOm in exports over the next five years. We are all talking about the balance of payments, and one can see how important Kodak is. The article continues: Only 18 months ago, Kodak (Australasia),s Managing Director, Mr Ed Woods, was saying, after the company won an Austrade manufacturing export award and after doubling export sales in five years, 'Australians can effectively compete in the world if companies invest in new technology, research . . . and make a significant commitment to quality control, developing an ongoing strategy staying close to their customers.' Let us have a quick look at the profit and loss sheet of Kodak (Australasia). In 1988 its operating profit was $21,766,000. The company's retained profit-and this is interesting-was $89m. I do not know where that retained profit is or what it is used for, but that is the figure-$89,672,489. The company's management in Australia, it has been said, has never been able to make a decision-all decisions are made in Rochester. I know someone who used to work for Kodak, who has given me this information. Kodak (Australasia) employees were not allowed to buy even .a paper clip without receiving the okay from Rochester or from Kodak in the United States. I have found out that Kodak is doing a nice bit of price transferring. Chemicals that it could buy in Australia have been purchased in Rochester at 10 times the price. The company is paying huge prices for materials and sending the money to the United States. The company does not pay any tax here; it makes a loss and the profits Of the company in the United States go up. Kodak (Australasia) has been paying Kodak in the United States excess money for technology. It has been buying second-hand equipment from Rochester, or from Kodak in the United States, and paying the top price for it. Kodak (Australasia) buys machinery to develop and process film and it is paying between three, four and five times more than it is worth. That is a nice way to transfer money overseas. Mr Jull-This is outrageous.",107
248,Mr CHYNOWETH,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"I know it is outrageous. Let us look at the shareholding of Kodak (Australasia). This also makes interesting reading. The Eastman Kodak Co., of 343 State Street, Rochester, New York, has 64,999,200 shares. Mr Donald Frank Hogarth of Kodak (Australasia) has 400 shares and Mr Edward Graham Woods of Kodak (Australasia) has 400. So, of the 65 million Eastman Kodak shares, 800 are held in Australia, which is quite interesting. Perhaps we should look at having Kodak listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. That would be quite good. I have only a minute remaining, but I will for look at one or two other suggestions. Perhaps if Kodak (Australasia) makes a large profit over the next 10 years, it should be put back into Australia. A letter to the editor in today's Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial states: The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, is giving a nice present of $36m to Kodak . . . My son forwarded three holiday movie films (Kodak Ektachrome type (G) to the company for development. They have been sent back to him undeveloped with a printed sticker attached. It reads: 'We apologise that this service is no longer available. Your therefore returned.' There was no reason given, no suggestion for an alternative development centre. Kodak-this huge multinational-must develop its own films or it must repay the people whose hard-earned taxes help it during times of trouble. Mr Colby Chandler's company should be making an all-out effort to service its Australian customers, or he may find the bounty we are discussing induces others to come here and create some real competition for Kodak. Perhaps we can get a little action in that area-who knows?",108
249,Mr SINCLAIR ,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"New England) (5.36)The honourable member for Dunkley ( Mr Chynoweth), interestingly, has given us a breakdown of the shareholding of Eastman Kodak. We on this side of the House have no objection to overseas companies investing in Australia. We have no prejudice against companies deciding, as in the case of Kodak, that they should export and that they should be allowed to do so in competition with overseas affiliates of the same group. However, this legislation is not about that subject; it is about whether special ad hoc government assistance should be provided to one company. That company has been selected seemingly not on the quality of its product but, as far as I can understand, on two criteria, one of which is perhaps more honourable than the other. The one that is honourable relates to the fact that we are told that jobs are at risk, exports are at risk and the company's viability is at risk. The other relates to the political proximity to the electorate of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the fact that there is obviously a feeling within Wills that the Prime Minister has not been servicing his electorate in the way that he should. This afternoon I will look at the question of a bounty and at where we are going in relation to the industry generally. If we are going to endorse the payment of money to a particular company, as this legislation suggests, we must really think about the alternatives. Is the payment of a bounty to Kodak in this instance, or to any other company, the only way we should go? Or is the bounty another instance of the political adhockery which has been reflected in so many recent decisions of the Government and which has involved the outlay, to the cost of the taxorder is payer, of very considerable sums of money? The payment to Kodak represents a bounty of $36m, which is somewhat less than the $60m that was first suggested to be the product of Government decisions. However, it is still a great deal of money. Let us look at the forms of assistance the Government could provide. I will say something about the other very large and generous government grants to business in a moment. If the Government does not give a bounty, it can provide a tariff, a government grant or some sort of tax relief. Of course, each of those measures, when they are examined, discriminate against those who are not the beneficiary. My worry is that this debate takes place on a day when we have yet again had a bad number from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in respect of our current account balance. We know that the chronic deficit in overseas earnings continues to mount way beyond the projection of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in the Budget he handed down only a few months ago. We know that, as far as Australia is concerned, there is a genuine concern that something needs to be done to expand our export contribution. Is a bounty as suggested by the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill, the only way to go? Will we have to spend money on an ad hoc basis in order to increase our exports, or are there other ways in whic;h we can approach the subject? I find it interesting that, in considering the current account deficit and the detail by which other measures to assist industry could be approached, the Government has walked away from almost every form of assistance. The more particular forms from which it has walked away have been those that have been the subject of so many reports for so long. In answering questions earlier today, the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) referred to the Garnaut report, Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy Members on this side of the House welcome that report. We are looking forward to some micro-economic reform initiatives from the Government, initiatives to remove the burden of government regulation. It is paradoxical that only yesterreceive day we had even more regulation by way of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill. We hear the jargon about removing all the impediments to business; we know the phrases about even playing fields and windows of opportunity. Those concepts would be far more pertinent in considering the Kodak problem than measures that will cost the taxpayers $36m. In this instance, we are told that the ister concerned, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), is a very reluctant starter. We all know that the Treasurer was in the first place opposed to the payment proposed. We have recently considered legislation providing for the revamp of the Industries Assistance Commission and the Inter-State Commission. The nature of the Government's approach, at least in rhetorical terms, has been to say that we should get rid of tariffs and all those impediments towards free trade. Professor Garnaut, who; after all, has been an assistant to the Prime Minister, now tells us that what we must do is try to expand our exports. He says that at the moment we are forgoing about $20 billion a year in exports because of structural inefficiencies in the economy, barriers to trade and a failure to exploit market opportunities in the growing economies of Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. The reason we are forgoing those export opportunities is not that we are not paying companies bounties but that we are not getting the ball game right. We are certainly not getting the ball game right by handing out $36m to Kodak or by handing out a wages subsidy to Ansett Airlines of Australia of about $700,000 up to 1L September. In addition, Ansett is being given a defence carrying contract worth about another $7m a year. By those actions, we are certainly not helping to overcome those inefficiencies in the economy. That is not achieved by forgoing, in respect of Ansett, $30m in Government revenue by way of lifting airport charges. We are certainly not accepting the principles to which Professor Garnaut is referring in mentioning lifting the barriers of trade and removing structural inefficiency. That is not achieved by giving the banks $200m for a few people who are selected to housing loans, by giving about $130m to the waterfront unions or by providing the unfunded amendments to the company tax collection amendments that will affect about 98 per cent of the companies now paying tax in Australia. We must remember that last Sunday the Managing Director of the Macquarie Bank Ltd said that Australia's overseas debt would be doubled by the year 2000. IIi a report Minreleased this week, Citibank Ltd predicted that Australian assets in foreign hands would double from $223 billion to $425.8 billion in the next five years. All those statistics run quite contrary to the reasons behind this bounty to Kodak. Frankly, I find this a very sad debate. Reports have been prepared in relation to so many areas, and the Government could have looked at those reports. In fact, it has commissioned any number of reports. Never mind Professor Garnaut's report, although I commend many of the recommendations in it. A report was produced not so long ago, under the chairmanship of Professor Helen Hughes, that looked at Australian exports. I refer to the report of the Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance. Professor Hughes commented that it is well understood that our lagging economic performance is linked to our poor export growth. The report talks about the problems of Australia lagging in the industrial country stakes. It refers to the fact that an adjusted merchandise export to gross domestic product ratio for a country of Australia's size would be about 19 per cent. In other words, we are below the comparable industrial countries in the world when population size and distance from markets is taken into account in performance. We are in that situation not because we are not giving companies bounties; we are there because the Government is not pursuing the right economic or industrial policies. It is not pursuing the deregulatory policies that all Opposition members believe are necessary. The Government tries to take us back to the revolutionary wars by talking about what we, in Government, did not do. I point out to the Government that deregulation and the move away from the practices that bounties represent were all a product of the recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. They were the starting point towards deregulation of the financial system. That report was commissioned by the previous coalition government-indeed, by the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) who led for the Opposition in this debate. The Campbell committee recommendations were the first significant move towards getting away from the very principle that the bounty given to Kodak in this legislation represents. I am not just talking about the Helen Hughes report; there are so many others. Indeed, another report, Successful Strategies for Australian Trade, was released last year by the Centre for International Economics, under the editorship of Andy Stoeckel and Sandy Cuthbertson. It, too, identified the fact that, if we are to achieve any improvement in our export situation, we have to address micro-economic reform. We must look at flexibility in wage determination and eliminate wasteful management and work practices. That is what this debate should really be about. It is sad that, as we run down towards an election, adhockery and the political judgment of the Government will predominate over the decisions that should be taken to enable industrial development. What makes it worse is that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) has commendably spoken out about sustainable land use and sustainable production. Those points should· be listened to. I believe that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce would support much of the rhetoric of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy but, unfortunately, the reality is that the Government is not following those principles. Brief reference has been made in this debate to Wesley Vale. In the past few days, we have talked about Coronation Hill. What the Government is doing is shutting off positive assistance that will contribute to exports. However, this debate is not about those projects, although I should be happy to talk about them on another occasion. The point I am trying to make is that, in this instance, we are looking at one area in which secondary industry can contribute towards exports. We must start addressing the fundamental problems so that we can begin to encourage exports and not just provide a palliative by handing out $36m because a company is involved that will affect the Prime Minister's electoral chances. Adhockery is no way to approach a total solution to improving our export performance. Adhockery is no way in which to get rid of restrictive work practices. Adhockery is no way in which to address the problems referred to by Professor Garnaut, Professor Helen Hughes and Andy Stoeckel. We must start looking at the problem on a wider basis, not just because an election is coming up but because this is so important for Australia's future. We must embrace the problem more widely. We must attempt to pursue with more devotion and application micro-economic reform. We must accept the recommendations of these reports and not come up with bounties. This bounty is bad for Australia and for industry. It does nothing for small businesses, which are really the engine room of Australian development. In fact, 95 per cent of businesses would be delighted to have this bounty. We have heard all about interest rates and know how they have affected the viability of big business. We read about the Skases, the Budget Rent-a-Cars, the Alan Bonds day by day. However, there are thousands of small farmers and small manufacturers out there who are suffering, yet this Bill is about providing $36m to one company. This is not the way to go; it is wrong for Australia, particularly at the moment. Any decision taken because there is an election in the wind is one which the company itself and the Australian public know is likely to be reversed and should be reversed when the coalition comes into Government. Question put: That the Bill be now read a second time. The House divided. ( Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr A. C. Rocher) Ayes . . . . 69 Noes . . . . 50 Majority 19 NA Baldwin, P. J. Beazley, K. C. Kelly, R.

250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AYES,"Mr Rocber)Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question now is: That the remaining stages of the Bill be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA Lindsay,E. J. MCHugh, J. NA 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 November, on Mountrord, J. G. O'Keere, N. P. motion by Mr Kerin: That the Bill be now read a second time. Punch, G. F. Saunderson, J. Mr LLOYD (Murray) (5.58)-The Grain Legumes Levy Legislation Amendment Bill Scholes, G. G. D. Sciacca, C. 1989 is one of a number of related rural industry research Bills which provide reScott, Los Simmons, D. W. search arrangements for our great rural industries; and there are about 20 separate Snowdon, W. E. Staples, P. R. such industry research arrangements. This particular Bill amends the Grain Legumes Tickner, R. E. Uren, T. Levy Act, under which Act the growers of certain grain legumes pay a levy for research Willis,R. Wright, K. W. purposes. That levy is matched by the Government on a dollar for dollar basis. The NA maximum Commonwealth contribution is 0.5 Howard, J. W. per cent of the gross value of production. For quite a few years this has been, and Lloyd, B. MCArthur, F. S. continues to be, generally a bipartisan approach or cooperative arrangement with our MACKellar, M. J. R. Macphee, I. M. great rural industries. Miles, C. G. Millar, P. C. The current amount of levy paid for those legumes which are subject to the arrangePorter, J. R. Prosser, G. D. ment is set by regulation at $1.25 per tonne, and the maximum rate is $2.60 per tonne. Robinson, Ian Ruddock, P. M. The purpose of this Bill is to lift the maximum rate to $5 per tonne and to broaden Sharp, J. R. Shipton, R. F. the coverage of the legumes or species covered. Initially, only lupins and field peas Smith, W. L. Sullivan, K. J. were covered by the Grain Legumes Levy Act but now a number of other legumes are Wilson, I. B. C. Woods, R. L. involved. This Bill adds peanuts to that listand I will not make any cracks concerning what we are talking about tonight! The peaNA nut industry, through the Grains Council of Fisher Peter I Moore, J. C. Australia-;-the Grains Council represents grain legume growers-has requested the passage of the Bill so that it can quickly join the other rural industries in this joint government and industry dollar for dollar research arrangement. The peanut growers, to their credit, do not believe that the current operative levy of $1.25 a tonne is enough for research purposes for their industry, so they are immediately starting at the $2 rate. That . will raise about $30,000 from growers' funds which will be matched by the Commonwealth. The Bill also provides for a levy determination mechanism for grain legumes which are leviable for research purposes to reflect more closely the price received by the grower for the particular crop grown. As I said, it is a straightforward and bipartisan type of Bill and therefore it will be supported. I want to make a few other brief comments in relation to the grain industry and the Grains Council, which is the representative body for grain legumes as well as for other forms of grain. I refer to the very recent appointment of the new members of the Australian Wheat Board. That follows the Government's changes to both the range of members and the method of appointment in the recent wheat marketing legislation. The new Board will consist of two grower representatives plus two other representatives who are growers and have other nonprimary-industry expertise, out of a total of 10. The Chairman continues to be Mr Clinton Condon, who was a wheat grower at the time of his appointment and, I believe, still is. I want to congratulate all those who have been appointed to the Board. It is one of the great statutory marketing authorities of this country, a very successful one, and they will be representing and having the responsibility for the continued success of the great wheat industry. I commend the selection committee for those it has appointed. I also say that the wheat legislation is unsatisfactory. It will be amended by a coalition government after the next election. In particular, there will be provision for five growers to be members of the Board and the Chairman of the Board will be required to be a grower at the time of appointment. That will provide a far better representation for the wheat growers of this country. I have just been in South Australia, where there is great concern over the fact that after many years there is no longer a wheat grower representative from that State. The second major amendment will be the continuation of 95 per cent underwriting for the wheat industry on a single year basis. That part of the wheat legislation which refers to underwriting will phase it down to 80 per cent over a five-year period. That level is absolutely useless to the industry. At the 95 per cent level it will not be of any cost to the taxpayers, but it will assist the industry in relation to the amount of the guaranteed advance and the speed at which that can be made. A further point I want to make about the wheat industry is that it is unfortunate that, at a time when prices, although weakening, are still reasonably firm internationally, a combination of climatic circumstances will see a dramatically reduced wheat crop and, for that matter, as we are referring particularly to grain legumes, reductions in the various grain legume yields and totals. Planting in the Northern Hemisphere could mean that it is the last good year for prices for a variety of types of grains and grain legumes. It has the additional consequence of reducing not only growers' income but also exports at a time when we desperately need every export dollar. Estimates put that export figure somewhere between $50m and $700m. In conclusion, the farmers of Australia have been very generous and long-sighted in their commitment to research. If we look at the various industry funds we see that grower money going in is about $80m. When we add the contribution for promotion, particularly that made by the wool industry, a dramatic increase can be seen in the total contribution by farmers to their future. They set an example to other industries in Australia of having a research based industry which proves the value of research by the far greater productivity that there is for agriculture than for any other industry. The productivity rate is close to 3 per cent, well over twice the rate of any other industry in Australia. Because of that they are able to compete internationally. That is not the only reason. They continue at times to go through a very painful adjustment, both in their numbers and in their level of income. But, in spite of those difficult periods, they maintain that commitment to research. There is an acknowledgment and agreement that they have to increase the amount of that, and this Bill is part of that process. On behalf of the Opposition I say that we are pleased to support this Bill.",112
251,Mr COURTICE ,PAIRS,"Hinkler) (6.07)-The Grain Legumes Levy Legislation Amendment Bill, in line with several other Bills relating to agriculture introduced this session, deals with levies for research and development. I think it is very pleasing to see support on both sides of the House not only for this Bill and the Bills introduced subsequently but also for the direction in which agriculture is going in regard to research and development, which is obviously the key for agricultural sustainability. It is not only amount that we produce that is relevant but also the amount in regard to our cost of production and maximum efficiency. This can be achieved through putting funds into research and development which is jointly funded by both the industry and government. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Grain Legumes Levy Act 1985 and associated regulations. The principal amendment will allow different levy rates to be determined for different kinds of grain legumes, in contrast to the current Act, which allows a single levy rate only. To allow for future increases in levy rates, the maximum rate of levy to apply to all grain legumes is proposed to be increased. Provision is also made for amendments of an administrative nature in respect of the application of the levy on peanuts and mung beans. The Grain Legumes Levy Act, in conjunction with the Rural Industries Research Act 1985, gives effect to the grain legumes research scheme, which is funded by a levy payable by growers on the production of certain grain legumes. The levy rate is presently $1.25 per tonne for all leviable grain legumes and can be varied by regulation up to a maximum rate of $2.60 per tonne. Grower contributions to research by way of the levy are matched by the Commonwealth, as I said previously, on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the industry's gross value of production. This Bill makes a direct provision for an increase to $2 per tonne in the levy rate for peanuts from the rate of $1.25 per tonne applying to all other leviable grain legumes, reflecting the high unit value of peanuts. The Bill also provides for different levy rates to be prescribed for other leviable grain legumes covered by the research scheme, subject to the maximum rate specified in the Act not being exceeded. The Bill repeals the Grain Legumes Research Levy Regulations, which to date have specified the levy rate and would thus become redundant. Provision is also made for the maximum rate of levy prescribed in the Act for any leviable grain legume to be increased from $2.60 to $5 per tonne. This will provide scope for future levy increases for peanuts and other higher value legumes. The growers' organisation, however, must recommend-I stress this-on any change to levies. As I have said, grower levy the contributions mat-h Commonwealth funding on a dollar for dollar basis. The $2 levy rate for peanuts will generate an additional $29,000 in grower levy contributions to the trust fund in a full levy income year. Matched by the Federal Government funding, that represents some $60,000. One of the interesting things about this industry is its significant impact as an export earner. Exports for 1988-89 were in excess of 782,000 tonnes, at a value of $207m. That is from a national production of over 1.8 million tonnes and a total value of $400m. I make the point-I am sure the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) will agree with me-that, if we were to see some new sunrise industry start up and earn, say, $100m in a year, we would applaud it, as we should, and say that that is great. But here we have the humble legume industry producing $400m and over $200m in export earnings. I believe that its capacity to expand exists through research and development and also through changing farm practices. There are many farmers who grow legumes along with other products. With the new technologies there is no reason why their horizons cannot be broadened. Consequently, we have a massive potential to increase production and earn export dollars for Australia. The other point I make relates to the rate of the peanut levy and why it is higher than for other legumes. The proposed increase in the levy on production of peanuts is $2 per tonne. But I point out that the return for peanuts is much higher than for other legumes. Consequently, it has been seen to be right and proper that the levy should be at a higher rate than for other legumes. I have great pleasure in once again complimenting the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin), and I support the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Simmons) proposed: That the Bill be now read a third time.",113
252,Mr SINCLAIR ,PAIRS,"New England) (6.12)-I wish to speak briefly on the third reading of the Grain Legumes Levy Legislation Amendment Bill because, when dealing with a Bill applying a levy, it is worth making sure that people understand the character and nature of the way in which the rural industries around Australia have helped themselves. First, people should know that essentially levies come from recommendations from producers. Secondly, the levies demonstrate that producers are funding research, promotion and market support. Thirdly, it is so often complained that primary producers in some way receive an unfair share of the government take and it should be recognised that the government take is essentially in legislation of this kind. This levy Bill is a very good example of how the primary producers get together and face a situation that they believe needs redressing. Through the levy system, they are able collectively to ensure that everybody participates equally and contributes towards objectives that they know will be in their own interests. It is almost peculiar that it happens only in primary industry. Of course, the coal industry, through the coal industry levy, has contributed towards some superannuation type entitlement, but I am not aware of any other secondary industry that has legislation applicable to it in a manner similar to that contained in this legislation. It is important that people know that the primary producers of Australia, consistently, through this type of package have made a very important financial contribution towards achieving collectively a goal that I am sure everybody in the community would see as worthwhile. It is true that a number of industries receive a dollar for dollar contribution from the Commonwealth towards research. During the term of the coalition government we provided money for promotion and research on a dollar for dollar basis. That is worthwhile, particularly when we look at the purpose of this Bill and understand that it is designed to try to encourage the efficient operation of the peanut and grain legume industries. It is a way by which they can enhance their performance. Unfortunately, the nature of research is such that it is hard for individual growers to achieve what they seek. Regrettably, with funding cuts to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, if it were not for levy payments of this sort we would have an even lesser research effort than we have now. Indeed, the whole character of the levies applied by various rural industries to themselves is to be commended. That does not mean that each levy is not without some controversy, nor that they are universally accepted. Indeed, in so many areas, such as the proposed transaction levy for livestock purposes at the moment, there is very considerable opposition from within the rural industry. But this legislation is entirely supported by those outside the House. People in the wider community should know that it is typical of the way in which primary producers of Australia help themselves to facilitate research, promotion and market development, particularly abroad. I commend the concept and I support the legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA",115
253,Mr SPEAKER,HANSARD REPORT,"Earlier this afternoon the honourable member for Hume ( Mr Fife) drew my attention to the fact that words used by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) in the House yesterday-namely, 'Will you shut up, Kim'-were reported in the media but are not included in the Daily Hansard. The honourable member asked me, first, whether the Prime Minister or any member of his staff had had the remark removed from the record and, secondly, to ensure that the Hansard is amended to include the Prime Minister's words. The Principal Parliamentary Reporter has advised me that the words actually used by the Prime Minister were, 'Shut up, Kim, will you'. Whilst Hansard is a full and substantially verbatim report of the proceedings, it does not include words that are not part of the proceedings, such as asides or interjections that are not replied to or acknowledged by the member who has the call or by the occupant of the Chair. The Hansard reporter and supervising reporter considered that the words used by the Prime Minister were not part of the proceedings, and they were not transcribed by the Hansard reporter. So the words were left out of the record by the Hansard staff; they were not removed from the record by or at the request of the Prime Minister or any member of his staff.",115

INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 November, on edge, EmptyHere That the Bill be now read a second time.",116
256,Mr ROCHER ,HANSARD REPORT,"Curtin) (6.19)- Mr Speaker, I thank you also, but for your mely entrance to this place so that I could vacate the chair and make a contribution this debate. The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989, which the Opposition does not oppose, inforgone. volves, in the first instance, giving the force of Commonwealth law to protocols recently entered into and which amend the existing comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Singapore and Ausment tralia and France. The legislation seeks to give equal force law to comprehensive double taxation agreebe ments between Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Australia and Thailand covering all forms of income flowing tween Australia and those countries. The agreement with PNG was signed on 24 May of this year and that with the Government of the Royal Kingdom of Thailand on 31 August. It is interesting to note that provisions vary from agreement to agreement. Let me point out, in case it is not work. understood, that the protocols with Singapore and France amend existing agreements. The arrangements with PNG and Thailand are new agreements. It is strange, but probably understandable, that the conditions of agreements vary between countries. Those of us approaching this-as some of us in this debate must-without any knowledge of the strictures and constraints involved, might be tempted to think that agreements of this kind would be identical. That is not the case. We have also been told that both the and the agreements have no significant effect on revenue. We are armed with the knowledge that there are provisions in it the agreements and protocols which make the positions of Australians earning income any in any of the countries concerned much clearer and, therefore, they are able to ascertain their full taxation obligations. When they enter into arrangements or contracts of service,· or create a business in any of the four countries involved, they are able to establish their tax liability with greater clarity and certainty. But in the absence of that knowlit might be easy to come to the conclusion that if there is no significant effect on revenue, why bother? There may be-and I might touch on it tilater-some effect on revenue which is not mentioned. It seems to me that there may to be some unequal provisions in the agreements entered into with PNG and Thailand and, as a consequence, revenue is probably In the case of France, at least, there is probably also a cost to the revenue in that our agreements with that country involve certain arrangements whereby French investin this country would probably put France, and the Government of France, at an advantage on the basis that Franco inof vestment in Australia is much more likely to greater and profits derived by French investment in Australia, therefore, greater than Australian investment in France. I see be that Mr Holmes a Court is interested in Europe and perhaps that will bring about more balance in the future. But I would not rely on that because he seems to be operatthe ing through a United Kingdom company. Mr Jull-He might buy the Seven netMONICA",116
257,Mr ROCHER,HANSARD REPORT,"He might. He might buy Ansett ALP. There could be an advantage to Singapore, and I put it no higher than that. The replacement article in protocol provides that where the recipient of certain income which may have been taxed by both countries is an Australian resident, credit relief is to be provided by Australia in accordance with Australia's general foreign tax credit system. Also, I understand that it is intended to provide tax sparing credit relief for Singapore tax forgone under certain development incentives currently provided by and in Singapore. In this connection, Australia will treat as paid, for foreign tax credit purposes, the Singapore tax to be forgone. The protocol with Singapore will extend to 30 June 1987 the operation of tax sparing provisions in the existing agreement which generally ceased to apply from 30 June 1984. It seems to be a terribly long time to takefrom 30 June 1984, when the previous agreement expired, to 1989-to revive that agreement and enter into the new protocol. It could be that, as a result, tax will be imposed retrospectively. I hope that is not the case. If it is, we will have allowed something to escape our attention for want of better information. Also, under the protocol with Singapore, from 1 July 1987 the tax sparing provisions of the replacement of a 'credit relief article contained in the protocol will apply. We can see, from this rather belated conclusion of the protocol, that there has been-on the face of it, anyway-great laxity by the Government. This also applies to the protocol with France, which I might touch on later. The Government has shown no sign of being embarrassed by this delay, and perhaps that is just another sign of what we refer to sometimes as the arrogance of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). The Singapore protocol deals with shipping and airline profits. In the case of Australian companies, it will have effect from the 1983-84 financial year and, in the case of Singapore residents and resident companies, it will apply from on or after January 1984. I cannot help but get the feeling, reading from the information which is available, that Singapore has the best end of the stick. If I am right in that assumption, there would be some effect on revenue, surely, and this should be mentioned in the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum. I have mentioned in respect of the protocol with France that greater benefits accrue to France. By dint of my understanding that French investment in Australia is certainly greater than Australian investment in France, it follows that greater benefits will flow to French companies and others which obtain income from within Australia. The protocol with France involves pension income and that will have force from 1 July 1987. There is also an adjustment in the protocol with France involving the definition of royalties. Income derived under that section will come into effect from the date of the signing of the protocol in 1989. Other changes also come into effect from 19 June this year. The evidence is that these alterations to existing agreements have been hanging around since 1987. The Government must have known that the agreements were to expire and this seems to be an unacceptable delay.",117
258,Deus ex machina,HANSARD REPORT,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,117
259,Mr ROCHER,HANSARD REPORT,"Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I referred to the fact that the protocols amending the existing agreements between Singapore and Australia and between France and Australia are rather belated in the sense that each of those agreements expired some time ago. From memory, I think the Singapore agreement expired in 1984 and that with France was cut out in July 1987. The provisions of the rejuvenated agreements as a consequence of these protocols apply in terms of some of the provisions to 1984 and 1987 as the case may be. I asked whether that involved any retrospectivity and made the point that, if it had, we were singularly uninformed on it by the Government and it would be abdicating some responsibility to the Parliament, I believe, and to the Opposition if that were the case. The agreements, as the terminology suggests, with each of Papua New Guinea and the Government of the Royal Kingdom of Thailand are new agreements; so the question I just asked about the protocols is certainly not appropriate in this case. These are new agreements. Presumably, they are based on agreements we have with other countries and not just those under discussion tonight. Included in these agreements with Papua New Guinea and Thailand are provisions with which it would be difficult to argue even if we were of a mind to do so and, as I have already indicated, the Opposition does not oppose this legislation. It would be easy but probably superfluous to go through each of the various measures included in the agreement. I refer specifically to the inclusion of provisions governing tax payable in the country of origin or in the other country, as the case may be, for tax on income of various sorts for personal services. It is to be the case that, with Papua New Guinea and Thailand, employees' remuneration is to be generally taxable in the country where the services are performed. However, there are some qualifications and exceptions to that which I need not go through. They seem to be proper and justified. Amongst those people to be singled out for certainty of knowledge as to their tax obligations are public entertainers and sportsmen. The next speaker on the other side might want to touch on that. Dr Charlesworth-I never made any money out of it.",117
260,Mr ROCHER,HANSARD REPORT,"The honourable member for Perth is an amateur in more ways than one. The income derived by public entertainers will be subjected to tax under certain arrangements now, which will be helpful in the sense that those who want to perform in each of the countries with which we have made these new agreements will know their obligation and that can only be an advance on the prevailing situation. The same. is true for professional sportsmen. There are certain exceptions. For example, in the agreement with Thailand, certain artistic work which might be subsidised by that country's government will not be subjected to tax under this agreement if otherwise it would be taxable in Australia. I guess that is fair enough because no gove,rnment which is subsidising a group of people such as performers, professional sportsmen or even amateur sportsmen as they operate today would care to see that subsidy exacerbated by the fact that tax on the earnings of the individual artists or entertainers had to be paid overseas. It is one way that governments with subsidies to such people get part of their investment back eventually. The 'subsidies', if there is such word, have to pay part of what they are given back in tax anyway. Certainly we would not expect the Government of Thailand to be any different from us in that respect. The agre-ments with each of the governments of Papua New Guinea and Thailand seem to give, on balance, an advantage to each of those countries. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does get to another proposition which I have canvassed in other debates in this place. Our total aid contribution to developing countries is not known, in the sense that it cannot be totalled. If I am correct in my assumption that the balance of advantage is with Papua New Guinea and Thailand, it becomes another form of aid. It would be helpful to us as practising parliamentarians to be able to explain to our constituencies when we are asked, as we so often are, what the total of our aid is to a particular country, or the total of our international aid. This is just another way of confusing our effort. I suggest that it is even lost on the government of the day in that it does not get the full credit in those countries where we are delivering aid other than that which is obvious and appropriated through the Appropriation Bills which come before the Parliament periodically. So we have another dimension, another factor, in the equation. It would be helpful if the Government were to tell us that there is an element of aid in this legislation by dint of the advantage we give to countries such as Papua New Guinea and Thailand with measures such as this. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation. It is generally acceptable. Although we have raised a couple of questions, those questions are of a type which merely seek information which has not been given either in the explanatory memorandum or in the Minister's second reading speech. They are no more than that. However, they do seek information to which I believe, and the Opposition believes, the Parliament is entitled. We support the Bill. Debate interrupted. NA",118

263,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I certainly do, sir.",119
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member may proceed.,119
265,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"During today's personal explanation period, which was probably the most explosive one that I have sat through in 23 years, I alluded to yesterday's and today's Sydney Morning Herald, which contained reports of my involvement in and views on the subject of the banning of tobacco advertising. In the Sydney Morning Herald, Richard Mulcahy of the Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd was quoted as claiming that the death of my father and my contracting of diabetes had left me both unwell and confused. Let me categorically deny these ridiculous and scandalous assertions. I am very well, and if the death of my 81-year-old father 16 months ago means that I am unwell, one must query the state of health of the Tobacco Institute whose product is related to the death of 17,000 Australians annually. Further, I am certainly not confused, especially about the fact that tobacco advertising is 2t times more successful at getting young teenagers to start smoking than education programs are at preventing smoking. I do not resile from the views I have expressed about tobacco production and promotion, and I leave it to others to judge Mr Mulcahy for attempting to undermine my credibility with unfair and unfounded assertions. Indeed, he has belonged to the Australian Labor Party, the Democratic Labor Party and the Liberal Party, and I think that is a definition of confusion. INCOME TAX· (INTERNATIONAL NA (No.2) 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed.",119
266,Dr CHARLESWORTH ,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Perth) (8.13)- spective I never thought it would happen, but here I am speaking after the honourable member for Moreton ( Mr Donald Cameron). I must attest to the fact that on that particular issue I think he is anything but confused. He is clearly thinking in a most unaccustomed way to his usual behaviour in this House. I came here expecting a very mild debate, but the gratuitous remark of the honourable member for Curtin ( Mr Rocher), who is now leaving the chamber, about my amateurish performance cannot go without comment. I make the point that I am paid for what I do in this House and I think I earn that pay. I would hope that my performance is not amateurish. The honourable member for Curtin raised the issue of retrospectivity. That is very dangerous territory for the Opposition these days because we note in the Economic Action Plan that the panacea for the solution of all Australia's problems is a significant taxation measure with a very retrospective element to it in that the removal of the capital gains tax will be something that is implemented with a five-year retrospectivity. The cost to the taxpayer of that measure, the cost to revenue, and the cost to the fairness of the taxation system is hundreds of millions of dollars-perhaps billions. It is dangerous territory, and perhaps territory over which I might stray later in this speech. The legislation before us is the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989. There are two elements of this Bill. The first element is that its passage will bring into being comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Papua New Guinea and Australia and Thailand. As the honourable member for Curtin suggested these will be new agreements and will clearly offer an improvement in the way in which taxation arrangements and undertakings are dealt with between those two countries. The second element brings into effect protocols to amend Australia's existing comprehensive double taxation agreement with France and Singapore. The honourable member for Curtin has mentioned that element which could be considered retrospective. This very innocuous legislation, for which the revenue impact is practically zero, is something in these retromeasures which can be justified. These measures will strengthen trade investment and cultural ties between the nations that I have mentioned. It is an important part of building up the interJ?ationalisation of Australia's economy, WhICh is very important. One of the features of the Bill-that is, the comprehensive taxation agreements with Papua New Guinea and Thailand-is that it provides for tax sparing. This provides credit relief extended by Australia for tax forgone by Papua New Guinea or Thailand under special development incentives. In this way the tax sparing aspect of the legislation encourages foreign investment which is very important for Australia. There are also provisions within the comprehensive double taxation agreements which prevent double taxation. This is something which we have endeavoured to do in Australia within the business community and it is an important part of our international arrangements with other countries. The Australian Government, or the treaty partner, can levy tax, but not both. That is a very desirable aspect of this legislation. There are also certain classes of income which can only be taxed in the country of residence of the recipient and there are various limitations on the rate of tax which can be levied. All these aspects of the legislation are unopposed by the Opposition and represent a strengthening and an improvement of the trade and investment relationships between Australia and those countries. Let us look at the other part of the legislation which amends the agreements which we have had with France and Singapore. In respect of Singapore, the provision through which Aust'ralia is required to provide a rebate of tax for dividends paid to an Australian company by a Singaporean company in which the Australian company has a 10 per cent or greater interest will be terminated. Indeed, there are also provisions within this legislation for tax sparing to occur in relation to our negotiations with Singapore. Again this provides for investment incentives. In respect of France, the major provision of the legislation provides that the source country has the sole right to tax government and service pensions paid to the resident in another country. This applies in many circumstances. It also applies to teachers and to those who may be temporarily in another country, affecting their profession. It must be understood that where the resident in another country is a citizen or obtains the nationality of that country, in those cases there is an exemption and the tax is levied by the country of residence. These measures are not controversial, they improve our relationships, and they ;lre an important part, although only a very small part, of our relationships with these countries. This brings me onto another aspect of taxation. It is an issue that has been considered to be very important by the public in general in Australia and relates to international profit shifting and the use of tax havens. I notice that the honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) will speak after me. He, with me, is a member on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. A report was brought down by that Committeeentitled 'Taxpayers or tax players' about the activities of companies within Australia and their international profit shifting arrangements. I think it is important for us to discuss these issues because it is an area where there has been significant leakage of taxation revenue that was due to the Government. It is an area in which taxation revenue has been lost. The Government in its statement of May 1988 said that the taxation treatment of foreign source income, especially as it applies to Australian companies, needs to be given special consideration. Indeed, a consultation process was undertaken and in April of this year the design of measures for taxing of foreign source income was finalised. The basis of this so-called accruals legislation has been established and there is now an understanding that it will form part of tax law into the future. It is a very important part because some estimates of the leakage of revenue are as much as $100m. Many would suggest that it is perhaps much more than that. There are two very important features of the accruals legislation. The first is that most of the income sheltered by Australian residents in low tax countries through foreign companies and trusts will be attributed to those residents and taxed in Australia on an accrual basis. This means that companies that decide to remove their taxation liabilities from Australia and place them in low taxing countries will no longer be able to avoid their taxation responsibilities in Australia. It is legislation that is important in sealing the net around the tax base in Australia. It is important for us to make sure that we have a consistent and workable philosophy behind our taxation structure. The second element, of course, provides for income derived from substantial interests in companies resident in comparable taxation countries, countries which have structures similar to our own, to be exempt from accruals legislation and to be exempt from company tax, when those companies pay dividends to Australian corporate shareholders. So, there are two elements to the measure. Companies which are genuinely doing active business overseas will not be expected to be liable to accruals legislation, but for those companies which are fiddling and hiding their taxation liabilities in Australia, it will be necessary for those liabilities to be repatriated to this country and for the tax to be paid in Australia. This measure secures the taxation base in this country and removes all of those previous incentives to hide interest bearing securities, to hide deposits, to have portfolio holdings of shares, perhaps to have rental property, copyrights, trademarks and trade agreements-which existed in other countries with low taxation levels and which indeed allowed those companies in Australia to avoid their taxation responsibilities. It is very portant that this be the case and, as the report concluded, in the past taxation in these circumstances was paid by negotiation, not by the law or the application of the law. That will be an important part of securing the taxation base. This is an issue that conjures up all sorts of emotions. Nobody likes to pay taxation. We all want to minimise it. However, we have to understand that, if we are going to live in this society and accept its benefits protections, we have an obligation to fulfil our taxation requirements. This legislation will not affect too many Australians-only some of. those people who might be in circumstances where they work for companies overseas or travel overseas. Indeed, accruals legislation is very important because it affects all Australians. The burden imposed by people who avoid taxation in this country falls on someone else, and the population in this country needs to understand that that is in fact the case. It is legitimate public policy to expect that the taxation base will be secure and broad and will catch within its net all those people who have a taxation liability. A child will look to mum and dad or to someone else when things go wrong; one of the signs of maturity is that one develops an attitude of responsibility, and I believe that that is necessary in Australia. It is too easy to blame someone else every time something goes wrong. Honourable members opposite may say that Australia's economic circumstances are the Government's fault. We would say that the economic circumstances which we face and which are severe have accrued over a long period of time. Perhaps there is some justice in both arguments, but there is no point in our sitting here trying to affix the blame; what we need to do is fix the problem. If one is going to fix the problem one has to accept some of the arguments that are legitimate about the way in which we find ourselves in these circumstances. It is exactly the same thing that needs to be considered when talking about pharmacists, for instance. Legitimate public policy says that taxpayers provide funding for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and what im- the Government says is that there needs to be control over that funding, that it needs to be at a reasonable level and that we cannot have it blowing out exponentially. In relation to the pilots dispute, I walked into the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots Dispute yesterday and heard Captain MCCarthy saying, 'We did not cause this dispute'. One may want to blame the Government for part of it or one may want to blame the airlines but, and on any analysis, for the suggestion to be made by Captain MCCarthy that his organisation did not conceive of and initiate the dispute is absurd. In the same way, a responsible attitude needs to be taken towards the way in which taxation policy is directed and determined in this country. No-one wants to pay tax. Lots of people would like to avoid it, but if someone avoids it someone else has to pick up their part of the burden. Last year we heard the facile concerns about Mr Bond, with people asking why he does not pay more tax. It seems very obvious why Mr Bond was not paying too much tax last year-because he did not make too many profits. If he loses $1 billion this year, I do not think he will have a very considerable taxation liability. Yet we hear all the facile concerns about the taxation system-a taxation system which in its integrity is much tighter than it was seven years ago. One has only to consider the rhetoric out there in the community. Tax avoidance is not on the front pages any more, and that is because the company taxation provisions, imputation, the end of double taxation of dividends, the fringe benefits tax, the end of the entertainment tax, the requirement for substantiation, the prescribed payments tax, and especially the capital gains tax have all played a part in tightening up the integrity of the taxation system. As long as the Opposition comes into this place and seriously purports to suggest that one should treat wages or interest that one receives-Mr Smith-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the matter before the House is the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2); the honourable member for Perth has ranged widely in his comments. The Bill has a narrow focus. For most of his speech the honourable member has been talking about international agreements. I would ask you, Sir, to ask the honourable member to come back to the Bill.",119
267,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,Mr MiIdren)-I would ask the honourable member to be relevant.,122
268,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Curtin ( Mr Rocher) raised the aspect of retrospectivity. I did not intend to speak about retrospectivity, but I will speak about it now, and I think that is fair because he raised the matter.",122
269,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,So long as it is relevant.,122
270,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes. The point I am trying to make is that if we are going to have a tight and fair taxation system we must treat wages, interest, dividends, rents and profits in exactly the same way as one treats a capital gain. After making adjustments for inflation, we have to treat a capital gain in exactly the same way, if the system is going to be fair. It is facile to say, as the Opposition does, that its Economic Action Plan will be an incentive to save and invest. It will be an incentive to avoid taxation. Bills such as the one before us are about making the taxation system fair and complete. Those opposite are about producing an incentive to avoid taxation liability. I know that many members on the other side of the House know very well in their heart of hearts that they are making a mistake in going ahead with their proposal. The element that I want to raise is the absolute unsustainability of an argument which says that such a proposal will provide an incentive to save and an incentive· to invest-because for five years it is retrospective. Are those opposite seriously purporting to suggest that they will change taxa,tion behaviour of individuals in this country retrospectively? Do they seriously suggest that they will change the savings pattern of Australians retrospectively? Mr Smith-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: again I raise the matter of bringing the speaker back to the basis of the Bill. We are operating under the guillotine, other members want to speak and time should not be wasted on wide-ranging debate on matters totally irrelevant to the Bill. If that occurs, members who want to speak on the Bill in a legitimate way will not have a chance to be heard this evening. We have other Bills to deal with and perhaps the honourable member for Perth could have some consideration for the honourable members who want to speak on those Bills.",122
271,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, we have until 10 o'clock, and indeed the previous speaker spoke for longer than I will speak even if I take all of my time. In any event, there are only two more speakers in the debate and so I think we have plenty of time. The point I am making is that honourable members opposite know they cannot sustain their argument in relation to taxation. I know that the honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) will not try to defend it. All I am saying is that the public needs to be informed about these things. There are legitimate differences in this place when it comes to public policy, but to open up avoidance, to open up loopholes, is something that we do not need here. The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2) that we are presently discussing is part of the mosaic that makes up a decently constructed taxation policy. It deserves our support. It has the support of both sides of the House. I only wonder at what could motivate honourable members on the other side of the House to introduce this other element to which I have alluded, which will destroy part of that decent, reasonable and fair taxation network that we have set up.",122
272,Mr WILSON ,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Sturt) (8.30)-I rise to take part in this debate on the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2). In doing so I make a very brief response to the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) to indicate that I will not take up the issues that he has raised-not because I do not have the answers but because I want to concentrate on the;: central focus of the implications for Australians of the form and nature of the international agreements that are being entered into at the present time. Over the past decade there has been much debate about reforming the tax system to make it more efficient, equitable and neutral. This reform has centred on the domestic tax base and has occurred at a slow pace. In the past, clever avoidance and evasion schemes have meant that Government revenue from taxation has been less than it should have been. In turn, this has necessitated an increase in the tax burden on ordinary Australian individuals and ordinary Australian businesses to offset the loss of revenue that has occurred in this way. Measures to make genuine reforms to the tax system have therefore been welcomed by most Australians, but many problems can still be identified. For example, there are inconsistencies in the way in which the tax system takes account of inflation. The capital gains tax, to which the honourable member for Perth referred, takes account of inflation and taxes the real capital gains only-that is, the capital gains adjusted for the effects before being taxed. To that extent it is relevant because some of these international agreements deal with the reciprocal arrangements that apply between two countries which have that form of taxation. On the other hand, interest income is taxed on a nominal basis. Similarly, no inflation adjustment is made for inventories for tax purposes; and the steps in the threshold and a significant number of tax rebates are not inflation adjusted, either. They are varied on an ad hoc basis but, because ad hoc action usually has a significant time lag, the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) ends up collecting far more in real terms before the adjustments are made, and then the adjustments may rarely, if ever, compensate for the huge windfall gains that governments achieve as a consequence of the non-inflation adjustment. At the same time, little has been done in our tax system to focus on the need for reform so that the system truly takes into account the capacity of individuals to pay, and I have spoken on this issue in other debates. Clearly, then, neither the personal nor the corporate income tax systems are perfect. Only when inconsistencies such as I have outlined and many others are eliminated will we achieve a tax system that is truly neutral and does not cause individuals and companies to distort their investment patterns. In the main, these issues concern the domestic economy. However, a significant distortion is now being caused by the failure of this Government adequately, effectively and speedily to make reforms in the taxation of people involved in international transactions. The question is: What about individuals and companies with these international involvements? It is quite clear that reforms are necessary in this area as well. Action must be taken to ensure that such individuals and companies bear a fair tax burden and do not evade and avoid this burden through the nature of their international trading and investment involvements. In this regard one might well ask what this legislation does. In spite of what the honourable member for Perth said about this being part of the broad mosaic of the present Government's purported tax reform, this legislation is just more of the same-more of the same form of agreement that we have been entering into of inflation decade after decade. Let us look at the need for entering into these agreements. We live in a world economy and, although it is true that most Australian taxpayers have their income sourced in Australia and are residents of Australia, an increasing number of individuals and business enterprises now have some international involvement. At the same time that that is occurring, an increasing number of foreign residents and foreign corporations are deriving income from Australian sources. So, this throws us back to an examination of some fundamental approaches to taxation. Essentially, there are two main approaches and the hybrid, the in-between. A country can use as its starting point for taxation the taxing of its residents. Alternatively, it can use as its starting point the taxation of all income sourced in this country. As I said a minute ago, the income of the great majority of Australians is sourced in this country and they are resident in this country. However, there is an important group of Australians who now derive income from overseas and foreigners who have a source of income in Australia. The double tax agreements are really agreements not for double taxation but, rather, to prevent double taxation of the same income. Secondly, they are used by the parties to the agreements to put in place tax legislation and administrative arrangements which are aimed at minimising tax evasion and tax avoidance. Thirdly, they are used by the parties to these agreements to share the tax take which is properly to be collected from taxpayers where they reside in one country and the source of their income is in another. So the two countriesthe one of the resident and the one of the source-get together and work out the tax take and how it will be shared. I interpolate here, before completing my list of the reasons why these agreements are entered into, to indicate that it is important that those two elements are remembered: the determination of the fair tax take and the determination of the fair sharing' between two different and competing tax regimes. One thing that these agreements fail to acknowledge-and one thing that the Government has failed to identify-is that in dealing with and developing these agreements and tacitly carrying on with dozens of other agreements entered into over the past 25 years we should have been tougher in the interests of Australian taxpayers to ensure that we get a fair share of the tax take paid by either non-residents or people who source their income in Australia. I will now identify the fourth point as to why these tax agreements are entered into. Perhaps this is the justification for the two new agreements we are considering tonight. It is interesting to note that the papers reveal that there are no revenue implications in this legislation at all. I presume that that means that there are no direct revenue implications. One could well ask the question: If there are no direct revenue implications, what are we on about? Why are we spending the time dealing with this issue? My view is that the agreements should have been far more favourable to Australia than they are. The fourth reason these agreements are entered into is that we want to try to provide a level of certainty in the trading and investment relationships that we have with the countries with which these agreements have been entered into and with the citizens of those countries. These agreements endeavour to smooth out the difficulties that arise as a consequence of the extent to which each of the countries may have different definitions of 'residence' and 'source'. It is not only a question of determining whether a country uses 'residence' or 'source' as the base for taxation. Different countries may both use 'source' but have different definitions of that word. They may both use 'residence' and find that they both classify the one person as resident in the two countries. So these agreements aim to try to sort out some of those difficulties. The contracting parties also try to smooth out the difficulties that arise from adopting residency or using the source of income as the primary basis of determining tax liability for this purpose. So that, in trying to relate the domestic Australian laws on taxation to the taxation of foreign investors in Australia, and trying to protect Australians who, as residents of Australia, sometimes derive income from sources overseas, we have to try to sort out whether we will use source or residential status. If it is a bit of each, we must decide how to arrive at the appropriate mix of the allocation of tax rights as between the countries with which we enter into these agreements. I will deal briefly with the history of these agreements. Australia's first agreement was entered into in 1946. Then, in 1967, the first of the modern genre of agreements was entered into. Quite predictably, they were both between Australia and the United Kingdom. That 1967 agreement has formed the foundation of all our subsequent agreements and my view is that this is like using in the and the 1990s a T-model Ford. We have not sufficiently analysed the· changing trading lationship; we have not examined the difference between our interests and the interests of the United Kingdom. In this sense, we need look only at the model tax agreement of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is often advanced as the agreement all countries should enter into. Of course, the OECD is an advanced, industrialised, highly capitalised, trading bloc. Its members are capital exporters. They have export know-how. Of course, they want a situation in which they can take the approach of 'residence' rather than 'source'. They even suggest that royalty payments should be exempt from source country tax. They are recipients of royalties and so they want their residents to get tax free income out of Australia, for example, so that they can impose their tax and lower the tax burden on Europeans. Our tax burden is higher because they make no contribution, notwithstanding that the source of their income is Australia. The United Nations and Andean models do, however, better represent the interests of capital importing countries. It is true to say that Australia generally has approached these agreements with some bias towards source country taxation. My plea to this House and, through this debate, to the Government is that it should take another look to see whether we are putting sufficient emphasis on source country taxation and, thereby, increasing the bias. The purpose of the rules that we want to enter into is to ensure that the country is empowered to exercise the taxing rights allocated to it under the agreements over the residents of other countries. We want to make sure that we, adopting a source country approach, exercise rights over residents of other countries who derive massive amounts of income from within Australia. Like the honourable member for Perth, I was on the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which brought down a report entitled Taxpayers or Taxplayers. That report examined the whole question of international profit shifting. We drew to the attention of the Parliament and 1980s Government that there was an important need to change. I fear from what I hear re- from Government spokesmen that the Government is just sitting back and saying that its new arrangements are going far enough. I do not think they are. They are a step in the right direction but they do not go nearly far enough. In that report, we drew the attention of the Government to the need for a closer examination of what is called functional analysis. That is a long expression and its meaning is hard for people to comprehend. Putting it another way, we are referring to a profit split. The aim is to determine how much of the profit of an enterprise is sourced out of Australia rather than out of the Cook Islands. The honourable member for Perth touched on the Bond institutions. He said that they were making a big loss this year, but raised the question whether they made a profit last year. That is not relevant to the point. They did declare a profit in the Cook Islands of $250m and more, and a loss of $250m in Australia. It seems to me in passing strange that breweries in Australia can make such a huge loss whereas, by the time they go through some financial shenanigans, they can make a profit in the Cook Islands. Therefore, one should look at the resources that corporations invest in Australia and ask whether sensible entrepreneurs would retain those investments if they were not returning an effective yield for the assets employed. We would apply this functional analysis or profit split approach where the sorts of questions asked are: What is done? What economically significant function was performed? What economic risk was assumed in this country? Who performed each function and assumed it? Were they here or overseas? What is the economic value of each function performed in each country? Are any valuable intangibles used? Who developed the intangibles and are they being paid for their use? I am not suggesting that the application of that approach will be easy, but a fairer outcome for the general body of Australian taxpayers would result if that approach were adopted. If it is not adopted, I predict that we will go on bleeding to foreign investors as a consequence of our current tax regime. That leads me to touch briefly on the withholding tax situation. At the moment we withhold tax at 15 per cent on unfranked dividends. On franked dividends, we effectively withhold tax because the company pays it at 39c in the dollar. I believe that we should be withholding tax on unfranked dividends at the same rate as we withhold it and hold it back on franked dividends. Then overseas investors in Australia would be paying at least as much in tax as Australians are paying on the same profit. The situation with interest is similar. The dividend withholding tax on that is 10 per cent. The dividend withholding tax on royalties is, I think, 10 per cent or perhaps 15 per cent. It does not matter; it is substantially less than the amount paid by a company at corporate rates. We find that the United States Government, under its tax regime, is now looking at the royalties that its companies are receiving. If it finds that the royalties, in its view, are not sufficiently high, it deems them to be higher and taxes them on the deemed rate. What does a company do? It increases the royalty which is taxed in Australia at 10 per cent. If that royalty were not paid out but retained in Australia, the expenses of the company would be less, its taxable profit would be higher and Australia would receive 39c in the dollar. It is quite absurd to allow these sorts of distortions in the tax system to continue for the benefit of foreign investors in Australia, when Australian investors are being taxed at such a very high rate. It might be said that that would not be fair. I believe that it would be. It may mean that we could reduce our general corporate tax rate and have a uniform withholding tax and corporate tax rate. That is the sort of thing we should do to prevent the competition between tax regimes, for that is what is occurring and will continue to occur, and it is what the Australian Taxation Office in its negotiations of these agreements has failed to identify. I hope that, as a result of what I have had to say and what other people are writing about, the Tax Office will become more vigorous in the interests of Australia so that we get a fair return both through the wages that are paid to people who are working for foreign investors in Australia and the tax that we collect out of their profits.",123
273,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Mountford)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. EmptyHere ister for Industrial Relations) (8.50)-in reply-I would like to thank those members who have participated in the debate on this very important legislation. Let me say that the comprehensive taxation agreements with Papua New Guinea and Thailand, which have been given the force of law by this Bill, will add to the list of such agreements already in force with 22 other countries. The amending protocols to the existing tax treaties with France and Singapore are also to be given the force of law by this Bill and will update those agreements in line with Australia's current tax laws and tax treaty practice. These types of agreements will provide a level of security about the tax rules that will apply particularly in relation to international transactions. They therefore remove an important barrier to trade and investment between the treaty partner countries. The Government is mindful of the positive contribution that such agreements thus make to Australia's international trade and other relations. It is therefore pleasing to endorse the agreements and protocols which are the subject of this Bill. As I said, I thank those honourable members on both sides of the House who participated in the debate on this Bill and I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. EmptyHere a third time.

274,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,MARINE NAVIGA TION LEVY,"Mr Mountford)-Order! I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Marine Navigation Bill 1989 cognately with'the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Bill 1989. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",127
275,Mr SHARP ,MARINE NAVIGA TION LEVY,"Gilmore) (8.54)-As you have just mentioned, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Marine Navigation Levy.Bill 1989 and the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Bill 1989 are being dealt with cognately. They have a specific purpose which, by the nature of the fact that they are cognate Bills, means that they are directly related to each other. They are specifically designed to redistribute the cost recovery processes that the Commonwealth applies to the provision of navigation aids, such as lighthouses and lifebuoys, for our shipping industry. I commence by saying that the Opposition does not oppose these two Bills that are being debated cognately this evening. Indeed, having studied the detail of the legislation, we support the Bills. In our own way in government, we would perhaps be doing things slightly differently but there is no doubt that we can support the Bills. The cost recovery process for navigational aids provided to the Australian shipping industry is very important. There is no question that, today, Australians should not be in the position where they should be subsidising the cost of these services. The services are provided to commercial shipping interests which are presumably in place not only to provide a service to Australian industry but also to provide a profit to the owners of those shipping services. It is for that reason that we on this side of the House believe that it is fundamental that any services provided to these industries are provided on the basis of cost recovery. So what this debate is fundamentally about is the redistribution of 1989 the burden for the collection of those cost recovery services. Some little time ago, an investigation was carried out by the Department of Transport and Communications. That Department was asked to look at a fairer way by which the cost recovery processes could be shared amongst all those people who benefited in a commercial fashion from the provision of navigational aids. The Department engaged, from within its ranks, the services of a number of people who had expertise and, over a reasonable period, put together these recommendations. The initial request for those investigations came from the national bulk container group which is composed of the proprietors of large bulk carrier ships, particularly the sorts of ships seen carrying such commodities as coal and iron ore. So the people who initiated this investigation of fairer ways of redistributing the recovery of the cost of providing these navigational aids were the larger shipowners in Australia. The Government set about implementing the results of the inquiry. It decided to reduce by some 20 per cent in practical terms the cost of navigational aid services to those larger vessels and, in order to ensure that the whole exercise was revenue neutral, if somebody paid less, somebody else had to pay more. It was felt by those people who carried out the investigation that the smaller vessels should pay a larger amount towards the cost of the services of navigation aids. So the smaller vessels are paying approximately 20 per cent more than they were and the larger vessels are paying approximately 20 per cent less. So, the people who initially instigated that inquiry and called for a reform of the process of cost recovery found themselves to be advantaged to the tune of about 20 per cent as a consequence of calling for that inquiry. To be fair to it, that group is still not satisfied with that redistribution of the cost for the provision of those services and indeed the National Bulk Carrier Group says that it would prefer the reduction in the fees that are charged to its members to be greater. I can understand that when a company is trying to run a very competitive business the opportunity to reduce costs in all areas is very essential. Companies that own and operate large vessels along the Australian coastline have done the best for their shareholders by trying to push the cost of these navigational services down to the minimum. In order not to place too great a burden on , anyone else the Government has decided, as , indeed has the Opposition, that the present format of cost recovery is the fairest one because the only way that we could proceed further to reduce the cost of these services to the larger vessels that ply up and down our coastline would be to bring into that cost recovery process such people as fishermen, small charter vessels and pleasure boats. We believe, as I am sure the Government believes, this was something that, at this stage, was not desirable and for that reason the Opposition is prepared to support the Government on this particular matter. In the process of debating these issues, the whole issue of our Australian shipping service comes to the fore. Coastal shipping is one of those industries in which the Government claims to have made some reforms over the last 12 months. Those reforms have taken many years to bring into being and they have been questioned by large numbers of people who have an interest in seeing micro-economic reform implemented in this country. and that micro-economic reform, of course, is ultimately designed to reduce the cost of shipping services and therefore enhance Australia's economic potential. The whole of this legislation gives us some opportunity to talk about Australia's coastal shipping services in a way that enables us to discuss the very viability of those services, because the charges that are to be altered through this legislation come to the very core of the viability of Australia's coastal shipping services. It is not just the cost of navigational services that affect the viability; it is a whole range of other issues. Tonight the Opposition has taken the opportunity to speak not only about the cost recovery processes for navigational aids to shipping, but also about the coastal shipping services of Australia generally. For that reason we want to make a broad-brush mention of some of the problems facing Australia's coastal shipping services. As I mentioned a few moments ago, the Government has engaged in some reform of those coastal shipping services. One reason the Government has endeavoured to do that is that it is well recognised that Australia's coastal shipping services are inefficient. Indeed, not so long ago the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC), in one of its investigations, identified that the current inefficiencies within our coastal shipping services cost the Australian economy up to $550m a year. Various estimates that the Industries Assistance Commission engaged in indicate that the cost of Australia's coastal shipping services is between 20 to 50 per cent above what it should be if reforms of a proper nature were implemented. It is for those reasons that Australia's shipping services are a cause for great concern amongst manufacturers, processors and retailers throughout Australia. Because the high cost of Australia's coastal shipping services exists, the coastal shipping industry does not get the sort of trade that it deserves. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) would appreciate the difficulties that Australia's road system suffers as a resUlt of the tremendous increase in heavy vehicle traffic going up and down Australia's highways these days. One reason heavy vehicle traffic has increased by such a large amount over the last few years is simply that Australia's coastal shipping services are not as cost effective, efficient or reliable as they should be. For that reason manufacturers, processors and retailers in Australia put commodities which could quite easily and cheaply be transported by coastal shipping services onto heavy vehicles on the highways. For that reason there is a higher burden on Australia's road system than there should be, and so we need to look at ways in which we can reform Australia's coastal shipping services, not only to make the coastal shipping industry more viable, but also to try to get some of that heavy traffic off Australia's highways and onto our coastal shipping services, thus reducing the costs of maintaining the highways and reducing the damages, injuries and deaths that occur on the roads. As everyone has seen over the last few months, there is no doubt at all that heavy vehicles are a major contributor to the number of deaths and injuries occurring on Australia's highways, so it is terribly important to look at reducing the incidence of those injuries. One of the ways of doing that is to have a more efficient coastal shipping service. Despite the Australian coastal shipping services enjoying the benefits of cabotage, the Australian coastal shipping services have actually been declining in number over the last few years. Not many people understand the meaning of the word 'cabotage', but basically what it means is that we deny foreign competition on Australian coastal shipping services so that, except for very few and specific circumstances, the only vessels that are allowed to ply the Australian coastline are Australian flag vessels operating under very tight, union-dominated rules and terms and conditions of employment. Despite the protection from foreign competition for Australia's coastal shipping services, the Australian coastal fleet has actually been declining in number. That raises this question: if we are protecting our fleet from foreign competition and it continues to decline, what on earth is going on? When one asks that question, one needs to get very well-informed answers. If we are to have a proper debate on matters relating to Australia's coastal shipping services, it is worthwhile to turn to the 1988-89 annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission, which was released only a week or so ago. It sheds some extremely bright light on the reasons why Australia's coastal shipping services are as inefficient as they are. I will take a few moments to read directly from that report and, in the process of doing so, I will endeavour to cast some light on why Australia's coastal shipping services are not as efficient as they should be. Page 41 of that report states: Notwithstanding the important efficiency gains which should flow from the coastal shipping reforms, the nature and pace of change may be inadequate to address current inefficiencies. For example, while the proposed reductions in crewing and berthing levels can be expected to result in cost savings, our overseas competitors are also reducing their operating costs. The main issue in assessing the effectiveness of the reforms is whether the competitiveness of Australian shippers will be improved relative to, say, OECD shipping operators. Australian flag ships are overcrewed compared with those of OECD shipping nations. The reforms aim to reduce average crewing levels on Australian flag ships to 21 crew by 1992. However, as the Commission noted in its coastal shipping report, OECD shipping nations operated with average crewing levels of 18 crew in 1985. Newer OECD ships have even lower crewing levels. More importantly, the total costs of crewing an Australian vessel are inflated by the leave provisions provided Australian seamen which are generous compared with those provided by OECD competitors. Because of these provisions, an Australian ship operator currently.needs to employ about 2.2 crew (on average) per berth to maintain year-round ship operations. The proposal to reduce this factor to 2.0 will do little to reduce Australia's crewing costs relative to overseas countries. Most OECD countries operate on crew-to-berth ratios of 1.5 to 1.7. If Australian industry generally is to benefit from the reforms, the cost savings must be passed on to users in the form of lower freight charges. However, there appears to be no guarantee in the strategy to ensure this outcome. Retention of the cabotage policy means there will be no effective competition from foreign vessels in the coastal trades to act as a discipline on costs. The proposed changes to the SVP and CVP systems may well increase the availability of shipping services to users. However, it seems unlikely that the arrangements will offer much scope for real competition because price has unequivocally been rejected as a criterion. The systems have failed in the past because consultation has implied a power of veto by unions, but more importantly, availability of a suitable Australian ship has been the sole criterion. So long as the permit systems disregard freight rates as a criterion, they will do little to improve industry competitiveness. While cabotage policies may be quite common among our major trading partners, this in itself is no reason for Australia maintaining such a stance. Australia is unique in its virtual dependence on shipping to transport its exports and imports, its dispersed locations of economic activity and the long-distance freight haulage task necessitated by its isolation from markets. These features make it vital that Australia has access to the cheapest and most efficient transport system. The inefficiencies on the waterfront and lack of competition in the provision of shipping services remain major impediments to a competitive Australian shipping industry. Those words, which I have drawn directly from the annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission, reflect very badly on Australian coastal shipping services and on the way in which this Government has attempted to reform the Australian coastal shipping industry overall. One could say that those criticisms could be extended to the way in which this Government has tried to reform the waterfront. I believe all credible commentators would find that the reforms on the waterfront that have been talked about over the last few months are totally inadequate. Indeed, a large number of people who had expected, from the words of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the words of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) at the latter stages of last year, major changes as a consequence of reform on the waterfront have been severely disappointed. What we talk about tonight in reducing charges to our Australian coastal shipping services is an tempt by this Government to reduce the cost of those services. It is an attempt which this Opposition is prepared to support. However, we believe that it does not go nearly far enough towards ensuring that Australia has an efficient coastal shipping industry. If we are to have such an efficient service, we need to do a number of things. If we do those things, then the cost of navigational aids is really quite irrelevant to the argument. Australia will have an efficient coastal shipping industry only if we are prepared to remove cabotage. By removing cabotage we will allow foreign competition to enter our coastal shipping services. Allowing foreign competition to enter those services, will result in freight rates for shipping services around the Australian coastline dropping by up to 50 per cent on average. That is not a bad reduction. Indeed, the absence of foreign competition from our coastal shipping industries is a very high price for Australians to pay for the maintenance of cabotage. Whilst the Opposition supports the legislation, it does so with the words of concern and disappointment that I believe all people who are credible-all who are concernedwithin the shipping industry of Australia would also like to express. We believe that the Government is not going far enough in its reforms of coastal shipping and not going nearly far enough in its reforms on our waterfront. As a consequence, Australia's exporters, Australia's manufacturers and Australia's primary producers are being sold short. As the lAC says in the very first sentence of its annual report for last year, we are to prosper, the economy must become more productive. If we are to become more productive, we have to have a more efficient coastal shipping industry, a more efficient waterfront, more efficient railways and more efficient road services. But ultimately, in order to achieve those efficiencies, we must have a government which is prepared to look at the issues in a dispassionate fashion, a fashion which will ensure that vested interests are not catered to and that the overall best interests of the Australian people are catered to first and foremost. I am afraid to say that, under the Government, in the areas of transport those Australia-wide interests are not catered for first at- and foremost. What we have, and continue to have, is a maintenance of the status quo, maintenance of vested interests and, indeed, maintenance of inefficiencies, which will lead Australia not down the path of improving prosperity but down the path of decreasing prosperity. As the lAC suggests in its annual report, if we can make efficiencies within our coastal shipping services, our waterfront, our rail services, our aviation services and our road services, an extra $9,000m a year can be added to the gross domestic product of Australia. Purely by improving the efficiency of our waterfront by 20 per cent, we can add $l,lOOm a year to the gross domestic product of Australia. In this Bill we are talking not just about that fundamental issue of who will pay the cost of maintaining the lighthouses; we are talking about the very future prosperity of Australia. The industry that we are talking about in this legislation is one of the stumbling blocks, one of the log jams, for Australia's more efficient producers and manufacturers. While these inefficiencies remain in place, we will not have an efficient manufacturing industry, we will not have efficient primary producers and we will not have, as the lAC points out in its annual report, an economy which is becoming more prosperous, and, as a consequence, an improved standard of living.",127
276,Mr LINDSAY ,MARINE NAVIGA TION LEVY,"Herbert) (9.14)-After listening to the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp), I just wonder where he has been residing over the past few years and particularly during the 33 years prior to if the Hawke Government's being elected. He does not seem to have read the newspapers of that era; he does not seem to understand that the last annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission refers specifically to the failure of the Liberal and National parties to deal with waterfront reform, shipping reform and transport reform, both land and air, in this country. Yet he is a sincere man. I am sure that he believes in what he says, but there is a sense of naivety about his speech tonight. It is a source of puzzlement to me that he could stand up in this House and utter the words that he did. It was his Government that baulked at the challenge of waterfront reform, baulked at the challenge of shipping reform-it did nothing about that whatsoever-and was prodded to introduce land transport reform. I am quite surprised that he could stand in this House this evening and, even by way of suggestion, chastise the Hawke Labor Government for not quickly addressing the challenges that face Australian transport. The Marine Navigation Levy Bill is very specific in its purpose. It deals first of all with raising a levy to replace the light dues that were imposed under the Lighthouses Act and the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Bill deals with the administrative arrangements for the collection of the levy. Under the Lighthouses Act 1911, the Commonwealth provides marine navigation aids to facilitate the safe and efficient coastal movement of commercial vessels engaged in trade and commerce. The navigation aids are financed by light dues paid by commercial shipping. The Marine Navigation Levy Bill introduces a new and more equitable formula for the collection of Commonwealth light dues by way of a levy from commercial shipowners for the navigational services provided to them by the Commonwealth, as is set out in the explanatory memorandum. These new arrangements will be of particular benefit to large bulk ore carriers, which carry the greater part of Australia's exports. The Commonwealth operates an extensive network of marine navigational aids around the coast of Australia. The annual cost of providing this service is approximately $37m, and this expenditure is recovered in full from commercial ships entering or operating in Australian waters through the paying of light dues which, since 1915, have been collected on behalf of the Commonwealth by the A1Jstralian Customs Service. In 1915 the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the operation of a network of coastal lights and other marine navigational aids around the coast of Australia. From the time that the Commonwealth assumed this responsibility, it was always intended that the shipowners should meet the whole cost of operating lighthouse services. The Lighthouses Act 1911 provided for the collection of light dues to pay for the lighthouse services and in 1915 the rate was 8d a net registered ton payable each three months. Since that time the Commonwealth has used the Lighthouse Act of 1911 to determine and collect light dues to provide navigational aids for the shipping industry of this country. As a consequence of the recent High Court decision in Air Caledonie International v. the Commonwealth, doubt has been expressed by legal authorities as to the constitutional validity of this method of raising revenue for this purpose. This Bill alters the basis of calculating the method of raising such revenue. As the Minister said in his second reading speech: Under the new formula as set out in the Bill, the navigational aids levy per net registered ton is reduced as the tonnage increases. Smaller vessels will pay slightly more but bigger ships will save several thousand dollars each year. Light dues have remained constant since 1983, which means that in real terms there have been ongoing savings to the industry over recent years. The new formula, which is more fair and appropriate to all sections of the commercial shipping industry, has been developed in consultation with the industry, as stated by the honourable member for Gilmore. I observe that since 1973 Federal government policy has been to recover full costs of the marine navigational aids network from the commercial shipping industry. Prior to 1973, government recovered only 80 per cent of the cost of the navigation aids service from commercial shipping. The remaining 20 per cent was regarded as a government contribution, not only as assistance towards the cost of building and maintenance but also covering non-commercial users such as the fishing industry, pleasure craft and the government's own non-commercial ships. The new rates of levy in this Bill have been designed to be revenue neutral. As the navigation aids are used only by the maritime community, it is obviously inconsistent with the user-pays principle that the Australian taxpayers should be called upon to subsidise this service. Furthermore, the Government has, quite properly, rejected the suggestion that fishing vessels, pleasure craft and Royal Australian Navy vessels be subject to the levy. The Navy already makes a significant contribution through the work of the Hydrographic Office and pleasure craft and fishing vessels do not diminish the utility of the navigational aids for the commercial shipping industry. In any event, the system of charging light dues has historically been based on the notion of earning capacity, and regulations under the Lighthouses Act 1911 already exempt these vessels from light dues. I understand that regulations under this legislation will provide exemptions similar to those that obtained under the Lighthouses Act 1911. The review of light dues which has led to the introduction of these Bills followed claims by the National Bulk Commodities Group of excessive costs and inequities in the current arrangements for the provision of marine navigation aids and the collection of light dues. As the honourable member for Gilmore has already alluded to, these claims were investigated by the Government, which had extensive consultations with the shipping industry. It was generally considered that charges should continue to be based on net registered tonnage. This was seen as the most practical and equitable basis to assess light dues. This method of determining charges is accepted practice in most countries that charge light dues. I should add that charges based on net registered tonnage is a method generally accepted by the shipping industry. The new levy comprises a sliding scale of charges by tonnage which relieves the burden at the top end by 20 per cent while increasing it at the bottom end by 20 per cent. There is no change in charging formula to vessels in the middle tonnage levels and, as the Minister said in his second reading speech, the new formula will be of particular benefit to large bulk ore carriers, which carry, in terms of tonnage, the greater part of our exports. The vast majority of the shipping industry has concluded that a charge based on net tonnage offers an approximation of the benefits obtained by vessels from the use of the navigational aids system. The management of the Australian marine navigational aids system is administered on a consultative basis. The shipping industry is involved in decisions through its membership of the Maritime Services Advisory Committee on Navigational Safety. Indeed, no significant change is made to the system without the proposal being discussed by that Committee. The provision and maintenance of marine navigational aids along Australia's coast is a challenging task. Australia has about 37,000 kilometres of coastline extending from the tropic to the Roaring Forties. Not only are the physical conditions different but so, too, are the traffic types and densities. For example, on the north-west coast of Australia large bulk carriers dominate traffic, but on the south-east coast and in Bass Strait traffic consists predominantly of general cargo and container ships. The conditions in the Torres Strait and Great Barrier Reef are completely different: relatively large ships operate in shoal waters and very narrow channels and strong tidal streams. These varying conditions require the Commonwealth to operate marine navigational aids which vary in type and capability and which are specifically designed to meet the requirements of the area concerned. As of June last year, 1988, the Commonwealth operated approximately 350 marine navigational aids, which included visual aids and electronic aids. In recent years the Commonwealth has upgraded its extensive network of aids along the Barrier Reef and Torres Strait. In 1985 navigation aids were installed along the new charted passage through the Great Barrier Reef north-east of Mackay. Costing more than $5m, Hydrographers Passage, as it is known, provides a more direct route to Asian and north Pacific markets for coal export ships departing from Queensland ports. This, in turn, results in savings in shipping costs due to reduced steaming times. I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works which conducted a hearing in Mackay into the proposal to establish those visual and electronic aids in Hydrographers Passage. The submission from the coal industry was that it was absolutely necessary to provide aids which would result in Australia saving millions of dollars in steaming time. The Government has provided a more extensive network of aids in Torres Strait. Because of the shallow water, reef shoals and complex tidal flows, Torres Strait has the highest concentration of marine navigational aids in Australia. These aids include a network of radio operating tide gauges-the only such system of its kind in the world. The extensive network of marine navigational aids throughout the length of the Great Barrier Reef has been largely designed to ensure, as much as possible, the safe navigational requirements of bulk carriers and other large commercial ships. Indeed, of the total of approximately 350 Commonwealth marine navigational aids, nearly one-third are located in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait areas. The installation and maintenance costs of these aids are generally higher than for similar aids in most other parts of Australia. This issue was a source of contention when the Government investigated the issues with respect to the development of a new levy procedure. For some years past real costs of operating the marine navigation aids systems. including the provision of new capital items, have fallen. Over the past five years light dues have not increased in real terms and this is a consequence of the effective use of modern technology and good management practices. The provision in the Bill to restrict levy increases to a maximum of 15 per cent per annum is recognition of the need to ensure that revenue raised is reasonably related to the provision to the industry of the necessary marine navigational services. This Bill is further evidence of this Government's commitment to reconstruction of the shipping industry and of its determination to ensure that Australia has a shipping, air and land transport system which will serve this nation as efficiently as possible. commend the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown), for his initiative in pursuing this legislation so that Australia has the legislative framework to ensure, first, that there is no challenge to the collection of the levy and, secondly, that the levy is at a sufficient level to ensure that the navigational aids that we have on our extensive coastline will protect commercial shipping, upon which this country relies so desperately. I hark back to my opening remarks. I invite the honourable member for Gilmore to take the time to investigate the history of shipping and rail transport in this country and particularly to note the failure of the Liberal and National parties to embark on reform of those industries and to keep those industries at a level which matches the expertise and efficiencies that have developed in other parts of the world. I invite him to then return to this chamber with suggestions and proposals as to how the Australian transport system can be improved, and then the matter can be debated. During Question Time today the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) alluded to the problem which has been faced by the Opposition in its failure to develop policies and proposals. He referred to the Bourbon syndrome whereby the Opposition has apparently learned nothing and forgotten nothing. Despite the fact that I have the utmost respect for the honourable member for Gilmore, at no time during his speech tonight on this important piece of legislation did he take the opportunity to put forward what the Opposition would do on these critical issues of economic and structural reform in this country. I hope that the honourable member accepts my words in good spirit and will at the first available opportunity bring into this House those proposals which he thinks will help this country. If he does that it will be a milestone because, from my thorough investigation of transport issues in this country, which goes back to Federation, I can assure him that he will be the first member from the Opposition side to introduce such policies in this House.",130
277,Mr ROBERT BROWN ,MARINE NAVIGA TION LEVY,"Charlton-Minister for Land Transport and Shipping SupI port) (9.32)-1 do not wish to spend a great deal of time responding to some of the issues that have been raised, but I would like to respond to a number ()f matters raised by the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp). But, firstly, I wish to express my appreciation for the comprehensive, thorough and profound interest in and understanding of questions of transport operation and development in Australia and of transport development as an important service and economic function around the world, on the part of the honourable member for Herbert ( Mr Lindsay). The speech presented by him is one which I would commend to anyone who is interested in the nature, the significance and the purpose of this legislation and the undoubted success of it. The honourable member for Herbert always makes outstanding contributions to debates in this chamber. The one that he just presented was, to my mind, one of the best. It was profound and thorough and, as I said, I commend it to anyone who is interested in the legislation. He indicated the importance of the legislation and the fact that we operate navigational aids around Australia on a complete cost recovery basis. Those 350 navigational aids situated around the great length of coastline of Australia are paid for by commercial shipping. Unquestionably, they also provide a very important function for pleasure craft and fishing vessels. But it charge on commercial shipping. As the honourable member for Herbert indicated, prior to this legislation there was a standard charge of 53c per net registered ton for commercial shipping on a quarterly basis. Quite clearly, that imposed an unnecessarily unfair burden on the big bulk carriers. The idea behind this legislation is to reduce that burden. The Government has established a sliding scale from 33c per ton through to 63c per ton. As was recognised by the honourable member for Gilmore and the honourable member for Herbert, that would represent an increase of about 20 per cent for the small tonnage vessels and a reduction of about 20 per cent for the large vessels. For example, a 200-ton vessel will pay an increase of about $20 a quarter. The largest vessels, of over 70,000 tons, will pay almost $7,000 less per quarter. Vessels of about 25,000 tons will pay about the same. The Government established this sliding scale to reduce the burden on the larger bulk carriers and, to compensate, to increase it for the smaller vessels. The honourable member for Herbert also indicated the importance of the Industries Assistance Commission report which identified the failure of the Opposition parties to deal with these general issues. That brings me to one of the points made by the honourable member for Gilmore. I endorse the comments made by the honourable member for Herbert in connection with the honourable member for Gilmore. The honourable member for Gilmore does take a serious and a very fair approach to these issues. However, he referred to Australian coastal shipping as being inefficient. I think that fact has been fairly well recognised. The reasons for that inefficiency are not simply those that were referred to by the honourable member. I am not saying that he or members of the Opposition today can necessarily be held responsible for the very serious deficiencies that have existed in this area in the past as a result of coalition governments. For 30 of the 33 years before the Hawke Government came into office in 1983, there was a coalition government. We have to recognise this; I think the honourable member for Gilmore would recognise it. I think he would be just as critical of those coalition governments as is a we are. They have an appalling record of sloth lack of concern and lack of commitment about increasing inefficiencies, and not only in the area of transport in Australia. We came into government in 1983. The most dramatic changes that have ever been introduced into coastal shipping and into waterfront reform in the history of the Commonwealth have been introduced by this Government. Now that we have put them in place we are told by the Opposition that we acted too late and did too little. We have done it in six years. The previous coalition governments did nothing in 30 of the previous 33 years, which is an appalling record. When this Government came into office the crewing levels on coastal vessels numbered 33 to 34 per vessel. We have reduced that number to 21, and we have done it in six years. In time it will be reduced even further. We are now down to the level of our Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development competitors. That is a quite remarkable change, and we have done it with the support and cooperation of the industry, the commercial interests involved in the industry and the assistance, cooperation and endorsement of the unions. I think it has been a quite remarkable achievement. Certainly, we seek to go further and we will go further. All of the parties know that we will, and must, go further in the development of those improved efficiencies. As far as the waterfront is concerned, the honourable member for Gilmore said that reform over the last few months has been totally inadequate. Let me say that over the last few months and over the last few years there have been significant, major reformsreforms which will compound as a result of the commitment of this Government and of the industry, both the corporate and union interests in the industry. The Opposition says that reform over the last few months has been totally inadequate. Reform over the previous 30 years was appalling. It was nil. At least there has been reform and a commitment to reform right through the Australian economy. It flows over onto the waterfront and into coastal shipping. I want to make an observation about one other reference that was made by the honourable member for Gilmore. He said that the only way to have more efficient coastal shipping is to abandon cabotage. He correctly indicated that cabotage reserves coastal shipping to Australian flag vessels. There has been a relaxation of the application of the single voyage permits that we used to have for foreign vessels to operate on the coast when Australian flag vessels were not available or, for other reasons, could not be made available for a particular purpose. That has been extended with the more extended voyage permits which can be provided now. But Australia is not alone in the operation of cabotage. All countries of the world exercise cabotage. The United Kingdom has just recently extended the operation of cabotage. We recognise and accept that coastal shipping is essentially the same as any other type of domestic industry. If we say that coastal shipping is inefficient because we will not allow foreign competitors on to our coast, that is no different from our saying that any other industry in Australia might have inefficiencies with a lack of competition because we will not allow foreign work forces to be brought into compete. The honourable member for Gilmore made it perfectly clear that the Opposition would abandon cabotage along the Australian coast. This Government, the Labor Government, has indicated that we will do no such thing. We recognise coastal shipping as one of our domestic industries. We are not going to bring in cheap labour to man the mines, to man the farms, to operate the factories, to operate our commercial and financial undertakings in Australia or to work the Australian coast. We make that perfectly clear. I am disappointed and concerned that· the Opposition would indicate an intention on its part to do that. The implications of that are serious indeed. The Shipping Industry Reform Authority and the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, under their respective chairmen and with the commitment, cooperation and participation of all those interested in the industry, are now putting together significant reform programs. I appreciate the contribution that was made by the honourable member for Gilmore and the commitment he brings to the responsibilities that he has as Opposition spokesman in this area. I again particularly commend my friend and colleague the honourable member for Herbert for the profound and thorough exposition he gave of the nature, the importance and the purpose of this legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Robert Brown) proposed: That the Bill be now read a third time.",133
278,Mr SMITH ,MARINE NAVIGA TION LEVY,"Bass) (9.44)-1 want to say a quick word about a matter that was not raised by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) in his summing-up. I did not fully hear the speech of my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp)-and a very good speech it was-or the speech of the honourable member for Herbert ( Mr Lindsay). One of the issues that this Minister's predecessor raised about improvement in the maritime industry was the need for . greater training and greater skilling of the Australians involved in coastal operations and in international shipping. One of the activities that he undertook, and it enjoyed strong bipartisan coalition support, was the new arrangements and encouragement for the training courses that are operated by the Australian Maritime College, the pre-eminent training authority of maritime people in this nation. It is no coincidence that I rise to speak about .that college, given that it is in my electorate; but there is another matter that I should raise, and this is an appropriate Bill on which to raise it. The college started some 12 years ago, again with bipartisan support, including strong support by former member for Bass and former Deputy Prime Minister Lance Barnard and, more particularly, by my immediate predecessor, Mr Kevin Newman. The man who started that college and who has been its Principal until last week, for some 12 years, has resigned and is leaving Australia to take up a post at the World Maritime University in Scandinavia. To Captain Dan Waters I am sure that I can extend on behalf of the House our congratulations for the exceptionally good work that he did in that pre-eminent, pathfinding role to establish the first Australian national maritime college. All of us in this place are indebted to him for the work that he undertook. He has put Australia on the map in terms of maritime training. The college receives many students from all over the Pacific and elsewhere. I We owe him and the staff who have supported him for such a long period a great deal of gratitude for the work that they have done. The issues of multiskilling of our maritime work force are exceptionally important and, regardless of the matters the Minister raised with regard to cabotage, which obviously I disagree with, in the time that I have spent at that college-I gave some visiting lectures on maritime law there from time to time. I have always been encouraged and impressed by the quality of its work. This Parliament always ought to be seen to be supporting that level of expertise in the training of something which is very dear to this nation if we are to be a successful trading nation. Perhaps the Minister will take the opportunity to join me in these remarks.",135
279,Mr ROBERT BROWN ,MARINE NAVIGA TION LEVY,"Charlton-Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support) (9.48)-in reply-I am delighted to be able to do so. I appreciate the very generous and warm comments of the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith). The honourable member has always indicated his pride in the fact that the Australian Maritime College is located in his electorate and has always been a very firm supporter of the college. I appreciate his reference to the work of Captain Dan Waters and I am sure that the Principal of the college appreciates it as well. I also express my appreciation to officers of the Department for their preparation of this legislation, for the advice which has been available to me and my office in the preparation of the legislation and for all of the background work which is necessarily involved on the part of departmental officers in canvassing issues of this kind with the industry and in ensuring that the terms of the legislation that is put together are adequate for the purposes that we seek to achieve and in ensuring that we are able to reconcile what are very often conflicting interests within the industry. I would appreciate it if the officers of the Department who are here would also convey my appreciation to their colleagues. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time.

280,Mr SMITH ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Bass) (9.50)-On behalf of the Opposition, as spokesman in this place on environment matters, I am pleased to debate tonight the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill which was introduced by the Government some little while ago, having been presented by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories ( Mr Holding, who is at the table. Before coming to some of the amendments which will be circulated in my name, one being a second reading amendment and two others having to be dealt with in committee, which I will talk about in some detail as we go through this debate, I would like first to talk a little about the Australian Heritage Commission, what it does and how it was established. It was established by an Act of Parliament back in 1975. The reason I say this is that I think it is important, in terms of the comments that will be made during this debate, that one appreciates exactly what this Commission is charged with doing and some of the history surrounding it. It was set up in 1975 following a major public review conducted by the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Hope. Its charter is to administer National Estate matters and to oblige all Commonwealth agencies to act in such a way as to ensure maximum possible conservation of all items in the National Estate. It comprises a part-time chairman and up to six part-time commissioners. The Bill gives effect to the changes to the operations of the Australian Heritage Commission announced by the Minister in November 1988. It implements all the major recommendations of the Hodges review of 1979, a review carried out by the former member for Petrie, concerning the operating procedures of the. Commission. A subsequent review in 1985 by the then Minister for the Arts, Heritage and Environment, the honourable for Robertson ( Mr Cohen), forms the basis of the Bill. The amendments proposed seek to clarify and improve the Commission's operation; in1989 clude in the Act powers for the Commission to administer the National Estate grants program; delete a subsection which discriminates against Aboriginal sites-as the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, I am pleased to see that-exempt self-governing territories and Australian Airlines Ltd from the requirements of the Act; and make certain administrative changes. The coalition will not be opposing the Bill, although we will be moving a second reading amendment and also amendments in the committee stage, which I will talk about in due course. The coalition does support the National Estate concept. Indeed, the Hope inquiry, in part, was certainly supported by us. Despite the problems arising from the Government's indecision and changes in relation to National Estate matters, as I said, the coalition fully supports the concept of the National Estate and the work of a commission reformed under a coalition government. As defined in the Act, those places that are part of the National Estate must be components of natural or cultural environment that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations, as well as for the present community. Thus the National Estate may include, for example, national parks, nature reserves, Aboriginal rock art sites, sacred sites, historical and archaeological sites and historic buildings and structures. It is important to note that the Bill only binds the Commonwealth. There are no direct legal constraints on· owners of private property, or on State or local governments, caused by the entry of a place in the Register. The Act requires a Commonwealth Minister, department or authority to inform the Commission of any proposal which may affect the National Estate and prevents actions which adversely affect, as part of the National Estate, a place in the Register unless the authority is satisfied that there is no feasible and prudent alternative and that all measures that can reasonably be taken to minimise the adverse effect will be taken. As I said, the Opposition supports the main aims of the Commission, which have been enunciated before, but for completeness they are: to prepare and maintain a register of National Estate places; to provide advice to the relevant Minister on matters relating to the National Estate; to provide advice to other Ministers and government authorities on government proposals which may affect the National Estate; and to develop policies and programs for research, professional training and public information and education. Thus the Commission's role is to identify and to advise. I want to underline that point-it is to identify and to advise. It has no powers of intervention. It is the Government which must make decisions on issues involving the National Estate and which must .be held responsible for those decisions. It is governments which act on that advice. Indeed, as I will talk about later on, there has been some controversy about the action in regard to that advice. The amendments that have been circulated-I refer particularly to the second reading amendment that the Opposition is proposing-pick up much of proposed amendments from the Government. We do go further to make some other points in our second reading amendment. We think that there should be a far greater role for the States and the Commission; we think that action to deal with the present backlog of existing nominations needs to be addressed; importantly, there needs to be the development of mechanisms to consider the economic impact of the Commission's decisions; the exemption of Australian Airlines Ltd from the reach of the Act gives us concern, as does the unreasonable time-frame given for the notification of private owners. We believe that there should be a greater role for the States in national heritage matters. Those States without heritage legislation should be encouraged to develop such legislation. The Commonwealth should seek a measure of uniformity in procedures to identify and classify places on the National Estate Register. If such are agreed, nominations made by State heritage bodies could then be entered automatically on the national register. Such measures would avoid duplication of National Estate activity and, of course, resources. That is why we propose that the Australian Heritage Commission should be restructured so as to include representatives of the States and Territories. Indeed, my own State of Tasmania would be delighted if we had a continuing representative on the current Heritage Commission. The prevailing view in the Government is that the Commission should only have regard for heritage values in its listing process. We believe that there is a need to develop appropriate mechanisms to require the Commission to take into account the economic impact of its decision to list an item on the Register. We make that point in our second reading amendment. There is also a tremendous backlog of some 3,000 nominations, and in government we will attempt to catch up with that backlog by providing additional resources to the Commission and by freezing further nominations, except for special cases. In our second reading amendment we say that, as a matter of urgency, we need to clear up that backlog of outstanding nominations. Although the coalition is not opposing the Bill, we believe that the Government deserves to be condemned for misusing the National Estate listings for purposes far removed from genuine heritage issues. That is the nub of our objection. There is industry uncertainty over decision making. Perhaps the Minister is aware-if he is not, I am sure his colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), and certainly the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) and his junior Minister, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), would be aware-of the major Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd (ANM) fine coating papers proposal in Tasmania which needs to gain access to eucalypt hardwoods. That is what is required if that $600m-odd investment is to proceed. There is uncertainty about whether that resource will be there and whether or not access will be granted to National Estate areas. It is a little intriguing to see this Bill actually come to the House. It is almost as though it has picked up a few issues and been brought in, but it has not addressed the big issues which are: how far shollid the Heritage Commission be able to go and when will we finally sit down and sort out this issue of the economic and social impact of the listing of items in the National Estate? I think that this Bill fails to address those issues. That is the reason why the Opposition has this second reading amendment before the House. As I said, we are concerned that there is no requirement in the Bill to take into account economic and social consequences of listing; but, further, it does not address the issue and I think that this is also where the Government deserves to be condemned. It has misused the National Estate listing for purposes unrelated to genuine heritage issues and it has also failed-I think the Commission is guilty of this-to ensure adequate public understanding of the differences between National Estates areas and national parks. Indeed, there is great confusion in the public mind about the very different concepts of National Estate, what is meant by National Estate listing and how that interrelates. In fact, it does not totally interrelate at all, but in the public mind it appears that it does. Many of those items in the coalition's heritage policy, which was released last year, have not been addressed by the Government, but they are certainly items that we would want to raise in government. I think it is important that this opportunity be taken to set down some of these issues. We say in our policy that the Act will be amended to give the Commission a role in advising the Minister about grants made for National Estate purposes. However, while the coalition supports the work of the recipients of such grants, whether they be the Australian Institute of Architects, the National Trust, the Australian Museum, various historical associations, or the better known conservation bodies, we would in government bring a greater degree of ministerial scrutiny to the projects and groups funded. I think it is important that there be ministerial scrutiny of the granting of such funds. Our heritage policy also states that the Act will be amended to provide that a place may not be entered on the National Estate Register unless and until all reasonable steps have been taken to notify the owner or owners of such properties of the intention to enter such places in the Register and to advise them of their rights to object to or seek review of such a decision. While. we believe that the provision in the Bill, that if for some reason such notification in prescribed fashion is not given a listing may still take place, is undesirable, we do not see any alternative mechanism reasonably available. The Opposition has also stated that the Act will be amended to provide that any property owner whose property is listed or is proposed for listing shall have an unqualified right to inspect at no charge all papers or documents held by the Commission relevant to the nomination, assessment, evaluation and decision to list such a property. The Act will be amended to make it clear that no entry on to either the Register or the interim list may be made unless the property concerned has been publicly notified and steps taken to notify all relevant owners. This is particularly important for owners who do not realise that their property is going to be listed on the National Estate. Believe me, I have talked to people who have experienced this and they get one heck of a shock and become extremely indignant. Our policy is clearly supportive of the Commission and the concept of conservation of the National Estate. There are areas of concern. As I said, the role of the private individual is a concern, as are the listing requirements and the notification period and the fact that the role of the private sector in the preservation and conservation of the National Estate goes largely unrecognised. The outstanding contribution made by Amatil Ltd in its gift to the nation project, which involved restoring 13 historic properties throughout Australia, is a model to be encouraged. We believe that more can be done to foster and encourage this kind of private sector involvement. The capital gains tax that has been imposed on us by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has not been conducive to the protection of the National Estate. While donations of money are tax deductable, donations of land or property are not. The Hope National Estate Committee of Inquiry back in 1974 and many inquiries since have recommended a system of financial incentives for heritage conservation. We will review these taxation arrangements with a view to removing what we believe are impediments to the protection of the National Estate. Another concern of the coalition is the fact that all places, whether they be of large or small importance, are listed on the Register uncategorised. Our policy is that there will be two categories of places: first, those which are deemed essential and which must be preserved and, secondly, those which should be recorded and whose preservation is encouraged. The coalition has other concerns, two of which I will raise in the committee stage when we consider the amendments I will propose. I now turn to some of the comments that were made in the Minister's second reading speech and come back to the nub of the issue that I think is not addressed in this legislation, namely, the economic and social impacts as a consequence of listing. I think it is very regrettable that this Bill has been introduced into the House without this issue having been addressed. In his second reading speech the Minister said that there had been arguments that the economic significance ought to be taken into account. He said that these arguments are particularly ill-founded. The Minister said: The judgments required in registration decisions not and should be political. They should be objective and backed by expert scientific assessment. They are nice words but what has actually happened? I refer to the example of the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests area. The arguments started and it was decided that some of the areas ought to be registered part of the National Estate. Indeed, a large area subsequently was registered, on advice to the Minister, and the Minister accepted the advice-which goes back to the point that I made before. However, what hapthought pened there was that the advice did not take into account the economic and social implitype cations. So, the Helshain Committee of Inpriate quiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests was set up, a special about $3m, to look into the scientific assessment and the social and economic consehe quences of such listing. There was no mechanism within the herisuch tage listing procedures for those issues to taken into account and so an ad hoc apthink proach was taken and the Helsham inquiry was set up. Those of us who have been involved in these debates for some timereading and I have had this job as Opposition spokesman on the environment for some years now-remember the anguish that was felt by sawmillers and others who were part of the economic structure that relied on forests for a livelihood when the Commission did not take into account the economic· and social or industry points of view when addressing World Heritage values and assessing a case for inclusion on the Register. The Government has failed to address that issue here. In his second reading speech the Minister said that there should be objective and scientific assessment. What happened after Helsham? The Government recognised that there was a shortfall in the whole approach to addressing these issues and it set up the Resource Assessment Commission. That was done to formalise the Helsham inquiry procedures. The Government recognised that there needed to be a better way of addressing these issues, but it was still not prepared to put any changes in the Act in relation to the Heritage Commission. Based on .how I believe the Resource Assessment Commission will work, I think it will be under-resourced. It has a small secare retariat. I made the point when the Bill setting up the Commission was before the House that it is chaired by a lawyer. Eminent as he might be, in addressing issues of economic impact and social concern or industry points of view, I wonder whether it is appropriate to have a lawyer who has spent as most of his life in the law, and more recently, running the National Crime Authority. I think that was a regrettable decision. I think there were others. I do not cast aspersions on any individual, but I would have that, in considering resources, a geologist or a geographer, or someone in that of field would have been more approin that position. This is a matter of judgment, of course: but I think an opporinquiry, costing tunity was missed. My broader point to the Minister is that admitted in his second reading speech that a scientific assessment was needed of all issues. However, again the Government be has walked away from this issue. I do not the Resource Assessment Commission in itself is the answer, and neither does the coalition. That is why we say in our second amendment that there needs to be, at the stage of considering whether or not matters ought to be listed, some cognisance of the economic impact of the consequences of listing. Indeed, looking more closely at the September 1989 publication from the Australian Heritage Commission, one notes that it raises some of these issues. The issues that it spends most of its time talking about relate to the consequence of listing forest areas and what flows from that. As I said, it does not take into account the economic impact, but it does dismiss the arguments which have been put by industry and by the coalition and, indeed, which have been put in another form, although equally strongly, by the Minister for Primary Industry and Energy ( Mr Kerin). What was the debate about Coronation Hill all about? It was about a balanced approach; it was about taking into account everyone's interest in the development of resources. What happened there was that there was a rush to meet the green agenda without looking at the matter in a balanced way. I am concerned that if we have such a commission-and we have seen its track record-doing the things that have been done, without taking. into account the social and economic consequences, we would be allowing it to make decisions in isolation-with advice then given to a Minister. There is no integrated system. The best way to get that is to provide the Commission with the functions to allow it to take these matters into consideration. I was also interested in the following comment that I picked up in this publication: Although it has been argued that the Commission should only register small areas of site specific or localised areas perceived to have higher significance, for the reasons discussed above the Commission will continue to register large areas where appropriate to the National Estate values. There is a great deal of debate, as we saw with the Helsham inquiry, about whether or not large areas ought to be ascribed with National Estate values. My own view, based on the experience of what we have seen, is that the attempt to list large areas-and that takes in a lot of fringe areas rather than site specific areas, especially in regard to forests-gives the Commission a far wider ambit to list areas than was originally envisaged in the proposals which led to the establishment of this Commission in the first place. I think that area also needs to be addressed. Once again-and I refer to the ANM case-industry in Tasmania needs to know in advance, so that it can determine its investment decisions, what powers the Commission has and how far its reach is in determining National Estate values. I think the Eden decision is another one that the Government ought to be looking at more carefully. Again, that is why I find it a little bit intriguing that this legislation has come into this chamber tonight. I would have thought that some of these issues required far more consideration and detailed consultation with industry in an attempt to address the very basic points. It is all right to bring Bills into this House to tidy up little problems here and there, but primarily a government should be addressing the nub of these issues. . As most members on both sides of the House know, this Bill has been extremely contentious over a long period. The Government had the opportunity to consider this matter more fully, having had the experience of Helsham and the Franklin Dam in which the National Estate was involved. If we cannot get some of these issues right in this chamber when the opportunity presents itself, we will fail to uphold the underlying principles which support the National Estate and also we will fail the people who rely on jobs in the forests. Someone who is involved in the forests and who is not sure about the . reach of the Bill will concentrate his mind much more on what the Government should be. doing. I think tonight the Government value has failed those people. I do not think the Government has addressed the issues which are contentious in this area.. Once again, an opportunity has been passed by because all the Government wants to do is again rush through a bit of legislation under guillotine late at night.",137
281,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the Chair.,141
282,Mr SMITH,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Government is rushing the Bill through late at night without allowing the opportunity for a full debate and more particularly, without even having addressed the very contentious issue that still needs to be dealt with. The Opposition has done what it can in this debate to raise that matter and I only regret that the Government has not taken the opportunity. There is one other point that I would raise. At page 9 of his second reading speech the Minister says that there has been confusion between the Commission's role and what is meant by National Estate listing. He says: . . . has been deliberately and mischievously tered by some development interests opposed to Commonwealth Government actions to conserve the National Estate. That is patently not true. The people who have a vested interest in confusing this issue and using the National Estate listing in a nefarious way-they have not acted in a genuine way in accordance with the underlying principles of National Estate-to broaden the environmental agenda, have not been the development interests. The development interests are asking for some clearcut goals. They want to know what is involved and how far listing will go. The development interests want to know whether or not listing will be site specific or whether it will be broad. My own view is that it should be site specific, but one cannot get any sense out of the Government. Tonight, the Government had the opportunity to bring this issue to a head, to address it properly front on and to tell us exactly how far it would go with the Commission. That statement by the Minister is patently untrue. Development interests, as we saw with the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) and Coronation Hill, are not directly related to National Estate but the same principles apply. They want some certainty. They thought they had certainty and so did the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin). We saw a genuine approach to the issue of environment concern. But what happened? In my role as Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I am bound to say that we saw an unholy alliance between Aboriginal activists and environmental activists who acted to the economic detriment of this nation. It was a disgraceful decision. But only one Minister had the guts to stand up and say so. Thank goodness he did, because it gave a bit of heart to some of us who want to see a balanced and a sustainable development approach to add value to our resources in a sensible way. However, only one man was prepared to stand up. Where is the person in the Government who will stand up and say that the same sensible approach should be taken to National Estate listing? The opportunity presented itself tonight. We could have addressed these issues tonight in this amending Bill, but fosthe Government did not take up that opportunity. The Opposition has addressed these issues. Tonight in my speech I outlined the Opposition's approach and policy and the things that should be included in this Bill so that we can give effect to the preservation of the National Estate-the genuine National Estate-and so that all people are notified about what is happening and fully understand what is going on. Tonight was a missed opportunity. It is a sad occasion in a sense. I know that we are running into an election period and these issues will remain unresolved until the coalition takes government early next year. I or someone else from the coalition will then have the opportunity to come in here and address these issues in a proper and balanced way to bring a little bit of sanity back into the whole National Estate area. For that reason I now formally move my second reading amendment. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: . 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: ( 1) is of the opinion that the Australian Heritage Commission should: (a) be restructured so as to include representatives of the States arid Territories; (b) develop mechanisms to allow it to consider and evaluate the economic impact of its decisions to enter places on the Register or Interim List of the National Estate; and (c) take steps, as a matter of urgency, to clear the backlog of outstanding nominations for the Register; and (2) condemns the Government for its misuse of National Estate Listing for purposes unrelated to genuine heritage issues and for the failure of both the Government and the Commission to ensure adequate public understanding of the differences between National Estate areas and National Parks'. I repeat: the Opposition supports the Bill. It is minor in its intent but the amendment I have just moved picks up some of the broader issues which the Government has failed to address tonight.",141
283,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr Miles-I second the amendment.,143
284,Mr KERR ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Denison) (10.18)-The honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith) made the prediction that when his Party forms government he or some other front bench member of that Party will be in a position to bring forward balanced environmental and development proposals. One of the ironies of this whole debate is that the very reason that neither he nor any other member of his Party is likely to be on the government side after any future election is that the Party that he represents has an appalling record when it comes to finding that appropriate balance between the environment and development. Indeed, if one looks at the fundamental underpinning of the position of the honourable member's Party, it is that it will not use the powers of the Commonwealth to protect the environment that is common to all of us as Australians. That approach comes from an unwillingness to take on some of the most conservative and reactionary State governments which are willing to use their local authority to disadvantage all Australians. This is a position that they do not seek to hide. The Opposition claims to be concerned about the environment, but its spokesmen, from Senator Puplick to the Leader of the EmptyHere on record as saying that they will not use mechanisms such as World Heritage listing to protect those parts of Australia which are subject to opposition from the States. .If one starts from that basic proposition, one finds that the Australian Government resiles from its fundamental position as a protector of the National Estate and of our World Heritage areas, and leaves the question of resource allocation to the lowest common element in the Australian political system-the corrupt and rapacious State governments. The honourable member for Bass mentioned the Helsham decision. I do not want to go back and traverse all the ins and outs of that case, but I know that my colleague the honourable member for Bass had the decency through most of that debate to remain conspicuously silent. He, amongst very few of his Liberal colleagues, understood the significance of the Southern Forests. I believe that there are people of significant decency on the Opposition side of politics, and amongst them. I certainly count the honourable member for Bass. I believe that his heart is very much on the side of protecting our National Estate. However, the party which he represents and for which he eloquently argues as an advocate is committed to tearing down the barriers that stand there to protect the environment and to permitting the exploitation of properties that are now listed as World Heritage areas in my State of Tasmania, in Queensland and in other parts of Australia. Without those barriers that the Australian Government has managed to erect against the most determined political resistance of State governments and Opposition parties generally, we can imagine the kind of economic despoliation that would be visited on Australia We would see the vandalisation of the Southern Forests in Tasmania and the destruction of the Queensland rainforests. We would see all kinds of vandalism sanctioned in the name of States rights, because underlying all the cant and hypocrisy coming forth from the Opposition is the fundamental premise that it will do nothing to stand in the way of the worse of the State governments, that it will not stand in the way of any government that would wish to destroy our national assets. The Australian Government's proud record in finding a way of reconciling the environment and employment is something for which the Australian people will judge us favourably. We need only look at what we have achieved in tandem: a job creation record of 1,600,000 new jobs since the Government came first into office and, at the same time, the protection against vandalism of some of the most important national assets of the country. That is a record of reconciliation, of finding an appropriate balance between the necessary protection of those who need to see economic development and progress and a proper concern for the environment. Although the Opposition seeks to dress up its abandonment of any willingness to stand in the way of the destruction of the environment and say that in some way it has some credentials in that regard, the bottom line is that when push comes to a shove it will stand aside and not prevent destruction of the natural environment at the behest of any State government. It is willing to revoke existing World Heritage nominations and to allow the bulldozers to roar. It is willing to allow proposals that should be settled as part of the Australian political comity, agreed between both sides in this debate to reopen those wounds. Coming from Tasmania, I find this particularly odious. We now have a situation, through the Salamanca process negotiated by the new State Labor Government, where, for an historic first time, those that represent the environment movement, the forest industries and the trade union movement have come together to agree on a common approach which makes certain that there is a proper balance and a measure of respect for each other's views and a way forward that will not reOpen the savage, almost civil war conditions that previously divided our small Tasmanian community. Mr Miles-Due to Brown ..",143
285,Mr KERR,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"The last thing I would want and I am certain the last thing the honourable member for Bass would want-although perhaps some of his less clever colleagues interjecting from behind him might have a different view-would be for those divisions to be reopened within our community. I now turn to the specific provisions of the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill, which is by no means revolutionary. It simply takes the existing Australian Heritage Commission Act and constructively adds to it to make clear some of the things that are already occurring. For example, clause 4 provides an explicit set of criteria that the Australian Heritage Commission is to take into account in listing an area as part of the National Estate. Those matters include: (a) its importance in the course, or pattern, Australia's natural or cultural history; (b) its possession of uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of Australia's natural or cultural history; (c) its potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Australia's natural or cultural history; (d) its importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of: (i) a class of Australia's natural or cultural places; or (ii) a class of Australia's natural or cultural environments; (e) its importance in exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics valued by a community or cultural group; (f) its importance in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period; (g) its strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons; (h) its special association with the life or works of a person, or group of persons, of importance in Australia's natural or cultural history. Those matters were always taken into account in the Act- but are now given express legislative form by the amending Bill. Thus, no-one need not understand the clear effect of the legislation. Other measures are important in terms of making transparent-making clear-the objects of the legislation, so as to avoid some of the kinds of obfuscations raised by those who wish to distort the purpose of the Australian Heritage Commission Act and some of the alleged difficulties with notification and pUblication of notices. The intent is to make sure that the process is open and that there can be no suggestion of unfairness in the way listing takes place. Thus, objects are actually· written into the legislation and not left for administrative discretion. Those are important steps forward in making sure that there is a proper basis for public acceptance of the National Estate. Let me say something to those who are cynical about the National Estate. Surveys have been undertaken by the environmental movement which show that the public understands and values the National Estate. The public wishes to protect and to see listed as part of Australia's National Estate those of parts of our environmental and cultural heritage which are important to the nation. The Australian people value that and will reject absolutely parties which wish to undermine that process. 1 conclude on this note: the honourable members for Bass said that there had been some misrepresentation of the purpose of the National Estate by the environment movement for nefarious purposes. Protecting the environment is not a nefarious purpose. Only on the Opposition side could protecting the environment be thought of as a nefarious purpose. It is not: It is a valued and important part of our national responsibilities. 1 commend the Bill to the House.",144
286,Mr DOWNER ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mayo) (10.32)-1 will not take very much of the time of the House tonight. Listening to the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr) reminds us of how literally millions of Australians look forward to the return of Mr Michael Hodgman to this place following the election. The honourable member for Denison made the comment often heard from the other side of politics and from some sections of the environmental movement that, because people on our side of politics are concerned about the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, the corollary is that it will lead to the inevitable destruction of all the Queensland wet tropics areas and other great and valuable parts of our natural heritage. Naturally, anybody with any balance in his mind would know only too well that all sides of politics and probably all Australians want to protect the important parts of our National Estate and our natural heritage.",145
287,Mr KERR ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,The Queensland National Party-MONICA,145
288,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Blanchard)-Order! The honourable member for Denison will cease interjecting.,145
289,Mr DOWNER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Whatever honourable members may say about political parties in different corners of Australia, there never was a political party in Australia that advocated the complete destruction of the Queensland wet tropics. Everybody knows that, but this is part of the problem with these sorts of debates. 1I have lived through some of these debates in the last couple of years. The trouble is that there are people who take basically a motherhood proposition which is that we want to conserve our natural environment for many reasons that we all know. Then they take that motherhood proposition and claim that people who do not agree entirely with everything they say are people who believe in the destruction of motherhood or the total decimation of the environment. It· is clearly false and it is a very unhappy thing that so many people in the community are influenced by that level of debate. But it is true that they are. That is one of the reasons why so much of the environmental debate has become a debate about humbug. It is one of the reasons why the extremists in the conservation movement-not the bulk of Australians who are concerned about conservation-have hijacked the environmental agenda. The people on the other side of politics put into the position of Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) a man who is not interested in the environment. We all know that. He is.a numbers man and we all know that he calculates which way the preferences will go. He calculates which way the percentage of Australian Democrat preferences and what percentage of green preferences the Australian Labor Party can get, and all that sort of thing. Then he takes the extremist position and says that if we came to power we would chop down every tree in Australia but if Labor is put back into power it will plant one billion trees in 10 years. That is complete nonsense. Labor Party members say these things and hope that, in doing so, they will somehow win preferences. When this part of Australia's history is reviewed in 50 or 100 years time, this environmental debate will be looked upon with ridicule because it has been so immature, so exaggerated and so distorted for all the worse kinds of purposes. Future generations will recognise that real damage was done to this country because of kneejerk responses to an hysterical debate. 1 want to make are additional point in the few minutes that 1 want to take tonight. It is about the built heritage, instead of w.\1at others would talk about, which is the natural heritage of our country. 1 reiterate a view that 1I have held for a long time about the importance of considering further government initiatives in the area of the built heritage. Those initiatives are alluded to in the coalition's heritage policy and were alluded to in the present Government's policy speech in 1983. I think that was the speech in which it said that there would be no capital gains tax. The Government also said that it would do something about the taxation arrangements for improvements in the built heritage. I think all of us support-and even people such as the honourable member for Denison in the privacy of his own home would admit that all people support-the conservation of important parts of our built heritage for its historic value, its aesthetic benefit, leisure and tourism reasons and indeed for some economic reasons beyond leisure and· tourism as well. But the way we approach the conservation of the built heritage in my view is very unimaginative. We have the National Estate grants program. That is fair enough. The Government gives a little here and a little there-very small amounts project by project-to assist the conservation of the heritage or to improve some of the older buildings. But it is a very small sum of money and understandably the Government argues that, for budgetary reasons, it cannot provide much more than that. Also, small sums of money are granted to organisations such as the National Trust, which is the intelligent and balanced face of the conservation movement, if I may say so. That is probably because my mother was the Vicepresident at one stage and she is very balanced and intelligent. Mr Smith-You will get a good Christmas present.",145
290,Mr DOWNER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, there is a good Christmas coming for me. Grants go to those sorts of organisations. There are some tax concessions. For example, donations to the National Trust in the form of property do attract some tax concessions and the like. But the people who are concerned about the conservation of the built heritage in this country know only too well that nothing like enough resources are going into that conservation to ensure that our built heritage is properly looked after for generations ahead. So, what I would implore the House to do is to consider, for these sorts of problems, new solutions in legislative form even though they are not terribly new in concept. The new solutions revolve around providing tax concessions for expenditure on the restoration of the built heritage. A number of people have put forward proposals of this kind. There was the Hope inquiry in 1974; there was the Council of Capital City Lord Mayors; and the Australian Heritage Commission itself has put forward a very constructive, imaginative and practical plan for providing that sort of taxation arrangement. The experience in the United States of America where, interestingly enough, the Reagan Administration provided these tax concessions or tax credits in that case, was very beneficial. The United States provided a 25 per cent tax credit for expenditure on heritage buildings. The result was that between 1981, when it was introduced, and 1986, which is the latest figure I can find available, $8 billion had been sent on the rehabilitation of the built heritage in the United States. That is a fantastic figure. Of course, the dimension of that economy is built much bigger than ours. But to spend $8 billion on the rehabilitation of the built heritage is something that no government itself would have been willing to do. In proportion, we would be talking about much less money in Australia, but still substantially more than is spent on the rehabilitation of our built heritage at the moment. The Americans argue that the economic activity generated by the rehabilitation of the built heritage through these tax concessions far outweighs the relatively small cost to the Treasury of providing the tax credits. In the United States it is argued by the conservationists, who are not quite as hysterical as one or two extremists in our movement might be, that one of the benefits of this scheme is to develop cooperation and understanding between the developers and the conservationists. Finally, it has rehabilitated many of the inner areas of the older cities of the United States, such as St Louis, to very great benefit, and all members of the House would find that to be fairly obvious. Despite the promises of the Labor Party in 1983-and I suppose it has only had seven years to do something-the Government still has done nothing. I suspect that that is. because of the resistance of the Treasury. The Minister at the table may be quite sympathetic to these views. Is the Minister sympathetic to these views? Mr HoJding-I have not been listening to you.",146
291,Mr DOWNER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"He is obviously sympathetic. He is a man who is very interested in the processes of Parliament and is sympathetic to these views. He is unable to succeed in persuading the Treasurer to provide any proposition. I hope when the Government changes that the new Liberal-National Party Government will be able to move ahead with providing that sort of tax credit or concession. The proposal put by the Australian Heritage Commission was to provide the concession only to properties that were on the Register of the National Estate-and I think that is entirely appropriate-and to provide for a ceiling of expenditure of $200,000. I think I am right in saying that that is the figure. The Commission estimated that the total cost to Treasury in lost revenue would be something like $3m gross, although the Australian Heritage Commission argued in its paper that the net cost would be substantially less than the gross figure. I do not want to take up any more time of the House, but I reiterate my view once more that I very much hope that people will not only be carried along by the latest vogue, which is to follow Bob Brown and try to get his preferences, but also will think about the need to conserve Australia's built heritage. Australia does not have as much of it as, for example, the European countries, for obvious reasons, but what we have is very beautiful and important in establishing our national identity. It is very important to the aesthetics of our country and important economically to tourism, the leisure industry and the like. More must be done for Australia's built heritage. That is one way in which more can be done for it and that is recognised in principle in the coalition's her- do that. itage policy.",147
292,Mr BRUMBY ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Bendigo) (10.43)-I wish to take this opportunity to make some brief remarks about the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill that is currently before the House. In doing so I will disagree with some of the comments made by the honourable m.ember for Mayo ( Mr Downer), but agree with some of the comments he made regarding the built heritage in Australia, which is our cultural heritage, if I can use that expression. I disagree strongly with the way the honourable member for Mayo refers to the environmental policies of the Government as simply following the 'latest vogue', to use his words. For legitimate reasons there is a growing concern around Australia, not only amongst all the people of Australia but amongst people in this Parliament, about the nature of Australia's natural environment and the way in which we are damaging that eiwironment. Very legitimate concerns have been expressed by people. These concerns are genuine and they arise from issues, for instance, such as the depletion of the ozone layer. Anyone who has read the newspapers in the last two days will have seen articles by a researcher in Melbourne who has been undertaking research on the ozone layer and skin cancer. He has determined that there is a very clear correlation between the number of skin cancer cases that are being detected in Australia, in the southern hemisphere, and the depletion of the ozone layer. Australians have a very genuine and legitimate concern about what we have done to the ozone layer. There is no natural reason why the ozone layer has been depleting; it has been depleting because of what we are putting into it in the form of waste products, chlorofluorocarbons and so on. This is a legitimate environmental concern. There are other legitimate environmental concerns. Today there are places around Australia's coastline where it is not possible to take our children to swim in the sea because it is too polluted. One of the things that Australian families legitimately want to do with their kids is take them to the beach and swim in the sea without any worries about pollution and so on. Today there are areas in Australia where it is impossible to In my own electorate of Bendigo the questions of salt and land degradation have assumed momentous proportions. The level of salting in many of Australia's inland rivers and streams is a national disaster, and perhaps the Murray River is the worse example. The question of land degradation has been identified by the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation, and no-one in this Parliament would disagree that land degradation is the single largest environmental problem faced by Australia. These are not Mickey Mouse, vogueish concerns, as the honourable member for Mayo attempted to assert in this House; they are legitimate concerns which are properly held by people from all walks of life in Australia about the the damage that we are doing to our environment. I have quickly mentioned two or three of them: the ozone layer and its relation to skin cancer; the fact that many of our beaches are so polluted that people cannot take their children to the beach for a swim; and in inland Australia the problem of land degradation and salting, which is assuming massive proportions. Having said that, I will agree with some of the comments made by ""the honourable member for Mayo in relation to Australia's built heritage. I, too, would like additional funding to be made available, either through the National Estate grants program-and I am pleased that in the last 12 months we have provided some modest increase in funding for that program-or perhaps by looking at· other initiatives which might provide incentives for the private sector to preserve and conserve Australia's historic buildings. In my own electorate I am fortunate to have what has been described by many historians as the best collection of nineteenth century buildings and architecture anywhere in Australia. This heritage has been left to central Victoria because of the gold rushes of the nineteenth century. It is worth stating to this Parliament-and I have done it before in a previous speechthat I am one of a number of people involved in a committee in central Victoria which is now actively working to win increased national and international recognition for the goldfields heritage that we have in that area. Over recent years a number of eminent Australian historians have suggested that the Government should consider nominating the central Victorian goldfields for world heritage listing. They have made that recommendation and said that the Government should consider it because they assert that central Victoria has the best surviving examples anywhere in the world of the great gold rushes era of the nineteenth century. This era was a remarkable phenomenon in relatively recent world history. Literally millions of people traversed the world and it was a phenomenon that was linked up with the end of the industrial revolution which brought Australia new mining technology and, when we look at the impact. that it had in central Victoria, we see that Australia is left with a magnificent legacy of nineteenth century buildings, streetscapes, boulevards and mining technology which are amongst the best surviving examples of that gold rushes era anywhere in the world. This is a matter of built or cultural heritage, and I use the expression 'cultural heritage' fairly loosely, but the gold rush in the central Victorian goldfields caused the biggest mass migration to Australia of all time. Today we talk about multiculturalism, and rightly so, but the nineteenth century gold rush in central Victoria was a real mingling of people, entrepreneurs, from all around the world who came together to find new wealth in Australia. They left us with a rich legacy. In regard to Australia's political history, Sir John Quick was a resident of Bendigo. His house is still there today and I am pleased to say that it has been fully restored. He was one of the founding fathers of the Constitution. In the pro-Federation ballots that were held in Australia before 1901, the biggest number of votes in those ballots anywhere in Australia was in the towns of Bendigo and Ballarat. The origins of Australia's whole Federation movement through Sir John Quick and the ballots in Bendigo and Ballarat can in fact be traced to central Victoria. In a sense I do agree with the honourable member for Mayo that perhaps we should be looking at increased support, either through the National Estate program or through the Australian Heritage Commission. I have not seen any of the arguments on tax deductions-the honourable member brought those into the debate today-'-but perhaps the Government should be looking at those types of policies to ensure that the best elements of Australia's built or cultural heritage is preserved. I conclude by making this point: tonight there has been some debate about world heritage listing. It is true that if one looks at the properties that this Government and preceding Governments have nominated for world heritage listing, by and large they have all been natural properties. Whether it is the Great Barrier Reef, Uluru, the Queensland rainforest or south-west Tasmania, those nominations have not been made because of anything man made, any cultural heritage. By and large they have been made because of the natural properties that exist there. I suppose the only exception to that would, of course, be Kakadu and Vluru, where questions of Aboriginal heritage were obviously important. But in terms of our European heritage, in terms of our man-made or built heritage, there is nothing which we have yet proposed or considered in Australia for World Heritage listing. I would like the Government to consider that. If we are to continue in our support of World Heritage listing-this Government certainly does intend to continue it-it would be valuable, and it would be of benefit to the nation, for us to address seriously the question of what cultural nomination we can make. What is it in Australia that we have done as a man made example of heritage which ranks as the best example of that type in the world? We come down to a fairly short list. We could consider things like the overland telegraph or the central Victorian goldfields. I just say that there is a magnificent asset that we have there in central Victoria in our built heritage. It is in Bendigo, Ballarat, Stawell and in towns like Maldon-Australia's first notable town-Dunolly and Inglewood. I really do support the moves that we are taking locally to achieve greater national and international recognition of these areas. I support the Bill before the House. As I have said in response to the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer), I disagree very strongly with his views that the Government's environmental concerns are simply 'the latest vogue'. I do not think they are. They are genuine environmental issues which must be addressed in Australia. I do concur, though, with his views about the builtheritage and I hope that, in the future, it will be possible to provide increased government support to encourage preservation of that heritage.",147
293,Mr MCGAURAN ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Gippsland) (10.52)In listening to the debate this evening, I was struck by the differences between the contributions of the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr) and the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Brumby), both speaking on behalf of the Government. Whilst it is a rare day for me to agree with, or to endorse very much of, what the honourable member for Bendigo says, I did find much in his speech tonight worthy of examination, and even support. But I ask my honourable friend not to take that as a wholehearted endorsement of every word he has spoken tonight. I can only suppose that the honourable member was absent from the chamber when his colleague the honourable member for Denison engaged in the shallowest of emotional sloganism possible. If the honourable member for Bendigo would have us believe that the Government's environmental policies are not based upon a cynical grab for votes, then he would have been sorely disappointed by the hysterical contribution by the honourable member for Denison. The honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer), who followed the honourable member for Denison, very satisfactorily and accurately stripped away the veneer of concern which the honourable member for Denison sought to impose on those of us in the chamber and anyone else unfortunate enough to be listening at the time of his contribution. Why is is that people are so cynical now about· the professed concern of the Government in regard to environmental matters? The answer is simple. It is because the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) stated without any shame that the formation of environmental policy is predicated upon a need to win the preferences of any green party or independent green candidates at the next Federal election. When the Labor Party was elected to office in March 1983, it obtained a primary vote of approximately 48 per cent. By the July 1987 election, it had been whittled away to about 45 per cent. Senator Richardson has advised his party none too privately that he expects the primary vote of the Government to be as low as 41 or 42 per cent, citing as evidence the strong reaction against the major party political system as well as a swing against the Government because of the economic burdens it is imposing on young home buyers, small businesses, families and individuals. He believes that the only possible chance of the Government's being returned to office is to punch up that 42 per cent primary vote to something approaching the middle forties by way of preferences. will do anything-even sell out the interests of this country-to achieve that objective. He has succeeded in winning over to that cynical political ploy the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). But in doing so he has permanently alienated the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin), the Minister Resources (Senator Cook), the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button)-in other words, the supquate posed economic rationalists. How spect can the people have for those In individuals when they will stand by and low Senator Richardson to steamroll the terms: Cabinet decision making process? We have seen evidence again tonight that duces the Government will trump up the wildest the accusations against coalition governments the various States and, indeed, members this side of the House. The fact is that there will not be rational, objective decision makprovide ing unless the Government abandons the dethe liberate attempt to fool the larger Australian electorate. People are waking up. I believe a halt. that the Government has seriously underesIn timated the capacity of the Australian elecexotic torate to sift the wheat from the chaff. They know what is rhetoric and what is sloganism, as opposed to what are rational, objective decisions made on the basis of the national interest. So where are the Government memknowledge. bers who are concerned about the drastic deterioration in the body of environmental science available upon which to make raadvice, tional decisions? Who amongst government ranks has raised his or her voice, publicly least, in protest against the decimation of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Reat search Organisation (CSIRO)? The evidence is overwhelming. In the time available to let me very briefly take the House through three reports which corroborate the same conclusion: that the Government does not have the scientific data available to it upon which to make serious decisions. The first report comes from, surprise, prise, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business ( Mr Barry Jones) himself. early September he tabled in this Parliament a written answer to a question on notice from the honourable member for Fraser ( Mr Langmore). The Minister released an assessHe ment which detailed 13 major programs that have been curtailed or abandoned since 1985 within the division of wildlife and ecology of the CSIRO. He further listed another 12 initiatives relating to agricultural productivity and conservation policy on which no work had begun. It makes extraordinary reading, for which no member should ignore. On the woodchips versus conservation debate, the Minister advised the House as follows: The development of this work is woefully inadeat present, and equivalent work in other remuch regions is not going ahead. dealing with conservation policy, the Minalister advised the House in the following . . . reducing the division's research effort rethe objective basis for understanding much of development of national conservation policies. in The general commentary of the Minister's on statement to the House was: Within Australia, the ability of the division to the detailed information needed to develop best national policies is well short of what it should be and in some areas is virtually grinding to regard to agricultural development, pests, diseases, arid lands research, pastures and crop production, genetic research, biological pest and weed control programs, the Minister listed the decimation that has brought about a totally inadequate store of The second report comes from one of the Government's principal bodies for scientific the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC). In early October it at released a paper which concluded that Austhe tralia's environmental research expertise was a low ebb and that there was insufficient baseline environmental data at hand to make me, rational decisions about land use. In the world's greatest environmental statement in July, the Prime Minister commissioned ASTEC to prepare a report on the state of environmental science in this country. ASTEC released a discussion paper which drew sursome preliminary conclusions. The most disturbing aspect of the paper In was the finding that the environmental impact statement process was seriously flawed and characterised by 'a poor level of science and fluctuations in the quality of research'. In other words, ASTEC concluded that it is difficult to know which environmental impact statements are reliable and which are not. The truth is that the ASTEC paper demonstrates that this situation has come about because of the crisis in human resources which confronts environmental science and because of serious deficiencies in the extent and organisation of the nation's environmental database. The ASTEC paper raises other faults in relation to environmental science. Principally, the information available to environmental scientists, and thereby the governments they advise, is often locked away. There are different repositories in the States, in different departments and in private industry. There is little sharing of this information. We need to assemble in one area a library of all the environmental science so as to provide this databank for decision-making. Sadly, other countries, such as Canada, have taken steps in this direction but, as the ASTEC paper points out, 'other countries are in a much better position to apply fundamental research to natural resource issues than is Australia'. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested to note that the successful Canadian policy of collecting and storing information was based on a model established by the CSIRO many years ago but never taken up by this Government. I now turn to the third report, which establishes beyond doubt the crisis that exists in environmental science. I refer to the CSIRO's submission to the ASTEC Review of the State of Environmental Research in Australia to which I previously referred. It simply blasted the environmental research effort of the Government. It stated that Australia is simply incapable of mounting an adequate research effort to resolve critical environmental problems. The Organisation claimed that the Government's July environmental statement: . . . has not made good the cuts to environmental research and did not necessarily contribute icantly to the core capacity and flexibility which have been jeopardised by the drop in funding. The CSIRO study, which has received much media attention because it reveals the hypocrisy of the Government's proclamations on the environment, listed the reduced research in a whole range of areas affecting a number of divisions within the CSIRO. The report states: The Division of Entomology has reduced its research into biological control systems designed to reduce dependence upon pesticides, while the Division of Soils has had to forgo important work on the effect of the release of emissions from heavy metals . . . on the environment. The Division of Forestry and Forestry Products has been unable to proceed with research into arresting rural tree decline and the Division of Water Resources has reported inadequate support for continued work into the contamination of coastal estuaries, soil and groundwater from industrial and urban activities. The honourable member for Bendigo sought to detail those common, almost garden variety, environmental and pollution problems that affect people in their daily lives, such as polluted beaches and clogged waterways. Here is an example of where the Division of Water Resources simply cannot continue its research. Why does not the honourable member for Bendigo, who wears his environmental concerns on his sleeve, say something about the decline of environmental research? How in heaven's name can we strike the correct balance in this country between environment and development, so crucial to the future of the next generation, if the Government does not have the data available to it upon which to make sensible decisions? The Government's hypocrisy is revealed for all to see. It cannot expect people to believe that it has a genuine concern for the environment when it allows the flagship of Australian science, the CSIRO, to deteriorate in the fashion it has. The Government must realise the development and the environment are not mutually exclusive. There has to be an acceptance of the concept of mUltiple land use. The decisions which will bring about the prosperity into the next century while preserving the environment and quality of life for the next generation can be made only upon the existence of hard irrefutable scientific data. Tragically for the fusignifture of this country, the Government has not made that information available.",149
294,Mr MILES ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Braddon) (11.06)-The previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran), made it very clear to the people listening to this discussion that the Government's position and concerns in regard to the environment are very transparent and very plastic. What he said about scientific information is absolutely correct. It is .a great tragedy that· this Government has failed in its duty to ensure that· this nation has .a scientific heritage, It has. virtually the heart out of scientific inquirY in this country. The honourable member for Gippsland put the case very clearly and succinctly. This debate has been very interesting. Only two Government members have spoken on this topic, and they have not been able to sustain the debate. That indicates that their hearts are not in this issue. Otherwise, another Government member would have been in the House to follow the honourable membel'· for Gippsland' before I rose to my feet. But there was not. It is interesting to note some of the comments, particularly those made by the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr). It would have been helpful if we could have cut the humbug from his speech and got down to the issue. , What is this issue really about? Plants and animals have a particular life cycle, as is the case with products marketed in the marketplace. Social issues, of which the environment is a popular one today, also have what I believe to be a life cycle. In that cycle the issue first arises and there is a lot of heat and very little light on the topic. In the next phase the general population begins to understand and appreciate the depth and breadth of the issue involved. As a nation, we are now at that stage in the social issue cycle. It was particularly clear from the speech of the' honourable member for Denison that he was still at the hype and heat stage of the cycle and had not reached the stage of intelligent debate. This nation is now at the stage where there is an appreciation of the economic impact of the environmental issue and the National Estate listings. It is a great tragedy that the Government has ,not seen fit to address that issue at this· time in this legislation. I believe that if the Government were really genuine about where we were going as a country in regard to the huge overseas debt crisis created by this Government in marrying the environmental issues of our day, it would have addressed in this legislation the economic impact of listing parts of Australia on the National Estate. That is where this debate is now at. If that had been addressed, we could have moved forward and there would have been much more support from the Opposition for this legislation. As it is, cut we can only be very half-hearted about it. With regard to addressing that economic issue, it would have been wise and sensible to have ensured that there were State representatives on the Australian Heritage Commission because they are the people who are close to the action and who understand the issues. They understand the impact that any listing will have. Cooperation in this area is absolutely vital. After the next election, when we are in government, our policy, covered in our Economic Action Plan will involve the States. It is based on cooperation. Instead of the confrontationist approach that this Government takes in these matters, or the centralist approach that it takes when it tries to shut out people in regional Australia and has decisions made by people in Canberra which often show that those people are out of touch with reality, the next coalition government will ensure that people in regional Australia and the State governments will have a say on' these very important matters. As the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith) also mentioned, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories ( Mr Holding) indicated that he believed that the terms 'National Estate', 'national parks' and so on had been used by certain people in this debate to obscure the debate. I remember very clearly being involved in the debate over the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests. We were talking about a certain form of listing. I went back through the speech of the then Minister and, instead of referring to the correct terminology in that debate, the Minister deliberately obscured the debate by referring to something quite different. Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that you were involved in that debate.",151
295,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Blaochard)-I trust that that is no reflection on the Chair?,152
296,Mr MILES,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Not at all; but it does illustrate the confusion over the use of the words 'National Estate' or 'national parks' by Government members and by many members in the radical fringe areas of the environmental movement in order to create what I would refer to as cognitive wilderness for most people. They cannot understand it; they cannot follow it. Why? It is because people set out deliberately to confuse by mixing up these words. It does not become the Minister tq indicate that it was the people in the developmental industries who used these terms interchangeably in a confusing manner. From my reading of the literaturC? ript only were they the last to do that, but they take a lot of time to try to clarify the issue in the public's mind. ' Finally, I draw attention to proposed new subsection 4 (IA) which states: Without limiting the generality of subsection place that is a component of the natural or cultural environment of Australia is to be; taken to be included in the national estate if it has significance or other special value for future generations Those sorts of words do not give clarity to this debate. It contains thti words 'national of touch. estate if it has significance'. To what significance does that refer? If we assume that means part of Australia's natural heritage, we' can go to, any part of Australia and develop a case that the area is of significance for 'one reason or another. In this legislation we as a parliament had an opportunity to tighten up this wording so that areas put onto the National Estate were genuinely of national significance. This wording is too general and lacks specificity. It has all the Government. hallmarks of a document the interpretation of which is left open for debate and political opportunism. This legislation should have tightened up on the wording and given a their clear definition for the public. These terms should be defined clearly. We really have to consider whether can, in such a tight legal way, lock up areas of Australia and say that we are doing it the future generations. We must come to point where we ask: how much of this nation will be defined as national heritage under this legal framework? Tasmania bears the brunt of this sort of legislation. Almost third of our State is now locked up under one form of environmental type of legislation or another. This legislation gave the Governquite ment an opportunity to use words which sion clearly showed that we are interested in of national significance. ' Mr Tim Fischer-And they have failed.",152
297,Mr MILES,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Not only has the Government failed; it has failed dismally. This legislation has been around for a long time. For the Government to bring it in without giving specificity in the definition is a great tragedy. If it had clarified the matter, much of this debate about what is and what is not national heritage would have been avoided and it would have enabled debate out in the community to be much clearer. This Government has missed the opportunity ,to address the economic impact of wilderness areas and environmental listings in this nation. It is a great tragedy that that opportunity has been lost. This matter should (I) a have been addressed by the Government, a place which just shows that the Government is lacking in ideas, has run out of concepts to . . . take to the Australian nation-Mr Tim Fischer-They are tired and out",153
298,Mr MILES,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Exactly. That is obvious it from having watched those, opposite come in here to debate this issue. They are tired and out of touch. They have lost the vision th-t I think they had back in 1983. We are now witnessing a government which is certainly in decline. The people of Australia can see that very clearly from the way in which this debate has been handled here tonight by the",153
299,Mr HOLDING ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Melbourne Port-Minister for the Arts; Tourism and Territories) (11.18)-1 thank honourable ,members for contributions to the debate. There seems to have been some considerable confusion in ' the minds of members of the Opposition and we the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith). He u,sed arguments for referring to the Helsham Commission of Ina quiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests and to World Heritage matters as though those matters were interchangeable. He confused the Helsham inquiry process, onewhich dealt with World Heritage matters, with the processes of the Australian Heritage Commission. But the functions involved are different. The function of the Commisis simply to identify areas for entry 01) areas the Register of the National Estate. The Helsham inquiry attempted to identify for the Government areas of World Heritage significance. There is a very significant difference. Throughout this debate there has been an expression of the underlying philosophy of the coalition. It has come in two ways. On a daily basis the Government is attacked by members of the Opposition, both at Question Time and in general debate, on the basis that we do not make enough cuts in the public sector. That is the position in respect of the coalition's macro-economic approach. Yet in debate after debate when we are dealing with individual items of legislation we are continually berated by the very same members on the basis that in particular areas we are not spending enough, that we are failing in our duty. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. Opposition members are not entitled to go to the people of Australia as their Leader does day after day and as, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), does to say that there must be more cuts in the public sector-unidentified-and then come in here in an individual, debate and say what a terrible thing it is that there is increased funding for a body like the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. It is that kind of platitude in its position whiCh characterises the lack of thought and comprehension that bedevil this coalition. When we are talking about the Australian Heritage Commission, the first question we must ask ourselves is what is its role. Its function is simple. It identifies the National Estate and advises on National Estate values. It has no power of intervention and rio power of prescription. It is the Government which is responsible for deciding abouf feasible and prudent alternatives to actions affecting the National Estate value. That is a distinction which has not been made at any stage tonight by any spokesman for the Opposition. It, is totally false and totally incorrect to claim that the mere listing on the register of the National Estate somehow locks up areas or forecloses options for economic and social development. There are hundreds of examples throughout Australia of listed areas being used for economically productive purposes. It does hot mean simply because they are registered that economic activities in relation to them do not continue. That is the second mistake that has bedevilled the Opposition all the way through this debate. The role of the Commission is an independent statutory role in which it identifies and registers places of National Estate significance and brings them to the attention of Commonwealth Ministers and agencies. That is its function. It is a difficult function. It is not easy. But is the Opposition going to complicate that function by saying 'Instead of identifying 'a particular area or a particular house as being' of National Estate value, your real job, before you makes that identification, is to work out its economic significance', the presumption being that the economic significance is, in the view of somebody, higher than its National Estate value? That is an argument for governments, an argument for parliaments. Then what would the Opposition do? Would it not put it on the National Register? This is the falsity and the nonsense which have bedevilled the Opposition all through this debate. The Commission's achievements have been considerable. Not at any stage in this debate did anyone member of the Opposition criticise the Commission in terms of its identification, qf any aspect of the National Estate. That is a significant omission. It was not an accident. It was because the honourable members opposite were concerned to argue about decisions which are made by government in terms of governments' perception of policy in respect of the advice it receives that flows from the fact of registration. The substantial database which exists for the National Estate includes over 9,000 places entered in the Register, and their place on the Register. The Commission provides advice on the National Estate to a wide range of Commonwealth Ministers, departments and authorities. In 1988-89, the Commission provided such advice under section 30 on 336 occasions. And it does not stop there. That advice is also sought by people in the private sector, by private firms and individuals and State and local government authorities. Yet members opposite come in here and argue that this was some great opportunity to add a very complicating factor to an assessment of what is of priority in terms of the National Estate. I would argue that the old Parliament House clearly is relevant to the National Estate, but would the honourable gentleman opposite say, 'Before you make that evaluation, you could turn it into a motel, a hotel or a massage parlour. and before you can make a decision about whether it has a National Estate value you have to listen to all those arguments. '? Have you ever heard such nonsense? But that is the kind of glib claptrap that emerges from this Opposition daily. I do not think it is necessary for me to say much more in this debate. If, in producing its Register, in carrying out its functions, there were a large number of areas or buildings about which honourable gentlemen could stand up and say, 'That .was a rotten decision, that is a decision that could not have been made and should not have been made in terms of the National Estate' do honourable members think that they would not have done it? The fact is that they could not identify, nor did they argue, nor did they suggest that in carrying out its role the Commission had not properly had regard to its responsibility under the Act and in making its evaluations they were,' in fact, National Estate evaluations. The real problem that bedevils this Opposition is that, when it comes down to it, it wants to put into National Estate values, attitudes and positions which do not rightly belong there. Honourable members opposite say, 'You must also include the States'. We would have had a great contribution from some of the States! If one looks at the history of past administrations in various parts of Australia which the Opposition has supported-they were its political colleaguesone remembers that in the dead of night they colluded with private developers to put the bulldozers through historic buildings. Was there ever a protest from the gentlemen opposite, who come in here and tell us that, really, when we are making assessments about the National Estate we must make assessments about their economic worth? That is the history. I suggest that the amendment that has been moved is ill-timed and ill-considered and shows no understanding at all of the role and the responsibility of those who have to operate in terms of this legislation. That is, perhaps, a pity because I do not believe that all the virtues rest on this side of the House when it comes to making evaluations about items that are relevant to the National Estate. It is a great pity that one feels at the end of this debate that Opposition members were talking almost for the sake of talking and that the amendments which now come forward a.re without logic, are without rationality and will do nothing to contribute to the very important role which those who are entrusted with the responsibilities under this legisla.tion are charged.

We seek to reinsert the words 'Australian Airlines Limited', which were taken out of the Bill. The reason we seek to do that, as we know, this legislation applies to Commonwealth bodies and instrumentalities.

Indeed, one might ponder the thought that Australian Airlines Ltd might be listed if this dispute continues much longer. It will be a relic, will it not? The' second amendment that we' have moved is an important matter. It relates to clause 9. Clause 9 inserts a neW section into the Bill, section 23A, which states that the Commission must give notice to ownersthat is, private owners-in the prescribed fashion but that its failure to do so shall not invalidate any public notice given of intention of register, nor the actual process' of listing on the Register. Such listing cannot occur without public notice being given. Thus public notice must precede any listing, whether or not private notice to owners has been given. The Bill now requires that private notice is to be given as well either by letter, where there are fewer than 50 owners, or by a number of other specified means. This is cast as an obligation Australian Heritage Commission. However, if for some reason such notification in the prescribed fashion is not given, other than by public notice, a listing may still take place. The move to require notice to private sons is welcome. The amendment says that that notice has to take place at least seven days before a public notice in respect place is published under the paragraph. We say that seven days is an inordinately short time. For practical reasons, we seek to insert an amendment to extend the seven-day period to 28 days to take account of the obvious aspects of human behaviour. People do not always see everything straight away. Giving people a little time to be able to consider whether or not they wish to make a submisaccept sion to the Commission about a relevant amendments. proposed listing is an eminently sensible position to take. That is the reason we have moved the amendment. I understand that the Minister is not able to accept the amendment. When it gets to the Senate some adopted. thought might be given to it there. The other point I would just like to make whilst I am on my feet is the one the Minister raised about the Helsham Inquiry into third time. the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests. I accept the point that the Commission is volved in giving advice. I did say in the earlier part of my speech-I recall that I emphasised the fact-that it is what the Government does with that advice that gen. erates the political heat. The point that we were making is that in the formulation of that advice, we believe, the economic and social implications of such advice to governproposed ment ought to be taken into account. We Standing obviously differ on that. The Minister raised an issue in regard to Victoria. the Helsham inquiry and alleged confusion on my part. I am not confused. I refer the Minister to the September 1989 publication of the Commission, which indicates where the Commission had a role in looking at referred World Heritage values with regard to the Helsham inquiry. It made a submission and duly gave advice on that matter. That is the point this I was referring to. I do understand these issues. Believe me, a Tasmanian understands these issues. That is the point I was making and I just wanted to clarify that point. In on the conclusion, the Commission stated: The future of Australia's native forests is extremely complex, taking into consideration all the economic, social and environmental factors. I agree with that statement. They are complex issues. We are saying that we ought to perhave been given the opportunity to debate them more fully tonight when this Bill came forward. That was the other thrust of the of that argument that I was putting tonight.",155
