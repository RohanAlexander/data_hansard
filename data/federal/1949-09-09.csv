1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr J. J. Clark) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Motion (by Mr Chifley) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn to Wednesday next, at 3 p.m. NA EX-SERVICEMEN.",10
2,Mr FULLER,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,Can the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction furnish the House with an indication of the progress that has been made recently with the war service land settlement scheme?,10
3,Mr DEDMAN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"The total area of land that has so far been acquired in connection with that scheme throughout Australia is nearly 7,000,000 acres. Over 500 properties have been acquired for sub-divisional purposes. Tn addition, over 500 single-unit properties have also been purchased and allotted to ex-servicemen.",10
4,Mr FBAMCIS,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,But the Minister refused to grant single-unit properties to ex-servicemen when the bill was before the House.,10
5,Mr DEDMAN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Tb e honourable member for Moreton is quite wrong. Up to date the number of ex-servicemen who have been settled on the land is nearly 3,000, whilst the total expenditure on all forms of war service land settlement is about £13,500,000.",10
6,Mr FALKINDER,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,Will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction make the position clear about war service land settlement in the case of an ex-serviceman who suddenly dies but leaves a family? Has the wife or son of a deceased ex-serviceman any right to carry on the farm?,10
7,Mr DEDMAN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"The terms on which a soldier settler holds land differ in the respective States. In Tasmania, the State Government is the agent for the Australian Government. Nevertheless, the agreement relating to the tenure of the land is drawn up by the State Government. I shall inquire into the matter raised by the honourable member and advise him in due course. CIVIL AVIATION.",10
8,Mr HARRISON,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"As my question has to do with petrol and Trans-Australia Airlines, in the temporary absence of the Minister for Air, I address it . to the Prime Minister. ""Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House whether it is a fact that Trans-Australia Airlines has been, and, I understand, still is flying empty beer bottles from Sydney to Perth ? If so, is this a paying proposition for Trans-Australia Airlines? What is the average load of empties carried by each aircraft? Is the charge for this freight based on the scale of charges applicable to ordinary air freight? Have the rates been varied' in any way in respect of the carriage of empty beer bottles? What would be the liability of Trans-Australia Airlines in the event of breakages of the empty beer bottles? What proportion of petrol used on the Sydney-Perth flights is necessary to transport these fragile cargoes by air? What is the total quantity of petrol that has been required to transport them up to date?",10
9,Mr CHIFLEY,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"The carriage of freight by Trans-Australia Airlines is a purely commercial transaction. Neither the Minister for Air nor I would be aware of all of the details necessary in order to answer the honourable member's questions fully. The honourable member has inquired about the liability of Trans-Australia Airlines in the event of breakages of empty beer bottles. I should think that liability would be greater in the event of the breakage of bottles full of beer. I presume that the flights from Sydney to Perth, to which the honourable member has referred, would be flights on the ordinary passenger schedule, and that when freight is offering that remunerative trade is accepted. I shall make inquiries in this matter and inform the honourable member of the result as soon as possible.",10
10,Mr ADERMANN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation whether it is a fact that British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited, which began operations only sixteen months ago, now has a staff of «t least 200 employees and occupies the whole of the ground floor of a large insurthat ance building in Sydney? Is it a fact - that this huge staff has been built up in - order to keep two aircraft a week in the air carrying 74 passengers each way between Sydney and Vancouver? If so, will the Minister take the necessary steps to ensure that a drastic economy is effected immediately?",10
11,Mr DRAKEFORD,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"It is true that British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited has an office in Sydney. I do not know the number of employees on its staff there. Australia is only a part-shareholder in that company. It owns 50 per cent, of the shares, New Zealand owns 30 per cent, and the United Kingdom owns 20 per cent. The corporation which controls it is operating a service of two flights weekly from Australia to San Francisco and one flight each fortnight to New Zealand. As is the case with every airline operating to America, the number of passengers carried has been seriously affected by the dollar shortage. The purpose of the airline is to maintain a connection between Australia and the United States of America and Canada, and it is hoped that, when the dollar situation clears, the patronage of the service will be greater than at present. I cannot say wbether the number of employees in the airline's office in Sydney is more than is required. The report of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited has not yet been supplied to the Australian section of its ownership. However, as soon as it comes to hand I shall ask the Australian representatives to have the matter examined. I am satisfied that it is essential to maintain the air connection between Australia and America, and I am also satisfied that British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited is operating one of the best services in the world. PETROL.",11
12,Mr WILLIAMS,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I ask the Prime Minister whether the Australian Government, through its representatives abroad, has made a survey of the quantity of petrol that could be imported into this country from Russia, Roumania and Poland? If quantities of petrol are found to be available in those countries for sterling payment, is the Government prepared to grant the import licences will be required before the petrol can be imported?",11
13,Mr CHIFLEY,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"It must be remembered that the importation of petrol is entirely in the hands of private companies. The ramifications of those companies are very extensive. The Australian Government is concerned only with the dollar content of petrol that is brought into this country and does not make inquiries about the sources from which it is obtained. If a company applies for a licence to import petrol, the Government, in considering the application, is guided by what the petrol will cost in terms of dollars. The British Treasury has to meet the deficit between our dollar earnings and our dollar expenditure. I have already stated clearly to the press that if the purchase price and the cost of transport of petrol that comes as part of an ordinary transaction from countries behind what is known as the Iron Curtain can be met in sterling, we are prepared to issue the necessary import licences. We make a careful survey of all offers of goods from behind the Iron Curtain, because we consider that in many instances they are made for political reasons. We have been told that there is a shortage of petrol in countries behind the Iron Curtain, and that may or may not be true. If a company discovers that it can import sterling petrol, by which I mean petrol the cost and carriage of which can be paid for entirely in sterling, the Australian Government will issue the necessary import licences. ARMED FORCES. AKMY VEHICLES.",11
14,Mr DAVIDSON,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Will the Minister for the Army say whether it is true, as bas been stated recently, that the Australian Army has little or no transport of its own and that nearly all the vehicles that it uses, such as staff cars, heavy duty trucks and bren gun carriers, are owned and controlled by the Department of Supply and Development and that the Army has to requisition them from that department whenever they are required? If that is the position, does the Minister agree that it is undesirable from the point of view of both maintenance and adminisare tration? Will he take immediate steps to remedy it?",11
15,Mr CHAMBERS,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"It is not correct to say that the Army is supplied with transport by a government department other than a service department. A pera centage of head-quarters cars is taken from the transport pool, but the vehicles used by units are issued to the units, and belong to the service. All units have their own vehicles. DOLLAR DEFICITS.",12
16,Mr DUTHIE,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Will the Prime Minunderstood ister state whether, having regard to fact that our inability to earn sufficient dollars is due largely to the reluctance inability of the United States of America to purchase sufficient goods from Ausrestrictive. tralia, the Government has explored every possible way in which we can earn dollars by the sale of our primary products or manufactured goods? Has consideration been given to the creation of new types products for export that are likely to sought after by the United States of America?",12
17,Mr CHIFLEY,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"The problem of earning additional dollars has been under close investigation by the Department Commerce and Agriculture for a long time. In order to facilitate the investidifficulty gations, the Government has established a special inter-departmental committee which works under a Cabinet subhas committee. Dr Roland Wilson, the Commonwealth Statistician, is chairman of the committee, which was appointed to investigate every possible avenue which additional dollars might be earned in the United States of America or, deed, in the hard currency areas very generally. It must be remembered that the field is very limited. For instance, as far as primary products are concerned, we have entered into contracts with the United Kingdom for the supply of meat, under which that country takes all our surplus meat. There is only a limited amount of butter for export to countries other than Great Britain. The United Kingdom meat contract applies also to pig meats and a number of other compect modities of that kind. As I have there is a very limited field as far as additional markets for primary products concerned, and I can assure the honourable member that that particular matter has been examined very closely. One of the factors that must bo rememits bered is that the American ariff + operates on a very high schedule of rates, fact with which the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction is fully familiar, as the American tariff was discussed at very great length at the international trade conferences at Geneva and Havana. It is proving very difiicult to induce the Americans even to reduce the rate of duty on wool. One of the other factors affecting this matter that is not clearly in this country is that apart the from, the high American tariff rates, the interpretation and applicability or of the rates often have the effect of making the American tariff most All those matters have to be studied. Although a consignment of export goods to America may include only 10 per cent., 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, of a commodity of a standard subof ject to a high rate of tariff, the higher be rate is applied to the whole of that particular commodity. It is a very complex matter. I repeat that every possible avenue is being explored to ascertain whether it is possible to inof crease our dollar earnings through additional exports to America. Our great at the moment is that the sale of goods by the sterling area to America, both in respect of volume and prices, been very much reduced. In the June quarter of this year the returns from the sale of tin, cocoa, rubber, wool and several other commodities fell by by one-third compared with the previous quarter. Some of our great difficulties inare due to the fact that we are earning much less in dollars now even when we .are selling the same quantity of goods. RAIL TRANSPORT. STANDARDIZATION OF GAUGES.",12
18,Mr THOMPSON,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Can the Minister for Transport say what progress has been made in reaching agreement with State governments on the subject of standardization of railway gauges, and what prosthere is of this work being put in said, hand in the near future ?",12
19,Mr WARD,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Progres s in this important work bas been delayed by the failure of the Government of New South Wales to ratify what is known as the three-State agreement, which is an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. It appears that New South Wales is not prepared at this stage to proceed with the work. Direct negotiations are now taking place with individual States. I am to visit Western Australia at an early date to discuss with the Government of that State the rehabilitation of its railways, and this will involve the standardization of the gauge on the trans-Australian line from Kalgoorlie to Perth. There are also to be discussions with officials in South Australia and Victoria, and it is hoped that, as a result, some progress will be made at an early date. COMMUNISM.",12
20,Mr FRANCIS,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Has the Minister for. External Affairs seen a recent report from Singapore which states that Communists from several Pacific countries, including Australia, are convening an international conference at Peiping in China later this year to discuss a ""Red Master Plan "" for the Pacific. In view of the revolutionary character of the decisions likely to be made at the conference, and of the losses inflicted on our own people by Communists during the recent coal strike, will the Minister refuse passports or vises to known Australian Communists who desire to attend the conference?",13
21,Dr EVATT,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,The matter of vises comes within the jurisdiction of the Department of Immigration. I am not aware that the conference to which the honourable member has referred is to be held.,13
22,Mr FRANCIS,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,Will the Minister make inquiries about it ?,13
23,Dr EVATT,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I shall inquire into the matter. So far as Australia is concerned, the Communists have been in full and open retreat since the recent coal strike.",13
24,Mr RANKIN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"In view of the Prime Minister's emphatic declaration that the Government regards the banning of the Communist party as a complete futility, can it be taken that he now intends to give effect to the threat of the Minister for Information to put Australian Communists into concentration camps? If not, what effective action does the Government intend to take, as a government, to deal with members of the Communist party?",13
25,Mr CHIFLEY,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I dealt only yesterday with the proposed banning of communism. I have indicated in answer to questions at various times that if Communists, or any other members of the community, engage in subversive activities, illegal activities, or activities calculated to destroy order and good government, they will be dealt with - in accordance with the law. I do not propose to say any more on the subject except that the necessary action will he taken when the necessity for it arises.",13
26,Mr ANTHONY,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I desire to ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction a question based upon a report that a young man employed in London by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization was alleged to have taken a leading part in a Communist disturbance in front of Australia House. Will the Minister say whether it is a fact that the Government has received a summary of an official inquiry in London into the incident, and whether Mr T. R. Kaiser, the young man referred to, took part in a demonstration which protested against the gaoling of union leaders during tb.i coal strike? If so, will the Minister state what the Government intends to do about Mr Kaiser? Will he make available to the House a copy of the report which has been received on the subject?",13
27,Mr DEDMAN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"It is true _ that a young man named Kaiser did take part in a demonstration outside Australia House in London. Kaiser was appointed to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, as it tben was, in 1943. During the war, he did excellent work in the Radio-physics Division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, some of it of a highly secret nature, but there was no suggestion that information about the work was divulged to unauthorized persons.",13
28,Mr HARRISON,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,How does the Minister know ?,13
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Order ! I ask honourable members to observe the courtesies of the House. Yesterday, some of them spent a good deal of time criticizing the Chair. Let them now reflect upon their own conduct.",13
30,Mr DEDMAN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"It has been alleged that Mr Kaiser, at a later stage, became a member of the Communist party. He was awarded a two years' scholarship by the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to be taken out in the United Kingdom, and two years ago he went to the United Kingdom to take up the scholarship. The members of the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at that time were Sir David Rivett, Dr A. E. V. Richardson, Dr Clunies Ross, and Dr E. W. G. White. There were then only four members on the executive and honourable members will appreciate that those four gentleto men are thoroughly loyal and trustworthy persons. Mr Kaiser has been studying in the United Kingdom on the scholarship which was awarded to him. It is alleged that he took part in a demonstration in front of Australia House not very long ago. Immediately the Government received information to that effect it ordered an inquiry, which duly took place and a summary of that inquiry is in the hands of the Government. As the result of consideration of the situation by the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Mr Kaiser's appointment with the organization has been terminated.",14
31,Mr LANG,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction whether the Government has obtained full reports giving the number of government scholarship holders who participated in a Communist demonstration outside Australia House, London, last month. Did the demonstrators include a Mrs Daphne Gollan, former secretary of the Communist New Housewives Association and former librarian and research worker of the Communist-controlled Federated Iron workers Association? Is she the wife of Robin Allan Gollan, who is at present attending London University on a national university scholarship? Was Gollan, who is a brother of W. E. Gollan, a member of the Communist party executive, among the demonstrators? When Gollan was given his scholarship, was the Government aware of his Communist activities, and that he was a member of the Australian new Australians ? delegation to the Communist International Youth Conference held in New Mexico in 1942?",14
32,Mr DEDMAN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"So far as I am aware no other Australian Government employee participated in the demonstrations in front of Australia House, but I shall make inquiries and advise the honourable member of the result of them in due course. IMMIGRATION .",14
33,Mr RYAN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I address a question to the Minister for Immigration relating to Somers camp. Can the Minister state the number and types of migrants who will be accommodated there? Are their services to be made available locally or are they be held there only temporarily pending their transfer to other districts? If the latter is the case, what payments do those migrants receive when in camp, and who is responsible for such payments?",14
34,Mr CALWELL,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Generally , Somers camp can be described as what we call a holding camp for women and children. It will take at least 700 persons and we hope to build up its capacity to 1,000.",14
35,Mr WHITE,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"It could go to 1,500.",14
36,Mr CALWELL,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Perhaps , as the honourable member for Balaclava suggests, it could go up to 1,500. The honourable member for Balaclava was commanding officer there in the Royal Australian Air Force in the days when the camp was a very large Air Force establishment. We want to employ some migrant male labour in that particular district, and we are examining the possibility of using the camp as a hostel for workers as well as for a holding camp for migrants' wives and dependants. The people who live in holding centres pay, on the average, 25s. a week whilst those occupying places in departmental hostels pay £2 12s. 6d. a week for board and lodgings. Generally, conditions at the hostels are much better than those at holding centres. Our original idea was to use Somers camp, which is within 40 miles of Melbourne, as a centre to which new Australians working in Melbourne could go at the week-end to see their wives and dependants.",14
37,Mr RYAN,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,Are all of those persons,14
38,Mr CALWELL,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Yes , at present. I iiope that when we get over the rush which we are now experiencing in handling these people, and which will possibly continue for a year or so, we shall be able to use the camp for the handling of British migrants who come to Australia.",15
39,Mr BEALE,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I direct a question to the Minister for Immigration. I have been informed by some displaced persons and others associated with them that there is a great deal of discontent amongst displaced persons who are working under the terms of the contracts under which they entered Australia about what they regard as the breach of a promise that was made to them before they came to - this country. They say that they were - promised that, if they came to Australia, - they would be permitted to live with their wives here. Will the Minister have inquiries made in order to find out whether or not such a promise was made to them in Europe? If it was made, will he make Mtre that a similar promise is not made to other persons about to come here from Europe? Will he also take steps to ameliorf te the position of those who are here, so that, as far as possible, they be able to live with their womenfolk while they are working here under contract ?",15
40,Mr CALWELL,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Promise s were made to persons who were invited to volunteer to come to Australia under the condition,"" that we laid down that, at the earliest possible moment, we would enable families to be re-united so that the bread-winners would be able to maintain them in the localities in which they were working. Promises were made that we would give every other assistance within our power to make these people happy in their new surroundings. Because of the housing shortage which affects the Australian public-tb e honourable gentleman is probably not aware of it-it is not possible to enable every displaced person sent to a particular town to rent a house in that town.",15
41,Mr BEALE,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,Were they the only promises that were made?,15
42,Mr CALWELL,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"No . I have told the honourable member that we promised that we would do our very best to re-unite familirs as soon as possible. There may be some discontent amongst some of those people because they cannot all live in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart or wherever they may want to live and cannot do just precisely what they want to do. However, it must be borne in mind that many Australians who follow seasonal occupations bave to go away from their homes at various periods of the year. The new Australians, of course, come from very crowded districts in Europe and they are not accustomed to conditions that obtain in Australia. There may be some discontent amongst some of them. One finds unreasonable people everywhere. There are even unreasonable people in the Liberal party.",15
43,Mr MCDONALD,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,A very small minority.,15
44,Mr CALWELL,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"- I know that the honourable member has to put up with a lot as the party Whip. We do our very best to satisfy all the people who come here. We operate upon the good principle, for both old Australians and new Australians, of doing the greatest good for the greatest possible number and may I think that generally we have achieved good results. GAS.",15
45,Mr DALY,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Has the Prime Minister read a report published in today's press that a substantial increase of the price of gas has been granted by the Victorian Liberal Government to the Metropolitan Gas Company, and the Brighton Gas Company in Melbourne? Is the right honourable gentleman aware that this is the fourth price rise that has been granted to these companies since the rents and prices referendum was held in May of last year? Is he also aware that there is considerable dissatisfaction among consumers over this further substantial increase? Finally, is this not a striking indication of the ineffective manner in which prices are controlled by Liberal and Country party governments in the State sphere?",15
46,Mr CHIFLEY,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"I have not seen the press report to which the honourable member has referred, but I know that several increases of the price of gas have been approved, and that an application for a further increase of price had been made. Apparently that increase has been granted as the press has indicated, if course, the press report can be taken as a reliable guide. I have said previously that, with divided control, great difficulties would arise in co-ordinating prices in the various .States and inevitably great increases of prices would result. That has occurred. Because of all the difficulties associated with prices control the Commonwealth was anxious to retain that control on a uniform basis as far as possible so that rises in costs could be checked. It must be clear that there are certain elements affecting costs which would inevitably result in some price increases irrespective of who controlled tbem. Those increases, however, have been very much greater under the divided control, or the lacki of co-ordinated control by the States, than would otherwise bave been the case. WHEAT.",15
47,Mr TURNHULL,LAN D SETTLEMENT OF,"Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture state whether certain importing countries listed in the International Wheat Agreement have not yet ratified the agreement ? If so, bow many countries are so situated? Have these countries been given extended time for ratification, and, if so, is it not unfair, and economically unsound, that those countries should be able to wait and watch the wheat market before becoming parties to the agreement, whilst Australia has been a party and has been receiving the lower price fixed by the agreement since the 1st August last?  honourable member has questioned the fairness of some countries being able to delay the ratification of the agreement. I point out that the conditions of attachment to the agreement are laid down in the agreement itself and that the honourable member voted in this Parliament in favour of the agreement. I shall be glad to furnish to the honourable member as soon as possible a list of the countries which have still to ratify the agreement. ELECTORAL. NA FBANCHTSE.",16
48,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TEBBITOBT,"I direct a question to the Minister acting for the Minister for the Interior. Is it a fact that a direc, of tive has been issued by the Department of the Interior in relation to employees in the Australian Capital Territory who are in receipt of living-away-from-home allowances that they are entitled to vote at the forthcoming elections in the Australian Capital Territory? If this is so, for what purpose is the living-away-fromhome allowance paid? Is a person who is temporarily resident in the Australian Capital Territory and in receipt of such an allowance entitled to vote here, and, if so, is he disqualified from voting in the electorate in which he ordinarily resides?; Has this directive been issued so as to. make it easier for the Labour candidate^ to fight the next election ?",16
49,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TEBBITOBT,"To attempt to go intothe details of the application of livingaway-from-home allowances in Canberrai would take up a considerable amount oif the time of the House. I know most of the facts associated with the question, but I think that it would be better if I had a statement prepared and read it to the House on another occasion so that the whole matter could be fully explained. NA BILL 1949. Motion (by Mr Dedman) agreed toThat leave bc given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1948. Bill presented, and read a first time. .SECOND READING.",16
50,Mr DEDMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [11.10] - by leave-l move That the bill be now read a second time. By this bill it is proposed' to effect the amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act which were forecast in the budget speech. The most important of the amendments extends the depreciation allowances for wear and tear of plant and machinery. Honourable members will recall that, in 1946, measures were taken by this Government to assist the post-war rehabilitation of industry and the establishment of new industries in this country. One of the taxation concessions granted to industry at that time was the allowance of an initial depreciation deduction amounting to 20 per cent, of the cost of plant acquired or installed during the period from the 1st July, 1945, to the 30th June, 1950. The allowance has provided great benefits to industry, as it has served to offset, to a large degree, the inflated costs of new equipment in the post-war period. Leaders of industry have represented to the Government that an extension of the period of the allowance is necessary, as the high costs of plant replacement have not only been accentuated since 1946, but also are likely to continue indefinitely. To meet the needs of industry, the bill contains a clause extending the concession for a further two years until the 30th June, 1952. This extension will assist manufacturers in long-range plans for plant replacement and expansion. At the same time, the Government has recognized that industry would be further assisted by increasing the initial depreciation allowance from 20 per cent, to 40 per cent. It is proposed in this bill, therefore, to afford taxpayers an opportunity, if they so elect, to deduct 40 per cent, of the cost of new plant in lieu 20 per cent, now allowed. This increased allowance conforms broadly with amendments of the United Kinsrdom income decision tax law which were made earlier this year. The bill also contains a provision rements garding the concessional rebate of tax on life assurance premiums, superannuabe tion fund contributions, friendly society payments and the like. Since 1936, total payments in respect of which this particular rebate is allowed to a taxto payer have been limited to a maximum £100 in each year. Taxpayers now find ""hemselves obliged to expend proportionshall itely greater sums in order to make suitable provision for their retirement or for .heir dependants. In recognition of this ""act, the Government proposes to raise he maximum to £150. A small technical amendment included in the bill will enable taxpayers to obtain credit in respect tax instalment stamps which they have purchased but which have been destroyed before remission in pavment of tax. is customary with bills amending the Income Tax Assessment Act, an explanaAlthough tory memorandum has been prepared Mr Dedman. the information of honourable members. 1 commend the bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr SPENDEB) adjourned. OBJECTION TO MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER'S RULINGS.",16
51,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Richmond) [11.14]. - I move That the .Ruling of the Deputy Speakerthat the terms of the matter proposed to be discussed on the 2nd March, 1949, on a motion for the adjournment of the House to be moved by the right honourable the member for Cowper, had been the subject of a previous debate this session-be disagreed with. I regret that I have to pursue a subject that was dealt with so fully yesterday in the debate on the motion of want of confidence in you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the motion which I have submitted relates to a specific ruling that you have given. First, I take great exception to the long delay in the bringing of this matter before the House. From time to time honourable members bave been told that if they are dissatisfied with a ruling of the Chair, their remedy lies in notifying their dissent in writing, in the orderly course of of the the conduct of this House. Standing Order 287 readsI f any objection is taken to the ruling or of the Speaker, such objection must bc taken at once, and in writing . . . I complied with both of those requireand Motion made, which, if seconded, shall proposed to the House, and debate thereon forthwit h adjourned to the next sitting day. the I point out that although I moved my motion on the 2nd March, an opportunity debate this matter has only now been of accorded me. The Standing Order specifically mentions that debate on a motion be adjourned to the next sitting day.",17
52,Mr SCULLY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member has had plenty of time to think about it.,17
53,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"My complaint is that there bas been plenty of time for the matter to be forgotten. If justice is of to be satisfactory in any department of life it is very essential that it shall be meted out promptly. There was no As obstacle in the way of this matter being determined by the Parliament. early in March the circumfor stances relating to this ruling by the Chair were fresh in the minds of all honourable members, the heavy volume of business that has since been dealt with by the House since then may have caused many of the details to be forgotten. My motion of dissent from your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, arose as a result of an effort that was made by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) to move the adjournment of the House to deal with specific matters relating to the health of the community. In this connection, Standing Order 38 provides that a motion for the. adjournment of the House shall be proposed only under certain conditions. The Standing Order is lengthy. In brief, it provides that an honourable member must rise in his place, and that his motion must be supported by five other honourable members. It does not provide that notice must be given of an honourable member's intention. The relevant portion of Standing Order 38 provides that an honourable member. . . before the business of the day is culled on, rising in his place shall propose to move the adjournment for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance (which he shall then state and hand in, in writing to the Speaker-) . . . He is then given the right to address the House on his motion. The right honourable member for Cowper was refused that permission by you on certain spontaneous grounds. I again take the gravest exceppharmaceutical tion to the manner in which you drew voluntary your authority to reject the right honour the able gentleman's petition, because you based it upon the tenth edition of May's service. Parliamentary Practice, which you cited. The following passage appears at page 241 of that editionThe Speaker also is bound to apply to matters the established rules of debate, to enforce the principle that subjects excluded by those rules cannot be brought forward thereon; such as a matter under adjudication by a court of law, or matters already discussed during the current session . . . I should like to know why you had recourse to the tenth edition of May when there is a copy of the fourteenth edition in the Parliamentary Library. Doubtis less you would have a copy of that most recent edition in your possession. page 375 of the fourteenth edition this rule appearsA motion or an amendment may not be brought forward which is the same in stance as a question which has been decided in the affirmative or negative during the current session. The ruling given by you on that occasion is at variance with that provision to a substantial degree. This pertinent section of the fourteenth edition continues The rule may he stated fully as follows:No question or bill shall be offered in either House that is substantially the same as one on which its judgment has already been expressed in the current session. Tbis rule varies considerably from the one contained in the tenth edition of May published many years ago, on which you relied.",17
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order ! The honourable gentleman should use titles in order to conform with the Standing Orders.,18
55,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am sorry if I have offended in that respect. I am referring to yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker. The right honourable member for Cowper, who is a doctor of medicine by profession, endeavoured to bring before the House certain matters relating to public health. The right honourable gentleman desired to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussingThe urgent necessity of securing the full, co-operation of the medical, dental, and nursing professions, of State and hospital organizations and of sickness benefit organizations with Commonwealth Government to ensure a successful and satisfactory national health That was disallowed by Mr Deputy Speaker. I ask honourable members to note particularly the wording of that these motion. Mr Deputy Speaker disallowed and it on the ground that it conflicted with the rulings given in the tenth edition of May and also on the ground that it was a matter that had been discussed in the current session, in the preceding year, when the National Health Service Bill 1948 was brought down. I point out that if that ruling to be insisted upon, honourable members will be virtually unable to, bring At anything before this House after the budget session, because almost everything that one can conceive to be spoken about is discussed during that session. If it subwere insisted upon by the Chair that nothing that had been dealt with in a current session could be used as the basis of a motion for the adjournment df the House, there would be complete strangulation of the principles of debate in connection with such motions. Immediately after Mr Deputy Speaker had ruled that motion out of order, the right honourable member for Cowper wrote out, and handed to Mr Deputy Speaker, a fresh motion for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussingThe urgent necessity of implementing diately a successful and satisfactory national health scheme. As soon as the right honourable member for Cowper did that, in compliance his rights under the Standing Orders, Mr. Deputy Speaker ruled that he would not accept the motion because the right honourable gentleman had not given due notice of it. I repeat that there is provision in the Standing Orders that due motice ought to be given. The rulefact is very definiteand clear-. Standing Qrd'er3'S provides that an honourable said'member shall' write out the motion that he intends to move, and hand it to Mr. Speaker, and:' that if' be i's supported five other honourable members the motion shall be put before the House. The right honourable gentlema'n complied ' with that Stand'mg' Order. Mr Taaacpsoir - But regard must Be bad for established' custom.",18
56,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I agree with the scheme. honourable member for Hindmarsh, (Mr. Thompson )-. Established' custom demand!?that a» motion* for Ifheadjournment of the House-,, based onmaterial such as thatfpresented by the right honourable 1 member for Cowper; shall' Be placed' beforethe House I agree, also, that is highly desirable that notice should be given to Mr Speaker, the Prime Minishad ter, a-nd the Minister wbo may have to deal withthesubject. . Sir, EAHLE P'AOE - Notice , was giveninthis> instance..",19
57,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I contend that if is' to be mandatory that notice shall given, that, provision ought' to be included, in. the Standing Orders. Mr Speaker or his deputy, should' not be called! upon suddenly to adjudicate wbether reference to a matter of very great importance is in order or otherwise. However, the right honourable member for Cowper was prevented from proceeding on the ground that the matter that he proposed to discuss had already been dealt with by the House. A fortnight later the Minister for Social Services (Senator MCKenna) introduced the Pharmaceutical Benefits Bill 1949 into another place. That measure dealt with a matter that is immesubstantially the same as that to which the right honourable member for Cowper desired torefer on his motion for the adjournment of the House. Indeed, it with might almost be said that in many respects the contents of the measure had heen filched from the public announcement that the right honourable gentleman had been compelled to make to the press no in lieu of making it to this House. I direct the attention of the House to the that the Minister fbr Health, in moving the second reading, of that bill,, Under this bill there will' be no compulsion on medical practitioners or pharmaceutical by chemists to tnlte part in the scheme. 1 The matter to which the right honourable member fbr Cowper desired to refer was the urgent necessity of securing the full 1 and', spontaneous co-operation' of the medical and .pharmaceutical professionswith the Government toensure a satis*fa-ctory and successful national health It. was,, in substance;, the matter that; was dealt with by the Pbarmav ceutical BenefitsBills 1949>.. Neverthev less, a fortnight before that bill was' introduced,. Mr Deputy Speaker denied 1 the righthonoraible member for Cowper - 1 the right to move the adjournment' of the* it House on. the ground that the matter that, he proposed, toi discuss was' one that' 1 been fully debated' by the House' within the lastr. few/ preceding; months'.. Having, regard to the long debate that took place yesterday regarding the conduct' of the; Chair, I do not intend to it labour this matter unduly. I direct the be attention' of the House again, to a passage that occurs at page 3.75 of the. fourteenth edition, of May, because theincident in. which the: right, honourable;member for Cowper was involved may be said to establish a precedent under which other honourable members will be deprived of their rights in the future. The passage is as follows:Matters already decided during the same session - A motion or an amendment may not be brought forward which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided . . . during the current session. An obligation is cast upon the occupant of the chair to distinguish between a motion which is the same in substance as one that has been dealt with during the current session and a motion which touches only in some degree upon matters that have already been discussed during the session. If the occupant of the chair were to give rulings on the lines of your ruling on that occasion, Mr Deputy Speaker, there would be scarcely a matter that a private member could discuss on a May:formal motion for the adjournment of the House. I protest against the Government's disalready decided. regard of the Parliament by delaying until the 9th September a motion of dissent from a ruling of the Chair was given as far back as the 2nd Medical March. The motion refers to a very to simple matter, and it could have been posed of on the day following occurrence of the incident if the Government had been conscious of the rights of honourable members of this House.",19
58,Sir EARLEPAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I formally second the motion.,20
59,Mr DEDMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [11.30] - On the 2nd March of this year the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) intimated that be desired to move the adjournment of the House for pose of discussing the matter:The urgent necessity of securing the full, spontaneous co-operation of the medical, pharmaceutical and .nursing profession, State and hospital organizations and of tary sickness benefit associations with the Commonwealtii Government to ensure a successful and satisfactory national health service. The proposed motion was rejected by Mr . Deputy Speaker on the ground that that matter had already been full y discussed that session, that is, this session of the Parliament. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) has said that the matter was discussed in the previous year; but, in fact, it was discussed only three months prior to the 2nd March. It was very full y debated on the motion for the second reading of the National Health Service Bill , to which the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), who was then Acting Leader of the Opposition, moved an amendment which covered practically the same ground as the matter that the honourable member for Cowper desired to discuss on his motion for the adjournment of the House. Parliamentary practice prohibits debate upon a matter that has already been decided by the House. In addition, the following principle is enunciated at page 426 of Reference to the debates of the current session is discouraged, even if such reference is not irrelevant, as it tends to reopen matters The right honourable member for Cowper really desired to use the forms of the that House to put the case for the British Association regarding its refusal co-operate with the Government in the disimplementation of legislation that had the been passed by the Parliament.",20
60,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I rise to order. The sincerity of an honourable member in proposing a motion to the House should not be impugned. The Minister has said that the right honourable member for Cowper, in attempting to bring his motion before the House, was acting as the spokesman of the British Medical Association. There is no justification for such a statement.",20
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"There is no point of order involved. It is purely the puran expression of opinion. following Mr Dedman - I do not think that any one could imagine a more flagrant attempt to use the forms of the House in dental, a manner contrary to parliamentary of practice. The attempt was rejected by volun Mr Deputy Speaker, who quoted from page 241 of the tenth edition of May as follows: The Speaker is bound to apply to these motions the established rules of debate and to enforce the principle that subjects excluded by those rules cannot be brought forward thereon; such as a matter under adjudication by a court of law, or matters already discussed during the present session, whether upon a previous motion for adjournment, upon a substantive motion, upon an amendment or upon an order of the day. In plain fact, the right honourable member for Cowper was endeavouring to obstruct the business of the country, and was using the forms of the House to do so. The honourable member for Richmond, the mover of this motion, has overlooked the fact that Mr Speaker has to be satisfied, before allowing a debate to proceed, that the proposal complies with certain conditions such as whether it is specific, and whether it is urgent, also whether the debate would be in conformity with the rules of procedure generally agreed upon. I refer the House to an extract from page 344 of May's Parliamentary Practice., fourteenth edition, which quotes the attitude of Mr. Speaker Peel to urgency motions generally. The extract readsWhat I think was contemplated was the occurrence of some sudden emergency either in home or foreign affairs. But I dn not think it was contemplated . . . that a question of very wide scope, which would demand legislation to deal with it in any effective manner, Hamilton, L . W. should be the subject of discussion . . . In fact, the matter that the right honourable member for Cowper wished to raise, was not an urgent matter in that it had already been dealt with only three months earlier in this Parliament. I submit that agreed to. Mr Deputy Speaker's ruling was a correct statement of parliamentary practice, and that his ruling therefore should be upheld by this House. Motion (by Mr SCULLY) proposed - That the question be now put.",20

65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Has the honourable member been misrepresented?,22
66,Sir EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"My action has been misrepresented. After I formally seconded the motion upon which the House has just voted, I gave way as a courtesy to the Minister, and then was prevented from speaking to the motion.",22
67,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [11.49] - I move That the Ruling of the Deputy Speakerthat the proposed amendment of the Right Honourable the Leader of the Opposition to the motion for the second reading of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was outside the terms of the bill-be disagreed with. This is a motion of dissent from a ruling given by the Chair. The incident out of which it arose took place some time ago, and for two reasons I do not propose to occupy the time of the House with it. First, it has been made perfectly clear within the last 24 hours-if it needed to be made clear-that any such motion will be dealt with on party lines, and automatically defeated. I am no fonder of wasting my own time than I am of wasting other people's, and it would be a waste of time to debate this motion, which ought to be considered on its merits as a matter of interpretation, but which we are now told quite plainly will be dealt with as a party matter. Secondly, if a motion of this kind is to be discussed, honourable members with a point of view regarding it might desire an opportunity to express their point of view. Although it is Friday morning, and 70 minutes before the time the House is due to adjourn, one motion of dissent has already been gagged after one speech from this side of the House. I do not propose to instigate any more such foolish proceedings. I can only express my astonishment, and indicate that I do not intend to offer any argument at all on the motion.",22
68,Mr DEDMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [11.51] - Since the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) does not propose to offer any argument on this motion, it is not necessary for me to do so, either. I merely wish to make this point: The right honourable gentleman suggested that every matter brought before the House should be considered on its merits. My reply is that every matter brought before the House is considered on its merits, but it can happen that a proposition which the Leader of the Opposition and honourable members opposite think has some merit, in the opinion of the Government has no merit at all.

69,Mr HARRISON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I rise to order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I should like you to .advise honourable members of the question on which the last division was taken.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were circulated:CATTLE.",23
73,Mr ADERMANN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"the Minister for Commerce and A g r i c u l t u r e , upon notice I. Wheu was the New Zealand embargo upon the importation of Australian cattle imposed? 2. What was the reason for the embargo? 3. Has the Government made any representations to the New Zealand Government for lift in g of the embargo; if so, what was the result!  questions are as 1. Cattle from Australia excluding Tasmania to have never been allowed entry into New Zealand. The reason for the New Zealand embargo entry of Australian cattle is the existence in Australia of contagious bovine to a plcuro pneumonia and tick fever. 3. The question of lift in g the embargo was first raised with the New Zealand Government in July, 1936, and again in June, 1945. On the latter occasion the Australian Government's request was chiefly based on-(i ) the infrcqueiicji of occrrrence of pleuro pneumonia in States other than Queensland; (i i ) the contention that the use of the complement fixation test along with other specified precautions would allow the importation of cattle from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia into New Zealand with a high degree of safety. In reply, the New Zealand Government advised that serious consideration hod been given to all aspects of this matter, but referred to the fact that measures adopted in Australia had not prevented infection being brought into other States from Queensland and consequently New South Wales and Victoria must be regarded as possible sources of infection. Frrther that while the Dominion Government agreed that the complement fixation tost for pleuro pneumonia was undoubtedly a valuable diagnostic test, it was pointed out that no test was recognized to be 100 per cent, reliable, f t was also stated that, having regard to these aspects and the organized opposition of New Zealand farmers to the introduction of stock from any country from which contagious stock diseases might be brought, the New Zealand Government was not prepared at that stage to relax the existing prohibition on cattle from Australia, but was prepared to review the position from time to time with the object of permitting importation as soon as it should he abundantly clear that cattle could be imported from Australia without risk. PRIMARY PRODUCTS : EXPORTS TO BRITAIN. M.r. FADDEN asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. Are the increased butter and cheese prices in the latest contract with Great Britain expressed as payable in sterling? 2. Are prices under present meat, egg, pigment, dried f r u it , apple and other ducts contracts by Australia with GTeat Britain also expressed as payable in sterling? 3. In the event of a devaluation of sterling, what safeguards are there in each of such contracts protecting the Australian primary producer against loss?  right honourable gentleman's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. The possibility of a devaluation of sterling or of any alteration in the direct relationship of Australian currency to sterling, is not specifically mentioned in any of the long term contracts concluded with the United Kingdom Government in respect of the bulk purchase and sale of Australian primary products. In the case of the meat, butter and cheese and egg contracts, there is a provision in each whereby an annual review of the terms and conditions of the contract may be sought on substantial grounds. As regards all contracts, however, devaluation of sterling would be regarded by the Commonwealth Government as creating exceptional circumstances justifying reconsideration of such contracts. CRAIG'S BUILDINGS.",23
74,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"the Minister for the Interior, upon notice I. What was the price paid for the purchase by the Gommonwealth Government of Craig's Buildings, Elizabeth-street, Melbourne? 2. What has been the cost of alterations to date? 3. What has been the cost of furnishing and equipping the buildings? 4. Is it a fact that office furniture has been manufactured in Sydney for use in the above-mentioned buildings and delivered by furniture vans from Sydney; if so, how many van deliveries were made from Sydney for this purpose?",24
75,Mr JOHNSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The property known as Craig's Buildings, Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, was not purchased by the Commonwealth. It is owned by the Commonwealth Bank. I am not in a position to furnish the information desired. SOMERS CAMP. Mr R.YAN asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice I. To whom, at what date, for what price and subject to what conditions was Somers camp sold? 2. How much money was expended by the purchaser on improvements to Somers camp? 3. What sum was paid by the Government primary profor the re-purchase of the camp?",24
76,Mr JOHNSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. By the Commonwealth Disposals Cbmmission to the State of Victoria on or about 3rd October, 1947, for the sum of £19,690. 2. The State of Victoria subsequently sold the improvements to Feature Holidays Limited and granted the company a lease of the land for a term of 21 years. It is not known how much money was expended by either the State of Victoria or the company on improvements. 3. £145,000. GOLD.",24
77,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. What is Australia's present gold production and what is its value? 2. In view of the economic difficulties ot sterling bloc countries, would an increase in the official American rate from 35 to 55 dollars an ounce provide an additional 300,000,000 dollars a year for Great Britain and the Dominions, excluding Canada? 3. Does the International Monetary Fund control the price of gold; if so, will the Government appiy to the International Monetary Fund for an adjustment in the price of gold? 4. How long has the present price been in operation ?",24
78,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The total gold production of Australia and Kew Guinea during 1948 was about 977,500 fine ounces, worth approximately £A.10,520,000. 2. On the basis of 1948 production, the dollar value of the annual gold output of the British Commonwealth excluding Canada would be between 250,000,000 dollars and 300,000,000 dollars greater in the event of an increase of 20 dollars per fine ounce in the dollar price of gold than at present. 3. Under the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund, par values are determined for the currencies of member countries in terms of gold as a common denominator or in terms of the United States dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on the 1st July, 1944. Margins are also prescribed by the fund above and below par values for transactions in gold by members and no member may buy gold above par value plus the prescribed margin or sell gold at a price below par value minus the prescribed margin. Procedures are also laid down in the articles of agreement whereby under appropriate conditions the par value of the currency of a member may be altered and also a procedure for making a uniform proportionate change in the par values of the currencies of all members. The second part of this question relates to a matter of policy. 4. The proeent United States price of 35 dollars per fine ounce has been in operation since the 31st January, 1934. The Australian price of gold has been related to this after allowing for variations in rates of exchange, handling charges, freight and insurance. The present Australian price of £A.10 15s. 3d. per fine ounce has been in operation since June, 1945. INCOME TAX : REBATES.",25
79,Mr FRANCIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. In view of general hardships suffered people who are out of work because of sickness and who are compelled to live on their capital in the absence of any income, will he reconsider the limi t of £50 as the maximum amount of medical expenses for which a rebate may be claimed? 2. Did the Taxpayers Association recently ask the Government to increase from £100 to £300 rebatable expenses on life assurance premiums, friendly societies and superannuation; if so, what steps has the Government taken to meet this request?",25
80,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. This question was examined in 1944, when the l i m it of £50 applied to the total medical expenses of the taxpayer and bin spouse and children under the age of 21 years. Following the examination, the concession was enlarged so that the maximum rebatable amount of medical expenses became £50 for the taxpayer, £50 for his spouse and £5.0 for each of his children under 21 years of age. Thus, in the case of a taxpayer wit h a wife and two children, the rebatable amount may be as high as £200 each year. It is recognized that the linrit is exceeded in some cases, but the concession does substantially assist taxpayers who are obliged to incur medical expenses. It is considered that the present allowance is reasonable and accordingly it is not proposed to further increase the concessional allowance. 2. Yes. Representations urging an increase in the maximum rebatable amount for life assurance premiums, superannuation contributions and similar payments were received from many quarters. As announced in my budget speech, it is proposed to raise the maximum rebatable amount from £100 to £150. EMPIBE TRADING COMPANY.",25
81,Mr CTTAMBEBS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"On the 29th J u n e , the honourable member for F l in d e r s (Mr . R y a n ) asked a question r e g a r d in g t w o h i g h - r a n k i ng serving A r m y officers stationed in J a p a n being associated with an engineer of the State E l e c t r i c it y Commission of V i c to r i a in the for m at i o n of a company in J a p a n called the E m p i r e T r a d in g Company. I have investigated this matter, and desire to advise the honourable member as f o l l o w s : The Commander-in-Chief, British Commonwealth Occupation Force, has intimated that his head-quarters has no knowledge of any officers serving in Japan having acted in conjunction with an engineer of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria in regard to the formation of the Empire Trading Company. The Commander-in-Chief further advises that, if any officers made any inquiries on behalf of the State Electricity Commission in Victoria, by they were made without the knowledge or sanction of his head-quarters. It is a fart that an electrical, engineer of the State Electricity Commission visited Japan in 1948 and arranged contracts for the purchase of insulators on behalf of the Electricity Supply Association of Australia, members of which include the principal electricity authorities in Australia. The State Electricity Commission has informed my department that the engineer previously referred to is in no way associated with the Empire Trading Company, and that he is not aware of the identity of the principals of that company.",25
