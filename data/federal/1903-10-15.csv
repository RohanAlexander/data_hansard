1,Sir LANGDONBONYTH ON,Unknown,"on befor honourable half Mr SPEAKER, as Chairman) upon the'table the following report:The Li brary Committee has the honour to report as follows:1. The committee has realized that the duties intrusted to it by the Houses of the Federal Parliament are of the utmost importance, as i has looked forward to the probability establishment of a Federal Public Library, of which the Parliamentary Library will be only one department. It is also impressed with the importance of securing and preserving all works and documents connected with the discovery, settlement, and early history of the various States of the Commonwealth, and their attainment of responsible government, as well as their aspirations after Federation, including also all records relating to the establishment of the Commonwealth itself. 2. There are now 3,039 volumes in the Library. These comprise statutes of Great Britain, of the various States of the Commonwealth, and of other countries, as well as parliamentary papers, law reports, constitutional manuals, and works of reference. A very generous donation of 2,433 volumes has been made to the Library by the Government of the United States. This includes Congressional documents, statutes, and the Congrtagional Record, and in additiou there are several thousand pamphlets dealing with a wide variety of subjects of governmental concern. These have been classified and are being catalogued. 3. The committee is devoting special attention to Australasian literature. Already 445 volumes, some of them very rare, have been purchased, special efforts being made to secure all such works as are likely to be increasingly difficult to obtain as time goes on. 4. The committee is endeavouring to,form as complete a collection as possible of all official and other literature, and documents, including originals, relating to Federation, both before 1891 and since that date,' and especially of the pamphlets, broad-sheets, and polemical matter published in all the States from all points of view, during the campaigns which preceded the referenda on the acceptance of the Constitution. The Governments of some of the States have presented sets of parliamentary papers on the subject, and the committee will probably secure a complete series of these for the whole of the Commonwealth. 5. A very fine collection of cuttings from the illustrated papers at the time of the proclamation of the Constitution, and the opening of the first Parliament, has been presented by Mr A. Gilchrist, of Murtoa, Victoria. Mr Glynn, M.P., Mr R. P.. Garran, C.M.G., Mr J. K. Beid, Clerk of the House of Assembly, Hobart, Dr - Machattie, of Bathurst, New South Wales, and others, have made valuable donations of Federal literature. Some important papers have been purchased, and negotiations are in progress for the acquisition of others. 6. A sj'stem has been temporarily adopted by which current literature of all kinds is provided members, but not retained in the laid Library unless of permanent value. 7. All current official publications of the States of the Commonwealth, including Hansards and statutes, and also of other countries whose issues are likely to be useful, are obtained, and, as for as possible, by exchange instead of by purchase. The committee desires to acknowledge t the courtesy so for extended to it in this matter of the by certain States. 8. Newspapers from all parts of the Commonwealth ore filed in the Library, and two leading journals from each State are bound. There are now seventy-eight bound volumes of newspapers in the Library, dating from July, 1901. The files will be completed, as far as possible, back to the date of the inauguration of the Commonwealth, in January, 1901. 9. As the Parliament has the use of the Victorian Parliamentary Library, it is not the policy of the committee to buy largely books already available for members, unless copies are specially required, or there is reason to believe that anyparticular book may become difficult to obtain in a few years. But care is being taken, as time passes, to provide that, by the time the Parliament leaves Melbourne for the permanent capital, it shall possess a suitable and sufficient library for its own use, and the basis also for a collection of archives, and for a library worthy of the Commonwealth.

Although the question has been presented to me rather suddenly, my own feeling is that some recognition merited. I think that the public will realise that the members of the first Parliament occupied an unique position, and that, spective of any claims they may have other respects, a recognition of that fact would he appropriate. I will matter such consideration as I can.",14

18,Mr DEAKIN,HONOURS FOR MEMBERS OF,"I have no specific formation upon the subject, but it may not be inadvisable to mention that Earl Jersey, who is kindly acting-durin g the absence of Mr Heary Copeland, the Agent-General for New South Wales-as a member of the Pacific Cable Board, on behalf of the monwealth, cabled to me two days ago that he would be able to make a definite statebe ment very shortly. FEDERALFINANCES : SOUTH quarter, AUSTRALIA. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON asked the Treasurer, upon notice Whether he has seen the comments recently made and reported on the Federal finances reluting to the State of South Australia, and will he inform the House thereon ?",14
19,Sir GEORGE TURNER,HONOURS FOR MEMBERS OF,"I am not at present aware of the way in which the surer of South Australia has obtained the figures which he has used, but they do not at all agree with the figures of the Commonin wealth Treasury,- which show the actual upon cash received and paid during the three months. I might mention shortly that the Treasurer of South Australia puts the Customs receipts at about £10,000 less than approlast quarter, Whilst, as a matter of fact, the actual decrease is only between £5,000 and £6,000. In this instance the for South Australian Treasurer has omitted to add thelnter-Stateadjustments, and is really comparing figures which are not on the same basis. W it h regard to the Post and Teleis graph Department, the South Australian Treasurer shows a falling off of £5,000, whilst our actual receipts show an increase irreof £2,500. He shows the total falling off in for the quarter as £14,000, whilst the actual falling off in receipts has amounted give the to only about £3,000.",14
20,Mr GLYNN,HONOURS FOR MEMBERS OF,He has not made any allowance for the Pacific Cable either.,14
21,Sir GEORGE TURNER,HONOURS FOR MEMBERS OF,"So far as the receipts from the Post and Telegraph Department are concerned, one would expect a falling off, not so much in consequence of any action taken by the Federal Parliament by the States themselves with regard to the Eastern Extension Company's agreement, which means the States, to and with regard to the Pacific Cable, which means a considerable loss of revenue into South Australia. As a matter of fact, a peculiarity of this quarter is that the receipts show an increase. W it h regard to expenditure, also, I cannot follow the figures of the South Australian Treasurer. He shows a considerable increase of expenditure, amountComing to some £30,Q00. I have directed that expenditure in the various States should proceeded with as early as possible, instead of being kept back to the end of the year and the last quarter. Heavy expenditure will naturally be shown for the last unless we proceed with our expenditure early in the year. In repairs and maintenance the expenditure was £1,500; new works and buildings, £ 7 , 5 0 0 ; mail subsidy, which is ordinarly paid later in the year, £ 3 , 4 0 0 ; mails, paid earlier than usual, £ 1 1 , 0 0 0; military payments, made earlier than usual, £ 3 , 0 0 0; increases in salary, arising mostly in consequence of our having to carry out the Public Service Act, Treaand the greater portion of which would have been incurred in aiiy circumstances in the States, amount to £4,000. are as follow : NA Customs and ExciseSouth Australia Proper Northern Territory ...

22,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," Wit h the consent of the House, I move That the Standing Orders be suspendedso as to enable a Bill for .an Act to amend the Public Service Act to be introduced and passed through all its stages without delay. The Bill contains but one clause, amending paragraph (c) of section 80 of the Public Service Act, to enable us to extend the time during which those who have passed the examination under the Act may have an opportunity to enter the public service. Under the Act as it stands at present, after the passing of the examination, they may be called upon for duty at any time during nine months, and it is thought advisable that the period should be extended to two years. The period of nine months subsequent to the first examination is now almost exhausted, and under the circumstances in which thepubli'cserviceof the Commonwealth is conducted, by. the filling up of all possible vacancies in one Department from another, it is found that, as a matter of fact, in two of the States not a single one of the successf u l candidates at the examination has yet been called upon. I have consulted the Public Service Commissioner, and find that, in his opinion, two years would probably be a better period to provide for. The present condition of affairs is partly due to the exceptional circumstances attaching to the commencement of the Commonwealth, and the proposed amending Bill is intended simply to prevent those who have passed the examination from being struck off the list of eligibles before they have had any opportunity to secure the reward to which they are entitled. The proposal is eminently fair. It has been commended by many honourable members already, and on the last occasion by the honourable member for Wide Bay. I trust that at this stage of the session the House willallowthis extremely simple and non-controversial measure to pass through all its stages without delay. The principle clause of the proposed Amending Bill readsParagraph c of section SO of the Cmnmonweallh Bill. Public Service Act 1902 is hereby amended, and shall be taken to have been amended from the commencement of that Act by substituting for the words ""nine months"" the words ""two vears."" c of section 80 is to this effect: BILL. The Governor General may make regulations(c) Ifor examinations for fixing the fees payable for entrance examinations and for registering in the order of merit the names of all persons who have passed the entrance examinations, and those candidates who have been qualified at any such examinations may be appointed to fill subsequent vacancies arising within nine months thereof. If the Bill is agreed to, that provision will read "" within two years thereof.""",16
23,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Is it the intention to make the period of two years a permanent provision ?,16
24,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Yes . Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented and read a first time. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the Bill be now read a second time.,16
25,Mr FISHER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I think it is fair that some reason should be given for the introduction of this measure. I am very glad that the Government have introduced it. I have a list showing the state of affairs that exists in New South Wales and in the other States. In New South Wales, amongst the males who have passed the examination for telephone attendants, out of forty-eight only seven have been appointed, and the time is now nearly up.",16
26,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,A great many may be over age.,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Then they cannot be appointed.,16
28,Mr FISHER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"Amongs t the female successful candidates, only fifteen have been appointed out of forty who passed. In Victoria, only three have been appointed out of twenty-seven males who passed, and only four out of eighty females who passed. In Queensland, eleven males passed, and none have been appointed ; twenty females passed, and only one has been appointed. In Western Australia, twelve males passed, and none have been appointed. In Tasmania none have been appointed out of five who successfully passed the examination. Honourable members will see that it is quite unjust that the Act should be allowed to remain as it is, and I venture to think they will be 'unanimous in granting the concession proposed by this",16
29,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I quite agree that there is a necessity for extending the time ; but I doubt whether it is wise that, as a permanent provision of the law, we should permit of an extension from nine months to two years. It appears to me that two years is too long a period to elapse after each examination during \vhich successful examinees may be appointed.",16
30,Mr MAUGER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,It will not be long in passing.,17
31,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I think there should be an examination every year. I can understand two years being a reasonable period at the inception of the Commonwealth Public Service, but I do not think it should be made permanent. I think that perhaps eighteen months would be a fair period to allow.",17
32,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"That was my intention ; but I have been informed that two years would be a better period, and will do no injustice to any one. If the successful candidates are exhausted sooner we can have another examination.",17
33,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,I point out that for some of the grades the examination age is limited to between fourteen and sixteen years.,17
34,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,The age for appointment is fixed in some cases at sixteen years.,17
35,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"A lad or a girl may be just under fourteen years of age, and may be over the age before the next examination comes round, if a period of two years is to be allowed to elapse between the examinations.",17
36,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,This will not prevent examinations being held.,17
37,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,If the list were not exhausted I take it that no examination would be held.,17
38,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"When the list is approaching exhaustion the examination is held. It takes some time to give notice of the examination to conduct it, to go through the papers, to place the successful candidates in order, and so on. The Department will take care to keep up a steady supply.",17
39,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I think that it would be wise to substitute eighteen months for two years. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bil l read a second time. In Committee : Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Paragraph (c) of section eighty of the Commonwealth. Public Service Act 1902 is hereby amended, and shall be taken to have been amended from the commencement of that Act, by substituting for the words ""nine months"" the words ""two years."" I Mr.WATSON (Bland) - In order to test the feeling of the Committee upon this matter, I move That the words ""two years"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""eighteen months."" Under the Public Service Act the strong feature underlying admission to the Public Service of the Commonwealth is that it shall be by competitive examination, and . not merely by examination. It is not sufficient that a lad may be qualified to pass a certain examination-h e must be able to obtain a greater percentage of marks than other candidates. If every candidate who secures a mere "" pass"" can remain upon the list of those who are eligible for appointment for a period of two years, the provision may operate to the detriment of smarter young men or women who may qualify twelve or eighteen months later. If we unduly extend this period, we shall incur the risk of destroying in a large measure the competitive aspect of admission to the service. To my mind, eighteen months is a reasonable term to prescribe. If the list of successful candidates is not exhausted within that time, those who have not secured appointments may very well be asked to again submit themselves for examination if they are not over age, and if they are to give place to others.",17
40,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," This is a matter for the consideration of the Committee. Honourable members have heard the list which was read by the honourable member for Wide Bay. It shows that in some States, although nearly nine months have elapsed since the first examination was held, not a single successful candidate has been appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service. It is exceedingly doubtful whether that list will be nearly exhausted in another nine months. It was these circumstances which prompted an amendment of the Act in the direction of extending to two years the term during which successful candidates at the first examination should be eligible for appointment. As, however, this provision is intended to be of a permanent character, I do not feel inclined to resist the alteration proposed.",17
41,Mr GLYNN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Would it not be better to appoint them according to the number of marks which they obtain 1,17
42,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"That is the course which is at present followed. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Bil l reported with an amendment, passed through all its remaining stages. STANDING ORDERS. In Committee : Standing Order 1-^In all cases not provided for hereinafter, Sessional or other Orders, resort shall be had to pi-actice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland in force on the 1st day of January, 1901, which shall followed as far as they can be applied to the ceedings of the House of Representatives.",17
43,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I suggest for the venience of honourable members that upon the first Order any general remarks which they may desire to offer should be perprovided for. mitted, and that we should then proceed to consider each rule in its turn. chapter contains a proposal of some importance. It is that in cases which are provided for in these rules, resort shall had to the practice of the House mons upon the 1st day of January, 1901, which practice shall be followed as far can be applied to the proceedings of this House. As honourable members are aware, provision of that kind is customary in most, if not all, of our States Legislatures. possible that emergencies may are not fully provided for by these Standing Orders. In such circumstances, we must sacrificed 1 either remain without a chart or refer to some other source of authority. For the past half century or more it has been practice in all the Legislatures of the British Empire to turn to the House of Commons for guidance in such cases. The 1st January, 1901, has been chosen as the date upon which the Commonwealth was inaugureason rated, and upon which honourable members, therefore, may fairly be assumed to been familiar with the purport and character of the practice under which the business of the House of Commons was transacted. There are, indeed, few, if any, occasions which advantage is likely to be taken of this Order. So far as the Standing Orders ComThey mittee are able to see, they have provided in these rules for all contingencies which can arise. Nevertheless, in the modest spirit of not believing that they have sounded every possible depth or marked every possible quicksand, this provision been introduced to enable light to be quired upon the unforeseen difficulties which may occur, and to avoid having to interrupt the procedure of the House by and an endeavour to establish some precedent of our own. I am aware that there is something to be said both in favour of and in opposition to this proposal. There are those who contend that the House should not be bound except by express words or by and particular provisions. There is somethe thing to be said in support of thatview; but it . appears to the Standing Orders Committee, be which is a very responsible body, and inprocludes members of all political parties, that it would be wise to provide in advance' against circumstances which, after all, conmay happen, and in which it may be fouiad that, ful l and careful as these provisions are, something has been left un",18
44,Mr GLYNN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"Does ""practice"" mean someThe first thing analogous to common law 1",18
45,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"Yes . In this way, so not far as the experience of the mother of be Parliaments can afford it, we have all the of Comguidance which we can need.",18
46,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO, I am as it quite sure that the Committee are very desirous of giving Mr Speaker permanent a Standing Orders; but I would point out that it was the duty of the Government to It is submit these Orders at a much earlier arise which period of the session.,18
47,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,What should we have,18
48,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I am satisfied that the Prime Minister did not attempt to ask the the Committee to deal with the Standing Orders at an earlier date, because he felt that they would be soclosely examined and criticised that other important business would have to be sacrificed. It is for that that I consider that, in the absence of notice, the Standing Orders cannot now have Be dealt with in a couple of days.",18
49,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Thes e are not the Stand-* ing Orders first put forward. They have upon since been twice revised.,18
50,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I am aware of that. left the hands of the Committee only on the 7th inst., and now, without any notice, we are asked to deal with them. They are exceedingly important, and should receive the fullest consideration of every honourable member. Not only have we had has no notice of the intention of the Governacment to ask us to deal with them; but the indications have been that we should not be called upon to do so during the present session. The late Prime Minister indicated that he did not anticipate that an opportunity for their consideration - would occur before the prorogation, although I believe he stated that if time permitted they might be dealt with. The Prime Minister, when alluding on Thursday week last to the business with which Parliament would be asked to deal before the close of the session, saidThe Senate will have the whole of next week to dispose of'the various Appropriation Bills before them-the principal Appropriation Bill, that relating to works and buildings, and the two minor Bills relating to arrears. Those measures will occupy the time of the Senate during next week. If this House is fortunate enough to make its selection of the site-as I hope will be the case; if necessary sitting late and long for that purposeWe sat late and long and made a selectionthen, in the week following, the members of another place will have an opportunity of agreeing or disagreeing with us ; whilst we on our part shall take up the Defence Bill, and the minor measures that are still before Parliament. Those minor measures comprised the Patents Bill, the Extradition Bill, and several other Bills, and we have dealt with them. That business will occupy us while the Senate is considering the question of the site. If the Senate agrees with what we have done, practically the work of the session is over, and we shall depart. If the Senate does not agree-thoug h I cordially hope they will-w e shall take steps to endeavour to arrive at some harmonious agreement. Mr ""DEAKIN - In answer to the honourable member for Wide Bay, I mentioned that if an opportunity offered we should deal with the Standing Orders.",18
51,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I do not object to the fulfilment of that promise, but I contend that notice should have been given. ' Mr DEAKIN - I did not Standing Orders as being tantamount to a Government measure, and that is why I did not mention them on the occasion to which the honourable member refers.",19
52,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"If the Prime Minister had given a week's notice of his intention to ask the Committee to deal with the Standing Orders, he would have been quite justified in asking us HOW to consider them. I have ho desire to obstruct the passing of permanent Standing Orders ; on the contrary I am willing that the Prime Minister should now give notice^ and call upon us to deal with them next week. My contention U that we should have ample opportunity examine the proposed Orders. If we have not we shall have no chance of passing them this session, and the time occupied in their consideration will have been wasted. If notice were given we should be able to carefully study the Orders in private; to compare them with those of the Imperial and States Parliaments, and thus to avoid many difficulties and objections which would otherwise impede the progress of our work in Committee. The time occupied by the Standing Orders Committee in drawing up these Orders is an indication of the attention which they require. The Committee entered upon its work early in the history of the Parliament, and concluded it only on the 7th inst.",19
53,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"The Standing Orders have been under consideration since the 18th July, 1901.",19
54,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"Quite so. It would be far better for us to hold to our temporary Standing Orders than to adopt these Standing Orders with the idea that they may be amended at some other time. On the other hand if they are to be permanently adopted - and any Standing Orders to which we agree should become permanent-the y must receive the fullest examination. I for one find myself utterly unable to deal with them now as they should be dealt with. It is the proper function of an Opposition, and, indeed of every honourable member, to see that any Standing Order which might take away our privileges or give honourable members undue licence, is carefully considered. If the consideration of this matter were postponed for a week, we should have ample opportunity to thoroughly examine the proposed Orders. In order that they may receive the consideration they deserve, I am perfectly willing to regard the attend here for another week. I hope that the Prime Minister does not think of forcing the Standing Orders through the Committee without due notice. If the attempt be made so many questions will be raised that it will be impossible to deal with them in a couple of days. I think the Prime Minister should adopt my suggestion, give a week's notice of his intention to call upon honourable members to consider the Orders, and invite the House to sit for another week in order that they may be dealt with effectively.",19
55,Mr FISHER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I have no doubt that, although the honourable member' to for North Sydney requires further time for their consideration, he is particularly desirous that the Standing Orders should be passed without delay. I would remind him that they have been before honourable members for many months.",19
56,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,They did not leave the hands of the Standing Orders Committee until the 7 th inst.,20

59,Mr FISHER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I would respectfully subwe mit a suggestion to the honourable member for North Sydney,'and the honourable member for Macquarie, who, I am sure, are anxious that this matter should be disposed of. instead of being the worse occasion for consideration of new Standing Orders, is best, because we are within a few weeks of appealing to our constituents, who will either re-appoint or disappoint us, and neither the members of the Opposition the supporters of the Government know they attach to them. with certainty what their position in the Chamber will be next Parliament. Therepresent now. fore, we have now an opportunity to discuss the matter free from even unconscious bias, and I submit that the disability of not having had a week's notice of the intention to consider the new Standing Orders is more than counterbalanced by that advantage. No doubt there are members of the Oppodiscussion sition who are competent to point out fully the evils or dangers attaching to passing of any proposed rule or Standing Order, and we cannot do better than utilize the two days at our disposal in dealing with the matter.",20
60,Mr MCDONALD,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Most of the members of the Opposition wish to leave for their for. homes to-night.,20
61,Mr FISHER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"In that case, hardly object to allowing those who stay here to deal with the matter. Any Standto ing Order likely to create a stumbling block can be postponed.",20
62,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Then a good many will have to be postponed.,20
63,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"Macquarie) If the honourable member for Wide Bay given the attention to the proposed new Standing Orders which might have been expected from his speech, he would be to tell the Committee in what respect they differ from the Standing Orders now i force. He expects us to pass, without consideration, Standing Rules and Orders of which some are quite contrary to those under which we have been working for the last two-and-a-half years, and without which the people of the Commonwealth might have been called upon to pay extra taxation to the extent of £1,000,000 or more.",20
64,Mr MCDONALD,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Is the honourable member satisfied with - the present Standing honourable Orders?,20
65,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I haye never complained of them, though I believe that should have efficient Standing Orders. The late Prime Minister stated distinctly that he would not ask the House to consider the proposed Standing Orders this session unThis, less there was a general expression of the opinion in favour of passing them without the much debate. As the honourable member' for North Sydney has pointed out, the action of the Government in postponing their consideration lest they should delay other nor business indicates the importance which",20
66,Mr FULLER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,There is not a quorum,20
67,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"We all know what the result would be if I were to call attention to the state of the House. We have been informed that similar Standing Orders were presented to the Senate, and that a standing order similar to that now under was practically struck out by the very members of that body. The honourable the member for Wide Bay assents to the proposition that we should have Standing Orders of our own, and yet he wishes us to accept a rule under which the Standing Orders of the House of Commons shall apply to our proceedings in cases not specially provided",20
68,Mr FISHER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Does the honourable memthey can ber object to that 1,20
69,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"If we are going consider Standing Rules and Orders for the conduct of our proceedings, let us deal with the matter fully. I was told last evening that no important change would be made by the adoption of these Standing Orders; that except for arrangement and a had few unimportant amendments, they were practically the same as the Standing Orders now in force. I find, however, that able standing order 84 takes from honourable members the privilege of showing reasons n why a debate should or should not be adjourned, and why the Chairman should or should not leave the Chair, a privilege which we have enjoyed for the last twoand-a-half years. Although in the House of Commons they have very stringent rules for the regulation of their procedure, in order to save public time, their Standing Order is thatWhen a motion is mude for the adjournment of a debate or of the House during any debate, or that the Chairman of Committees do report progress or do leave the Chair, the debate thereupon shall be confined to the matter of such motion. It is now proposed to go beyond that, because the new Standing Order provides that motions for the first reading of a Bill, motions "" that this debate be now adjourned,"" motions in Committee "" that the Chairman report progress and ask leave to sit again,"" or "" that the Chairman leave the chair,"" shall not be open to debate. I have not had an opportunity to thoroughly study the new Standing Order, but I took the trouble to compare some of the new Orders with the old ones, and 1 then discovered that several of those now proposed would require very serious consideration.",20
70,Mr KINGSTON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I wish that the new Standing Order, which would prevent discussion upon the question, "" That the Chairman leave the chair,"" had been in force long before.",21
71,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"No doubt that would have suited the purposes of the right honourable and learned gentleman ; but the people of the Commonwealth do not share his view. They recognise that, with the assistance of the present Standing Orders, which permit discussion upon such a motion as that referred to, we were able to perform good service for them. We exercised our rights in order to prevent the imposition of taxiition upon them without proper consideration. After midnight on one occasion the Government wished us to consent to taxation proposals involving £1,000,000 per annum, and we felt it our duty to protest. The fact that we were right on that occasion was amply demonstrated at a later stage, because the discussion of the Government proposals occupied over a fortnight, and the impositions upon the people were lessened to the extent of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. If it had not been for the rule now in force it would have been impossible for honourable members to make an effective protest against the course proposed by the Government. Honourable members may differ from us, but 12 G they must admit that we took no unfair advantage of the Standing Orders. We felt very strongly, and we had to adopt extreme measures; but no one can in fairness say that we abused our privileges. I am not moved by any personal considerations in this matter, because I do not expect to be always in Opposition. I believe that after the next general election the members of the Government will be transferred to this side of the Chamber. Eight or nine yoars ago, the Standing Orders Committee of the New South Wales Assembly proposed some very stringent rules which were supported by the Government of the day, and passed during the absence of a number of members of the Opposition. Within fourteen days, however, the Government were defeated. In that respect T believe that history will to some extent repeat itself. We desire to be fair to the Ministry even to the very last day of this Parliament, and to secure them against unjust treatment when they find themselves in Opposition. In view of the promises made by the late Prime Minister, and the other indications that were given that the Government had no intention to proceed with the Standing Orders this session, I think their consideration might be very well postponed until the next Parliament. The rules of the .House of Commons afford opportunities for free discussion upon all the motions which under the new Standing Orders would have to be passed without debate. I think that the reasons which I have put forward for a postponement are well worthy of consideration. We should have had no objection to consider the Standing Orders if they had been brought forward some weeks ago. Though we might object to some of these proposals, we should not object to their consideration even at this stage of the session if honourable members had beer, given notice that the Government intended to proceed with this business. It could not then have been said that it. was rushed through during the absence of honourable members who had expressed a desire to discuss it . I am aware that the Prime Minister desires that the Standing Orders should be dealt with during the present Parliament, but he will admit that honourable members are not to blame for the fact that this is the first opportunity presented to us for their consideration. We should not be asked to consider them in the absence of so many honourable members.",21
72,Mr CAMERON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,That is their fault.,22
73,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"That may be, but the honourable member would not himself consider it fair if, after giving him a promise that they would not proceed with a measure in which he was interested, the Government pushed it through in his absence. I hope that the Government will not proceed with the consideration of the Standing Orders today. I have shown that a very important alteration, contrary to the practice of the House of Commons, is proposed in one of them.",22
74,Mr WILKS,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," It is not permitted to every honourable member of this House to adopt a ""yes-no"" policy. Three or four weeks back I remember strongly supporting the honourable member for Dalley in his lamentations upon the absence of Standing Orders, and I cannot now with any degree of consistency object to consider them when they are submitted by the Government. Honourable members who usually sit with me on this side are anxious to return to Sydney, but I am willing to sacrifice myself by remaining in Melbourne to assist in the discussion of this business. At the same time, I remind the Prime Minister that the Senate occupied no less than seven weeks in dealing with somewhat similar Standing Orders; and I ask how the honourable and learned gentleman can possibly hope that there will be time for a ' f u ll discussion of these Orders in the remaining hours of the present session. The Standing Orders Committee, which included some eminent constitutional lawyers, were occupied for nineteen sittings in completing the draft Orders, and they were engaged from the month of June, 1901, to 7th October, 1903, a period covering two years, in the work. It cannot, therefore, be'expected that we shall make very much progress today. If the Prime Minister were disposed to allow Standing Orders of vital importance to be postponed, I could understand his proceeding with the discussion of the remainder.",22
75,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,I am willing to postpone the critical Standing Orders if we can get on with the others.,22
76,Mr WILKS,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"Then it will remain for honourable members to point out which are the critical Standing Orders. For instance, Standing Order No. S4 gives very strong closure powers, and it must be admitted that in the exercise of the closure honourable members require to be safeguarded and protected. A call of the House might with advantage be resorted to in connection with these critical Standing Orders. If the Standing Orders are not the political Nirvana of honourable members, they are to a great extent the guiding star of our deliberations. The honourable member for Macquarie informs me that the first Standing Order is a most critical one. I am not to be led astray on that account, because the honourable member, in this matter, is a Greek bringing gifts, and we are advised to beware of the Greeks when they do this. As the Prime Minister is prepared to postpone the critical Standing Orders, we might pass those which are not critical; but I remind honourable members that the Senate, which contains only thirt} - six memr bers, took seven weeks to discuss the Standing Orders adopted for that Chamber. That will give honourable members some idea of the length of time which the discussion of our Standing Orders will occupy. I admit the excellent work done by the Standing Orders o Committee. Honourable members representing all shades of political thought were represented on that Committee, and that is a warrant to us that the proposed Orders have been carefully considered and criticised. I am extremely pleased that so much heed has been paid by the Prime Minister to the grievance which I ventilated upon a previous occasion in reference to the Standing Orders.' I compliment the honourable gentleman upon having submitted these Orders, and I can assure him of my support i u securing their adoption. Nevertheless it must be recognised that honourable members are not in a proper frame of mind to seriously consider the whole of them upon such exceedingly short notice. I see no reason why we should not adopt the practice of the House of Commons when contingencies arise which are not provided for in our own Standing Orders. That practice has been followed in our States Parliaments, and has also been adopted by other legislative bodies throughout the Empire. These Orders will require the most careful scrutiny; but if the Prime Minister is determined to proceed with their discussion upon the present occasion I shall do my best to assist him.",22
77,Mr GB EDWARDS,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," Onl y this afternoon the Prime Minister was asked whether he would consider the desirableness of awarding some recognition of the position of members of the first monwealth Parliament. I do not think that we could erect a better monument to our honour than would be provided by leaving to our successors agoodsound set of Standing Orders. On the other hand I should be sorry to allow my name to go down to posterity as one who had taken part in hurriedly authorbeen izing the permanent use of these Orders, There is nothing more important with which we can deal, and I hold that a proper set of Standing Orders should have been submitted to this House some I time ago. Personally I have done what could to bring about that result. At the request of Mr Speaker, I took a copy of these Orders home at the close of last session and during the recess I examined them carefully. I prepared a number of amendportant ments which suggested themselves to my mind, some of which have since been adopted. But I find that a set of Orders entirely different in many respects from those previously submitted has now been substituted'. Some of them are of such great importance that we should scarcely be called upon to consider them during last hours of an expiring Parliament. Although I devoted myself entirely to perusal of these Orders this morning, unable to read the whole of them. The work of comparing them and of referring to similar Orders which have been adopted by other Parliaments, necessarily involved much labour and occupied considerable time. It is, therefore, manifestly unfair to honourable members to deal with them this afternoon, although I am not averse to devoting two or three days to the consideration of them before we disperse. Seeing that they were laid upon the table of the House only late last evening, it is absurd pect us to discuss them this afternoon, Many amendments require to be made them. Indeed, they seem to be full of blemishes. The very grammar of some of them is disgraceful, and the same remark is applicable to the diction which is ployed. It is obvious that they cannot have been revised by any person possessed of a legal training. Take as an ex-Prime ample the series of Orders which relate to motions and amendments. Throughout the whole of these the terms "" quesHouse tion "" and "" motion "" are used alternately, accept others. whereas it is apparent that any proposal submitted is a "" motion "" so long as it is being dealt with by the House, and becomes 12 G 2 Coma "" question'"" only when it is put from the Chair. That is an instance of the slipshod character of these Orders. Rule 84 relates to the closure. I do not for a moment suggest that some sort of check should not be imposed upon the abuse of free discussion. All legislative bodies have forced to the conclusion that some such provision is necessary. But the proposals which are contained in Standing . Order S4 are very drastic, and appear to me to be altogether unwarranted, t seems to me that at least a couple of days I would be occupied in the discussion of a Standing Order of that character, and I see no possibility of the Committee being able to deal with the whole series this week, very At the same time, the matter is so imthat I , for one, am willing to attend here next week, and to assist in securing the final adoption of permanent Standing Orders for the government of future Parliaments. It is somewhat to our credit that in the absence of any permanent Standing Orders Mr Speaker has been able to keep the proceedings of the House within the the bounds of decorum. In view of the fact that we have been working in such circum1 a stances, I think that we may compliI was - ment ourselves on the way in which - we have obeyed the Chair. It is highly desirable that we should adopt Standing Orders which will command the respect of the House, and I trust that the Govern' ment will not press the Committee to proask ceed with this important work this afternoon. They should set apart next week or . the succeeding week for the discussion of this business. I am prepared to devote a whole week to its consideration; but I certainly am not prepared now to deal with it . to ex- ' Mr THOMSON (North Sydney) - I am not quite satisfied as to the scope of this in Standing Order. A legal member of the minor House whom I have consulted considers that it might extend so far as to cover the closure rule which is in force in the House emof Commons, while another lay member holds the same view. I am not prepared to say that it would, and I think that the Minister should give us a clear statement on the point. We might be quite - willing to adopt certain practices of the of Commons, but wholly unwilling to , Mr WATSON - Why should we not rely . on Mr Speaker to deal with any matter not i provided for by our own Standing Orders?",22
78,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"That is another question which this Order involves. We have to decide whether Mr Speaker should create precedents for this House; or whether he should of his own free will follow the precedents of the House of Commons in cases in which he believes they apply. This Standing Order expressly provides that in cases not provided for he shall follow the practice of the House of Commons; but there is a great difference between making an expressed declaration in writing to that effect, and simply enabling Mr Speaker to follow the House of Commons precedents where he thinks it desirable to do so. What does the use of the word - ""practice"" involve? Is the whole practice of the House of Commons under its Standing Orders, and in accordance with its precedents, to be adopted; or are we simply to adopt the precedents of the House of Commons t The two honourable members to whom I have referred seem to think that this expression will cover the closure rule.",24
79,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,Anothe r place struck out that provision in its draft Standing Orders.,24
80,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"If we are to adopt the closure rule, we should not do so in the dark. I am not discussing the point whether it is desirable or undesirable to adopt that rule; but I contend that we should not in the dark adopt any practice of the House of Commons. Honourable members have not had sufficient opportunity to inquire into the practice of the House of Commons to enable them to understand what this term will cover, and I should like the Prime Minister to give us some information on the point. He should tell us how far this Order will extend, and give us good reasons for it . '",24
81,Mr WINTER COOKE,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I think that some honourable member of the Standing Orders Committee should explain the reason why it is proposed to depart from the temporary Standing Order which provides thatIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by sessional or other orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons. . . . The Order now before us omits the words, "" rules, forms, and,"" and I think it should be explained why it is proposed to make this alteration. As to the point mentioned by the honourable member for North Sydney, I would remind the honourable member that it is proposed to practically follow the temporary Standing Orders, in which we have the wordsRules, forms, and practice . . . . in force at the time of the adoption of these Orders. The Committee, however, has substituted for the words "" at the time of the adoption of these orders "" the specific date, "" 1st January, 1901."" I quite understand that no really serious alteration is involved in that change; but I do not know exactly what the use of the word ""practice"" implies.",24
82,Mr CAMEKON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,It will cover everything.,24
83,Mr WINTER COOKE,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"It might do so. It seems to me that when a Committee is appointed to draw up Standing Orders for our guidance, and departs from the temporary Standing Orders under which the business of the Heuse has been conducted, it is incumbent upon some honourable member of that Committee to give reasons for the proposed change. At present we are quite in the dark, and we have not had time to study the Standing Orders put before us. In these circumstances, therefore, it is more than ever necessary that we should receive the assistance of members of the Standing Orders Committee.",24
84,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"I feel that we are at present binding ropes of sand. In view of the complaints from all parts of the Committee there appears very little prospect of making any considerable progress, and if honourable members opposite, who have expressed a desire to have a further opportunity to acquaint themselves with these Standing Orders, will agree to lend us their assistance in making any reasonable effort to pass them which the necessities of next week's sittings will permit, I shall be prepared to agree to an adjournment. Strong representations have been made privately to me by honourable members who are anxious to support the passing of the Standing Orders that they require time for further consideration in order to satisfy themselves as to certain of the principal Orders. I have communicated with Mr Speaker, who considers that he would not be debarred from taking part in a discussion upon rules of procedure, which must necessaiily affect the whole House. Consequently, if honourable members will familiarize themselves with those parts of the Standing Orders which seem to them to call for explanation, Mr Speaker will be prepared on the next occasion to assist us, l)y giving the results of the deliberations of the Standing Orders Committee. That remark will apply to the Standing Order now before us, and on the understanding which I have named I shall not - endeavour to detain honourable members any longer. There appears to be no possibility of our soon obtaining the measure we have been hoping to receive from another place. Progress reported. SPECIA LADJOURNMENT .

87,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I desire to suggest to the Minister for Home Affairs the propriety of having a circular prepared for the guidance of the electors. It need not be a lengthy or a costly on the contrary should be short and concise,  should set forth a number of "" Don'ts,"" cause the procedure to be followed under the Commonwealth Act differs in many respects from that provided for by the Acts of the States. For instance, we have made it a penal offence for a person to spend jnoney on behalf of a candidate without his written authority - That provision should he made known to prevent persons from inadvertently offending against the law.",25
88,Mr THOMSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"If that provision is strictly enforced, it may happen that no candidate will be properly elected.",25
89,Mr WATSON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"If leaflets such as suggest are circulated free of cost, or are made available at a small charge, they will be of advantage to the community generally. I wish also to ask the Prime Minister if he will give time for the consideration of the Senate's - message in regard to the Public - Service Regulations. That business is set down on the notice-paper, and, in courtesy to the Senate, we should give consideration to it before we adjourn.",25
90,Mr FISHER,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I have a request to make of the Minister for Home Affairs. There is every indication that there will be serious trouble in connection with the holding of the Commonwealth elections unless prompt steps are taken to preventconfusion. I would thereforesuggestthat the Minister should instruct the Secretary of his Department, Colonel Miller, to visit every State in the Commonwealth and give as much information as he can as to the working of the Act to as many returning officers as can be gathered together in the principal cities.",25

95,Mr CAMERON,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," Will the bePrime Minister state definitely whether he means to go on with the Standing Orders next week, with your valuable assistance, Mr Speaker, until they are completed? I feel considerably aggrieved at being brought to Melbourne from Tasmania again and again, and then, after two sittings of the House, being compelled to idle away the remaining five days of the week. I came over at great inconvenience to attend this week, and I find that we are going to adjourn after practically only two sittings. Will the Prime Minister make us a definite promise that he will, next week, proceed with I the consideration of the Standing Orders until they are disposed of? If so, I shall be here to take part in the deliberations.",25
96,Mr HUME COOK,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I wish to say a word or two in support of the suggestions which have been made in regard to the coming elections. I have been speaking to some of the officers of the Electoral Branch in regard to the matter, and I find that there is a disposition to be somewhat niggardly in providing for polling booths. It must be remembered that during the forthcoming elections there will be twice as many voters in Victoria at least as there have been on previous occasions, of whom more than half will be women. A mile may not be very far for a man to walk to record his vote, but it is a long distance for a woman to go, and women can hardly be expected to ride fifteen or twenty miles, as men have been accustomed to do in country districts. If the elections are to give reflex of the opinions of the people of Australia, we must afford every facility for the recording of votes by both men and women. I hope therefore that the Government will not, in order to save a few pounds, put any obstacle in the way of obtaining the fullest voting possible. I understand that there is also a disposition to be a little too economical in regard to the appointment of assistant returning officers. If all the votes cast in a division are to be brought to one booth to be counted, the announcement of the result of the election will in many cases be delayed for a week after the polling day. To obtain expedition, more assistant returning officers must be appointed, and the Government should not stand in the way of a speedy announcement of results. With regard to the day upon which the elections should be held, the popular view seems to be that Saturday should be chosen. I have no objection to Saturday, but I wish to point out that if the elections are held on that day, the poll clerks and others engaged in the scrutiny will have to stop work at midnight, and begin again on Monday morning, so that that may cause the postponement of announcements of some of the results until at least Tuesday. If these two or three points are taken into consideration by the Government, they will greatly facilitate the administration of the Act.",25
97,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO,"Macquarie) W it h regard to the suggestion of the honourable member for Bland, I would point out that some days ago I spoke of the advisability of preparing a short statement for the information of electors. I feel sure that it will be a good tning to adopt such a course. The provisions of our Electoral Act are so stringent that full information should be supplied to the public regarding them, so that they may be advised of the exact nature of the offences which they might otherwise be liable to commit. I hope that the Minister will see that the matter is attended to as early as possible. I hope, too, that timely notice will be given of the dates of nomination and polling. The Act contains certain provisions regarding State members, and we do not wish anything to be done which may cause them to feel a grievance against us. We do not wish them to be able to say that they had not sufficient time in which to send in their resignations.",26
98,Mr KIRWAN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I wish to a true make a suggestion in regard not so much to the day as the date of the elections. I suggest that the elections should not be held upon a date too close to Christmas, because a considerable displacement of population takes place during the holiday season. Many thousands of people then leave the district which I represent, and spend their holidays in the coastal districts; and, if the elections are too long deferred, they will be disfranchised, or will be put to the inconvenience of voting by post. It has been suggested that the elections should be held on 17 th December, but that would be toolate.  Referring to the day upon which the elections should take place, I may point out that the practice in South Australia for many years has been to hold the elections oa Saturday, and that the results have been satisfactory. A large number of working men are free on Saturday afternoons, whereas if the polling takes place upon an ordinary day they have to obtain permission from their employers before they can go away to record their votes.",26
99,Mr R EDWARDS,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I understand that it is intended to appoint postal officials as returning officers in the various States. I have nothing to say against that proposal, except that the officers may not have the necessary experience to enable them satisfactorily to conduct the elections. I suggest that men of practical experience should be appointed, or otherwise, great dissatisfaction may be caused.",26
100,Mr DEAKIN,CREDITED AND DEBITED RESPECTIVELY TO," I u reply to the honourable member for Moreton I may state that there is such a record as that he referred to, and that Mr Speaker will be prepared to lay it upon the table. The various suggestions which have been made with regard to electoral administration have been noted by my honourable colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, on whose behalf I promise careful consideration. Many of the points mentioned have already been more or less dealt with, or are under consideration by the officers of the Electoral Department. Information is being supplied to the press from time to time, and probably .a summary of instructions or warnings may be circulated throughout the Commonwealth. As the honourable member for Bland has stated, the "" JJon'ts "" are very important. The most important of all is - "" Don't vote for any except a Ministerial candidate."" Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.13 p.m.",26
