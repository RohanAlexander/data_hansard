4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I gave instructions months ago that the shares were to be interest? sold, and I am a little astonished that they have not been sold. But the Public Trustee is an officer appointed under an Act of this Parliament, possessing wide statutory powers, and, for anything know to the contrary, the sale of these life. shares may be at his discretion. Honororable members who have held office may, be able to find, if not an excuse for, an explanation of, the delay.",4

21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yesterday the honourable member for Bourke asked the reason for the cancellation of a prohibition against trading with certain firms in Japan and in the United States of America. In addition to what I said then about the cancellation of the prohibition affecting certain firms doing business in Japan, I wish to add that the Imperial Government, being notified of the fact that Japan had legislated in regard to the matter, requested us to act as we have done. The removal of the names of American firms from the prohibited list was also undertaken at the instance of the Imperial Government, in consequence of the Government of the United States having adopted satisfactory measures to prevent trading with or for the benefit of the enemy. PRESS CBE SUBSIDY.",5
22,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIs it the intention of the Government to continue the press cable subsidy; and, if so, why?.",5
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows :1. A subsidy was originally granted to the Independent Press Association, as it was considered that there should be available in Australia a supply of cable news independent of the only service then existing. The conditions have since changed, and a healthy competition in cable services now exists, which insures to all newspapers a full service of cable news at a reasonable price. The continuance of the Government subsidy was therefore regarded as unnecessary. The subsidized association had, to the date of the notification of the cancellation of the subsidy, suspended its serACETAT E OF LIME FACTORY.",5

25,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The Defence Department has supplied the following information:1. £28,334. 2. £53,403. 3. Bulimba, Queensland. 1 4. Yes. 5. At the time the Estimates were prepared, the information in possession of the Department indicated that the estimate of £40,000 was a fair one. Later advances in costs of material and labour, and some modifications of plans brought about by changed conditions, necessitated a revision, bringing the amount to £80,000. 6. The responsibility cannot be placed upon individuals, as the change was caused by circumstances over which the Department had no control. 7. The works were undertaken after communication with the Ministry of Munitions, with a view to relieving Great Britain of its disundertaking to supply us with acetone, and to make Australia self-contained in the matter of this important adjunct to the manufacture of cordite, The experts advising the Minister for Defence in Australia were- Mr A. de Bavay, who is an authority on such matters,' and whose name was suggested by an expert of the Ministry of Munitions; Mr R. J. Lewis, Chief Inspector of Explosives, Victoria; and Mr N . K . S. Brodribb, Manager, Government Cordite Factory. 8. It is contrary to the public interest that reports upon defence works of this nature should be circulated. 9. The expenditure has been necessitated by war conditions, as explained in 7. It is regretted that the necessary Order in Council to exempt the expenditure from the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act was not put through, but steps are being taken to this.

34,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"for Sir ROBERT BEST) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that to carry out the recently views of the Advisory Council of - Science and Industry would mean the substiof the legally established and convenient proof-gallon,"" as universally used in the British Empire, by a system of "" absolute alcohol percentages"" based on the method enforced by the German' Government, and that if given effect to, would lead to dislocation and confusion in industry and trade with no commensurate result? 2. Is it a fact that the Government of the reUnited States of America, for a period of fifteen years prior to 1866, had in force a fiscal alcohol system based on that of the German Government and corresponding to that now proposed by the Advisory Council ? . 3. Is it a fact that the Government of the United States of America, in 1866, on the advice and recommendation of a Committee of the National Academy of Sciences, adopted the "" proof-gallon "" as a standard of reference instead of alcohol "" on the ground that the price was habitually referred to proof, and the fact that there is no sacrifice of scientific when the relation of the proof standard to standard alcohol is positively defined,"" and has retained the proof-gallon ever since? 4. Is it a fact that the British Government issued official tables of great accuracy, published as recently as the year 1916, for ascertaining the strength of spirits, and in which the precise relationship between the terms "" proof-spirit,"" "" specific gravity,"" "" percentages of alcohol by weight and by volume "" are minutely defined? 5. If the foregoing questions are answered in the affirmative, and if it is a fact that sent standard "" proof-gallon,"" based on and developed by the British people through practical use, has stood the test of time, convenience, and adaptability to the trade, is the Prime Minister prepared to seriously entertain the proposals of the Advisory Council for Science and Industry?",6
35,Mr HUGHES,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"The Advisory Council has, I understand, been making some investigations into the matter. ' No official recommendation has been made by them, but, if such recommendation is made, I shall consider it in the light of the honourable member's statements. WAR - TI ME PROFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 15th August (vide page 1105)"", on motion by Sir JOHN FORRESTThat this Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr TUDOR had movedThat after the word "" That,'""' the following words be inserted : "" in the opinion of this House the Bill is utterly inadequate, and signally fails 'to place upon wealth its due share of the expenses of the. war'"" >  hard to imagine, in view of what we hear in the course of this discussion that there is really an amendment before the House.; indeed, I do not think that any amendment could have carried so libtle weight. The war ought to be prosecuted with as small a load of taxation as it is possible to place upon the taxpayer. According to the Treasurer, in his Budget statement, he has a reserve of something like £17,000,000 in hand for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the war; but the honourable members opposite are always urging the Government to extract the utmost farthing from the pockets of the taxpayers, although this must mean the disorganization of trade and business generally. Only last week I was speaking to an ex-member for Illawarra, who exprecision pressed the opinion that the Commonwealth Government ought to accumulate something like £20,000,000 for this purpose. I think the Treasurer is showing his wisdom in raising the money as it is required, and not endeavouring to accumulate it to the disturbance of trade. The other day the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) contended that the Treasurer ought to adopt the Act passed by the British Parliament, which the preplaced the standard rate of interest at G per cent, on private individuals, and 7 per cent, in the case of companies. It has to be pointed out, however, that in the Old Country the rate of interest is very much lower than it is here. In Australia, if we. require to borrow money for the purposes of our businesses, we have to pay a much higher rate for the accommodation. Apart from that. I find that, only last June, at the instance of Mr Bonar Law, an amendment was made in the British Act , which raised the standard rate of interest from 6 per cent, to 9 per cent, for individuals, and 10 per cent, for companies, and this I regard as a very high compliment to our own Treasurer. I agree to a certain extent with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) in his contention that taxation on profits made owing tb the war can be passed on to the consumer. There is no doubt that if a business man has to pay 50 per cent.' in the way of extra taxation, it is a very easy matter to him ito add a small and almost imperceptible amount to his prices, so that, in the case of a big turnover, the purchaser may be made to pay the imposition. But the honourable member has shown us no remedy for this state of things, which he knows has prevailed from the time of Adam. He condemns the present Government, but ignores the fact that the previous Government, of which he was a supporter, did not deal with this octopus. Then, again, the honourable member for Barrier C Mr Considine) has had a lot to say on the subject of Broken Hill : but, he, too, has failed to support his charges against the Government hy any proposals for a remedy.",7
36,Mr CONSIDINE,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,What do you suggest  at all.,8
37,Mr CONSIDINE,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"Of course not!  cauuot pass on the tax are those I cipally represent, namely, farmers and graziers. Mr ' FENTON - I think I mentioned years,- showed no profits. that.  to hear it ; but I suggest that those who other difficulties. criticise the Government ought to be able to present some concrete scheme to prethis vent the passing on of taxation.",8
38,Mr CONSIDINE,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"You have been told that the Government could not do better than adopt the Labour party's Bill .  last night told us how certain bullocks had been sold at £ 6 5 at Broken Hill , and that time. the Leader of the Opposition, speaking of the high cost of 'living, mentioned lambs that had been sold .at 37s. 6d. know whether the Leader of the Opposition has any pet lamb running about his garden, but it would appear as though some had been sent to him.",8
39,Mr TUDOR,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"I gave the average,price for the whole of Australia, as supplied Mr Knibbs. ",8
40,Mr TUDOR,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"No ; I took the average price, as sent to me.  lambs are sold at 37s. 6d., and 2,000 are others. sold at 28s., the former figure does not represent the average price. I am in the pastoral business, and last year, at Homebusiness. bush, I received 30s. 6d. for thirty lambs, and for the balance not more than 26s.; and in this I was lucky. I can honourable members that I can obtain better price for my store sheep at the present time than I could if I sent them down as fats. Taking the statement of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine) as correct; I should be very untrue. pleased to send a consignment of bullocks to Broken Hill , where, according to they would return £ 6 5 . Mr CON.SIDINE - I gave the average price at £25, and said that a bullock had. realized £ 6 5 .  position quoted some figures prepared for Sir Alexander Peacock, showing the nroto [46]- 2 fits for the war years, earned in. some 112 cases. In one case no profits were shown ? for the first year, £700 for the second year, and £7,000 for the third year; b ut there is really nothing in these figures, you do because we are not told the nature of the businesses carried on. I could tell the honourable member of a station in prinQueensland-Avondale-whic h has been occupied for the last t h i r ty years, and which for the first twenty-seven This was because the owners were debarred from moving their stock, owing to drought and Only three years ago did this station start to show profits; and fact was due to the good seasons, and to it being possible to move the stock to the nearest marker.",8
41,Mr FENTON,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"Did that station suffer from drought for twenty-seven years?  to the books, there were no profits for",8
42,Mr TUDOR,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"That is different- "" according to the books "" ! ' I do not  sioner, under the Act which the honourable member helped to pass, has a right to inspect all books.  by position suggests that every primary producer "" fakes "" his books.",8

53,Mr SPEAKER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"Order ! The honor- £36,000 able member for Maribyrnong' is out of order.",9
54,Mr FEWTON,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"I generally am, it seems.",9
55,Mr SPEAKER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"Order ! I propose to name the next honourable member who, in defiance of the Chair's call to order, interjects.  seven years prior to the war a sum of £80,000 was invested in the Avondale Station, but it showed no profits, which fact can be Tevealed by an examination the 'station books. Since the outbreak the war, however, £60,000 has been earned. If pastoralists are brought within the provisions of the War Time Profits Bill the pre-war standard in. the case of this property will be fixed at £8,000i and anying thing exceeding that £8,000 will be taxed. This struggling concern, which has been carrying on operations in the back blocks, in a drought-stricken area, and in a part of Australia that we are anxious to popusuccession late, will be victimized by the tax. I pleased to hear the remarks of the honorI able member for Corangamite (Mr Manitheir fold) upon the question of cattle. the result of a drought, the whole of the stock on a station may be completely wiped out. In any case, half the stodk will be lost. Let us take the ease of a station in Central Queensland. If they commenced with 4,000.cows, they would probably have 3,000 calves in 1915. As soon as these calves were branded they had to be set down as valued at £6 per head under the Commonwealth income tax provisions, and at £4 per head under the Queensland income tax provisions. For the purpose' of our calculations, us take the value at the Queensland rate. This would give the property an income of £12,000 in 1915, the first year covered by the provisions of the Bill now before us. In the following year there would be another 3,000 calves at £4 per head, equalling £12,000. In 1917 there would be a similar increase. In three years the station would have a total increase of 9,000 calves, heifers, or young bullocks, of a total value of £36,000. Should an "" old-man"" drought come along, half these cattle would probably die, and the result would be that the station-owner would have no more than £18,000 worth cattle, although he had paid 50 per cent, and 75 per cent, taxation upon worth of cattle, less 10 per cent, on the pre-war standard. Such a position would be manifestly absurd, and I am sure the Treasurer will be sympathetic in his attitude towards the pastoralists. In regard to the losses sustained by pastoralists, I recollect the case of one station property in the Calare district, there were valuable flocks of sheep. They managed to save 60,000 ewes during the 1902 drought, but it cost them about £1S0,000 to do it. Thus the ewes bf cost the owners £3 per head. The price of of hay and fodder is generally very high during times of drought, and it frequently costs pastoralists from '20s. to 25s. a head to keep their stock alive. Our opponents are always twitting pastoralists with havmade big profits, but I venture to say that with all the profits they have made they have not yet got their own back. Many pastoralists are still heavily involved with the banks, and I hope that a of good seasons will put them was in a flourishing condition. At any rate, hope that.the Treasurer will consider position from the point of view As that I have put forward. Every honourable member prefers a war profits tax to a war-time profits tax. We cannot have a real war-time profits tax with exemptions. On the other hand, a war profits tax should have many exemptions. Any person who is not making a profit as the result of the war should be exempted, and the tax should be so arranged that it will hit hard any man who is exploiting the public and taking advantage of the war for his own ends. In let my opinion, the Bill before us exempts some people who should'not be exempted . and taxes others who should not be taxed. It is full of sins of commission and sins of omission. Gold mines are exempted because gold has a standard value. There may be something in that argument. I have gone very carefully through Knibbs, and I find that the Australian flocks sheep and herds of cattle are 25 per cent, less than they were during the pre-war years. The decrease is due to the drought of a few years ago. I agree that pastoralin ists should he called upon to pay on profits made as the result of the war. As a matter of fact, an effort should be made to see that-every business, whether it is that of a pastoralist or that of merchant, should pay taxation on the proand portion of profit that has been made the result of the war; but I suggest that pastoralists should have the opportunity of bringing their position before the Inter-State Commission. If that Comlittle mission as the result of an inquiry should say that a pastoralist has derived so much profit because of the war, the pastoralist should pay accordingly. If the Commission should say that the profit has been 25 per cent., the tax should be i m posed on 25 per cent. If the Commission should say that the profit has been no more than 10 per cent, let that be percentage taxed. There are in operation four methods of taxing profits, the British , the French, the Canadian, and the New Zealand, though I understand that the New Zeacause land Act has been repealed. I prefer the Canadian system. It would be better for the Treasurer to remove all exemptions, fix a pre-war standard of 10 per cent., take 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, on thing above that. He would get a bigger revenue, instead of the £950,000 that estimates to receive as the taxation two years' profits. Such a method would not press heavily on any one individual. All taxation should be borne equally those who can pay it . Many people still continue to make the big profits that were making before the war, but because those, profits do not exceed what were made before the war they are to escape taxation under this Bill . On the other hand, people who were not making onesoldiers tenth of the profits of others are to penalized by this Bill . I wish to show how the Canadian and New Zealand schemes work out in comparison with'the scheme proposed in our Bill . suppose that a certain person has a capital of £20,000, and makes a profit of £3,000 per annum. Allowing 10 per cent. on the capital value as the pre-war of standard, the Australian system leaves a taxable balance of £1,000, and the Government collect 50 per cent, or £500 in the first year, and 75 per cent, or £750 the succeeding years, or £2,000 in all any for three years. The Canadian system is to exempt 7 per cent, on the capital and tax the balance at the rate of 25 per cent.. Thus 7 per cent, on £20,000 is £1,400. De-' a ducting £1,400 from £3,000 leaves £1,600, 25 per cent, on £1,600 gives a revenue as of £400. This amount is collected each year, giving a total of £1,200 as against £2,000 proposed to be collected under our Bill . The taxation on the individual is more than half of what is proposed in Australia, yet Canada secures a revenue of £2,500,000, as against our estimated revenue of under £1,000,000. In New Zealand the. exemption is 74 per cent, on the capital. On a capital of £20,000 and a profit of £3,000 the taxable balance is £1,500. The rate of the the tax being 45 per cent., the revenue derived is £675 per annum, or a total of £2,025 for three years. The result in New Zealand is practically the same as that proposed here. As I have already said, I prefer the Canadian method, bei t makes every one pay, whilst at the same time the rate is not so excessive. I cannot see why professional men should be exempted. Some of the wealthand iest men in Australia are professional everymen, and I do not think that they are anxious to dodge this taxation. Most of he them are loyal, and would be pleased to on pay. their share. Then, again, I think that soldiers, and nurses serving with the Australian Imperial Force ought to be by excluded from the operation of this tax for the same reason as they are exempt they from several of the State taxes. A man who risks his life for the Empire's cause should not come home to find that in his absence his property has been exploited by the tax collector,- I would give to all and nurses, without exception, the be exemption to which I think they are entitled. I am sorry that the Treasurer has not included in this measure clause 10 of the previous Bill which allowed a person to offset against the profits of this year Let us the losses of another year.",9
56,Mr RODGERS,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"The pastoral industry of Australia could not be sustained if .you did not set off the losses of one year >against the profits of another.  'able years the pastoralist sets aside tain amount of monev as a reserve in ticipation of had years that must ineviments, tably follow. I suggest to the Treasurer that the proposed Board of Referees include either a grazier or a farmer. As a the men on the land will pay a big profinances of the country. portion of the tax .they should have presentation on that Board; and instead of having a Board sitting only in bourne there should be a Board to deal with appeals in each State. Why should a taxpayer in Queensland or Western Australia be obliged to travel thousands of miles to bring his case before a Board in Melbourne? There is altogether too much centralization in our taxation ministration. In addition to Federal State income taxes, and graduated land taxes the taxpayer. should be allowed deduct all forms pf taxes, including paid to shires, municipalities, Pastoral Protection Boards, and Rabbit Boards.",10
57,Sir JOH NFORREST,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"All rates and taxes are deducted.  that to be the effect of the clause. I remind the Treasurer that the Federal i come tax did not operate u n t i l 1915. Taxpayers in making up their returns will require in some cases to cover period of six years before the war in order to arrive at the pre-war standard, suggest that they be allowed to use for the purpose the returns prepared for the State taxation authorities. The Bill vides for appeals to be heard before High Court Judge, but the Commissioner may in his discretion allow a case to heard before a Supreme Court Judge or District Court Judge. I suggest now, I have suggested in connection with other taxation Bills, that the taxpayer should be given the right of choosing the tribunal before which his case shall be heard. the amount in dispute between a small taxpayer and the Department does not exceed. £ 2 0 or £ 3 0 , let him have the to bring his case before an ordinary stipendiary magistrate at the local Court nearest to the district in which he resides. Justice should be t a k t n to the doors the people; it is absurd to drag .an appellant and his witnesses from the bush to Melbourne to fight a case involving only £ 3 0 . A further improvement could be made in the Bill by giving the taxpayers a right to make their payments in quarterly in a cerstalments. The Commissioner has discreantionary power to accept the tax in instalbut the taxpayer should have the absolute right to make such payshould ments. That alteration would avoid considerable dislocation of the WKen all retaxpayers are obliged to pay their taxes at about the same time, there must Melbe a very great strain on the resources of the banks. Money is taken from the Associated Banks to pay the Commissioner of Taxation, and is then paid into the Commonwealth Bank, which establishes big credits at the expense of the private institutions. The result is that the money admarket is tightened, and those in need of and accommodation for the carrying on of their businesses find themselves hard to pressed. The difficulty might be overcome those by the Treasurer opening accounts in each of the private banks instead of doing the whole of his business with the Commonwealth Bank, and therebv the finances of the country would be considerably improved. For instance, I do my business with the Commercial Bank, and I sugn - gest'that when my cheque for the wartime profits tax is drawn on that institution, the Commissioner should pay it a back into his account with that bank. Thus the bank's balance would not be in and I terfered with in any way. Another desirable alteration is the in sertion of a provision allowing pastoralists proto deduct expenditure on rabbit destruca tion, and the cutting of suckers, and the digging out of seedlings. These expenses are be not allowed in connection with the Fedea ral income tax. A concrete case is that as of Mr Fagan, of "" Sunnyridge,"" who has a property of about 14,000 acres. At about the time of the outbreak of the war he purchased a lot of wire netting with If which he subdivided the property; he burnt off all harbour for rabbits, dug out the vermin, and generally improved the risrht place, with the result that today it is carrying 50 per cent - more sheep, and the quality of the sheep is 20 ner cent, better. In other words, his profits have increased of since the war by about 70 per cent., and because of his expenditure on improvements the Commissioner of Taxation will claim a share of that increase as a wartime profit,. My view is that an allowance should be made for that expenditure; otherwise, what advantage does the pastoralist derive by taking steps to exterminate the vermin and buying netting at £50 or £70 per mile, which before the war ; was costing not more than £24 per mile? In many parts of the western district of New South Wales, and particularly the West Bogan country, which has been settled for something . like thirty years, the pastoralists, every second year, have to cut down the suckers on their holdings. The country, because of that work, does not carry any more stock than it did thirty years ago. It is in practically the same state as it was then, but if graziers and others neglected to cut down these seedlings every second year, the carrying capacity of their holdings would be reduced. I contend that these landholders should be allowed to charge, as against expenses, the amount paid for that particular work. I suggest to the Treasurer that at the end of clause 11 the following new subclause should be inserted: Where capital has been invested in Australian Commonwealth war loans, the difference between the rate of interest received and the percentage standard may be used for the purposes of establishing this standard. I may briefly explain the object to served by such an amendment. The man who invests, say, £120,000 in a business established since the war, .will naturally be anxious to establish a high pre-war standard rate of profits, so that he take advantage of the percentage standard, for which this Bill provides. puts only £100,000 into his business, and invests the' remaining £20,000 in loans, he will be allowed an exemption of thereof. £12,000 in the one case, and of only £10,000 in the other. It will seen that under the Bill as it stands there has raised. is no inducement to invest in war loans. The difference between the 4£ - per which a man receives from his in - Land Tax Act? vestment in war loans, and the 10 per cent, which he is allowed to missioner make in his business, without liable to taxation under this Bill , namely, 5A per cent., should be allowed spect of war loan investments, to enable ""him to establish the standard of profit before the war. There is another point which, I hope, - will receive the serious consideration - the Treasurer, since it is vital to the ests of graziers and land holders generally. Clause 16 provides thatThe amount of the capital of a business shall be taken to be the amount of its capital paid up by the owner in money or in kind This ""method of defining capital is absolutely wrong - By way of illustration I would point out that in the Cowra district of New South Wales, which I know very well, there is a lot of land held by pioneers, who selected it forty years ago for .£1 per acre. If a man buys a property adjoining one of those selections at £ 8 per acre he is allowed an exemption to the extent of 10 per cent, on that £ 8 per acre, whereas the man who selected at £ 1 per acre will be allowed an exemption to the extent of only 10 per cent, on that £ 1 per acre. Thus in the case of a holding of 5,000 acres, the man who had selected at £ 1 per acre would be allowed an exemption of only £500 , whereas his neighbour, who had purchased 5,000 acres at £ 8 per acre, would be allowed au exemption of £4,000, or an exemption eight times greater than that secured by the pioneer who has helped so much to make the district what it is today. Mr GROOM: - What does the honourable member - suggest should be taken as be the basis of capital? If we adopted the honourable member's suggestion, then, in the event of a property purchased for £10,000 depreciating to £5,000, the exemption would come down accordingly. may His scheme would have to cut both ways.  If he should be taken to be the amount by which the value of the assets of a business war exceeds the amount of the liabilities .",11

In other words, under the Tax A ct the value might he put up to £ per acre, since it would suit the purposes of the Commissioner to do so, whereas under the War-time Profits Act it be put down to £ 1 , because the reduced valuation would mean a bigger return revenue. I contend that we should the one level of taxation values, and these should apply all round. man named Gordpn, whom I know, has land the unimproved value of which was and fixed by him at 38s. per acre. valuer later on fixed it at 40s. per acre, and the Commonwealth Land Tax valuer fixed it at 65s. per acre.

In Land prove the assertions made by the Opposi5 tion, I propose to quote the latest figures compiled on the subject by the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs.

As a matter of fact, Mr Knibb^s shows that there is no appreciable difference between the wool returns for the year immediately precedthe war and those of the present time. How, then, can it be asserted that the appastoralists are making tremendous profits?",13
63,Mr CONSIDINE,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"But has it not been said by the supporters of the Government that, as a result of the last drought, many thousands of sheep were lost?  those losses. Mr Knibbs shows that in 1913 there were 85,057,402 sheep in Aus-' the tralia, while in 1916-and these are the we latest figures I could obtain from Mr . difKnibbs - ther e were only 72,779,969 sheep, showing a reduction of 13,277,433.

In 1913 Australia had 11,483,882 cattle, and in 1916 we had only 9,907,742, showing a falling-off of 1,576,140. In the course of this debate it has been suggested by the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members of the Labour party that in this legislation we should follow as closely as possible the example set by the Imperial Act. A noteworthy feature of that A ct is that under it farmers and pastoralists are exempt from this form of taxation. That being so, the Labour party, if they are consistent, will advocate the exemption of the pastoralists, at all events, from the provisions of this Bill . I was very pleased with the speech of the honourable member for Henty (Mr . Boyd), except for his statement that farmers sbould be included in this taxation, although I stated in my opening remarks that, if we were to have a war-time profits tax, it sliould apply to every one.. Some little time ago I stated in this chamber that it cost the farmer 3s. 10|d. to produce a bushel of wheat. I based that conclusion on calculations made by 120 different farmers, and it is substantiated by the following letter which appeared in a recent issue of the Melbourne AgeSir, I append the actual cost of wheat produchave tion. It will be seen how close to the tion point the production of grain brings the producer. I would also like to correct statement that the farmer gets 4s. 9d. bushel.

66,Mr CORSER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"Wide Bay) [12.22] No Bill of this character could be framed to give universal satisfaction, because many persons in the community wish to avoid taxation. But we must have revenue, and it is the business of Parliament to provide for the raising of that, revenue as justly as possible. We shall be right in taxing speciallv the man who has made profits out of the war. and in afterwards imposing an equitable income tax. The Treasurer tells us that he is proposing now only the taxation necessary to meet present requirements, and that in the future our taxation must be heavier. When the time comes, the money must be - found. The Nationalist party is pledged to the imposition of a war-time profits tax, and I do not think that any one should try to prevent the passing of a Bill to impose taxation on those who have made money .out of the war. It would be idle to say that money has not been made out of the war, because many persons have made large war profits. In my opinion, it would be wrong to set against these profits losses incurred independently of the war, which would to beborne if no war profits had starvabeen made. Certainly the profits made the by the war should be taxed. On these per grounds, I cannot agree with some of the obremarks made by honourable members sitting on this side of the' chamber. In regard to the objection that a profit of 10 £80; per cent, is an excessive exemption, I 6d. ask honourable members to consider that the Bill deals with all classes of the comincluding the mercantile class, ' less which, I suppose, pays more to the reless venue than any other. At the present time, merchants have to purchase goods man, from manufacturers in other parts of the to world at f.o.b. prices, and do not know £2; the . price they will be charged, or 1 what freights will be charged for the conat 5s., veyance of those goods to Australia. at When the war Ceases-the sooner the better for all of us-the shipping that, is now charge being used for the conveyance of troops and munitions will be diverted to the carrying of food for' Great Britain and The the allied nations. A large number of was vessels will be sent to Australia to take from here the produce already purchased by the Imperial Government, and the owners of those vessels will be tumbling over one another to get outward freight, even for ballast. Consequently, there will be a great slump in freights, and also a great reduction in insurance. It must be remembered that war insurance affects not only freights, but also shipping itself. For these reasons it is not unfair to allow merchants to make 10 per cent, profit free from taxation.",14
67,Mr HEITMANN,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,A considerable period must elapse after the war ceases before there will be shipping to spare.,15
68,Mr CORSER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"There will be extra shipping space available almost immediately after the war ceases. Look at the number of vessels entering the ports of Great Britain and of France every week, thousands of which will be used for the transport of what is required most, namely, the foodstuffs already paid for. Those traders who have stocks on the water, or in their warehouses, bound to suffer, and are prepared to suffer so loug as they get even-handed justice. There is, however, another section of the community with iarge stocks, more particularly in the drapery business. These stocks were contracted for before the war, to be delivered, probably, within twelve v months, and enormous profits have been ^made, prices in many cases having in creased as much as 400 per cent. merchants have had their goods protected by the navies of Australia and Great B r i tain, and they ought to be called upon to bear a large proportion of the cost of prosecuting 'the war, for no one w i ll deny that, but for the war, these profits wouldnever have been made. people ought to be taxed before any i m post is placed on the ordinary business man,, who is earning only ordinary or pre-war profits. I was astonished to hear the criticism of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) in face of the'expression of opinion by the Chairman of Commerce in Brisbane that the principle of this Bill is a just one. I am pleased that the Treasurer has the moral courage to insist on the passing of the m'easure, while he is prepared to accept any amendments for which good, sound reason can be shown, and personally, I expect to see very considerable alteration made in Committee by the Treasurer, who, I believe, desires to obtain only that revenue which is absolutely essential, and to obtain it in the most equitable way possible.",15
69,Sir ROBERT BEST,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,What do you say is the principle of the Bill ?,15
70,Mr CORSER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"It is to tax those who, in consequence of the war, have made profits that otherwise they would not have made.",15
71,Mr HEITMANN,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,That is not the basis of the Bill .,15
72,Mr CORSER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,But that is what the Treasurer is trying to arrive at.,15
73,Mr ATKINSON,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,He cannot do it .,15
74,Mr CORSER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"He will do the best he can. I have taken an active part in the public affairs of Australia since the "" seventies,"" and Lhave never yet known a taxing measure to give universal satisfaction. I am glad to see that agriculturalists are exempted from the operation of the Bill , for there are not many who ever make more than 10 per cent., and to subare ject them to taxation of this kind would - be very cruel under circumstances of drought, and other causes well known to the House. I have only to refer to the sugar industry to show how fair this exemption is. In 1915-16, owing to drought, only about 50 p'er cent, of the crop was realized, not sufficient, in most instances, to pay working expenses. In 1916-17, in many cases, no crop was harThese vested on account of the Dickson award; and now, when a better crop than ever before is expected, to take 50 per cent, of the profits would be downright robbery ",15

76,Mr CORSER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"If the profits were disSurely these tributed over the three years, I think it would be found that the sugar growers have not made 10 per cent., or anything like it , on the average; indeed, they have had to borrow ""money over two years, in the hope of redeeming themselves in the third year. The suggestion has been made that a remedy for the present state of affairs might be found in . fixing prices, but that is a most dangerous, and, very often, inequitable policy to follow. Only a few days ago, at a meeting of the Queensland Farmers' Union, the president, Mr J. H . Cecil Roberts, said that a request has been made to the Prime Minister that' certain produce should be reduced in price to pre-war values. "" We will accept such prices,"" said Mr Roberts,, "" w h e n the people making these requests are prepared to accept pre-war rates of wages."" employers are called upon to pay higher wages, they must be paid more for itheir produce. In one Department, viz., the Railways, in Queensland, during the last two months, no less than 16 per cent, has been added to wages, and this addition, in itself, represents £250,000. stance, railway charges are increased the extra charge must be passed on; and I contend that just aa much consideration should be shown to primary producers, who work the longest hours, and under the worse conditions, as is shown to men who, with no responsibility or fear of drought, work for wages and live comfortably in the cities. When I was a member of the State Parliament of Queensland, and an attempt was made to fix prices, the Price Fixing Board made some very unjust awards, based on the cost at which one f i r m could land goods. The Board had the right to inspect books; and it was found that, in the case of one firm, goods were imported from , and wool and other produce exported to, Great Britain . The firm was able to save exchange both ways, and did not insure at the then price of 10 per cent., but took the risk themselves. The consequence was that they were enabled to land their goods in Queensland at a very low price. There were other firms which had no such arrangement for exportation Queensland, and they had to pay both . exchange and insurance. These firms purchased goods probably at the same price as did„the other f i r m , but they had to find a certain percentage of the cash in London, with the balance to be paid by deferred payments; and - the which negotiated the drafts took care to see that the .goods were insured at the prevailing rates. The insurance and the exchange had to be added to the cost; and honourable members will see how unjust the position became. Many firms refused to sell goods at less than cost price, - as they were asked to do by the Price Fixin g Board; and the result was that, while some country storekeepers could not get goods, others had to face the difficulty of paying absolute net cash, and also to impose cash conditions on primary producers to whom they had been, accustomed to give credit between If crops. The Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members have, at some length, produced figures showing the profits made by companies trading in Australia during the last three years. It is to be noted, however, that we are not informed If , for in - whether additional capital has been put into these businesses, or whether two businesses have been combined, when naturally larger profits would be shown. Such figures as have been produced, in stead of assisting the House, are only misleading. We should have heen informed of the capital invested in the various businesses, and what percentage the profits bear to that capital. All these figures put into Hansard mean nothing to the business man, but the outside community, many of whom know nothing of financial affairs, imagine that unreasonable profits are being made. If the - truth were known it might be seen that the firms have not received even the 10 per cent, exempted under the Bill , and, in many instances, not 5 per cent. _ I suggest to the Treasurer that the l i m it of thirty days, in which payment has to be made, is very short, and that it would avoid inconvenience if it were extended to three or four months. Although firms have made profits, it does not follow that they have received those profits in cash. A large proportion from would naturally be in their books, and it would take some time to collect it and distribute the profits shown as having been made in war time.",15

It will be very in convenient to many ' people to find the ready cash to pay into the Treasury within thirty days. . If they have to look to their financial institutions for assistance, many will be asking for assistance at the same time, and the effect on the finances of the Commonwealth might be so serious as to checK enterprise. This might occur just at a time when we should be increasing our enterprises, with a view to enabling those who are in Australia to make a reasonable living, and so that after the war our returned soldiers and others may be encouraged to settle on our lands and work in manufacturing in dustries. At the same time, we should take any unreasonable profits made as a result of - the war, and if the money so raised is not adequate we can make provision in other ways, so that each, individual bears his share of taxation. understand from the Treasurer that the Bill touches principally those people who have been making war-time profits.",16

80,Mr CORSER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"Every Bill does some injustice; but, generally speaking, the Bill people. before us will reach those people who have made war profits, profits which they would uot have made if there had been no war. It may be said that the losses sustained prior to the war should be set off against the profits which may have been made during the war, but if it is a profit that would not have been made if there had been no war, the person called upon to pay cannot feel hurt.",17
81,Mr RODGERS,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,Las t year the increment of profit was due rather to the disturbance caused by drought than to the war.,17
82,Mr CORSER,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"We know that such has been the case in some instances, but profits have been made through the war, and it is these that the Treasurer has in view. I know that large companies, such as the Mount Morgan and Mount Lyel l Companies, have enjoyed large profits for years, and continue .to enjoy them, and that this Bill will not touch them; but, as the Treasurer has said, we will need more money, and they will be touched after we have reached those who have made money purely out of the war.",17
83,Mr RODGERS,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"-There is no provision in the Bill for that. The Treasurer catches the man who is making a struggling recovery from the drought, and lets the man who has been complacently drawing a big income all the time escape.",17

It seems to me that the Billis a gun, the range of which nobody can exactly tell. It has not been tested yet, and whilst doubtless there is an honest desire on all sides that the measure shall realise at least some-of the hopes expressed in regard to it by people outside Parliament, yet we find that some of the best legal authorities in the House are dubious about its results. ""We all know that, dently on account of the wealth and standards of comfort which have been joyed ever since the beginning of the war, tax, scarcely any section of the community gives outward evidence of pinch on acto count of the war itself. My opinion is that the hopes of the people who believe that it is possible to take from the fits made by various individuals and comfits panies since the war began a share of what may be termed illegitimate profits, that is to say, the profits made during the war over and above normal profits in will escape the tax. pre-war times, will not be realized. withstanding the honesty of effort repremaking sented in the long-deferred submission this measure in accordance with a mise made months ago, it is impossible to get hold of much of the profit that been already consumed in increased stanthis dards of comfort and livin g without ento trenching, in many instances, upon the means by which increasing businesses may be successfully carried on. It would have been infinitely better if the Governconnexion ment bf which I was a supporter when the war broke out had taken definite steps to prevent the possible accumulation derivation of profits during the war. However much people may differ with regard to the evils of governmental conput, trol, or State interference with industry by price fixing, or by any other methods, yet all must agree that those are the means that any of the allied Governments in the Old World has found practicable for conserving the interests of the people and preventing exploitation and starvation. The .Government in power when Copper, the war broke out would have been well Tin advised had they taken definite action .to Lead fix prices for the manufacturer and reSpelter tailer on their invoices, allowing a reasonI able percentage over and above normal profits, rather than that we should have allowed to develop that state of affairs which renders a measure of this kind necessary, and which, I believe, will it largely ineffective, however good the i tentions of its author's may be. As an instance of what I mean, I was informed the other day that some firms engaged in making agricultural machinery in Australia had a three years' supply of steel purchased at pre-war rates. Even if those firms were making big profits before the war by turning out evia huge quantity of machinery, they high are able now by merely reducing entheir output to escape this proposed by reason of the advantageous, position in which they stand in regard several of the raw materials for their manufactures. I believe that firms which were making 60 per cent, or 70 per. cent, proprofit before the war, even if their proare no greater now, though they have changed the. character of their business and are engaged in enterprises from which they derive actual war profits, Again, there Notare big solid concerns - which, whilst large profits, capitalized the of greater part of those profits and deproclared dividends of only 6 per cent, to 8 per cent.. Operating from that has safe vantage ground, they are allowed by Bill to make an additional 2 per cent, 4k per cent, profit before they exceed the 10 per cent, exemption, without paying a shilling of additional taxation. That state of affairs would be possible in with large companies engaged in mining metals used for munitions. The Bill takes no cognisance of the prices or charged for those products before and after the war. If the companies producing those metals merely reduce their outthey are able to derive the same or a greater profit without paying taxation, notwithstanding that the percentages have only risen so high. I find that metals have increased in price as follows:1914. 1917. £ s. £ s. Copper, electrolytic 61 0 140 0 standard 56 12 130 0 132 5 245 0 18 15 30 10 21 15 54 - 0 t is very clear that if we. are to reach the real profit derived by companies engaged in these operations in which these tremendous increases in price have taken place, there must be some means of fixing make the profit upon the output, even after n - allowing for the extra cost of production that may have been caused by the war At the outbreak of the war a man might have started in a small way of business with a capital of perhaps £1,000 which 1 he had saved up during a period in which he had been engaged as a servant in business or in production. Although his capital was small, he might be of .that class of man who is worth £1 000 per annum : in any industry upon whioh he embarks on his own account. He may make £2,000 or £3,000 profit, and, as he had no pre-war standard of profits, and his capital being infinitesimal, this Bill will deprive him practically of all the f r u it s of his in dustry or his opportunities. Personally, I do not think that in a War-time Profits Bill there is the slightest justification for any exemptions as exemptions. But exemptions may possibly be justified for the reason that it is utterly impossible to fix a standard of comparison that will enable certain industries to be included without manifest injustice. Take the farming class, for instance. As a farmer myself, I see no reason why those of us who combine grazing and grain-growing should be exempt from the operations of this tax. Doubtless it would be easy to show that the average share-farmer, pr small wheat farmer, after allowing interest at the rate of 10 per cent, on the amount of capital invested in his enterprise in pre-war years, and deducting labour and other charges, would show no profit at all. But if it can be shown that farmers have made a profit, there is no reason why they should be exempt. What I am particularly interested in is the point raised by the honourable member  basic principle upon which we are to get the exemption of 10 per cent. Clause 16, in defining "" Capital,"" says, "" The amount of the capital of a business shall be taken to be the amount of its capital paid up by the owner in money or in kind."" That definition would have the effect of bringing about a result which, perhaps, I can best express by mentioning a concrete example. Suppose that A , with his family, is the original holder of 5,000 acres of land acquired from the Crown at £1 per acre, held, perhaps, for the last t h i r ty or ^ years, and having on it improvements in buildings, fencing, ring-barking, clearing, <Ssc, worth another £ 1 per acre. If I correctly interpret clause 16, such a man woxtld be allowed only £10,000 as the capital upon which to base his claim for a 10 per cent, exemption. Even if stock had been bred on the property, as is usually - the case, there is no provision, that I can see, for including the value of that stock. Mr Lynch. 7 thousand pounds would be the basis upon which the exemption would be calculated. On the other hand, a settler who purchased on a walk-in walk-out basis a similar holding, stocked in the same way, for £20,000, would be entitled to 10 per cent, on that £20,000. If the £200 exemption added to the 10 per cent, basis were allowed and the 50 per cent, profit to be taken under this Bill for the 1915-16 quota, then the original holder, who had selected at £ 1 per acre, would pay about £250- I am assuming a £2,000 profit in the year 1915-16-and on the same basis the man who had purchased on the walk-in walkout basis at £ 4 per acre, would not have to pay one penny until he could show a profit of £2,500. I am confident that the Treasurer will avoid any uncertainty in this matter by inserting definite provisions in the Bil l itself. It is all very well to leave definitions to officers administering the Act. but we know from experience that even the capable and disinterested men administering the Federal Income Tax Act are bound by the law as they interpret it . Dnder the Income Tax Act, in the case of a man on the land, the value of his stock is set down as the price at which he purchased it , but he must credit in his account sales the actual prices realized for that stock. Apar t from the deduction allowed in respect of moneys borrowed on the property itself no deduction can be made in respect of the capital 1 invested in the grass and water which enabled the increased value to be put into his stock from the time that .they were purchased or dropped until he disposed of them. These are principles which, to my mind, need to be very carefully defined, and in view of his long and varied experience in public life, I feel confident that 1 the Treasurer will see that they are. Coming to the question of exemptions, if this is to be a war-time profits measure for t y I fail to see why professional men and others should be exempt where it can be clearly shown that their increased returns since the war are due to the war or to circumstances which have developed in consequence of it , I do not think that the provisions of this Bill could be fairly applied to members of Parliament. The suggestion .made some time ago by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charl j ton) that an all-round deduction from inTen comes should be made would be a much better way of taxing, so to speak, the salaries of honourable members. By doing something in that direction we should give hostages to our sincerity in this matter.",17
94,Sir JOHN FOBREST,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,I do not think that an honourable member makes much out of his £600 a year.,20
95,Mr LYNCH,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"My experience is that he makes nothing out of it ; but it would not do to introduce the card system with the object, of out what we are all doing. seems to me that while a few honourable members, as Ministers, are almost worked to death, others are doing their best to see that they are properly crushed W i th theoutbreak of war many of us thought that some such action as I have suggested would be taken. It was then that the honourable' member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) suggested that neither members of Parliament nor any one else in the community should be allowed an income of more than £200 a year-that all earnings in excess of that amount should go to the State. A fte r all, he was merely voicing a suggestion made by a gentleman in New South Wales who is not usually associated with very advanced forms of thought. I "" refer to Mr Abbott, of Wingen, who suggested that all salaries be reduced to £200 . I could not support such a proposition, because I believe that if the incomes of those who enjoy £10,000 a year were reduced to £200 per annum, we should have thrown on our hands hosts of people who in some way or other derive a living from the extravagances or the expenditures of such men. Even at this, the eleventh hour, however, we should take some determined action to prevent men, whether they he. engaged in commercial or manufacturing pursuits or in primary industries, making huge profits. I admit that there are many difficulties in the way, but it would be better to make the effort rather than to attempt the impossible, ' as the Government are now doing. We should exact the payment of a fair proportional amount on the part of every individual who, wittingly or unwittingly, has profited on ac. count of the war or during war time.. Attempts have been made to show that there is no foundation for the complaints we hear on every hand as to the profiteering that is going on. As. a man who makes his livin g by growing wheat, meat, and wool, I say distinctly that the consumers'of Australia are not being fair l y treated. Our systems lend themselves to wholesale robbery. Notwithstanding that we live in a country filled with the primary necessities of every-day existence, conditions are developing that make it harder and harder for the people to gain sustenance. Whether he be producing on a large or a small scale, I have no sympathy with the finding, man who insists that, even in these abIt normal times, he should not be called upon to make any sacrifice, and that his every effort shall be paid for according 'to the highest standards - Such a man gives us one of the worse exhibitions of the goslow or don't-go-at-all policy. Nor have I any sympathy with the man who thinks he can better his position by refusing to give an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. It is essential that the community should do for individuals what they cannot do for themselves. While I hold that it is impossible, by a measure of this kind, to stop profiteering, I realise at the-same time that the Government are bound to give effect to their pledge to the people. When the Bill shall have been ultimately passed, I hope that it will afford some measure of relief, and do something to assist in developing in Australia the truly patriotic spirit which is best expressed by - people in every walk of life making sacrifices, foregoing profits, and so assisting in every way to tide the Commonwealth over the disastrous times through which we are passing. However much this effort to bring about such a situation may fal l short of its object, if it only does something in that direction it will meet with the approval of the people. I do not agree with those who say that the Bill should be dropped, and that an increased income tax should be levied. There are in Australia today numberless people who are deriving pretty fair incomes, which are already coming under the heavier proportional rates of taxation. They are paying such taxation notwithstanding that they are not securing any increased emoluments in consequence of or during the war. On the contrary, their expenses owing to the increase in the cost of living have gone up. An era of extravagance has come upon the people. We are like children revelling in today, utterly regardless of what the morrow may bring forth . . By the adoption of some of the suggesquired, tions which have been made in the course no,t of the debate, this Bill may be so proved by amendment as to tend towards the realization of our ideals. I hope, howmeasure. ever, that the Government will take more vigorous and drastic steps to do what the Labour Government ought to have done when the war broke out in 1914. I trust they will grasp the nettle firmly. understand there are several honourable members who desire to speak this afterintroduced, noon, I shall say no more at this stage, there are several matters with which shall deal when the Bill goes into Committee. I shall content myself with the expression of the pious hope that too many of our aspirations will not be shattered by this measure.",20

I am rather surprised at the amendment brought forward by the Leader' of the Opposition . (Mr Tudor), having regard to the War-profits Bill introduced by the Government, of which he was a prominent member. Combeen paring it with the Bill now before us, can find but little change other than that which must have been induced by serious thought. The first Bill introduced by Labour Government was a hotch-potch measure, the provisions of which were taken almost entirely from the British Act. The statement made by the then Treasurer (Mr Higgs), that in the year of its operation it was proposed take 100 per cent, of the profits of the community, showed how lightly the Gowhich vernment of the day had grasped the economics of this country.  be retrospective-extendin g over the last three years?",21
97,Mr GREGORY,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"No ; that is what the. Leader of the Opposition now says should be done. His statement only goes show how the views of some honourable members alter when they are relieved of the responsibilities of office. The honormade able member's desire appears to be to k i the Bill . He speaks of it as totally adequate for the raising of the revenue and yet he admits that he does know whether it will ' o r will not proi m - duce more revenue than would be produced by what I may term the Higgs H is is not a fair attitude to assume towards the Bill . I do not like the idea of retrospective legislation, but the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) gave the people of Australia As I a clear intimation that legislation of the kind now under consideration would be and this Government made a but ^similar announcement, so that the tradI ing community has had warning of, and should be to some extent prepared for, the proposed taxation. It would, however, be preposterous to go back another year, and I cannot understand the object of the Leader of the Opposition in proposing so to do, seeing that he was a member of the Ministry which was responsible for the Bill of the honourable member for Capricornia. The Leader of the Opposition complains also of the delay in imposing this taxation, but the blame for that is to be laid at the door of the Government one of which he was a member. It was seen almost immediately after the outbreak of war that legislation of this kind was de- sirable, yet when Mr Fisher left Australia, in January, 1916, eighteen mouths after the outbreak of war, no Bill had brought in . I do not like this Bill , I but I feel that a special effort must be made to raise revenue at this time, and that those whose profits have been in the creased by the war should be made to disgorge the greater portion of their war gains. The difficulty is to determine what is a war profit and what is merelv a wartime profit. I would say that the imsecond mense profits made by shipping comto panies, due to the increase in freights, are war profits, as are also ""the profits are being made by the increase in the price of wool and the extraordinary increases in the prices of metal.. The to country has had to undertake so large an expenditure because of the war, and to make such big sacrifices, that we are justified in asking those who have made great profits out of the war to pay a large to share of the excess to the State.",21
98,Mr BRENNAN,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"Some persons have huge profits, with which the war l l has had nothing to_do, but they are to be in - left untouched, and only those whose prore- - fits are due to the war are to be taxed.",21

It would be monstrous those who are interested in our big emporiums, which at the outbreak of the had huge stocks, of which in some cases they were able to increase the prices 600 or 700 per cent., escaped taxation. mere hotch-potch. If in Committee the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine) can convince us that the Commissioner or a Board of Referees may safely be given power to determine what profits shall taxed, the Bill can be simplified considerthe war began. ably, and with advantage to the trading community. But we must walk with treme caution in this matter. It behoves fit prior to the war. us to be careful not to do anything that may destroy industry, because it is sary that our production should be in - liament. creased as much as possible. We must also take care not to drive capital out of graceful. the country. Capital is a shy bird, which which are almost superhuman. is easily frightened away; but almost every other country that is at war has imposed taxation similar to this. I do not agree with those who propose that we should take away all excess profits. In my opinion, the Bill will provide revenue than is estimated by the TreaWhile surer. The Treasury estimates effect of the new methods of taxationhave others. not been up to date, and I feel satisfied, who from what I have read of the way i large companies are putting aside to meet this taxation, that the Bill produce much more than the Treasurer's on their stock. estimate.

If we had a pre-war standard, such as provided in the Bill , a mine like the Great Boulder, which for, fifteen or twenty years has been paying £25,000 or £27,000 per month, or over a quarter of a million year, would not be asked tb pay a single sixpence, whereas another mine which came a producer this year, or in the two previous years, would only be able to take advantage of the 10 per cent.'",22

It would be all r i g h t ' in the case of a well-developed mine, .but, in the case of an ordinary mine, where the developments are usually just ahead of the battery, there would be the slightest. considerable difficulty. I notice that, according to the Bill , the tax is payable within thirty after the notice of assessment, and I fancy there will be many applications for relief. There may be instances in which the payments will range from £5,000 to £2""0,000, and it may be necessary to borrow money to pay the tax. Of course, there is an appeal to the Court, but, under the Bill , the money has first to be found. I suggest that the Treasurer provide for be payments in quarterly instalments, for the present provision would prove very not harsh, especially in view of the fact that,f the tax is not paid within the stipulated time, an extra 10 per cent, is charged. While many of us take an active in in the measure, and desire that it i th .shall be amended the Treasurer can rest that every effort will be. made to to enable the Government to obtain a large proportion of excessive war profits.

144,Mr LECKIE,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"It seems to me that the Bill will be s t ill more involved fore we finish. While some people could make as big profits as they liked before the war, and can still continue to make them, those who have just begun to make a few profits will not be allowed to do so. Several industries have been started in Australia since the outbreak of the war."" The Commonwealth Government distinctly encouraged people to seize the opportunity of building up industries which did not exist in Australia before. fact of Germany being out of the market gave thera the opportunity for building up certain trades here, and dozens of in dustries have been established because the imports from Germany and other countries have been shut out. However, if the tax is to be imposed in the way the Bill indicates, all those 'businesses will be shut up and ruined. Most of them have had to start with very small capital, and have had to build their factories and bu.y their machinery on terms extending over a number of years.",26

146,Mr LECKIE,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"I am not sure of Each honourable member seems to be fident that the Bill will do something, hut the Treasurer is not so confident. fact, he differs from everybody else in very surprising to me. some particular. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition declares that Bill is inadequate, because it does raise from wealth the money required the war. It is certainly a good principle that the money required for a particular year should be raised in that year, not some time ahead; but I do not know what the honourable member expects to obtain by his amendment. When he says that wealth is not bearing its due proportion of the expenses of the war, the face of i the must be wrong. I do not say that I shall vote against the Bill , but. at the same time, I its effect with great foreboding. lieve that the effect will be to keep the big businesses going .and to ' keep small businesses small, and that in a few years' time its iniquities will have to be exdied. Unless amendments in Committee will cure the particular evils I complain of, and if the measure is administered as I think it will be, from a departmental point of view, one effect will 'be that be^ hundreds of men will be put out of employment in the case of quite a number of industries to which I could point. I hope that the things I complain of will be altered in Committee, but I have very grave doubt as to the ultimate effect of the measure. It seems to me that it will not h it those people who are making big profits before the war, and are still continuing to make them.",26
147,Mr WISE,ADVISOR Y COUNCIL OF SCIENCE,"Gippsland) [?.30] - It The seems to me that both the amendment and a great deal of the criticism levelled at the Bill are altogether misplaced. The amendment states "" that in the opinion of this House the Bill is utterly inadequate, and signally fails to place upon wealth .its due share of the expenses of the war."" I could understand that amendment being moved on the Budget, but I cannot understand it being moved as an amendment on the second reading of this Bill , which never intended to place on wealth its due share of the expenses of this war. The principle of the measure is one to which both parties are' and is the same as that in the introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) that. when he was Treasurer in the first conHughes Government. That fact makes a lot of the criticism which has come In from the Opposition side of the House ,The Labour party adopted in Caucus the Bill which the the honourable member for Capricornia not produced in this House, and as ithe meaf o r sure now before us is modelled on the plan of its predecessor, I am astonished that it should have met with such hostile and criticism from honourable members opposite. Members on both sides pledged themselves on the election platform to the principle of this tax, the primary object of which is to secure for the Treasury on profits made by reason of the war. That was the original purpose of legislation of this kind, but it was found here, as it had been found in Great Britain, that it view would be very difficult indeed to prove I bein every case exactly what profits had arisen from the war, and in order to overcome that difficulty, the measure was framed to tax profits made during warremetime. Knowing that such a tax would operate unfairly in many cases, the , framers of the Bill endeavoured to avoid unfairness, as much as possible, by inserting conditions and exemptions, and it is in dealing with them that so much of the trouble has arisen. If we approve of the principle of the Commonwealth acquiring as much of the war-time profits as it can, we should, instead of voting for the amendment, and so rejecting the Bill , try to get the measure into Committee, and-there amend it in such a way that it will achieve the object we have in view. Personally, I think that many of the exemptions should be struck out. If we could get hold of the actual war profits I would have no hesitation in supporting a proposal that the Commonwealth should take the lot of them, but the difficulty consists in arriving at what are war profits. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie) was a little unfair when he said that this Bill differed, as regards the beginning of the accounting period, from the B i ll introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia. Looking at the memorandum showing the amendments which this Bill makes on the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill of 1916, I find that the first few lines of clause 7 are exactly the same, namely- There shall be levied and paid on the amount by which the profits arising from any business to which this Act applies, in any accounting - period ending after the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and fifteen, The honourable member also said that the honourable member for Capricornia had objected to retrospective legislation. This is what the former Treasurer said, and if his remarks were applicable to his own Bill they are much more applicable todayIn the United Kingdom, the War Profits Bill was passed in 1915, and covered the first eleven months of the war. The Government do not - propose to tax the profits accruing during that period, because the firms and companies have, probably, in all cases, distributed their profits,"" and it might cause a very great deal of irritation if we now demanded that they should make good those profits. That is very sensible in not to tax the profits for the year 1914, and I am all the more surprised that a member of the Government whose Treasurer enunciated that view should propose to make' the Bill retrospective so as to tax the profits earned in 1914. I shall vote against the amendment and for the Bill, and I hope that in Committee it Mr Wise. will be so amended as to achieve the object which we all desire.

The Treasurer would meet the views of honourable members on both sides of the House by affording us such an opportunity.
