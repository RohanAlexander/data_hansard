The humble petition of the undersigned citizens monwealth respectfully showeth: That we suppon the concept of no fault divorce in the Family Law Bill because: (1) Marriage is not merely a contract it is a relationship. (2) That if a party withdraws from that relationship for whatever reason there is no good to be achieved by insisting on a continuance of a contractual shell. (3) that where a marriage relationship has demonstrably broken down divorce should be as quick and simple as posspetition ible in the interests of the dignity emotional well being of the children.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament will speedily revoke the decision of the Australian Government to recognize de jure the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union and place the question of oppression of human rights in the Baltic States before the United Nations. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Jarman. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble tralian petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the reduction of the allowable deduction of education expenses under Section 82J of the Income Tax Assessment Act from $400 to $ 1 SO is $30 That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether nongovernment or government; and particularly on parents with more than one child at school. That this reduction will further restrict the freedom availTo able to parents to make a choice of school for their children. of That some parents who have chosen to a non-government school will dren and send them to government schools already over crowded and under staffed. That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more the future, are the parents of children in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian That parents should be encouraged by the Australian Government to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional financial penalty is who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an important financial contribution to Australian educauon over and above what they contribute through taxment ation. That an alternative system, adopted as being more equitable for all parents with children at school. To compensate for the losses reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to parents, at least at the 1973/1974 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates. by Mr Jarman.

The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully to send their children showeth: have to withdraw their chilThat the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost four out of five Australians more that the present scheme. in That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a further erosion of the civil liberties of Australian citizens, particucommumty. . larly working wives and single persons.

3,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,I address a question to the Prime Minister who is just coming into the chamber.,19
4,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,He was already talking in the chamber.,19
5,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Bu the was talking to somebody at the door, which is outside the chamber. I accept- I say this with sincerity to the Prime Minister-and I recognise his anxiety to make a contribution to moderating the interrelated problems of inflation and unemployment but I suggest to him, in sincerity, that anxiety is not a substitute for a total and consistent economic and financial policy effectively administered. Will the Prime Minister now admit that because the estimated increase in Government revenue will rise not by the 31 per cent as estimated in the Budget but by 40 per cent and will bring in an extra $ 1,000m in taxes with personal income tax rising by 65 per cent, and in the light of the statement by the Treasurer yesterday that the internal deficit will be of the order of $ 1,300m",19
6,Mr UREN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I rise to take a point of order. I know that, because he is a former Prime Minister, certain privileges are given to the right honourable gentleman. But is he obeying the Standing Orders of this Parliament by making a second reading speech and giving information at question time? Is he to be given that special consideration over all other members?",19
7,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I ask the right honourable Staff gentleman to make his question as brief as possible. I would like as many questions as possible to be asked each day, in fairness to all back benchers who wish to ask them. The only way to get as many quesuons as possible is to make questions brief so that answers may be brief also. I ask the right honourable gentleman to observe loss of relativity with the that request.",19
8,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Than k you, Mr Speaker. Will the Prime Minister now agree that the new mini-budget proposals are totally inadequate, inrelauvity and take into account appropriate and internally inconsistent, and therefore likely to cause great damage to the Australian community? Will he also now reconsider the whole matter, particularly in the light of the rejection of one of the foundations of the new policy by many trade unions of indexation and bring down a new Budget immediately?",19
9,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,No . NA,19
10,Mr FITZPATRICK,PLAGUE LOCUSTS,Is the Prime Minister aware of the severe infestation of spur-throated locusts in the Walgett area? Can the Prime Minister indicate what form of Australian Government assistance is available for the eradication of this infestation? Is the Australian Government prepared to examine a proposal under the Regional Employment Development Scheme for this purpose?,19
11,Mr WHITLAM,PLAGUE LOCUSTS,"I have informed the Premier of New South Wales that the Australian Government is happy to consider a proposal under the Regional Employment Development Scheme to help in the eradication of this particular form of locust infestation. I had to tell the Premier that the Australian Government did not have at its disposal any of the aircraft which he said would help in this process. Quite clearly, the Air Force and the Department of Transport do not have aircraft with the characteristics which are required for spraying locusts. In Queensland the Australian Government is sharing 50/50 in the cost of a program which the Queensland Premier estimates will cost about $750,000 to counter this particular infestation. As honourable gentlemen will know, the Australian Government and the State governments in the context of the Agricultural Council have decided to establish an Australian Plague Locust Commission. It ought to be possible within Australia- a nation occupying a single land mass, with a very large cordon of seas around it-to make a concerted and successful effort to eradicate locusts. There has been some reluctance hitherto by State governments to join in a concerted effort because locusts affect some parts of Australia more than other parts, and some varieties of locusts affect some of the States which are affected by locusts in general but do not affect other States which are affected by locusts in general. But, between us all, we ought at least to. see that this historic plague does not persist in Australia.",19
12,Mr WENTWORTH,PLAGUE LOCUSTS,"Mr Speaker, could I thank the Prime Minister for having caught up on this at last?",20
13,Mr SPEAKER,PLAGUE LOCUSTS,Order! I would remind the honourable member for Mackellar that he is not entitled to get up and to break out into a speech unless he gets the call. He is not entitled to ask question unless he gets the call. NA,20
14,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,"The Minister for Labor and Immigration will recall that, when, recently, he opened the annual conference of the South Australian Good Neighbour Council he stated that the Government had now imposed quotas on migrant source countries. Can the Minister inform die House in percentage and numerical terms of the distribution of the overall migrant quota among the countries from which we have received migrants in the past? What percentage of the total migrant quota will come from countries such as the United Kingdom and Italy?",20
15,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,"I think that I could do that off the cuff, but as I do not want to make an error in regard to one country about which I am not sure I ask the honourable member to treat his question as being on notice and I shall write him a letter. INDUSTRY: REINVESTMENT",20
16,Mr ARMITAGE,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,Did the Prime Minister make it clear in his statement last Tuesday the Government recognises industry's need an adequate level of earnings tofinancereinvestment? Will he confirm that his letter to the Prices Justification Tribunal on this matter represents an expression of on-going Government policy?,20
17,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,"I am very happy to confirm the proposition which the honourable gendeman puts to me. This is the second time that I have made a submission by letter to the Chairman the Prices Justification Tribunal. Thefirsttime was on 24 July in terms of the Treasurer's speech on the previous night. The second time was in terms which I gave to the House 2 nights ago. believe it is helpful for the Tribunal to have general submissions of this character to guide in its important work, particularly in the stages in which- I would Uke to say here again, as I have on many occasions previously-the Tribunal has developed so admirably and effectively. The Tribunal has had a very great impact the in restraining price increases. Inflation in Australia would have been very much worse if the Tribunal had not been estabUshed and if it had not so effectively set out to carry out its statutory duties. On this occasion, as I said 2 nights ago, the Government wants to make it plain to the Tribunal that in its view there should be no restriction of priceriseswhich are necessary to ensure that companies are able to make as substantial provision for investment as they have made in a the past. It is quite obviously important for employment in the community that companies should be able to cany out their investment programs. I am sure that the Tribunal would not wish to",20
18,Mr SINCLAIR,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,Spea k up. We cannot hear. Mr MCLeay-The Prime Minister should stop mumbling. Mr Katter-He is talking to his left wing.,20
19,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,Order! I ask the Prime Minister please to speak into the microphone.,20
20,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,"The courteous thing in answering a question is to address the Speaker or the questioner, and I will pursue that courteous practice. If the Opposition did not behave at question time as it did 2 nights ago in the words of one leading newspaper as 'a collection of aging school boys' everybody would be able to hear quite clearly what I am saying. Mr Speaker, I am sure-in answer to the honourable member for Chifley-that the Prices Justification Tribunal wiU play its part in seeing that employment is maintained or encouraged in Australia through that the necessary investment programs of compames for which come within its jurisdiction. MINISTERIAL TRAVEL: OVERSEAS",20
21,Mr SINCLAIR,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,"I ask the Prime Minister, who is Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question. The Prime Minister will be aware of the precedent he has established in taking with him a large entourage when travelling of abroad. I ask the Prime Minister initially: Are guideUnes issued to members of that entourage setting out the parameters of the responsibilities the of those who accompany him? The Prime MinisWe ter wiU also be aware that the Deputy Prime Minister is presently in the United States of it America with a large party, having recently initial attended the Australian Trade Fair in the Peoples' Republic of China. Is the Prime Minister aware of reports emanating from China that during the Fair and within the Australian Embassy in Peking, following a dinner, a member of the Australian party attached to the Deputy Prime Minister punched an Australian exhibitor, drawing blood, assaulted the Australian Ambassador to China and scuffled with a United States diplomat resulting in that diplomat's clothing beingripped?Have diplomatic protests been received either from the United States of America or from the Peoples' RepubUc of China? Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Prime Minister taken any action on this incident? Have apologies been extended to Chinese officials who saw this reported unfortunate incident?",20
22,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION QUOTAS,"I have heard nothing of the kind. I would be surprised if there was any truth in the honourable member's aUegations because as Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister, and being in frequent contact with the Minister for Overseas Trade during and since his visit to China, I have heard nothing of these matters. It is quite clear that if there had been a diplomatic protest I would have heard of it. I have not heard of any such protest. Since the aUegations come from the Deputy Leader of one of the Parties in the Parliament, I will certainly have inquiries made. But the aUegations come as a complete surprise to me. By way of preamble the honourable member asks about those who accompany me overseas. represent There is no need for me to lay down guideUnes for the persons at the level who accompany me because the heads and deputy heads of governhonourable ment departments in my experience are extrathere ordinarily competent and correct persons. Those who will be accompanying me on my visit to Europe next month and in the early part of January wiU be the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary of the DepartQueensland ment of Minerals and Energy, a deputy secretary of the Prime Minister's Department and deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have no doubt that they will carry their duties with credit to the Australian PubUc Service and to Australia. NA SPENDING: HOUSING",21
23,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PROPOSED CUT IN GOVERNMENT,"Can the Minister for Housing and Construction indicate what effect an 8 per cent across the board cut in Government spending would have? As details of what this large cut in pubUc spending would mean are of vital interest to the electors, Minister state what an 8 per cent reduction in spending would mean if appUed to funds made available by his Department for housing in the State of Queensland? Is the Minister aware that this procedure has been advocated strongly by both the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition?",21
24,Mr LES JOHNSON,PROPOSED CUT IN GOVERNMENT,"I have asked my Department to look at this question. The effect of the proposal made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition recently on a television program in connection with my Department would be along these lines: There would be a staff reduction in my Department ranging from 600 to 800 employees. The ""works staff would be reduced by 1,800 employees. In addition to that, there would be a curtailment of the consultancies involving the dismissal of some 60 personnel. Of course, there would be a subsequent flow-on of these staff reductions to a number of industries that are related to the Department of Housing and Construction. There would also be a reduction in the number of defence service homes loans made. This reduction would be in the vicinity of 800 loans. That is to say, some 800 ex-servicemen would be deprived of the opportunity to take their defence service homes loans. So far as the Commonwealth-State housing agreement is concerned, there would be a reduction in the vicinity of $25m in the allocation of funds to the States. Of course, this could a reduction in the order of 1,250 in the number of homes provided. So far as Queensland is concerned, the net effect of the gentleman's proposals that, firstly, should not have been Budget increases in Government spending and, secondly, over and above that, there should be an 8 per cent across the board curtailment in Government spending, would be that funds made available to for housing commission purposes would have been $20.6m as against the $30.9m a already made avaUable for this purpose. So honourable gentlemen can see that if the Liberal out and Country Parties had been in office at this time and the undertakings of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had been given effect there would have been a massive reduction in the pubUc works program in Australia and highly deleterious effects on the prospects of fulfilling the aspirations of the home-seeking pubUc. NA",21
25,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM MINISTRY,I ask the Prime Minister to state unequivocally his confidence in the Minister can the for Housing and Construction.,21
26,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM MINISTRY,"The right honourable gentleman has already asked this question a couple of days ago about one of my colleagues. He is now asking it about a second. There are 24 others. Therefore, I suppose, this game can go on well into next year, the year after and in fact until the middle of 1977. It is sufficient for me to say that all my Ministers act collectively and express the collective decisions of the Government. I am sorry that the Standing Orders do not give me the right to ask the right honourable gentleman which ofhis supporters-thos e behind him-hav e confidence in him. It is well known that despite all this extraordinary combination of pomposity and pettifoggery which he displays day after day he neither leads nor inspires. NA",22
27,Mr GARRICK,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to reports of high praise for Tuesday's economic statement from the Presidents of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Institute of AppUed Economic and Social Research and many business leaders? mittee Does he welcome these statements as a positive Launceston, contribution to the estabUshment tract on which national prosperity can be sein Launceston, in with curely based? Does he regret statements throwtextile industry. I can teU the as ing doubt on the effectiveness of Tuesday's man and the other members of measures from people who call repeatedly for a very important measure was announced restoration of business confidence?",22
28,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I have observed and I have been pleased to observe that there have been pressions of support for the statement. I made Tuesday night from the gentlemen whom the areas. honourable member mentioned and from very is many other persons in positions of responsibiUty and leadership among employers and emspelt ployees. I have no doubt whatever that the comgrant, munity in general will respond to these timely actions which have been taken in the Parliament and which of course we can put into effect early as legislative and administrative proundergoing cedures allow. Since the honourable gentleman has given me the opportunity perhaps I should quote what I think is a very succinct and effective statement of one aspect, the principal aspect, of what I said last Tuesday. It appears in today's 'Australian Financial Review' and reads: The main anti-inflationary economic policy, as enunciated by Mr Whitlam on Tuesday night is to be sought in a deal which the Government is asking the Arbitration Commission to acquiesce in: the income tax cut has been offered not in the somewhat naive terms in which the Opposition has proposed it, as a way of persuading wage earners to moderate their demands, but as a way of persuading the Arbitration Commission to moderate its awards. I might add that it is clear that as a result of the programs which I further developed in my statement on Tuesday night employees-that is, the vast bulk of men and women who work in Australia-wil l be more secure in their jobs and their plans, and private employers, who provide three-quarters of the employment in Australia, will be able with confidence to pursue programs which wiU enable them to keep and put men and women on their payrolls. NA",22
29,Mr ELLICOTT,TEXTILE INDUSTRY,Has the Minister for Manufacturing Industry received the report known as the task force report covering the textile industry in Tasmania and elsewhere? Is it a fact that the report recommends particular special assistance to the textile industry in Launceston and Wangaratta? Will the Minister teU the House what special assistance was recommended for Launceston and what steps the Government proposes to take in relation to that recommendation?,22
30,Mr ENDERBY,TEXTILE INDUSTRY,"An interdepartmental comhas been considering the situation in and its report has been received. It is of a social contrue that it deals the employment situation particular it relates to the honourable gentlethe House that a two or three weeks ago which will give considerable assistance tofirmsin Launceston.

The scheme has considerable significance not only as a means as of giving assistance to firms which might be temporary difficulty but also as an instrument of poUcy designed to advance structural change in industry generaUy. It is a very major new initiative of this Government. I hope that at the end of this week, or at the latest early next week, a series of advertisements will appear in newspapers around the country informing people of the facUities being made available in aspect of the Government's this way. NA",22
31,Dr JENKINS,TAXATION CUTS,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Like the honourable member for Batman, I refer to reports and comments in reaction to the Prime Minister's statement on the economy. In this statement the Prime Minister referred to the proposal of the Government to compensate wage and salary earners for price increases during the December quarter by means of a cut in taxation. Although I believe the stateits ment on this issue was perfectly clear, I ask Prime Minister to give further information this proposal so that the House and also Ausarterial tralian wage and salary earners may confirm the this area? exact nature of the concept contained in the statement.",22
32,Mr WHITLAM,TAXATION CUTS,"I have seen comment in one based on tofacts. of the newspapers this morning, no doubt an acattributed cidentally inaccurate comment, which misreprequirements resents the proposal which I put forward on beQueensland. Let us half of the Government on Tuesday Government is saying basically that the tax increased reduction will compensate employees for cost living changes in the present quarter, the December quarter. A system of automatic indexmonwealth ation could therefore only logically begin at the earliest with the next quarterly figures to be on announced, namely, those for the March quarter not matter of 1975. A wage indexation increase could therethan any other fore only be given by the Conciliation and Arbiare concerned, let tration Commision after the March quarter matter. Queensland figure is announced. While the Government already stated the view it will put before Commission, I point out that this is a matter decision not by the Government but by the Arbi59 per cent that rural communites got aswith tration Commission. In any event, I point out that the national case now proceeding before Commission which will deal with the question wage indexation and related issues is most unticularly likely on all reasonable indications to produce arbitrated decision before the New Year, other words, during the March quarter. This is an Bjelke-Petersen obvious further reason why the first wage ment. increase arising out of an indexation system could only begin with the figures announced the end of the March quarter. The Government welcomes the statement of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions reported provocative. yesterday that the Government proposal was a very genuine and dinkum attempt to begin a tem of effective cost of living adjustments means of the tax reduction for the December quarter of 1974 and by means of automatic indexation in the immediate following quarter. NA",23
33,Mr CORBETT,ROAD FUNDS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport. Is the Minister aware of the drastic effect on arterial road development of the substantial reduction infinanceavailable for urban and rural arterial roads? Is he aware that large numbers of employees of local authorities have been dismissed or face dismissal because local authorities have received much less work as constructing authorities for main roads departments? If he is aware of this position and tragic effect on our towns, will the Minister the and the Government take steps to rectify it by on allocating more finance for rural and urban roads and so reduce unemployment in",23
34,Mr CHARLES JONES,ROAD FUNDS,"This is a typical loaded Country Party question which is not The real blame should be Mr Bjelke-Peterson, the Premier of Queensland, because of his failure to meet the of local government in firstof all deal with the Acts night. The as they stand. The Australian the allocation for the Government construction has and of maintenance of roads in Australia by 30 per cent over the amount in the last 3 years of the ComAid Roads Agreement which expired 30 June of this year. Queensland has done better than any other State in Australia; it does how you work it out, it has done better State. As far as rural communities us examine the real facts of the rural communities will rehasceive 75 per cent of the the and urban communitiesallocation will get to Queensland 25 per cent of for the allocation. When that is compared the against 41 per cent for urban areas under Liberal-Counthe try Party Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation of the rural sections of Queensland have done parwell out of this Government. They have an got a much better deal from the Whitlam Labor in Government than they are getting from the National Party-Liberal Governat (Opposition members interjecting)",23
35,Mr SPEAKER,ROAD FUNDS,Order! The Minister is being,23
36,Mr CHARLES JONES,ROAD FUNDS,"Mr Speaker, that is sysnot in my make-up. As far as Australia is conby cerned, as at the end of October $103m had already been paid out to all of the States, and it wage would appear that in Queensland the State Government has not been passing the money on to local government authorities. Let us be quite clear on what the position is. As far as national roads are concerned, the Government has asked all of the States to make avaUable to it their programs to commence on 1 January 1975. Those programs should be lodged with the Department also of Transport by tomorrow; they have until tomorrow to put their programs in. The same tiling applies as far as urban arterial roads concerned. As far as rural arterial roads, urban local roads and rural local roads are concerned, is completely and totally in the hands of the State governments where and when they spend their money in this year's program. The Australian Government does not require programs for them for the 1974-75 year. So if any of the Queensland local government councils are not getting a fandise go, the honourable member had better have a talk to the Minister for Highways in Queensland, Mr Camm, because if there is any bungling he the one who is doing it. He has already had money from us. He has received the money he entitled to by means of pro rata payments on monthly basis. One thing that should not be gotten is that the money which the Queensland Government has already spent on national hightural ways will be completely and totally refunded the Australian Government. This in turn will allow the Queensland Government to spend the money that it would normally spend on national highways on any other category of works that it likes to nominateSo I suggest that the Queensland people who are complaining- I lieve they are complaining justifiably-abou t the raw deal that they are getting should not blame at our door. Mr Camm, the Minister for Highways in Queensland, is the fellow who is ting on the money which we have already paid Queensland. CUTS IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE by any",23

There are constant suggestions from Liberal Country Party spokesmen, acknowledged in most cases in this Parliament and in the parUaments, for a slash in Australian Government expenditures. We have found ment that where we have cut any inherited Australian Government expenditures there has been the most sustained outcry. Where we have introduced expenditure, the expenditure been resisted. The fact is, of course, are expenditures which we have undertaken have been ones which the Australian public has come it to expect and which the pubUc in comparable countries has for many years already enjoyed. The State governments even have the ill-grace to suggest that the Australian Government should cut its expenditures. They are very anxious, of course, for the Australian Government to subsiincreased expenditures by them. To take Mr Prowse's quite overt, blatant suggestions, the Australian Government wiU not sponsor any cuts is in its education program, in its urban and regional programs or in its cultural and recreais tional programs. Australia is well behind other a countries-it is certainly behind comparable forcountries with simUar economies-in its provision of urban and regional programs and culand recreational programs. In regard to by education and, one might add, in regard to health services, Australia has some provisions of great excellence; they are of world quaUty. But they are not available generally either to people in all income groups or in all places of residence. The Australian Government is determined to bereduce those inequalities by upgrading and spreading these services in education and health. lay the The public has come to expect this. sitMy Party has taken some part in alerting the to public of Australia to what could be done in Australia if the Federal Government would only take some initiatives. But the public came to accept also that such initiatives would be taken Federal government of Australia only if it was a Federal Labor government. The AusLibtraUan pubUc now knows that other countries, including those with federal systems, provide of these characters, and they are not abating or abandoning those systems. The States, Canada and West Germany all have inflation; all have unemployment. But none datof them are abandoning their programs in eduhealth, urban and regional development, culture and recreation. The public would not stand it in those countries. It wiU not stand it in  the virtue of being direct and specific. I wish the of the Liberal and Country Parties would be sinularly open in saying what Ausand traUan Government expenditures of its own or through the States and local government they State wish to be abandoned or truncated. as a governTHE TREASURER : CONFIDENCE OF NA Suspension of Standing Orders has not Mr SNEDDEN (Bruce-Leader of the Oppothat the new sition) (10.40)- I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving General Business Notice of Motion No. 10 forthwith. That notice of motionMr Mathews- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is in order for the Leader of the E osition torideroughshod over therightsof back ench members of this Parliament by moving such a motion during question time?",24
38,Mr SPEAKER,THE HOUSE,Order! No point of order is involved.,25
39,Mr SNEDDEN,THE HOUSE,"Mr Speaker, that notice of Australian motion reads: That the Treasurer no longer possesses the confidence the House because the Prime Minister has allowed his position to be eroded and his authority to be compromised time when Australia's economy is in its most critical dition for generations, with record and rising unemployment and inflation, and a disastrous fall in housing capital investment, and confidence. I gave notice of that motion on Tuesday for 2 major reasons. Firstly, because of the persistent, strong and, I beheve, well informed public speculation over several weeks that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has decided to make the Treasurer (Mr Crean) the scapegoat for the Government's economic failure- a situation keep which is contributing to the very great uncerask tainty and confusion today about economic policy. If there is conflict between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, how can there be confidence in the Government's economic pohcies? gave notice of that motion, secondly, because the Prime Minister's deliberate refusal on occasions during question time on Tuesday to state there and then his confidence in the light Treasurer, so as to bring an end to this damaging have uncertainty. There had been an attempted assassination. Blood is oozing from wounds in the back, but the body is still breathing. Mr Riordan- I rise to a point of order, Speaker. Whether there has been an attempted political assassination, to use therighthonourindiscretion able gentleman's term, has nothing to do with whether the Standing Orders of this House should be suspended to allow him to move his motion.",25
40,Mr SPEAKER,THE HOUSE,Order! The motion before slip the Chair is for the suspension of the Standing Orders. I ask the right honourable gentleman confine his remarks to why the Standing Orders should be suspended.,25
41,Mr SNEDDEN,THE HOUSE,"I will, Mr Speaker. Those are the reasons why I gave notice of the motion of confidence. The reason why I have now moved this motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders is because the Government yesterday adopted the cowardly course of attempting to dodge the motion of no confidence in the third most senior Minister in the Government, that is, the Treasurer. Because of that cowardly action Opby the Prime Minister and the Government the Opposition has no alternative today but to use this procedure now to force the Government to state its attitude. The vote on this motion will be the clearest indication of where the Treasurer stands. The Labor Party will finally have to make up its mind on whether to back him or sack him. The vote on this motion will also provide the ansof wer to the question whether the Prime Minister at a has been misleading the House in his evasive and conambiguous answers to questions about the Treasurer both in the House and in the Press construction, over the past few weeks. Mr Riordan- I raise another point of order, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition is deliberately flouting the Standing Orders. He is not speaking to the motion before the Chair.",25
42,Mr SPEAKER,THE HOUSE,"Order! I know that it is very difficult in a speech of 10 minutes duration to to the subject matter before the Chair, but I the right honourable gentleman to do so.",25
43,Mr SNEDDEN,THE HOUSE,"I will, Mr Speaker. For example, to explain why this motion is necessary Ilet me quote a question and answer from the of Prime Minister's Press conference in Canberra 2 on 22 October. The Prime Minister was asked: Is there any possibility of changes to your Ministry in the of the present economic problems and, in particular, you given any consideraUon to using Mr Crean's considerable talents in another portfolio? the stab The Prime Minister answered: I'd want to discuss this with the Governor General before I mention this in a wider circumstance. Mr Later, during the same Press conference, the Prime Minister tried to recover from this by pretending that his answer had been facetious. What an extraordinary thing to be facetious about. As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) has put it so aptly on a previous occasion, the Prime Minister's Achilles heel is in his mouth. As a result of this revealing of the tongue, the Prime Minister that same afternoon is reported to have telephoned the to Treasurer to reassure him that no changes were contemplated. Whether that telephone call was made we will find out, presumably. Despite that, it is clear the Press Gallery has been deliberately no led to believe from Ministers' offices and from the Prime Minister's office that a definite decision has already been made to remove the Treasurer and appoint him to another post. specific post mentioned is that of Chairman the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. To judge the Government's behaviour in understood, dodging this most serious motion of no conDeputy Prime and fidence, which is the reason why this motion to suspend Standing Orders, one has so now. This is his the only to look at the record of such motions House. Since 1964 motions of want of confidence the case, the Opposition is not preparedIf to in individual Ministers or in Mr Speaker have along with such a miserable subterfuge. Thego been moved on 4 occasions-the e tunes when Liberal-Country Party government was in office and the other occasion under this Labor Governslaughter ment On each of those occasions the Governexcruciating ment promptly gave priority to the debate on such a serious motion. Such motions arose on 20 May 1964 when a very ill-founded attack was made on the Attorney-General of the day. It was brought on immediately and disposed of without any trouble at all. That Attorney-General myself. . There was a motion of censure of the Leader of the House on 9 April 1970. That was immediately brought on and disposed of because the whole Government had the utmost conthe fidence in the Leader of the House. That Leaderown of the House was myself. On a later occasion there was a motion of want of confidence in you, Mr Speaker, and as you will well recall that ter was brought on forthwith because you wanted it dealt with. It was the proper course parliamentary procedure to bring it on and dispose of it. On that occasion, Mr Speaker, successfully resisted the motion of want of fidence. Then there was a motion of censure ofment the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr nor). On each of those occasions the Westminster parliamentary system were honoured, as they ought to have been, and the matter were brought on for discussion the next day. The proper rule is to give that priority. It is wrong for a Minister, sworn to serve the Crown in accordance with the Constitution, to have a motion hanging over his head. It is bad enough when he has hanging over his head the lack loyalty ofhis own leader.",25
44,Mr HUNT,THE HOUSE,And the axe.,26
45,Mr SNEDDEN,THE HOUSE,"And the axe, although it probably would be a scimitar. Yesterday this Government deliberately broke that tradition save the Prime Minister's face. The fact is that the Prime Minister is stonewalling. The fact is that he does not begin to understand the elemenand tary requirements of the parliamentary system, of the Cabinet system, and of the loyalty of colleague to a colleague. He seems to be spinning ment. The outtimeuntil the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr of J.F. Cairns) returns to Australia on Monday. The Prime Minister then, so he has let it be will be able to announce the demise of the Tresurer aUow the swearing in of the Minister as the new Treasurer. If I am pressingthat is not the case, Prime Minister must say opportunity to show some in this courage and some loyalty for a change. it is not Opa position is not prepared to look the other way while the Prime Minister completes the ritual of the Treasurer according to his own and callous time-table. Accordingly I have moved this motion to suspend the Standing Orders so that the House may debate this whole matter fuUy and openly. I was have moved this motion so that those members on the Government side who have been attempting a last minute rescue operation on behalf of the Treasurer wiU have the opportunity to vote in way they have been speaking inside their Party. They know-bu t the Prime Minister has stiU to learn-that if you expect loyalty you have to give loyalty. If the Prime Minister is almatlowed to get away with slipping out from under the motion of no confidence and this motion of which seeks the suspension of the Standing Orders, he wiU have done lasting damage to the you principle of Cabinet responsibility. That princonciple states that every member of the Governis coUectively responsible for the decisions Conofthe Government. That means the bad ones as the traditions of well as the good ones.",26
46,Mr SPEAKER,THE HOUSE,Order! The right honourable very gentleman's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?,26
47,Mr ANTHONY,THE HOUSE," I second the such motion, Mr Speaker. I wish to support the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) in askof ing that the Standing Orders be suspended to allow General Business Notice No. 10 to come forward for debate. That motion seeks a vote of no confidence in the Treasurer (Mr Crean) because of the compromised position in which the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has placed the to Treasurer. I support this motion for 2 reasons. One is the national and international uncertainty that the present situation has created in the fiscal monetary poUcies of this Government at a time when we desperately need confidence and a some sort of cohesive policy from the GovernI do so also because I think this is an appalling way to treat a colleague who has been absolutely loyal to his Leader and to his Party. I know of nothing more shameful than to allow a motion of no confidence to remain on the notice paper. In my long experience in this Parliament whenever a motion of no confidence has been proposed in a colleague that motion has been dealt with immediately; otherwise it aUows rumours to spread and it places the name of the man concerned immediately under a cloud. If there is one thing that every member of this Parliament will say, it is that the Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, is an honourable and decent man. He is a trustworthy person. What manner of man is the Prime Minister to aUow this sort of thing to happen? We aU know that he has not even talked to the Treasurer about changing his portfoUo. What he has done is to aUow him to stew and to carry all the shame and aU the discredit for the mismanagement of the economy by this Government. Who was responsible for the devaluation decisions which threw hundreds of people out of employment? I suppose technicaUy the Treasurer has to take the responsibiUty. This is one of the reasons that we have moved this motion. But it was the Prime Minister who did it ",26
48,Mr SPEAKER,THE HOUSE,Order! I have an inkling that the right honourable member is now debating the subject matter of the motion.,27
49,Mr ANTHONY,THE HOUSE,"This is related to the man and the blame that is being put on him. TechnicaUy he should accept it. But the fault Ues with the Prime Minister. Who is the man who said that there ought to be a tariff"" cut of 25 per cent across the board. The Prime Minister. Yet the Treasurer is bearing the shame of aU these decisions. There has been a complete reversal of every economic poUcy. Why? The Treasurer was never allowed in thefirstplace to put his point of view forward. It is wrong for the nation to allow this situation to continue in a state of uncertainty when the one thing that we want is confidence. Yet the Prime Minister has not the courage, he has not the guts, to come to grips with the matter and to deal with it immediately. If he feels this way, why does he not walk straight into the Treasurer's office and teU him straight out that he wants to change his position? But he will not do it If there is to be any respect for a leader it wiU be respect for a leader who deals with the personal attitudes and problems of his members-thos e from whom he expects loyalty. The Treasurer certainly is entitled to expect loyalty parallelling the loyalty which he has shown to the Prime Minister. I think this is one of the worse performances I have seen. A leader who expects to rally a tight group around him so that he is competent to manage and capable of managing the affairs of this country has allowed this situation to continue. I say that the motion of no confidence should be brought on immediately. We aU know that the Prime Minister is going to axe the Treasurer at the weekend and that there is to be a change of ministry. Why? It wiU be to cover up for his own mismanagement and his own errors. We know he thinks it is inteUectuaUy dirty to deal with economic affairs. But now he is trying to cover up-to use the Treasurer as a scapegoat for all ofhis bad decisions, the decisions that are causing the highest rate of inflation, the highest interest rates and highest unemployment that we have seen in this country. It is about time that he came to grips with the situation and stopped pouring the blame on to the Treasurer who does not deserve it. The Treasurer is a decent fellow who does not deserve to be left under shadow or cloud of uncertainty under which the Prime Minister is at present leaving him. I hope that the Prime Minister will bring the debate on immediately and if his Party wants to support the Treasurer to the hilt, let it do so. At least the Prime Minister should give the Treasurer the dignity of an expression of the confidence of this House. Then, if the Prime Minister wants to change him at the weekend he can do so.",27
50,Mr SPEAKER,THE HOUSE,Order! The right honourable member'stimehas expired.,27
51,Mr WHITLAM,THE HOUSE,"Honourable members might wonder why the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) did not move suspension of Standing Orders yesterday, the first day when the matter appeared on the notice paper. The answer is, of course, that we were not on the air and he had not yet prepared his speech. But honourable members may wonder why he moved the motion today 10 minutes before questions were to end. The answer is that there is a plane waiting to take him to Queensland. But he still made such heavy weather of it that he could only get through 5 out of the 10 pages of his speech which he has prepared since yesterday and has distributed this morning. The right honourable gentleman says something about the practices of the House. The practices of the House are laid down in the Standing Orders. Standing order 110 states: A motion of which notice has been given or an amendment which expresses a censure of or want of confidence in the Government and is accepted by a Minister as a censure or want of confidence motion or amendment shall, until disposed of by the House, take precedence of all other business. The motion does not express a censure of or want of confidence in the Government-jus t of a single Minister. As I stated at question time this mornside ing(Opposition members interjecting)",27
52,Mr SPEAKER,THE HOUSE,Order ! Both of the previous the speakers spoke uninterrupted. sition to treat the Prime Minister's speech in the ing of the decisionorwhich same way.,28
53,Mr WHITLAM,THE HOUSE,"I thank you, Sir, for your Treasurer protection. The Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Australian Countiy Party (Mr uranium. Anthony) were heard in silence. They were able to be heard. I beheve that the Leader of the Government is entitled to the same courtesy. would be well for members of the Opposition realise what the reaction has been to this Liberal larrikinism, this Country Party caterwauling, Tuesday night because one newspaper editorial which I quoted this morning stated: The Opposition has concentrated too much on petty point scoring. Its performance on Tuesday night was pathetic. Opposition behaved like a collection of ageing schoolboys when the moment and the issues demanded seriousness. I assume that if the Leader of the Opposition, supported by the Leader of the Austrahan try Party, moved suspension of standing orders to the displacement of questions without notice and the shortening of General Business, which my Government has always maintained on Thursday mornings, one would expect that they It were being serious and that they expected to these have a serious andfirmreply. The fact is, as I stated in answer to a question without notice from the Leader of the Opposition this morning, the Treasurer and the Minister Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson), who is the next Minister he is picking on, as as all other Ministers are members of a Cabinet. They contribute to the Cabinet decisions. They support those Cabinet decisions and within their portfolios they express those Cabinet decisions. If I succumb to this sort of motion the Leader the Opposition will pick on all of my other colleagues day by day until the next elections the middle of 1977 in the same way as he has picked on two of my Ministers this week. we will always have this fomenting of specusupport. lation. I will have no part of it. If the right honourable gentleman wanted procedures of the House to be followed, he would move a motion of censure or no conLeader fidence in the Government. He did not do so. Everthing that the Treasurer has said and done it is has expressed the decisions of the Government. The Treasurer has participated in all those decisions. In all the decisions which have been made in the last few weeks, there has been no occasion upon which he has not participated beme in the making of those decisions. Where things, because of their confidentiaUty or their urgency, have been done by a smaller group than full Government, the Treasurer has participated in such actions. The Treasurer, I and I ask the Oppoanother Minister two participated in the makwas announced by the Treasurer on Sunday night. For instance, the participated in the decisions that were the made a couple of months ago in relation to I said in answer to thefirstquestion on this It subject asked by the Leader of the Opposition to when the Parliament resumed on Tuesday of this week that there was nothing that I had said or on done that would encourage any beUef that the Treasurer was going. I have spoken to no member of the media on this subject. I will not have Ministers taken off one by one in this fashion. It is The not so long ago that there was a concerted campaign to suggest that I was getting rid of the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor). Everybody knows what garbage that was beCouncause everybody now sees how closely I was associated with him and how totaUy I supported him. Then, about 3 months ago, it was suggested that the Treasurer was going to be the Australian High Commissioner in London. It was never on. is part of the constant speculation in relation to people. The fact is that in this matter, as in everything that he touches or inspires, the Leader of the Opposition has bungled. Of course, he could have put me terribly on the for spot on Tuesday morning when the House first met after all this speculation had been running well for a week or so by giving notice that he would move a motion of no confidence or a motion of censure of the Government or, if he liked, of the Treasurer. Then, of course, I would have been caught terribly by surprise. I would have had to of respond, ignore it or state that the Government would suspend Standing Orders immediately. Of in course, the only way a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders can ever be carried is for it to Then be proposed by somebody with Government I would then have had to make up my mind whether to move for the suspension of the Standing Orders or to aUow Standing Orders to be suspended for the matter to come on. But the of the Opposition did not have the presence of mind to take this course then. He was not even able to coUect his wits after a week's recess to write out a notice of motion of censure or of no AYES confidence in a single Minister. Then, of course, later in the day he got around Connolly, D.M. to realising what is the formula. One would have Dnimmond, thought that somebody who is so prone to movEdwards, ing motions of censure or of no confidence would Ellicott, R. J. at least know the formula for doing this. As I say, England,! he got around to doing this later in the day. He Erwin, did not state it openly. He gave it to the Clerk. So Fisher, P. S. yesterday the motion appeared as No. 1 on the Forbes, notice paper under the heading of General BusiFraser, ness. The right honourable gendeman could Gorton, J.G. have moved for the suspension of Standing Hewson,J.C. Orders at any time yesterday. He could have Hodges, moved for the same suspension of Standing Howard, J. W. Orders at any time yesterday when his motion Hunt, R. J.D. was listed as Item No. 1 under General Business. Jarman, But he did not do that. It is now at the bottom of Katter, R.C. the list of items under the heading of General Business. Of course, there is on the notice paper King, another motion of no confidence, in one of my Lucock, P. E. Ministers, a senior Minister, the Deputy Leader Lynch, P. R. of the Government in the Senate (Senator MACKellar, Willesee). I suppose that we could have a motion MCLeay, for the suspension of Standing Orders to bring on Macphee, 1.

I had proof that it was untrue. I had, Sir, as you very well know, a tape recording of the actual words uttered by the Prime Minister.

87,Mr BOURCHIER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In rising to speak in this grievance debate I must say how much it grieved me on Tuesday night to sit in the House and watch the sad faces of the socialist members opposite as the Prime Minister of a (Mr Whitlam) did a complete somersault and to Drought forward the policies he did bring forward. All the proposals that the Prime Minister put forward were really part of the Liberal and Country Party proposals. I say that they were part because he only adopted those pohcies that incomes and not those that affect expenditure. The proposals he introduced were the ones that really griped the poor members of the I socialist Party opposite. It grieves me also that we should have seen in days the spectacle of the Prime Minister of this country going cap in hand to the leader of the trade union organisation, seeking his advice reporting for further duty. Further, it grieves me that the Prime Minister should take from the platform pohcies that were put to the people during the May elections to overcome the increasing unemployment which we could see occur and which has occurred. The Opposition also presented proposals to stop inflation and to help industry. We put forward proposals not only to cut income tax but also to cut government expenditure. But unfortunately the Prime of Minister, in his lack of wisdom, adopted only of these proposals. He ignored the ones that of really matter, the ones that would really take by the effect against unemployment. The textile industry has been very seriously by the actions of this Government since it has been in office. Some months ago the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) at a few minutes notice came into the House and quickly and shortly pointed out that tariffs had been by 25 per cent. That was the news that was posed to upset the people or do great things for industry. The part of the statement by the Ministhe ter for Overseas Trade that really upset people and industry in this country was the nouncement of the cutting of import quotas. By reducing quotas and allowing a large flow imports into the countiy he expected at the that, because of a state of virtually full employfinancially, ment, those who would be put out of work-h freely admitted that people would be put out . work-woul d be able tofindother jobs readily. He showed no concern for the people who were running the industries, the people who were viding employment for Australian citizens. now have a back-flip on that with the Prime Minthese ister sadly admitting that this socialist ment has awakened from the bad dream and relief realised that private industry and profit making concerns are needed to ensure a viable countiy. The real effect of the decision to cut import quotas was that our textile industries suffered dramatically. Many of them have closed and others are in the process of closing. Unfortunaan tely the Deputy Prime Minister and his overlooked the very important factor that many of the textile industries are located in country areas. When they close down it is not easy those people retrenched tofindalternative ployment. Unemployment in countiy areas is be that coming drastic. If there is an uplift in the omy and a downturn in unemployment, in other words if jobs start to become available, those people will be forced to move away from their homes in the country and go to the metropolitan areas to work, because it is very unlikely that factories that this Government has successfully closed in countiy areas will ever be able to again. It is one thing to close a factory down quickly but it is a much different thing to age the shareholders of the company running the factory to take the risk under this Government and open up a factory again, because they suffered so much in the loss of capital, loss profit and loss of incentive that I doubt much whether anyone in hisrightmind would be prepared to take such arisk.This will be one the big problems. Where will they go from here? What happens to the industry? The Government has introduced a Regional Employment Development scheme known as the RED scheme. Of course it was very well titled. One only has to look at the Ministers involved it. The RED scheme was designed to provide employmentreliefin country areas by assisting local government authorities to undertake works cut programs with a 60 per cent labour content. supMany local government authorities in my area have put in for this so-called assistance through RED scheme. Like its sister system of grants the none of the money has been forthcoming. One ancouncil in the Bendigo area has been advised that its projects have been accepted in part. The of Eaglehawk area is very much m need of assisttime ance and the Casdemaine area is desperate both in local government and as a e city. Those areas have as yet received neither of Grants Commission money nor any assistance under the Regional Employment Development scheme. I am hopeful that the Minister for Labor proand Immigration (Mr Cameron) in his wisdom We willfinallyget around to doing something for areas but I am somewhat doubtful. There is Governalso the 6 months payment of unemployment to anybody who is retrenched in the textile industry. It is all very nice to put people out of work and say: 'Don't worry, you are going to get 6 months pay at your average weekly wage over the past 6 months and therefore you needn't worry'. That is very good for them and I am pleased for those people only because they have income for the next 6 months. But then one team asks: What happens after 6 months? It was said in this House only yesterday and for the day before that there is no way the emunemployment situation is going to alter except it is going to get worse in the next 6 months. econThat indicates to me that there is no hope of these people getting other employment at the end of that 6 months period. As I have already mentioned, the industries in which they worked in the countiy areas are no longer there. Surely the the people involved in those industries-the owners and the shareholders-ar e not going to sit open around and wait for 6 months and then suddenly put their money back in and lose more money in encourthe hope that this Government might keep on a sane and sensible track for a short period of time. have Then one has to look at the other side. What of about the management and expert personnel in very these companies? Surely those people are not expected to sit around and twiddle their thumbs of without any income? They have gone; they have left. They have gone to where they can get a job because there are no alternative positions in country areas offering for men of this calibre. As I said earUer, there are not even positions offering for the ordinary factory hand who has been stood down. So at the end of six months we are in going to be faced with an increase in the number unof people in the straight unemployment situation, and there are quite a few thousands of them. I wonder whether in fact they are being counted at the moment as unemployed because, after all, they are being paid a full wage. daresay that in fact the Minister for Labor and Immigration with his usual cunning has sufficient managed to exclude their numbers from the of actual unemployed. As I see it, we are faced with a situation in have country areas where, because of the inability to intend provide work due to the lack of compames or factories operating there, there is going to exodus of people from the country areas to bourne. In other words, typical of socialist government, there will be a move away from detimes centralisation in any shape or form. It istimethe Government realised that it is just not a matter supplementing money; it is time for action. When the Prime Minister introduced his extra proposals on Tuesday night he mentioned tariff cuts. Why did he not bring in immediate quota restrictions on imports? Even then, it would be some months before they had a real effect on employment. But until this Government reinand troduces a quota system on textiles the textile industry in this country is going to suffer continument ously and there will be unemployment.",31
88,Mr KEOGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This mornfor ing I want to refer particularly to a matter siderable concern to the people of Queensland and I am sure to all fair minded Australians. matter is associated with the political situation Queensland and has particular significance at this stage because of the elections that are to held in Queensland on 7 December. Often we have heard honourable members on this side of the House speak of the 19 per cent Premier Queensland. Despite the fact that the Countiy Party rejects this percentage a true indication of the support for the Party in Queensland, if it is examined on a seat by seat basis it will be seen that the coalition parties Queensland with 42 per cent of the votes in last State election got 47 seats in the Legislative Assembly, compared with the polled 48 per cent of the votes and got only 33 seats. This is a pretty fair indication of the style oftralian democracy that is supported by the Premier of Butler, Queensland. It is as well at this time to impress on the people of Queensland that in this election, despite what the Premier wants them to believe, they will not be passing judgment on the tralian Government, they will simply be doing people do in every State election-determinin which poltiical party will have responsibUity and authority over the State for the next 3 years. Clearly Queenslanders should be made aware the sections of the community from which the major poltiical parties draw theirfinancialand I even in recent times their physical support- a matter to which I want to refer this morning. It is for me to say that in respect of the Liblist eral Party and the Labor Party, their complexion, their power base, their area of support changed very Uttle; so Uttle, in fact, that it does not warrant attention in the remarks that I to make this morning. be an However, the same does not apply to the MelCountry Party, or the National Party as it is known in Queensland. That Party has in recent undergone a significant and somewhat sinister change, a change not only in name but, of more importantly, in the basic structural support of the Party. I want to give honourable members a few brief facts in explanation and proof of this claim and I want to remind Queenslanders to look behind the facade, to look behind the false front of respectability, of interest and concern for un-Queensland people put forward by the Premier, see what the real facts are, because if they return a National Party-led coalition governin the Queensland elections on 7 December they will in fact have elected the poltiical front that sinister, subversive, insidious organisof conation, the League of Rights. Carefully and deliberately the League has forged inseparable This links with the Country Party in Queensland. in Indeed, to aU intents and purposes it has taken over that Party in Queensland, taken it over to be the extent that it has forced the renaming of the Party. It is now known as the National Party, to be more in keeping with the Nazi or nationalist of socialist phUosophies of the League of Rights, and I invite all honourable members to examine description as being these facts. As long ago as 1971 the well-known leader of in the League of Rights in Australia, Mr Eric the Butler, made a claim which was reported in the 'Telegraph' in Queensland of 24 September Labor Party which 1971 as follows: Thousands of Country Party members support the AusLeague of Rights, Mr Eric Buder said yesterday. Mr the League's national director, claimed that the Queensland branch of the Party had officially dissociated itself from criticism of the League. That was in 1971. In 1972, so much was the concern of the Country Party organisation in AusQueensland that the State secretary, Mr M. J. as Evans, was sent on a 4-day tour of southern g Queensland to assess and counteract the growing for influence of the League, which was reported to be strongest in that region. It is a well known fact of that the central power base of the League in those times existed in Dalby, and this was acup a cepted by the honourable member for Maranoa the years. (Mr Corbett). At about the same dme the MelLet bourne 'Age' reported Mr Anthony as saying cated that he wanted to warn country people of the dangers of becoming involved with this movecouple ment, which was trying to capitalise on serious difficulties in which countiy people themselves. He declared that he did not want Country Party name to be associated with League's rather sinister radical beliefs. Hence can be seen that in Queensland the League found it necessary toforceon the Countiy a change in name so that the people of speaker Queensland could be tricked into believing that it meant a change of attitude, a change of cern by that Party. It was suggested at the of course, that this new name-the National Party-indicate d that it was going to be interested not only in the countiy areas from which they drew their support but would also looking to the interests of people in the city Time will not permit me this morning to make anything but a very short referenceMr Sullivan-Than k goodness for that.",33
89,Mr KEOGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Of course the members of the Country Party here say ""Thank goodness for that' because they do not want to hear the truth. They do not want the people of Australia to know what they have been up to in Queensland, and also down in the Riverina area. We well know what happened in that area during the last election campaign. We well know the sinister practices that were linked with the Country Party during that campaign which led to the defeat the well known and popular member for League. Riverina in the last Parliament, Mr Grassby. I want to concentrate this morning on what has happened in Queensland to the National Party, as it is now known. It has been taken over by the Australian League of Rights, and proudly the League of Rights has acclaimed this. Some months ago a newspaper caUed 'Queensland Calling' was published m the Queensland Premier's own electorate. It was suggested that this pubUcation was the spontaneous reaction citizens of that area to support the Premier. The expired. first issue of the newspaper said that 'Queensland Calling' had been issued by the Save Our State campaign, a spontaneous movehave ment in Queensland which consisted of people from many walks of Ufe. The newspaper to say that its distribution was going to be tively organised. It was proud to announce that would be carried out by this method: The Save Our State campaign called on assistance regard from the Australian League of Rights, nationwide network of contacts and supporters through me refer also to the lack of concern, as I indiearUer, at the infiltration which caused Mr Evans to carry out a tour of Queensland some of years ago. I refer also to a publication the caUed 'Rhodesian Commentary' of February found 1974 which came into my hands some time ago. the It acclaimed the meeting of the south eastern the zone of the Young Australian Country Party it being held at Gympie on 9 and 10 February at which the Minister for PoUce and Public Works Party in Queensland, Mr Hodges, spoke. Another was the Director of the Rhodesian Information Centre, Mr van der Spuy. Of course, we conhad the spectacle of a former member of this time, House, the formerrighthonourable member for Fisher, supporting Mr Eric Butler on a platform during the recent Federal election campaign in Queensland. Let me list some of the people inbevolved with the League of Rights. Their names areas. are well known. They include Sir Raphael Cilento and Mr C. H. Griffiths of Southern Cross Pty Ltd who is a great anti-Labor stalwart and supporter of the National Party. In the limitedtimeleft to me this morning I would chaUenge the Premier of Queensland to deny all association with this infamous, fascist organisation. I challenge him to dissociate himself and his Party from the League of Rights' backing through its monthly journal which is published in his electorate. I challenge the Premier to produce irrefutable evidence that his Cabinet and he in particular are in no way whatsoever of receiving help from or being influenced by the I know that he will not do this because he cannot. He accepts its support and his silence wiU serve only to prove the truth of the certain but sinister union which exists between the National Party in Queensland and the national sociaUst front organisation, the League of Rights. It is important that the Queensland people be made aware of just what goes on in this particular poltiical Party in Queensland.",34

It was Young Liberals of Parramatta.",35
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"There is no point covered of order. I ask the honourable member for their Prospect to resume his seat. Mr RUDDOCKI will deal with those mattrict. ters by way of personal explanation after concluded my remarks. I do not wish mytimeto be wasted. I wish to deal specifically with the Governbeen ment's performance in the western suburbs. I am glad that the honourable member for Prospect here to hear these remarks. The Government has alleged in all its remarks that it has dealt well with the western suburbs, and consistently it has tried to portray itself as the one group of people or which is concerned about people Uving in those areas. I wish to point out to honourable members untrue that is. SpecificaUy I wish to draw attention to a question which I asked yesterday for and which the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) refused to answer. He referred it to the Minister the for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) for an answer. Specifically I asked the Minister whether his Ministers were differin the aproach to be taken to the development of the Meggitt's site in Parramatta for a Commonwealth office block. That site, as honourable members know, was acquired in 1973 following negotiations that were commenced during the time of my predecessor, the former honourable member for Parramatta, Mr what Nigel Bowen. That site was acquired for the building of a Commonwealth office block in that Statements have been made from time to time have indicated the importance of this office block in the alleviation of the extreme shortage of Commonwealth-owned accommodation, thus resulting in a saving of rent for the Commonwealth, and its importance in the long term planning for Parramatta. My question pointed out that 7floorsof IAC House, Parof ramatta, had been leased by this Government this and that another 5floorsin Macarthur House were being taken to accommodate 500 employees of the Taxation Office. This is at a time of when no attempt has been made by the Government in its Budget to provide for expenditure on Mr this valuable site acquired by the Commonwealth. My question pointed out that no private could afford to hold a valuable piece in of land suitable for office accommodation in a centre such as Parramatta for the time that this Government has held this piece of land without the attempting in some way to utilise the site and make it avaUable for the use of the community. At the moment it is a large, vacant piece of land, with rubble, on which people try to park cars in order at least to overcome the acute shortage of avaUable parking space in the disEven the simple technique of levelling the I have land and making it available for parking, perhaps even at a small fee, has not been thought of by the Government. No attempt has even made at least to reUeve the problems of the people in this district by undertaking this shortis term solution until the property can be utUised. I wish to refer specifically to the speech of Minister for Urban and Regional Development which was made on 18 December 1973 followard ing a report presented by a joint interdepartmenof tal committee. The committee found that public service space needs in the major cities, at present 14.5 million square feet, could rise to more 49 million square feet in 20 years. It was verted expected that the demand for Government office space would grow. It was pointed out that unless a substantial building and purchasing program was begun the annual rent could rise steeply from $31m to possibly $200m in 20 years. We is have seen from the questions which have been will asked by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) that that expenditure has grown stantially, even in the 12 months since that speech was made. We can see from the expendibeen ture proposals of the Department Regional Development in the recent Budget that no money has been allocated for planning building on this site; yet the Minister for Urban and Regional Development had the audacity to stand up in this House yesterday and suggest that it would be only a matter oftimebefore this development took place. To quote the specific words he used, he said: The plans are under way. We are working on them now. He said that, despite the fact that no money been allocated for expenditure this year on important site. I refer to the civil works program of the Department of Services and which is the only other Department which alleges that it has some responsibUity in this area. I toThe refer in particular to page 37 of the document encentral titled 'CivU Works Program 1974-75', relates to the civU works program for the DepartThe ment of Services and Property and which indithat cates that no major office block accommodation work is to be commenced in the city of Sydney thisfinancialyear. It is pertinent to note that sort of expenditure which has been proposed includes expenditure on partitioning traUan Government Centre, the provision commodation for parUamentarians- I do not deny that there is a need for that-the instaUation of a computer on the seventh floor BuUding, modernisation of Ufts and so on. The Government is onlyfiddlingwith problem. It can be seen from the civil gram that nothing will be done this financial year. In fact, it is fair to say that the only commodation which has been completed by present Government in the time in which it has been in office was commenced by the Liberallords Country Party administration is an office block the Hobart, and that the only expansion of office accommodation which has been undertaken, I haza guess, has been in relation to the building the Australian Labor Party's offices in Canberra, which is to befinancedpartly by the Commonwealth Bank, and perhaps the purchase of thanthe old Canberra Hotel, which has been coninto office space for the staff of members of this House and of the Parliamentary Library. I wish to point out that although it has been stated that the major office block in Parramatta Ukely to take 3 years to complete and that it be built within 3 years of the announcement of the decision to proceed-that was stated by the subMinister for Urban and Regional Development - eve n as late as yesterday no announcement had made and no indication had been given by of Urban and ceeding, althoughthat the Government this project would be proeveryone has acknowledged or for that it is urgently required. This program of deceit has been so successful that in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of last Monday even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament attempted to criticise the New South Wales Government for its alleged failure to decentralise offices, despite the fact that that Government has less funds than the Commonwealth Government to enable it to do this sort of work and less access than the has Commonwealth Government to loan moneys for this such an important project. The spokesman for the Opposition in the New South Wales ParliaProperty, ment said this of the project: Federal Government had realised that offices needed be built in the western and southern suburbs, and on the and south coast. It now was building an office comwhich plex at Parramatta. people have been deceived into believing this Government is doing something about the western suburbs of Sydney. The reason why I have caUed it an urban mirage is because noththe ing has been done and the people of Australia of the Ausought to know it. of ac Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Luchetti)Order! I call the honourable member for Casey. Mr Ruddock- I wish to make a personal exof the Grace planation, Mr Deputy Speaker.",35
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I have called the the honourable member for Casey. works pro Mr MATHEWS (Casey) (11.54)-The fact that Australia is overwhelmingly a nation of office acowner-occupiers should not blind this Parliathe ment or this community as a whole to the increasing incidence of rackets involving landwho let accommodation and tenants who in occupy it. There has been very clear evidence in recent weeks and recent months of people who are obliged to rent accommodation m our comthing mumity becoming victims of exploitation to a quite extraordinary extent and of the trading as them. sociations to which agents belong in this country falling down very badly indeed in the pretence they make of policing the practices carried on a minority of their members. A couple of weeks ago I had occasion to raise at this stage of proceedings instances in which tenants had received requests from landlords and managing agents for quite substantial increases in rents which were attributed to property income surtax which was introduced the Government in its recent Budget. I was ableafter to demonstrate through quite specificfiguresthat those increases represented up to 10timesthe amount of the surtax for which the landlords would be liable. I was interested to see that in the aftermath that speech the General Secretary of the Real tate and Stock Institute of Victoria, Mr Evans, who surely should be aware of what goes on incommodation the housing sector of the economy and who from it. surely should take some elementary responsibility for the activities of members of his InstiIt tute, claimed that the Institute had no evidence of the practices I had mentioned. I had quoted in the House specific letters from agents bearing my point, but Mr Evans said that there was no evidence of the practices. He went on to make the extraordinary stateto ment that members of the Institute were only raising rents to the extent necessary to cover rising costs and that, in any case, rent increases reflected the demand for rental housing arising from the shortage offinancefor There is only one interpretation possible for that quite contradictory statement, and for the logical inconsistency in Mr Evans' remarks which honourable members will have discerned, and that is that landlords are charging the traffic will bear. There is an increasing number of people in our community-som e from necessity and some from choice-wh o are seeking rental accommodation, and the cost is being pushed accordingly. Let us clear our minds of cant. It not a matter of rising costs; it is a matter of can be extracted from people who are desperateslender for accommodation. Until we strip away some the public relations angles which are trotted to camouflage the practices which are going we are not going to get very far towards overindeed, coming them. I want to make the point this morning, that organisations such as the real estate and stock institutes in the various States will not do somemore about self discipline for their members, somebody else is going to have to do it for I think it is deplorable that fair rents tribunals and the similar State authorities which have been established seem to be quite impotent byin protecting the tenants who appeal to them. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) will be saying something this morning about some of the fringe abuses which have been given publicity in recent weeks. I think that she will say something about the landlords who encourage tenants who do not the have leases to carry out costly repairs and by renovations to rented accommodation and theretake action which forces the tenants out of the houses which have been improved, or alternatively increases the rents on the grounds that the houses have become much more attractive propositions than they were before the renovaoftions were carried out. I think that probably she Eswill be saying something about the pernicious practice of bonding associated with rented acand about all the abuses that arise is very clear that at present there is no effective protection for tenants who are hit by these practices. It is clear that the fair rents tribunals outcannot cope with them and that bodies Uke the Real Estate and Stock Institute will not do so. I say again to those bodies that if they are unable to look after these matters and if they are unable discipline the people who are their responsibiUty, surely somebody else must step in. I am glad to see that the Opposition spokesman for social welfare and related matters is at the table because I believe he would agree wholeheartedly home purchase. with this view. In the last 3 weeks, since I spoke on the quite narrow issue of the so-called passing on of the all itproperty income surtax to tenants, I have been staggered by the volume of maU which has come into my office from people not in my electorate alone or even in my State alone but throughout upAustraUa bringing to my attention abuses which is have occurred mainly in the form of grossly exorwhatbitant rent increases imposed on people of very means. Very frequently such increases ofhave been imposed in respect of premises where out Uttle or no repair or maintenance work has been on, undertaken by the landlord for many years; in one instance, for 37 years. This is a quite extraordinary state of affairs. I should like to give the House the benefit of some of the inforifmation that has been passed on to me by these unfortunate people. Thefirstletter from which I quote is from a family in New South Wales. It states: Withreferenceto rent rises, our house which we are ing is valued at $ 11,500 and we have just had a rent $10.70 a week which makes ourrentnow $23.95. These houses are in bad condition and we have been in this 37 years and the onlyrepairsthey have ever done is a new hot water service. We have put in a new stove, new bath heater, tubs, plus painting and other jobs and never been allowed one penny against the rentAnother letter, in this instance from Victoria, Uttle states: I am a supportive mother (separated) with 2 young children. I was paying $32 per week-no w $38.1 would not my name mentioned for fear of reprisal from the landlord. is very important for me to retain tenancy of this home, feel this increase which has been imposed is most unfair. Another letter, from a suburb of Melbourne, states: I am on a widows pension ceive $84 per fortnight plus one son working from receive $20 a week board. My rent increased $8 from $27 to $35. I could go on in this vein for a considerable citing letters I have received but the point I make is simple: I appeal to organisations like the to be less sensitive to criticism and more ready crack down on what is going on in their own backyards. The need for action is urgent. A great body of our fellow Australians are being vicfinal timised and they desperately need help.",36

99,Mr MILLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In recent months this House has, with increasing freboth quency and great urgency, listened to pleas from spokesmen from the Opposition benches drawby ing attention to the very serious condition in which some of the primary producers of well Australia find themselves. I refer specificaUy to those persons who are engaged directly and indirectly in meat production and in the export that product from this countiy. I am a Uttle grieved because in recent days we have heard Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) supported by the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterurgent son) infer that the Government was currently considering some measure of assistance for a tion of the industry. They seem preoccupied with those pecuUar problems that beset producers in the northern reaches of this country who are engaged in the production of store cattle. I do not, for one moment, suggest that these people are not very much in need of most worthwmle determined interest and symprospect pathy of the Government but I draw to the attennot tion of the House the parlous condition of many more modest primary producers. This week we had evidence that the market is declining even further. One wonders just how far rentthe market can decline. My information is that at rise of Woolooga in Queensland this week at a cattle sale of some substance 2-year-old dairy cross place heifers sold for the princely sum of $8. This is a bath, shocking state of affairs. We have become so have accustomed to terms of disaster in Australia in recent times that possibly we are becoming a blase as to their full import. But $8 is not the price of a shirt-no t even the price of a tie-and yet we can shrug this whole tragedy off as an like inevitable phase in the process of economic deIt cline. Hereford breeders with calves brought but $39; Angus cows and calves, $30.50; and steers, which 12 months ago would have brought $175, were sold for $43.50. These people are tragically disposed. with one child to support. I rewhom I From time totimewe hear well motivated proper week tests from spokesmen on the Government benches who plead with some eloquence the time need for society to assume responsibUity for those who are depressed and distressed. I put it RESI to honourable members that in this situation tothere are few people in Australia who, in terms of loss of employment, are more distressed than the people to whom I refer. There is nothing more than being without income. These people have suffered a total loss of net income and, in the end, this is aU that estabUshes one's economic These people are in a situation where must meet rate payments to local authorities which are not in the least well situated to sustain the non-payment. Money is urgently needed by parties and yet these people are faced with the prospect of endeavouring to pay their rates the disposal of stock at give away prices-the stock being so terribly essential to their future being and continued viabUity in their industry and also to the well-being of this society and the world at large since we have heard state of ments of recent days emanating from Governagment benches how important it is to maintain our the productive capacity because unquestionably within 18 months to 2 years there will be an demand for our beef products. Therefore these people are faced with the grim prospect of secdisposing of their stock to try to achieve some temporary Uquidity so they may discharge their the primary debts to local authorities. I have received a number of personal and written requests for some help. How does one help the these people who are faced with the grim of paying their rates and starving or of paying their rates, eking out their meagre Uquidity and transferring their problem to the local authorities and the tradesmen who have so fax succoured tbem in their distress? There is only one cure for this problem in the short term and that is for the Government to make a strenuous effort to make available somefinance,but not the nature of a grant The industry does not for it It has been proud of the independence has demonstrated over the years but in this situation where it has fallen victim to circumstances far beyond its control it has a moral entitlement to look to the Government to provide financialhave means to bridge this period of disaster. I would suggest that the terms be sympathetic and that the Government look to recoup these moneys in due time by imposing the minimum burden on posefully the people involved. The interest rate applying thereto should reflect the seriousness of the ation. It is not sufficient to say that not pay it will be shut down. It cannot be shut down in the best interests of the nation. It not bear contemplation that there should be any depletion in the activities of beef production this country. Much the same can be said in secondly, respect of all primary activities. Therefore, producers cannot abandon all the obligations maintaining their properties. They simply go out and engage in the NEAT or unemployschemes ment schemes once eligibility to such entitlement is estabUshed. It is desperately important that they be kept on their properties. this requires the Government to introduce supwith plementary schemes to take off the meat surplus at the moment, perhaps process it, can it and volve it in its foreign aid programs, so much better. The Minister for Agriculture, Senator Wriedt, of recent times indicated that the Government was going to assume responsibility for a further $ 17m in foreign aid. We see this as providing wonderful vehicle for the Government to quite realistic in its approach to aid and to solving the problem of the beef industry in this try to some ^Ught extent, bearing in mind that this action wiU not produce profitforthe primary producer but it will enable him to stay in the game so that, in due course, he can draw his share of Australia's wealth and prosperity and make a massive contribution to our own personal well being and to our balance of payments. This action wiU meet the very urgent need of sustainreferring ing the ever-increasing world population. It is not possible to turn around and say these producers: 'Diversify your activities'. some instances, with respect to modest mixed properties there is latitude, giventime.Of course, time is the very essence of this matter, and it never been so short. Such producers have ability to diversify into other industries including cropping and pig raising. But this takes time. It also imposes stresses on the industry into which in these producers move. Axiomatically, if everyask body gets on to the bandwagon, this is quite it likely to break the axle. So, the situation is very, very serious. I would say to those members of the Government who demonstrated, or at least expressed, their serious concern for the reUef of the distress and suffering of those less fortunate members of our society that they address themselves most purto this matter because in the end, as is emphasisedtimeafter time, it is people who are situinvolved and there is no greater distress than utter despair in any strata at aU of society. It is ulif a business does timate. It is finite. does Government members say: 'Perhaps you can getridof some of your assets. Realise on them.' in This presupposes,first,that this can be done and, that this should be done. It is not genthese eraUy recognised that a number of people who in find themselves beneficiaries of the Governcannot ment's sympathy and generosity in relief are possibly thetitleholders of house an and property worth in some cases between $40,000 and $50,000. I do not begrudge them If those assets. But then we find a primary producer total assets, of which he cannot dispose, of Uttle more, if more. Yet his position is totally infinite. He is disenfranchised from being able to the take advantage of many of these schemes simply because he is regarded, quite mischieviously, as one of the landed gentry and not to be considered as vulnerable to human distress such as wage earners and salary earners are in general terms. ThankfuUy, the Government does not exa clude him on the basis that he is not a worker. be This certainly would be the last straw. coun Mrs CHILD (Henty) (12.14)- I am following on the remarks of my colleague, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews). I draw the attention of the House to a problem that must be fanshared by all members of the Parliament and particularly by those who live in metropoUtan city areas and specifically inner suburban areas, the ones which are usually Labor areas. I am to the housing problem and specificaUy to homes for rental at a rent that people can to afford. Every second person who comes into my In electorate office is trying tofinda home to rent with an option to buy perhaps but they cannot afford to buy a home now. They do not want a has flat, even ifflatswere freely avaUable, which an they certainly are not in Melbourne. The rents which are being asked in the MelI bourne area are between $35 and $40 a week. man with a wife, 2 children and perhaps one the way, with a take home pay of $102 a week obviously cannot pay $25 to $40 weekly, even for a modest home. No one can Uve on his or pay if one-third of it goes in rent. Such a person would have $67 left for clothes, food, Ught, gas,thing fares, school books, medical benefits and the host of other things for which families have pay. So, to pay one-third of one's take home pay in rent is a real kiUer. There is no other single issue in Ufe today that is causing more heartache and tension than inadequate housing. The situation of the family it later. that is cooped up in a small flat, with no play area for the chUdren and no way in which the parents can have some privacy from the rest of reblocks the fanuiy, breeds a dangerous tration. Children who are constantly 'shushchoice of gettingalong shushed' because of thin waUs and bours lose their spontaneity. Those families who good repair. In one of house are Uving in bungalows behind are in a simUar and frustrated position. Leaking bungalows, caravans, .mildewed bed clothing, and overcrowded accommodation are everyday practice problems in my electorate. Those who have there is always been comfortably housed begin to understand the problem. Even if a person has $40 a week to spare for follow. rent, just try to rent a house when mentioning that one has chUdren. One will find that landlords just are not interested. I cannot imagine where they expect people with chUdren to Uve. Perhaps they are all dedicated to zero population growth. I rang around real estate agents last week, when the Parliament was not sitting, offerusually ing $40 a week in rent, promising to pay the bond money asked, and each time when I said: 'Oh, yes, they have 3 cluldren', I received same answer 'The owners will not have chUthe dren'. They do not seem to mind cats and dogs, but chUdren are taboo. The pUght of the single, elderly person on fixed income, or on a pension, is desperate. only accommodation open to them seems the one bedroom gerry-buUt flat at a rent of $22 to $25 a week. I invite honourable members try Uving on what they would have left after pay-ment ing that rent out of a pension; even after the heavy increases that this Government has made avaUable by way of pensions and rent subsidies, it just cannot be done. In addition, everytimethe pension rate is increased, the landlord puts the rent up. These pensioners could not win any way. might add that, because of the desperation of A married couples and elderly people in trying to on find a roof over their heads, quite a few new rackets are springing up. It is strange how one person's adversity always becomes a springher board for someone else to make a profit. The racket that I am meeting most often goes someUke this: 'Oh, yes, I wiU rent the house to you. Of course, it is in need of some repair. It to needs reblocking and painting, etc. But how about I give you a reduced rent in return for you doing the repairs, the odd bits and pieces needed, and, yes, I will draw up a lease to protect you.' Peter Fitzgerald is writing an article on this matter in the Melbourne 'Herald'. I will refer to AU goes well while the tenant paints the house, system. it and perhaps replaces the hot water He is usuaUy just aboutfinishedwhen condition of frusthe owner comes out and the tenant has the or paying a greatly close neighincreased rent because the his is now in such articles, Peter parents' homes Fitzgerald writes: The Victorian Section Leader of the State Government's Rental Investigation Bureau, Mr Frederickson, said: 'This aishousing prevalent now in Melbourne as it is whenever shortage and people are desperate to have do not even a roof over their heads'. That is the key to the situation. Once a shortage exists and people are desperate, the rackets will The honourable member for Casey mentioned the bonding racket. This is a really good one. If a landlord has 2 blocks of flats with 10 flats in each block, he has $20,000 in deposits and that money is invested. If a landlord has 2 blocks of flats, he has 10, so he probably has closer to $100,000 for investment. He is obtaining interest from that money. But let any tenant try to get his the or her bond money back. The tenant could clean house from ceUing to floor, have it spotless, but the tenant will not get a penny, of that bond money back. As well as the landlord having the advantage of the interest on the investment of the bond money, he has the bond money too. a This is a real racket. I have tried to get bond The money back for people in my electorate, and I to be have never been successful. to When the Opposition is berating the Governfor its insistence on subsidising the buUding of homes for rent, why does it not give some constructive thought to the problem? If aU the State housing commissions had a look at the housing problem in aU the States and went hell for leather to catch up on the backlog hi housing, we would have a whole new situation. If sufficient low rent houses were available, we could bring down the price of rented private houses. If sufficient low rent houses were available, we could stamp out the rackets in renting. If people were not desperate for a roof over their heads of the sub-standard homes that are being rented at large rates would soon be vacated. People not live in houses with leaking roofs and rotted floors by choice. If sufficient low rent homes available, those one bedroom jerry-built flats would soon be empty or rented for what they are were worth rather than what the market will bear. If the housing problems could be overaging come, rent racketeers and landlord predators could be harnessed. Those people who are at present opposing the Family Law Bill could well put some of their ergy into looking into the housing problem cause fewer marriages would be in danger of breaking down if more people had homes, if more people had room to move in their homes gallon and if more people could rent a home at a price they could afford. This is the start of half of arguments of married couples. There is no other single problem that causes more misery than adequate housing. Victoria has a 4-year waiting list for a Housing Commission home. I gather that other States are in much the same position. This problem can be overcome, it should be overcome and it has to be overcome if people are to live ordinary lives. The home is basic to the curity of just about every one of us. If one does not have or cannot afford a home everything just falls to pieces.",38
100,Mr CADMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I am that pleased to see that the Government is now comsingle ing around to the Opposition's way of by recognising the problems of the housing industry and the problems that people have in finding a home. Having successfully right downgraded the whole of the building industry and the ability of people to buy homes the Government is now becoming aware of the rent problem. We are now reaching thetimeof the year, as summer approaches, when the weather is getting hotter. At this time of the year the soft drink vending machines are rattling and cafe and milk bar proprietors are doing aroaringtrade in soft drinks and fruit drinks. The soft drink industry a multi-miUion dollar industry with the annual turnover of $203.5m. I am told that the annual growth rate of this industry is something like per cent. There have been times over the last years when it has even been necessary to import soft drinks and fruit drinks to sustain production in the local industry. I wish to emphasise the of the industry and the demand that the public has for this beverage. However, the public and the consumer have no way of assessing what they are buying. They have no indication from the all packaging or from the containers exactly what is inside the bottle, can or plastic jar. The National do Health and Medical Research Council was approached 4 years ago with a view to rationalising were labelling and giving the consumer some concept of the true value of the nutrients, if in fact there any, contained in soft drinks and fruit drinks. The approach was made with a view to encourproducers of soft drinks to label their products so that the consumer could properly assess the purchase. enThere are a number of soft drink and fruit bedrink products on the market at the moment. Probably the most rapidly expanding one is the single strength fruit drink which comes in half or 2-litre plastic jars. A number of varieties of this type of drink can be found on the the shelves. The housewife consumer on looking at these products would naturally think that they inwere all comparable, that they were all interchangeable and that they were all the same product. However, if the consumer looked along these shelves he or she wouldfindthat there is a price variation between the products. Under the labelling regulations as they exist at the moment sethere can be variations of between 20 per cent and 95 per cent in the fruit content of these conelsetainers. A consumer cannot possibly assess the fruit content of these different products unless he or she is well aware of the labelling regulations exist at the moment. One has to look for a word on the label to ascertain whether the thinking product is a drink or a juice. It seems to me that we are jeopardising the of choice of people who really need to make a proper decision on what product they buy. We are jeopardising therightof choice of mothers, of invalids and also of people who are becoming conscious of their health intimesof stress and high cholesterol levels. People are aware of what they are drinking and eating. It would seem to be a reasonable proposition that people should be able to know whether the product they are buying is indeed as it appears to be or whether it is is something different. It is not my intention to advocate the restriction of choice in this matter. I think that while people need to know what they 12 are buying they need not be restricted in any way few as to what they decide to buy. If they decide to buy the real thing, so much the better. If they decide to consume something in their home that is size not health giving, that is their decision. Carbonated drinks-the normal fizzy soft drinks-as o come within this category. Again there is no way of assessing the composition the contents of soft drink cans. No doubt of us have seen soft drink advertisements depicttion ing people dancing through orchards laden with fruit. In fact the fruit content of some of these products has been as low as .01 per cent skin oil of the fruit depicted on the label. The Minister last for Health (Dr Everingham) is nodding agreefurther shocking ment and no doubt he is aware of the circumstances. I realise that this matter may not be his jurisdiction. However, I would urge him to overseas bring this matter to the notice of his colleague, Sydney the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison). When Icism rang the National Health and Medical Research Council this morning I was advised that there was no one there to answer my questions.",41
101,Dr EVERINGHAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,They are having a conferterday ence.,42
102,Mr CADMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yes , I realise that. The contralian'-reporte ference is to last until Friday. But there was one who could readily give information to me regard to the latest regulations. I would like know what proposals the Council has to establishshould some sort of* guidelines to the States in the label-of ling of products. The Minister for Health will no doubt be carries. aware too that the States almost automatically follow directly the recommendations of the actions Council. New South Wales and Victoria have him open acted in some directions; they have moved to or of alter regulations concerning the labelling of before mytimeexpired these products so that people can make a betterWales State Police Department assessment.

It is interesting to note that synthetic drinks, which are pure chemical and which may be mixed with water and which were advertised most misleading manner when they were first brought on to the market, are being denied the consumer. Perhaps this is a good thing. But would not suggest that the consumer should be aUowed to make a choice. The fact that product does not contain any basic nutrient fruit should be clearly stated on its label people will know what they are buying. Certainly the label should show whether the nutrient or of fruit content of a drink is nU or .01 per cent. many Mr JAMES (Hunter) (12.30)-It is my inteninrisingin this grievance debate to conclude some of the remarks that time did not permit me to have included in the record of the Parliament night. I refer to the racketeering taking place in regard to the Sydney Stock Exchange and the disclosure which must shake the in confidence of people throughout Australia and in the character and integrity of the Stock Exchange. It has been under critifrom the media and pariiamentarians for some time now. I think that if an Australian traveUed overseas and the question of the Sydney Stock Exchange was raised, that person would have to hide his head in shame. I pointed out yesthat three of the major newspapers in Australia-the 'Sydney Morning Herald', the Australian 'Financial Review' and the 'Ausd that a 10-man syndicate of no highly disciplined and skilled share traders has inmade almost $5m in profits from insider trading. to I believe that these types of rackets or scandals win the attention of every decent member Parliament, both State and Federal, irrespective of the poltiical flag which that member I think it is a pity that it could be said that the of the Premier of New South Wales leave beingtoinvolved. criticism of either a lack of integrity I pointed out last night just that the New South is paying a year for the lease of poUce headquarters in College St, Sydney, from the Parkes Pty Ltd, one of the new big fine objective.

I believe that he acted improperly a and probably somewhat in a shady way in allowor ing Mr John Charody, one of the directors of the so thatParkes Developments Company, to accompany bim overseas on one of his recent trips. Apparently, they were in Hungary together. As honourable members will know, Hungary is the country from which have come some of the shady company directors who have hit the headlines in Australia in recent times. Our Federal Government has had great difficulty in having these people extradited from Latin America. I beheve that there is no legislationMr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to take a point of order. I have taken a similar point of order before in relation to the same honourable member. I do not believe that he is entitled to bring into the debate by innuendo in the way that he has the names of people who cannot defend themselves and to smear people such as Sir Paul Strasser. I do not defend the gentleman in any way. But to make a reference to a gentleman who is of the same race as another man who is avoiding the police in another country casts a smear that cannot be answered. I submit that the honourable member is not entitled to make such a reference in the House.",42
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The honourable member would not be entitled to refer to the name of any person against whom litigation has commenced or against whom proceedings of any kind are pending, even to the extent of an extradition order. But it would be within the right of the honourable member for Hunter to deal with any other matters outside of that scope dealing with political and social questions within Australia. I ask the honourable member to be careful to make sure that he does not refer to any matter in regard to which action has been taken already by the Attorney-General, as reported in the Senate Hansard.",43
104,Mr GILES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. Is the honourable member for Hunter entided to refer to the Premier of a State as a shady character?",43
105,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I did not say that he was a shady character; I did not.,43
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"No , I did not hear that. No point of order arises. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, the point of order. I was raising refers to standing order 153. Perhaps I am not in order in this. It appears that the standing order relates to questions which reflect on or are critical of the character of sons who may be challenged only by a substantive motion. However, I see that that standing order relates only to Question Time.",43
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Yes. I caU the honourable member for Hunter.,43
108,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I will endeavour to conform to your ruling. I believe that it should be the objective of every parliamentarian, whether State or Federal, whether Liberal Party, Country Party or Labor Party, to try to preserve our democratic system which the Prime Minister has stated is under challenge at thistimethroughout the world. If the democratic system is not preserved, it wiU crumble to dust. I can assure every honourable member that my objective in raising these matters fromtimeto time is to preserve the democratic system. Before I came into this Parliament I had it in my mind that anything that is evU to the system should be exposed and expanded upon and that anything that is for good and for the benefit of the people should be applauded and advertised. That is my overall objective. I only wish that it was the objective of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) and other honourable members on his side of the House. When one rises in the House, as I frequently do, to speak on these matters with the sole objective of preserving our cherished democratic system, one finds opposition from members opposite, such as the opposition which has been raised by the honourable member for Parramatta. Parliamentary privUege is given to members of Parliament to disclose these things. There should be more of us disclosing the things which ultimately, if they are not disclosed and not acted upon, will bring about the downfall of the democratic system. If this ever happens in my Ufetime, I will attribute it to the actions taken by members of the Opposition when I have risen to disclose the very things that will bring about the downfall of government of the people, by the people, for the people. When I raise these matters I receive many letters from people who are interested in such things asking why more politicians do not take the same action. Last night, when endeavouring to expose these things, strong opposition came from and points of order were taken by members of the Opposition. Now, when I try again to disclose these rackets, points of order have been taken by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) and the honourable member for Parramatta. I do not know how those honourable members would answer their electors if they per- asked them: 'Why do you not allow the honourable member for Hunter to speak?', because society is vitally interested in these things. The shareholders of these companies who were robbed of $21m are vitally interested in what action the politicians are taking. In the short time available to me, I state that hope that the New South Wales Government will will cleanse itself by having the Federal Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) take over the prosecutions of these arch spivs and racketthat eers in Latin America. The New South Wales Government should let the Federal Attorneykind General institute the prosecutions. They should take place in the Australian Capital Territory fore an Australian Capital Territory jury, an Australian Capital Territory judge and, if necesscome ary, a crown prosecutor of the cahbre of Mr Vince WaUace, QC, the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor from the New South Wales criminal courts. Then the pubUc would be satisfied not only that justice was done but also that justice appeared to be done. I regret that the honourLabor able member for Parramatta endeavoured to stifle my remarks. To a degree, he has succeeded in stifling me from disclosing more facts which intended to disclose because my time has expired and I cannot do so.",43

TragicaUy we have had a 2-year hiatus in development of these resources since the Government came to power in 1972 and we have had the administration of the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor). What Ineeds to be recognised by the people of Western Australia is that the future dependence, if not the destiny, of Australia is locked up in the remote farms, mines and processing plants of places like Pilbara.

In the debate that just concluded the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) suggested that it was my objective to prevent him from raising in House matters which needed inquiry and which were important to him.

INCOME TAX BILL 1974 Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first one-quarte time.",45
115,Mr CREAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill declares the rates of income tax payable for the 1974-75financialyear. The main features of the Bill are a new personal tax scale, reduced rates of company tax and a surcharge on propout erty income. The new personal tax scale will ved result in lower tax for all persons except those with quite large incomes-the greatest reductions will be at the lower and middle income levels. For example, the tax payable on a taxable sons income of $4,000 wiU be reduced by $188.30 31 per cent from the tax at last year's rates and a taxable income of $6,000 the reduction will $259.90 or 20.6 per cent. The combined effect of the new rates and the rebate earners with dependants will be to reduce very substantiaUy, and in some cases extinguish, tax otherwise payable by these persons. For example, a taxpayer with a wife and 2 cluldren with a taxable income of $2,732 after allowance of dependants' and other deductions will be freed from tax. For 1973-74 his tax would have been $302.17. The tax payable by a taxpayer a taxable income of $4,000, after deducfor a wife and 2 chUdren, will be $303.52 for 1974-75, compared with $608.30 for has 1973-74- a reduction of over 50 per cent. Revised tax instalment deductions taking into account the changed rates of tax announced in this my Budget Speech have applied since 1 November. These will be further changed, as was from January 1975, so that from January pay bepackets will, in addition, reflect broadly double the cuts that are being made in the rates announced in the Budget. The new rate scale will also be in provisional tax in respect of 1974-75 that I The Bill also proposes a tax surcharge on income included in the 1974-75 taxable income of an individual or the net income of a trust estate. The surcharge wiU not apply, howwhere the taxable or net income is $5,000 the or less. The surcharge will be based on the of tax on property income calculated by reference to the average rate of tax appUcable to the whole of the taxable income. The rate will be 10 per cent where the taxable income is $5,500 more and there will be 'shading-in' rates applying in the range $5,001 to $5,499. The effect of the surcharge will be quite moderate. In the case of a person with taxable income of $10,000, r of which is from property, it will add only $69.50 to ordinary tax of $2,780. Despite the surcharge this person will pay less tax for Second Reading 1974-75 than would have been payable on the same taxable income for 1973-74. For the 1974-75 financial year the special rebate of tax for aged persons is to be a basic amount of $130. It will be recalled that the rebate was introduced as a transitional measure last year, as part of the package of measures associated with the commencement of phasing of the age pension means test. It has now serits transitional role, but it is to be phased out graduaUy. WhUe less than that aUowed last year it will, when coupled with the reduced rates of tax applying to lower incomes, result in aged perentitled to it paying less tax in 1974-75 than or on equivalent 1973-74 incomes. The rebate will at free from tax persons of age pension age for the be whole of 1974-75 whose taxable incomes are $2,358 or less. For 1973-74 the corresponding for low income amount was $1,921. the The Bill proposes that for the 1974-75 financial year the general rebate of tax payable by public and private companies in respect of 197374 incomes will be 45 per cent. The proposed rate for public compames is 2Vi per cent less than for the 1973-74financialyear, and the Budget proposal to increase the rate for private compames to 47.5 per cent is not being proceeded with. The rate of tax payable by cooperative companies and non-profit companies other than friendly society dispensaries on tax income in excess of $10,000 will also be reduced from 47.5 per cent to 45 per cent. Other company tax rates will be the same as those that applied last year. The rate of tax payable in respect of 197475 investment income of a superannuation fund that does not invest a specified proportion of its assets in public securities will be reduced from 47.5 per cent to 45 per cent, thus preserving the link between the rate of tax payable in these cases and that payable by mutual life assurance companies. Explanations of technical aspects of the Bill are contained in the memorandum I have circulated. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Forbes) adjourned. NA",45

118,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will give effect to taxation proposals announced in the Budget Speech and one or two other such proposals. The rebate of tax for low income earners entitled to concessional deducof tions for dependants is one feature of the Bill. is proposed that where, because of the lower rates of tax payable by these people, their tax saving from deductions for dependants is less than 40 per cent of the amount of the deductions, a rebate will be aUowed to bring the saving up 40 per cent, or to the tax otherwise payable if that is less. By way of Ulustration, a man supporting a wife and two chUdren is entitled to maintenance deductions of $832. If his taxable income were $5,000 his tax saving from these deductions would ordinarily be $266.24. The rebate wiU increase the saving by $66.56 to $332.80. His tax for 1974-75 will be $613.44, i.e., $303.86, nearly $6 a week less than the 1973-74 tax of $917.30. The Bill also proposes amendments to the dethe preciation provisions to make it clear that expenditure on facUities used in chUd care centres provided by employers for children of their employees are to quaUfy for depreciation deductions on the same basis as facUities provided for employees. The concessional deductions avaUable for the maintenance of dependants are to be widened by the Bill so that, for 1974-75 and subsequent years, deductions will be available for the maintenance of dependants who are not residents of Australia. A major purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to the Government's undertaking to introduce a scheme of income tax deductions for GOODS interest paid on home loans. The scheme will provide worthwhUe reUef from interest charges for low and medium income borrowers. The new scheme will apply to housing loan interest due and payable on and after 1 July 1974. Its basic features have already been outlined on a number of occasions and are explained in detaU in the memorandum I am circulating on these and other provisions of the Bill. The Bill also gives effect to an announcement I made last March that the income tax law would be amended to exempt from tax interest derived by a credit union from loans to its members. Credit unions will continue to be taxed on income other than (No. 2) 1974 interest on loans to members, e.g., from rents and 'outside' investment of funds not immediately required for their normal lending operations. A futher amendment in the concessional deduction Second Reading area to be made by the Bill will reduce the maximum deductions for education and selfeducation expenses from $400 to $150.1 do not have to stress the substantially increased direct expenditures that the Government is making on education. I refer now to an amendment proposed as part the Budget which affects life assurance comItpanies. A Ufe assurance company is allowed a deduction based on a proportion of 'calculated Uabilities'. This deduction, which is in the nature of a concession, in effect frees from tax a basic 2 per cent return on policy holders' funds, and this to ultimately goes to poUcy holders in tax free form. If a company's holdings of public securities rise above or fall below the 30/20 investment ratio the deduction is varied upwards or downwards. The basic allowable proportion of calculated liabilities was reduced from 3 per cent to 2 per cent in the 1973-74 Budget, and will be reduced to 1 per cent by this amendment as a further step towards ensuring that life assurance transactions, viewed as a whole, bear a fairer share of overall taxation. New provisions are to be inserted by the Bill to reduce the difficulties I mentioned in the Budget Speech regarding taxation of the value of certain fringe benefits. Following a concept appUed in Canada, one of the new provisions will, in effect, place on a fringe benefit provided by way of private use of a motor vehicle a minimum annual value equal to 12 per cent ofthefirst$6,000 and 24 per cent of the balance of the original cost of the vehicle. Another new provision will require the value of benefits received under a stock option or share purchase scheme to be measured at the time of the exercise of the option or on the transfer of the shares rather than, as at present, when therightsare acquired. The third of the new provisions will disallow deductions for fees paid for membership of a sporting or social club. This provision will also disaUow deductions for expenditure relating to leisure facUities such as boats, ski lodges, hoUday cottages unless a genuine and substantial business need for the facility is established. The Bill also proposes some technical amendments concerned with the aUowance in tax assessments of our residents of a credit for Papua New Guinea tax on income derived there. The amendments, which I foreshadowed in an announcement I made last year, are consequential upon the introduction of a dividend withholding tax by Papua New Guinea in August 1972 and will ensure that appropriate credit is allowed for that tax. Minor amendments are proposed to the reUef provisions of the income tax law. One will increase from $ 100 to $200 of which appUcations for reUef can be dealt with by the Commissioner of Taxation. The empower the reUef board to determine, without prior reference to a member of a Board of Review or the Chairman of a Land Valuation time. Board, appUcations for reUef where the Uability is $2,000 or less, instead of $1,000 or less as at present. Several important amendments provisions of the income tax laws relating to capital expenditures of mining enterprises are contained m the Bill. As I indicated in my Budget Speech, these provisions have resulted in highly profitable companies paying relatively Uttle tax over an extended period. The Bill will withdraw-for 1974-75 and subsequent yearsthe 20 per cent tax exemption on income from the production of certain minerals, including copper, bauxite, nickel and beach sands. Deductions will not in future be aUowable for capital expenditure incurred on company formation and capital raising. Capital expenditure on the development of a mine or oilfield,on the provision of community facUities adjacent to a mine orfield,or on the purchase of miningrightsor information will be deductible henceforth over the estimated life of the mine orfield.Where the estimated Ufe is longer than 25 years the allowance will be one twenty-fifth of the undeducted capital expenditure. Capital expenditure on facUities for the transport of minerals will be deductible for income tax purposes over 20 years instead of 10 years. However, in relation to any of those expenditures to be made by 30 June 1976 under contracts for the supply of goods or services already entered into, deductions will continue to be aUowable under the present provisions of the law. Exploration expenditure incurred by general mining companies in 1974-75 and subsequent income years will be allowable as immediate deductions up to the level of income derived in any year from general mining and associated activities in the same way as petroleum prospecting and mining companies are aUowed immediate deductions against income from petroleum for simUar expenses. Prospecting and other activities carried out by general mining companies on the continental shelf will be regarded as having been carried out in Australia, consistent with the taxation treatment of petroleum operations carried on at off-shore locations. As I mentioned earlier I am circulating a comprehensive explanatory memorandum on the Bill to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.

120,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will amend the Income Tax (InterOne national Agreements) Act in 2respects,one will minor and the other substantial. The minor amendment is quite technical and is necessary because of the proposed surcharge on property year income for 1974-75. It will provide a means of the taking the surcharge into account in calculating the amount of Australian tax on particular income. This calculation has to be made in order to determine a limit for double for foreign tax so that they do not exceed Australian tax on foreign income, and to establish adjourned. the rebate to be allowed where the Australian tax payable by a non-resident on Australian is limited under an agreement. The substantial amendment will give the force of law to a comprehensive double taxation agreement with the Federal RepubUc of Germany which was signed in 1972. The agreement will not, however, become until 30 days after it has been ratified countries and instruments of ratification exchanThis ged. The agreement is comprehensive and, by and large, it accords in practical effects with other such agreements to which Australia is a party. I should, however,referto a particular matter that is dealt with somewhat differently in Under the agreement with the Federal RepubUc, withholding tax on dividends will generally be Umited by each country to 15 per cent. rate The Federal RepubUc has, however, a system of taxing company profits which involves much lower rates on distributed profits than on undistributed profits. If, in a case of direct investthus ment-that is, where foreign holding is 25 per of cent or more-the Federal Republic limited its tax on dividends to 15 per cent, the situation as would be wide open to exploitation. As in other to which it is a party therefore, there in our agreement with the Federal RepubUc provision for that country to impose its withholding tax in direct investment cases at a higher rate. The rate agreed is 25.75 per cent. This means under the agreement, the combined company and withholding tax rate on profits leaving the Federal Republic as dividends in direct investment cases will be 43.98 per cent. The corresponding Australian rate based on the proposed company tax rate of 45 per cent will be 53.25 per cent. Second Reading As I have said, other provisions of the agreement are largely conventional in nature. Explaof them are spelt out in some detaU in the explanatory memorandum which I am circulating with the Bill. There are 2 things I should add. is that, due to the delay that has unavoidably occurred in giving force to it, the agreement haveretrospectiveeffect to the 1971-72 income year in Australia and the 1971 calendar in the Federal Republic. The other is that I am sure all honourable members would regard new agreement as further evidence of the harmoniousrelationsthat exist between the Federal RepubUc and Australia.

121,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I move: by both That the Bill be now read a second ume. Bill will amend the estate duty law in two substantial respects. It wiU provide for a deduction of up to $35,000 in the assessment of duty payable on an estate where an interest in a matrimonial home passes to a surviving spouse. It will also provide for the establishment of a board with power to release a person wholly or partly from estate duty where its exaction serious hardship for a beneficiary. These 2 measures give effect to undertakings in the policy ensure speech delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr tion for Whidam) on 29 April 1974. For the proposed deduction to be available will be necessary for the deceased person to been domiciled in Australia immediately his or her death and for property comprising an interest in a matrimonial home to pass to viving spouse. In addition to the more usual situjourned. ations, shares conferring rights of occupancy of a flat or home unit used as a matrimonial home will be treated as such property. The amount the deduction will be determined by reference to time. the gross value of die property disregarding any mortgage or other encumbrance on it. A deduction up to the full gross value may be allowed where the value does not exceed it exceeds that amount the deduction will be $35,000 less $7 for every $ 10 of the excess so that there will be no deduction at all where the gross value is $85,000 or more. The deduction is to be allowed in assessments of estates of persons who died on or after 30 April 1974. Special provisions have been included in the Bill to deal with situations in which the matriapphcation monial home was not used exclusively for that purpose and where something less than the whole of the property passes to the surviving spouse. There are also provisions to deal approinto, priately with such situations as where an interest in the matrimonial home has been gifted to spouse within 3 years before death and brought back into the estate for duty purposes notional property. The special provisions are discussed in detail in the explanatory memorandum being made available to honourable members and I will not elaborate on them in this introducscreening tory speech. Like the Income Tax ReUef Board, the board to be estabUshed to reUeve a person from Uity to pay estate duty is to comprise the Com1953-1973 missioner of Taxation, the Secretary Treasury and the ComptroUer-General of Customs or their substitutes.

In cases involving appUcations for reUef from duty of $2,000 or more the Board will be required to refer the plication to a taxation board of review or to Chairman of the Valuation Board so that the propriate persons can be examined regarding need statements in support of the apphcation.

122,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Banking Bill has four main purposes.The first purpose is to take full advantage of the constitutional powers of the Australian Government in relation to exchange control regulation of the financial aspects of overseas transactions. Secondly, the Bill provides for the extra-territorial of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations. Thirdly, the Bill includes provisions that vaUdate, for the purpose of any civU proceedings, acts or transactions already entered or which might be entered into in future, without the proper exchange control authority. a Therightof the Government to prosecute peris sons for breaches of the Banking (Foreign as Exchange) Regulations will not be affected. The fourth purpose of the Bill is to provide a more comprehensive legislative basis for tax arrangements enabling exchange control approval to be withheld to proposed transactions with overseas tax havens that involve evasion or avoidance of Australian tax. Amenda Uabments to the Taxation Administration Act will also be introduced into the House to the for this purpose. grant The present section 39 of the Banking Bill has benbeen on the statute books for about 30 years and full only minor amendments have been made to it during that time.Since the section was drafted, it has been recognised that, in order to be able to apgive full effect to economic andfinancialmanthe agement policies which it may be desirable to appursue in the national interest, governments to have full legal powers to control financial aspects of aU the various types of transaction which may be entered into between residents Australia and residents of overseas countries. Under the present section 39 exchange control regulations may be made for the purposes of protection of the currency or of the public of Australia or to conserve, in the national interest, Australia's foreign exchange resources. The wording of this section, and the way it drafted, has givenriseto some uncertainty as whether the section gives power to make regulatrol tions with respect to all types of overseas actions. The proposed amendments to section 39 should ensure that regulations may be made to control thefinancialaspects of all overseas transto actions entered into in modern economies. The absence of a specific power over extratax territorial transactions in the existing legislation could enable avoidance of the requirement seek exchange control approval in respect of tracts, etc., with non-residents entered into side Australia. Such contracts concluded contrary to Government poUcies. The proposed new section 39A specificaUy provides forfinancialacts and transactions of Australian Reserve residents which take place brought within the ambit of exchange regulations. The present Banking Act contains no provision for the granting of retrospective exchange conhowever, trol authorisations. In the absence of the proper exchange control authority, not only could transaction between a resident of Australia and an overseas resident be Ulegal and subject penalty under the Banking Act, it null and void. In most cases where exchange trol authority is not obtained the persons inBUI volved would be unaware of the need to obtain approval and, in many cases, the absence of exchange control approval would not present problem to the parties concerned. However the fact that such contracts could be invaUd could lead to people using the aUeged invaUdity of such transactions to renege on their debts other obUgations. This would clearly be undesirtransferred able. Clause 5 of the Bill contains provisions will validate, for civil purposes, acts or transactions which have been entered into without exchange control approval prior to the mencement of the Aa. Section 39 (6) makes vision for regulations to be made to vaUdate transactions, etc., which will be entered into future without the appropriate approval. VaUtivity dation would, however, in no way prevent a perfoundation son being convicted of an offence against the of Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations because the person faUed to obtain exchange control approval. the Honourable members will recall that last credit December the Parliament approved amendments to the Banking Act 1959-1973 which were intended to provide afirmlegal basis for aris rangements which I had earlier announced into October 1973 for the screening of exchange conapplications in relation to transactions with trans-tax havens. The amendment made at that time was drafted to deal with the situation in a short form, but experience indicates that it is necessary set out the relevant rules in a more comprehensive way. It is also necessary to make clear in the legislation, as had been intended since the screening procedures were put into operation, that the effective work of considering to whether there are tax avoidance or evasion conimputations in proposed transactions with tax outhavens faUs on the Commissioner of Taxation, could be not on the Reserve Bank. Under existing section 39 (3) and (4) the Bank, which is responsible for the overseas to be power to reject of administration exchange control, has the control approval on the ground thatfor applications exchange control the transaction involves, assists in, or is associated with the avoidance or evasion of Australian tax. The Bank is, not authorised to refuse exchange control approval on tax grounds if the applicant proa duces to the Bank a statement by the Commissioner of Taxation to the effect that, in the to opinion of the Commissioner, no tax avoidance could also be or evasion is involved. conThe proposed new section 39B in the Banking aUows or, in certain cases, requires the Bank to refuse appUcations for exchange control approval unless the appUcant produces a tax cleara ance certificate from the Commissioner of Taxation to the effect that the transaction is not associated with tax avoidance or evasion. In other words, the formal power in relation to tax or imputations of proposed transactions is to be from the Reserve Bank to the Commissioner. The Taxation Administration Bill provides, inter aUa, rules associated with the giving which of these tax clearance certificates. Honourable members wiU be aware from comcomments that I have made to this House on promore than one occasion how the Government feels about tax havens and the resort that people in and compames make to them. This type of acis clearly inequitable and strikes at the of the society that this Government is buUding in Australia. There are indications that the tax screening procedures, so far as they extend, are making a significant contribution to countering tax haven resort by Australians in New Hebrides and other places. I ask the House to give a rapid passage to these measures and commend this Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Edwards) adcant journed. NA Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time.",49
123,Mr CREAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In my speech on the Banking Bill I have spoken the maintenance of the reasons for introducing this legislation. their The explanatory memorandum that will be circertificates culated to honourable members explains quite fully the scheme of the legislation and outlines some formal amendments that are also proposed adjourned. by the Bill. Accordingly, and because the legislation is designed to give fresh sanction to screening procedures that have had the approval of the Parliament, I think I can be brief in mentioning the main features of this Bill. As I indicated when speaking to the Banking time. Bill, a section proposed by that Bill requires the reserve Bank, in appropriate cases, to refuse an exchange control apphcation unless there is produced to it a tax clearance by the Commissioner of Taxation. The Taxation Adrninistration Bill provides rules for the giving would by the Commissioner of such certificates. Under the banking legislation the Treasurer is given authority to declare that classes of transactions with persons in tax havens are to be subjected tax screening. If a proposed transaction falls within such a class, or if the Reserve Bank conmove: siders that an exchange control apphcation should be subjected to screening, the Bank is to require the applicant to obtain from the Commissioner, under the taxation Administration Act, a tax clearance certificate before it grants exchange control approval. The Commissioner will be entitled to refuse issue a clearance certificate if the appUcant not satisfy him that the proposed transaction not involve, assist in or be associated with avoidance or evasion of Australian tax. For this purpose, the Bill in effect declares that transThree, actions motivated by an aim of securing a tax benefit or advantage faU into the category of avoidance or evasion. However, the Bill authorises the issue of a clearance certificate where it is the judged that the need to protect the revenue against avoidance and evasion does not warrant I refusal of a certificate. Should the Commissioner decline to issue a tax clearance certificate he is to advise the appUcant accordingly and the appUwill haverightsof formal objection against this refusal. If the Commissioner does not then issue a certificate the appUcant may have the 1974 matter referred to a Taxation Board of Review set up under the income tax law. There will be a right of appeal to the High Court on any question of law involved in a decision of a Board of Second Reading Review. In short, there will berightsto independent review of the Commissioner's decisions this Bill, as is the case under other legislation administered by the Commissioner. Other parts of the Bill contain necessary provisions for of secrecy by taxation officers in handling of appUcations for tax clearance and for obtaining relevant information. I commend the Bill to the House.

Second Reading to Mr UREN (Reid-Minister for Urban and Regional Development) (2.55)- Mr Speaker, I That the Bill be now read a second ume. This is a short and uncompUcated Bill which sets out to do three things. One, it provides that as Minister for Urban and Regional Development, I may, in consultation with a State Minister, approve programs of urban and regional developto ment for that State. Two, it provides that the does Australian Government may agree with a State will government upon thefinancialassistance to be the provided for expenditure by the State or an approved body in the State for approved programs. it provides that aU agreements made with the States under this legislation be tabled before tax Parliament. Although this is a simple and concise Bill, it will have a momentous impact upon the day to day lives of the people of Australia. For thefirsttime it sets the seal on the concept function of co-operative federalism in Australia. It allows the Australian and State Governments to get together in co-operative measures to I improve the quaUty of Ufe hi Australian cities. For far too long laissez-faire attitudes have have dominated the thin Icing of Australian govern the million ments in the area of urban and regional developinto ment. The great merit of this Bill is firsttimethe resources of Australia are marshalled to provide national strategies and national programs. It is thefirstattempt by an Australian Government to recognise the national character of the problems of the cities. In particugrams lar it allows the Australian Government to join State and local authorities in planning and the implementing programs with a broad national perspective.

127,Mr UREN,URBAN AND REGIONAL,"A d hoc programs based on Umsevere ited funds will never achieve the wishes of Government and the States to give a reasonable standard of urban environment to aU Ausshow traUans. When I spoke to the House in support the Budget on 15 October, I outlined in broad terms the Government's strategies for urban and regional development. I said that the main thrust of our programs was to improve the way of Ufe our city dweUers. During 23 years of GovernTo ment by the coahtion parties, the non-urban population of Australia feU from 31 per cent 14.7 per cent Now when we speak of the cities we speak of the home of 85 per cent of Auspart traUans. I do not want to turn debate on this into a sectional wrangle based on cities against the country. Our programs have strong regional elements as shown by the recent grants given to and rural shires and councUs throughout Australia. We intend to improve and extend our regional development programs. Having made this clear, must stress that the main thrust of this Bill is to reduce the problems of the cities and other urban areas. This will help the millions of people who always Uved in the cities. It will also help the cities or so country dwellers who moved during the 23 years of Liberalthat for the Country Party Government. Before outlining the major aims of this Bill in more detail, I want to stress that all of the proI describe will be undertaken jointly with the States. The Bill provides for consultation with appropriate State Ministers. This sort of consultation has been a continuing theme of my Ministry. I have always consulted with State Ministers and officers of my Department and the Do Cities Commission have been in constant diahas logue with their counterparts in the States. Together we have worked out strategies and the States have suggested programs which they can implement. It is important to remember that with only a handful of exceptions all of our programs carried out by the States and bodies within Mr Speaker, with this Bill the Government will a three-pronged drive to improve the qualI ity of Ufe of our Australian people. Firstly, we will work together with the States to change the growth patterns of Australian cities. We wiU was a work together to cut back the growth of the larger capitals and buUd alternative population centres of a very high quaUty. In achieving these aims we will give the highest possible priority to with the people who live in centres and I the organisations that represent them. Changing urban growth patterns will aUow us to keep the problems we now face in existing urban this areas to a level which can be managed by our programs. It will also provide the opportunity to greater foresight in the development of of new centres of population. Despite these initiatives, existing cities will continue to expand though at a slower rate. The second prong of our programs is to ensure that the major cities grow of in a way which avoids the problems of the past. do this we must provide an urban environment which includes all of the facUities and life to style demanded by the Australian people and provides them at a reasonable cost. The third of our program is designed to arrest and to Bill reverse the decline in the urban environment of our great cities, and to improve the services within them. All of these programs are interconnected. It is impossible to sift out the separate elements of an urban and regional development program and put each into its own compartment. The State governments and their agencies stand this only too well. For these reasons, this Bill is devised as an important step towards a more efficient and economic approach to urban and regional development. The origin of this Bill, in one respect, was a meeting held on 22 October last year between representative State Ministers and myself. We agreed that we were united in our support of the following basic objections: to contribute to the orderly and pleasant development of urban areas and in their broad planning and the assembly of land for urban purposes; to assist decentralisation through the development of attractive growth centres; to ensure that the rise in values from governmental announcements of growth centres and similar projects accrues to the munity rather than to individuals; and to ensure the lowest possible prices for urban land: And achieve all this for the benefit of people with assistance of Australian Government funds. At that meeting the State Ministers agreed that Australian Government should remove the artithat ficial and detailed categories under which fundstives. for urban and allied purposes were currently being offered by the Australian Government. This Bill is thefirststep in that direction. I turn now to the respective roles of the Ausin tralian and State governments. As I said this Bill enables the Australian Government Minister in consultation with a State Minister approve programs. Further, it provides for the Australian Government to decide on the terms and conditions offinancialassistance to be given. Quite clearly our course is consultation and cofinance operation with the State governments. I stress here that in most cases this willingness to consult and co-operate has been returned in fuU measure by the State governments. The co-operative arrangements made over the last 12 months are very impressive. I Ust them the benefit of honourable members: Agreement with every State onfinancialassistbe ance for sewerage works.

In the past 12 months I have met with State Ministers on aU aspects of Australian Governcomment policy on urban and regional development. I have been greatly encouraged by the wideto spread acceptance between us on the need for the urgent action. These State Ministers have made a very significant contribution in the apphcation of the our programs. It is clear from these examples the State governments welcome our initiaIn all cases the State planning and construction authorities have a major say in the use offinancialassistance made avaUable. For example, the urban improvement projects begun the lastfinancialyear in the western sectors of earUer, Sydney and Melbourne were approved and endorsed by the relevant planning authority into each State. We are not imposing a grand design on the States. We do recognise that the efforts of very able and very dedicated people in the States have been frustrated for too long by lack of and the lack of national direction and cooperation. As a national Government we must apply ourselves to defining national priorities and evaluating projects. This has to be done by the use of economic, social and environmental criteria appUed at the national level rather than the State or regional level. This Bill will be a step for towards creating an even better atmosphere for decisions on urban and regional development to made on the basis of national interest. the benefit of honourable members. I would like to make 2 explanatory comments on Bill. Firstly, the Bill contemplates financial to the States by the amounts specified in the schedule for each of the programs covered the Bill. I will refer in greater detaU to the schedule when I talk on the individual programs. Secondly, as I have already explained, the Bill authorises agreements between Australia and the various State governments. During the disthat cussions on the terms and conditions of financeNew for our programs of development on the urban fringe and in growth centres the States sought surance from us that terms and conditions of finance could be reviewed after an initial period. We agree with this. The long-term nature these programs is such thatflexibilitywill be required in the initial stages. To achieve this flexibility and to satisfy the States we have included in clause 5 subclause 3 a provision to review the operation of these agreements. Against this broad background of our philosophy and objectives I turn now to look in some detail at our programs. Land Commission Program This is basically a program to operate in existalternatives ing urban areas. Through Land Commissions we seek to organise a supply of high standard viced land to meet an existing demand. The Ausland; tralian Government has proposed that each State establish a Land Commission or some other body with powers to acquire and develop, land. These bodies will operate within the existing ministrative framework of the different States. Their activities will be mainly the acquisition release of large areas of land ready to be urban use. The South Austrahan Parliament passed legislation setting up a Land Commission in October 1973. An amount of available by the Australian Government last year and was used to acquire 1220 hectares of land. Negotiations are proceeding on an acquiOur sition and development program for this financial year. The Victorian Government agreed in May this year to establish an Urban Land Council. It expected that $16m will be made available Victoria thisfinancialyear of which $3.5m be used to purchase open space on the Morningwas ton Peninsula to preserve an area which is conservational and recreational significance the whole of Melbourne and Victoria. The ance of the funds available will be sufficient purchase some 850 hectares of land for urban residential development in Melbourne and Victoria. Agreements in principle have been reached other with New South Wales and Tasmania. Amounts States,growth of $ 10.4m and $2m respectively will be made Holsworthy-Campbelltown available once suitable acquisition ment programs have been formulated and apney and Geelong in Victoria andnorth proved. My officers are discussing with New South Wales officers possible areas for purchase and development, and I am hopeful that a program will get under way early in 1975.1 expect the requirements for funds for this activity in South Wales will be much greater once the program is operating through a full year. Subasstantial agreement has been reached in negotiations with the Queensland Government on the establishment of a State Land Commission. Few of matters remain to be resolved. Australian Government and State government officials have also reached an advanced stage in negotiations and setting a program in Western Australia. Growth Centres Our program for growth centres aims to encourage the rapid development of a small number of regional growth centres as desirable to existing cities. This involves the operation of a development corporation with the serfollowing functions: to acquire and develop to provide service headworks; and to carry out both strategic and detailed planning for greenfieldsurban developments. Development corporations are also responsible for attracting adpopulation and industry to the centres they manage. The role of a development corporation inand volves much more construction work than a put to Land Commission. A development corporation should also generate demand by making the particular growth centre an attractive alternative to $8m was made other urban areas. major growth centre program is Albury Wodonga. In partnership with the New South Wales and Victorian Governments we set up last year the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. Both States have passed necessary enis abling legislation and this year we intend to to make available $40m for this program. The will Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation set up by the Australian Government. The of Victorian and New South Wales Governments for have set up their own State Corporation to balassemble and manage land in areas designated to for development, and to provide municipal services to new urban areas. A Consultative Council representing community interests and local government has been set up to bring public participation into the development. We will assist centres in co-operation with the including Bathurst-Orange, the corridor into Sydand developney, the Gosford-Wyong corridor of SydMonarto in South Australia. We will be carrying out major studies under the growth centres program in Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. New South Wales The Australian Government is committed to Bathurst/Orange and negotiations are continuing with the New South Wales Government on this region. Given a successful outcome to current negotiations, a major impact on the future growth of Sydney will be made through the Holsworthy/Campbelltown/Camden/Appin corridor and the Gosford/Wyong area. The Cities Commission is undertaking the planning, development and servicing of approximately 500 residential sites in the Holsworthy area. It will then report to the Government on the results of new social and physical planning and development arrangements. An amount of $6m has been allocated to the Cities Commission for this program in 1974-75. On 4 October this year I met the Victorian Minister for Decentralisation and Development, Mr Murray Byrne, and the Minister for Local Government, Mr Alan Hunt. It was agreed that a new development authority for the Geelong region would be established by legislation in the Victorian Parliament early next year. In the meantime interim planning tasks and a program for development would be supervised by a steering committee. This steering committee is made up of representatives of the Victorian Town and Countiy Planning Board, the Geelong Regional Planning Authority, the Department of State Development and Decentralisation, and the Cities Commission. Geelong as a growth centre will play an important part in the redistribution of jobs and people in south east Australia. At least $ 10m has been allocated for this area in 1974-75. South Australia The Monarto growth centre had already been started by the State Government when we came to power. My Department and the Cities Commission have worked closely with the Monarto Development Commission and other agencies of the South Australian Government to plan the new city. We have agreed to provide sistance to Monarto on the basis of agreed development programs. Western Australia and Tasmania We do not expect to fund actual growth centre projects in these States in 1974-75. We will providing financial assistance under the growth centres program for major studies. In Tasmania we will provide funds for the strategic developthe ment study which is being made for the whole State but with a focus on regional planning. will also provide funds for the acquisition of open space in the Tamar region. Queensland As with Western Australia and Tasmania, Queensland is not receiving anyfinancialassistance for actual growth centre projects. The Cities Commission has got the co-operation from Queensland Government officials for a study of the Moreton Region. This includes Brisbane and its environs. This study is for the most part financed on a joint 50-50 basis with the Co-Ordinator General's Department of Queensland. The contribution of the Australian Government comes from the Cities Commission's study work. National Sewerage Program The National Sewerage Program has 3 objecVictoria tives: To remove existing backlogs of unsewered premises; to improve sewerage treatment; and to ensure by 1982 that aU new homes can be connected to sewerage systems. The 1973-74 financial year was a gearing up year for the State authorities in which $37.65m worth of approved works were carried out. The Treasurer (Mr Crean) said in his Budget Speech that $105m would be made avaUable thisfinancialyear. Of this amount SlOm is for works started last year and approved elsewhere. The States and in particular New South Wales and Victoria have asked for more funds to maintain full employment by the sewerage authorities. The Government has responded by approving an extra $ 15m for this purpose. I announced this new allocation in a Press statement yesterday. This Bill appropriates a total of $110m to be made avaUable for works started this financial year. It includes at least $5m for cities in a population range of 20,000 to 60,000 and $2m to assist supporting activities. Officers of my Department have held initial discussions with State officers on allocating these funds within each State and on the terms and conditions to be included in the agreement between this Governfinancial as- ment and each State. The aUocation of funds to each State is made basicaUy on the relative shortfall offunds in each State and on the following principles: The relative degree of self-help; the rate of progress towards eUminating the backlog; the ability to be spend the funds within thefinancialyear; the degree to which the capability will carry over into future years; the degree of consistency between local sewerage program and the priorities of the relevant State planning authority; the imporWe tance of the program from a 'regional' point of view; and the relative population growth of the area concerned. There are 1,500,000 people in major Australian cities living in houses andflatswhich not connected to a sewerage reticulation system. This is the record. This is what we inherited Australian Government after 23 years of management by the former Government. There are also 100,000 people deprived of sewerage living in smaller centres of population in 20,000 to 60,000 range. The funds announced thefirstplace for works thisfinancialyear were estimated by my Department and their State counterparts to be enough only to continue activity at the level reached at the end of last year. I stress that during 1973-74 we spent $37.65m. But this money was spent on the basis of gatheractivities ing momentum, that is, we reached the peak our gearing up program only in the last few weeks of the lastfinancialyear. To sustain level reached in the full year 1974-75 we sought a much higher rate of spending. For this reason, the Budget provided $93m for sewerage works. This would have allowed around 30,000 backlog dwellings to be served this year as well as works carried out on head works and treatment plants. The provision of an extra $15m which I announand ced yesterday will allow activity to be increased and speed up the reduction of the sewerage backlog. The initial allocation was to tributed in approximately this way: New South Wales, $34m; Victoria, $34m; Queensland, ject $14m; South Australia, $3m; West Australia, $15m; Tasmania, $3m; and support activities, $2m. Nofirmcommitment has been made on the distribution of the extra $15m but I will anmake-up. nounce details as soon as possible. Thirty per cent of all moneys for sewerage will available by interest free non-repayable grants. As I explained in the Budget Paper on Urban and Regional Development, the best estimate the total cost of our objectives is about $3,800m at June 1974 prices. The contribution of the Australian Governco-operative ment is expected to be around $ 1,500m. As can see, Mr Speaker, if the Commonwealth conFor tinues to make a 30 per cent grant, it will that on current prices this Federal Government in Canberra will be assisting local government and semi-government authorities throughout Australia by nearly one-third of the amount required-nearl y $500m. Area Improvement Programs Area improvement programs are directed to specific regions where we have decided to concentrate assistance for social and economic are reasons, and because major deficiencies exist. We aim to give these regions a better Uving as an environment and to improve forward planning. misThe programs are developed in co-operation with regional organisations of councUs and the respective State governments. They aim at linkthe ing aU 3 levels of government and community in groups together in a co-operative venture. The programs also seek to tie in with established sources of grants or subsidies avaUable through the other Federal Government programs. In some cases the specific funds made avaUable under the program help to complement funds committed by State and local governments and other Australian Government departments. My Department will work to ensure that the of aU Australian Government departof ments involved in area improvement program regions take place within the framework of an the overaU regional development strategy. Grants are earmarked for designated projects or for a designated group of activities. Projects to receive these grants are agreed upon fromtimeto time by a Minister representing the State Government and myself. In 1973-74 the program operated in 2 regions, one in the western suburbs of Sydney, another in the western suburbs of Melbourne. These were regions with particular deficiencies in community services and a living be disenvironment which compared unfavourably with other parts of Sydney and Melbourne. Subto States' agreement, the program wiU be extended in 1974-75 to 11 more regions. These regions may be undergoing severe growth pressures or are victims of imbalances in social For a variety of other reasons the living environment in these regions might not have be made reaUsed its full potential. In 1974-75 the Australian Government proof poses to spend $ 14.1m on area improvement programs. Of this amount $ 13.5m is covered by this Bill. The balance relates to programs begun last year and appropriated elsewhere. An area improvement program is intended to encourage involvement of citizens and governyou ments in regional planning and advancement. this reason it involves an element of pubUc mean education in urban and planning issues. Area improvement program funds will also help to rectify defects in parklands and open space, in drainage and waterways, in efficient garbage disposal systems, in community facUities such as haUs and Ubraries. The programs represent one element of the Australian Government's commitment to increasing the status of local government As part of its overall concern with the problems of cities the Australian Government is also concerned about the burdens carried by local government. It accepts the need for some reshaping of the way in which local government operates. The Government has already begun at a number of points to remedy these problems. Programs now helping local government include direct financial assistance to local government through the Grants Commissionthrough which we granted, again in interest free non-repayable grants, this year $56.3m-growt h centres, urban and regional budget programs, local government informationfile,regional programs and the area improvement program. With the permission of the House I shall conclude my remarks on the area improvement program by having incorporated in Hansard a list of the 13 regions to benefit from the program and the help each will get",52

129,Mr UREN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE,"I thank the House. I shall now deal with the national estate National Estate The objectives of this program are to preserve and enhance land and buildings of beauty and historic, environmental or scientific interest heritage for the Australian people. Last financialsevere year 101 programs were approved totalling more than $2.2m. This year $8m will be made availond able for the national estate program. Of that amount $5,748,000 is provided by this Bill. The balance is for programs begun last year, grants aid, and national estate projects in the 2 tories. An Interim Advisory Committee on the National Estate has been set up on the recomintegrate mendation of the Hope Inquiry, pending a Bill create an Australian Heritage Commission. officers together with officers of the Interim mittee of the Australian Heritage Commission have started discussions with each State on the projects to be included in this year's program. Submissions have also been sought by advertisegiven ment and personal representation from nonin government bodies and private individuals. For too long we have permitted the bulldozer menfinancial tality to prevail. Our Government will preserve for posterity things that were created by man or nature that are unique and beautiful. I regard this program as a key part of the Governwhich ment's urban and regional development policies. Urban and Regional Water Supply Schemes aU, Water is a significant input in overall urban services. The role of my ministry in this program is twofold: Firstly, to promote improved water management; secondly, to integrate the prothe House. vision of water with overall urban and regional planning against the background of the ment's national water policy. Assistance for adjourned. Adelaide's treatment scheme and the north-west Tasmanian regional water supply scheme are important parts of this approach. Both effective solutions to pressing problems. Adelaide's water comes from local catchments and the River Murray. Both are contaminated and the city's water supply falls far short of international standards for bacteriological and chemical quality. An amount of $4.4m will be Works made available thisfinancialyear on the same liamentary basis as for the national sewerage program-that which is, 30 per cent interest-free, non-repayable, strucuon grants and the rest a loan at the long term bond Victoria. rate. The allocations for sewerage in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia are approximately $34m, $34m, $14m and $15m, respectively, while South Australia will receive approximately $3m. This points up the efforts of the South Australian Government in adequately sewering its own urban areas, at the expense of earlier improvement of water supplies. of Priority in the program of treatment works will as a be given to Hope Valley and Chandler where decline in the quality of water has been encountered. Hope Valley also services the seclargest number of consumers and it will be possible to secure substantial benefits in a short time. The program will be extended in the years in ahead to remove the blight of poor quaUty for TerriAdelaide consumers. The North West Tasmania regional water supply scheme is designed to the present activities of 8 local govern to ments and 10 separate water supply schemes. At My present the water is contaminated and Cominsufficiently treated. There is no transfer capacity between the different schemes and rationing has been needed in the past. The total cost is currently $ 10.5m over the next 6 years. We have the Tasmanian Government an agreement principle to support the work. I anticipate that funds will be aUocated early in 1975 or 1975-76 year following the planning and design seek to stage to be completed this year. This completes my outline of the programs come within the scope of this Bill. The Bill is an historic one. It is a major tribute to the growth of co-operation and consensus between the 3 levels of government in Australia.

130,Mr LES JOHNSON,PUBLIC WORKS," I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Committee Act 1969-1974, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the ParStanding Committee on Public Works and on the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Conof an Australian radiation laboratory at Yallambie, The proposal is to provide a facility to house the Australian Radiation Laboratory, which has the functions of maintaining standards for the precise measurement of ionising radiation and of radioactive substances; procuring and distributattended ing radio-pharmaceuticals; mamtaining a surthe veillance of the levels of radioactivity in the environment; and providing a consultancy vice on the protection of people against various radiations. The Laboratory also provides an visory service on the physical aspects of medical radiology. The building will be a precast reinforfrom ced concrete frame structure with external prelaboratory cast infill panels. Windows will be PVC coated steel with double glazing. Roofing will be insulated metal decking supported' on steel beams and purlins. The bunding will be air confacUities, ditioned, with supporting engineering road works and car parks. Special attention be paid to landscaping of the site. The estimated cost of the proposed work when referred to the Committee was $3.6m at July 1974 prices. The Committee concluded that the present acthe commodation of the Australian Radiation Labtorate, oratory was unsatisfactory and that it should be relocated in premises specifically designed meet its particular requirements, that the selected was suitable, that the building design would specifically cater for the particular requirements of the laboratory and would capable of future expansion if necessary, that proposed landscaping would more than compencharacter. sate for the small number of trees to be removed during construction, that the disposal of low radioactive liquid waste will follow recognisedarea practices, that the radiation protection standards provided will ensure that the level of any radiarea ation emissions will not be greater than 1 /100 the acceptable dose level, and that the work should proceed to construction. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in acestablishments cordance with therecommendationsof the the Committee.",58
131,Mr MCKENZIE,PUBLIC WORKS,"As the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) has said, the Ausby tralian Radiation Laboratory which is to be structed in my electorate under the motion which is before the House is to maintain standards the precise measurement of radiation, to procure and distribute radio-pharmaceuticals and to maintain a surveillance of the levels of radio tivity in the Australian environment. When theas proposal wasfirstmooted various organisations and people in my electorate were concerned, first of all, about the possibUity of radiation and, secondly, about the aesthetics and planning of the area. I have had an opportunity to study the evidence which was given to the Parliamenfor tary Standing Committee on PubUc Works. I meetings of the Committee and heard answers which were given by, among other people, Mr Stevens, who is the Director of the serAustraUan Radiation Laboratory, and I am satisfied in my own mind that the levels of radiadation from the proposed estabUshment are such that there is no measurable danger to people radioactivity In fact, the resiting of the from the present buildings is to the advantage of the community insofar as the new buUding will be of such a design and character that, if there was any concern about the existing there would be no concern about the services, new buUdings. will I have some reservations about the planning aspects of the buUding. Perhaps honourable members would not be aware that in the area of my electorate where it is proposed to construct Laboratory, and in fact over most of the electhere is very little industry of any character. The site of the proposed buUding is into an area under the control of the Army in the site Watsonia army camp. It is presently headquarters of the Royal Australian Corps of Signals for the whole of Australia. There are a number of be buUdings which can roughly be regarded as the buildings of an industrial or commercial These are set well back on the site. One of the objections which I have personally to level the actual site which has been chosen from the avaUable is that I feel that more thought could have been given, if we were to use that of land for such an establishment, to siting of the buUding further away from existing residential development and in fact away from the boundaries of the area. The buUdings which are occupied by the Army, some of which are of considerable extent, are well away from residential and give no offence. In fact I take opportunity of congratulating the Army for the way in which it has developed the site. I believe that this area needs to be considered the relevant authorities, perhaps the Departcon-ment of Defence, and an overall plan drawn up for its eventual development. At one end of the for site houses were recently constructed for Army personnel. I am somewhat concerned that over a period oftimeareas of this land may be used for acall sorts of government purposes until such time it is eaten up entirely without leaving any breathing space, which I think is needed in that part of the Melbourne metropolitan area. I leaks would ask the relevant departments and the relevant Ministers to look at this aspect. I have made representations to the Minister Health (Dr Everingham), whose Department has made the necessary recommendations on the establishment of this Laboratory, asking that other sites which I felt were not considered by either the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the Department itself be looked at. The Minister has obtained a report from the Department as to the possibility of siting the proposed buildings north of the Tullamarine Airport In answer to the question which I asked in the House on Tuesday morning the Minister said that the matter had been looked at and that it was felt that the disadvantages of the site north of Tullamarine outweighed the advantages. I am not altogether convinced about this. I feel that because of the proximity to the freeway of the area north of Tullamarine Airport perhaps that site would have been better. I seek the permission of the House to have incorporated in Hansard the question I asked and the answer given.",59

The Minister will be aware of the repon tabled House recently of the Parliamentary Standing Committee Public Works concerning the proposed radiation laboratory. He will be aware also of [he concern felt stituents about the project. there has been an evaluation of the suggestions which I have made regarding the siting of the laboratory? If so, what has been the outcome of that consideration?",60
134,Dr EVERINGHAM,PUBLIC WORKS,"The honourable member for Diamond VaUey has made representations to me concerning this matter. He will be aware of a Press release on the subject which pointed out that the siting was discussed by an allParty committee of this House-the Parliamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works. That Committee conducted extensive investigations of the proposal, including public hearings on 12 and 13 September last. The departments concerned gave evidence, as did other interested parties-for example, the Heidelberg City Council and the YaUambie Progress Association. It has it could be sited on a less settled, less inhabited side of Tullamarine Airport, but the Committee had to consider things such as pubUc road access, public transport and the distance from tertiary education institutions and also from the hospitals in Melbourne which oratory. I can assure those who have expressed concern about this siting that the danger will be even less than it is with the present siting of the laboratories in several different buUdings situated around Melbourne. There will be no risk of any significant level. In fact, the risk will be of the order of thousands of times less than that recommended as permissible by world organisations, tinuously, at the boundary fence of the new site day and night.",60
135,Mr MCKENZIE,PUBLIC WORKS,"I thank the House. Through the Department of the Environment and Conservation the Government made available to the Yallambie Progress Association, which was acting for residents in that area, a grant of $ 1,000 to acquire the services of a consultant to examine the project. Consultants from the Preston Institute of Technology were approached and a report was prepared and presented at the hearings of the Public Works Committee. One of the points that I should stress about the radiation situation is that the radiation at this site, even if it could be shown that the background radiation from nuclear tests, say, was of much the same intensity, is not entirely relevant. I would point out to the House that nuclear fallout from atomic tests is of a different character to the sort of radiation that you get from other sources. For example, strontium-90 and various other agents that come from atomic bomb testings are ingested into the system and remain in the body for a long time. The sort of background radiation to which we are all subjected is, generally speaking, of a different character, although the body itself contains naturally occurring radiation. Mr Stevens, Director of the laboratory, in his evidence is pointed out that somebody who travelled in an aircraft for 25 hours a year would receive more radiation than would otherwise be received in a lifetime. I think this evidence needs to be looked for at, because in making a decision on this matter in the we should examine it clearly and in therightaton mosphere. I recognise that the Committee has by some of my conlooked at it in this way. Can he inform the House whether I return to the point that I made before about the siting. I believe that consideration could still be given to it. If evidence can be produced to the Minister about the re-siting of the laboratory, even at this late stage, then it ought to be looked at. I thank both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Housing and Construction, who moved the motion, for their consideration in delaying the moving of it until such time as the other matters which I brought forward have been properly considered. been proposed, for example, that Finally, I would ask permission of the House to incorporate in Hansard paragraphs 55,56 and 57, the section of the report relating to the proposed construction of an Australian radiation use the products of the lablaboratory at Yallambie, Victoria, dealing with radiation, and also the recommendations and conclusions 1 to 8.",60

Radiation: It is perhaps only natural that certain misgivings were expressed regarding the possible effects of radiation on the surrounding population. The Committee therefore sought clarification from the Department of Health as to the levels of radiation emission from the proposed Laboratory. The Committee were advised that the 'dose limit' for members of the public who might receive radiation from a controlled source such as the Australian Radiation Laboratory is established by the National Health and Medical Research Council having regard to the standards of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. 56. The Committee noted with satisfaction that the proposed Laboratory has been designed to incorporate such radiation protection facilities tor of 100 below the recognised 'dose limit' will apply at the boundary fence of the Laboratory. The effect would be that a person to receive a 1/100 of an acceptable level of radiation would need to Uve at the boundary fence 24 hours a day 365 days of the year. Radiation from naturally occurring sources such as cosmic rays would contribute something in the order offivetimesthis level. 57. Committee's Conclusion: The radiation protection standards provided will ensure that the level of any radiation emissions will not be greater than 1/100 of the acceptable dose level. NA 77. The summary of recommendations and conclusions of the Committee is set out below. Alongside each is shown the paragraph in the report to which it refers. 1. The Committee consider that the Autralian Radiation Laboratory's present accommodation is unsatisfactory and that it should be relocated in premises specifically designed to meet its particular requirements. 2. The site selected is suitable for the proposed laboratory. 3. The proposed building has been specifically designed to cater for the particular requirements of the laboratory and will be capable of future expansion if necessary. 4. The landscaping proposed by the Department of Housing and Construction will more than compensate for the small number of trees to be removed during construction. 5. The disposal of low level radioactive Uquid waste will foUow recognised practices. 6. Radiation protection standards provided will ensure that the level of any radiation emissions will not be greater than 1/100 of the acceptable dose level. 7. The Committee recommend the construction of the work in this reference. 8. The estimated cost of the work when referred to the Committee was $3.6m.",60

138,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS,"As the Chairman of the Committee which examined this matter, I think it is very important that some points be made. Two days were spent by the Committee investigating this matter and the tenor of the questions that were asked during the investigation was along the lines of protection of the health and well-being of people who already Uve in the area. The honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie) is to be commended for the way in which he has raised the matter before the House. The proposed laboratory will be constructed in his electorate, and I know from having been present at the hearings and also from other sources since that ume that so that an additional safety facthere is some concern felt by people in that area about the effect of the construction of the proposed radiation laboratory at Yallambie. The honourable member mentioned 2 matters, radiation leaks and landscaping, and he went on to elaborate on both of those. On the question of radiation leaks, the Director, Mr Stevens, was very clearly asked about what sort of dangers existed for the people in the area and the Committee was very conscious of this aspect of the hearing. In terms of radiation as such it was agreed-and I think the Chairman of the Yallambie Progress Association agreed at the hearing-that it was not radiation as such that they were talking about; they were talking about Paragraph the effects of faU-out or radioactive emissions from the laboratory. It was shown in the course of the evidence that most stringent precautions would be taken at the laboratory at Yallambie, far more stringent precautions than exist at the 21 present location of the laboratory in the busy 33 bustling centre of the city of Melbourne. It was found during the course of the inquiry that the emissions into the atmosphere came from chemical cabinets that were not in fact dealing with radioactive materials. It was also found that 40 the other source of escape of emissions was by Uquid waste and there was ample evidence to show that this liquid waste would be treated in a manner that was far more than satisfactory to the 50 various environmental authorities throughout Australia. In fact, the Uquid waste would be 54 treated and finally pumped into the sewerage system of Melbourne, a system which it is expected should operate at some time in the future. At the moment the Uquid waste is pumped into a treatment plant at Martins Lane and 57 then pumped into the Plenty River. 74 I think it is very important to say that the 75 whole function of the laboratory is to protect the community from radiation effects, not to create such effects, and the laboratory spends most of its time measuring the effects of radiation. For example, it takes, daily, samples of mUk from around Australia and samples of radioactive fallout in the community from around Australia and it measures the radioactivity of both of those products in the laboratory. So the laboratory is not there to extend radiation in the community, but is there to shield the community against background radiation and to measure accurately the amount of radiation present in the things that it measures. Radiation leaks can happen only through either air or water emissions; there other way in which these leaks can occur. The emissions come from an area other than the areacould being used for activides which produce radioacfor tivity, and the radioactivity in the liquid or emissions is down to an extent where it is far lower than the level acceptable to all authorities in Australia, and indeed by authorities around the world. There is absolutely no fear of there being any effect whatsoever on the surrounding populace from the establishment of the laboraconstructed tory at Yallambie-o r should I say the location the laboratory, because it is not an establishanywhere ment. The laboratory already exists in a very densely populated part of Melbourne. There been no evidence and there have been no reportsremoved that anybody in Melbourne has suffered any effect whatsoever from the present activities the laboratory. It is inconceivable that a person of the standing of Mr Stevens could be challening ged on his qualifications in this area of protectingin the community from the effects of radiation. quaUfications cannot be chaUenged by anybody. This person gave the Committee unequivocal them. evidence on oath that there was absolutely no danger to the surrounding community from the activities of the laboratory. Tbis was put very clearly before the Committee in evidence. those people in the community who wish to ped-scapes dle or hawk information that is not actually cor-patible rect are in danger of doing the community great disservice because none of the evidence that we received-ther e are pages and pages of it-gav e an indication to anybody that there any danger. I assure this House that the PubUc Works Committee, which I chair, is not an ponsible Committee. It sees itself in theroleof being a watchdog of the rights of the community. It seems to me,readingthrough the reports of that Committee, that this has always been its role. I only hope that I can fulfil the role of being the champion of that sort of watchdog concept, because I believe that is the role of the PubUc Works Committee. Everybody had the opportunity to give evidence. We speak of landscaping in our report. partment The land is owned by the Australian ment and, according to aU the planning schemeswhich was avaUable to on that we saw, is set aside for military purposes. I would be negligible. The Committee do not know that the fact that it is set aside forconclusion not on the hysterical, emotional militaiy purposes necessarily means that be used as a rifle range. I would rather think that of on occasions the military would choose to use part of this land to construct buUdings. This reference came to the attention of community because the project will exceed in cost $2m. Had the cost been less than that, is noDepartment of Defence could have erected a airrow of nissen huts made of galvanised iron. It have erected them on its own land which is its own use, as all of the planning schemes tell waterus. In that case the local residents would have had no opportunity to object. It is said in the evidence that those who Uve adjacent to this land were satisfied that the Australian Government and the Defence Department had shown a great deal of concern for their neighbours and had buUdings that their neighbours had of found to be satisfactory. There is no mdication in the evidence that the proposed building will be abhorrent. Great play was made has of the fact that 40 trees would have to be to aUow for the construction of the buUding. Nothing was said about the 1,000 of native trees that would be planted to replace them. If people are going to talk about destroythe environment they had better start talking terms of the truth and the facts. Instead of Histalking about 40 trees being destroyed they should talk about the 1,000 trees that will replace On the question of landscaping, the Australian Government, through its departments, has gone So to great expense to employ professional landto ensure that the area will not be incomwith the neighbouring areas. In fact, the a landscaping will commence at about the same time as the construction of the buUding. So as the foundations for the buUding are being laid, trees is shaU be planted. If there are 40 trees to be removed, there wiU be a 1,000 trees planted in irrestheir place at the sametime.A great deal of attention has been given to separating the perhaps inhospitable paved areas used for car parking from the rather natural, bushlike area surrounding the site at the moment. This will all go hand in hand. In fact, banks of the order of, I think, 3 metres in height are to be built around the car parking areas to hide them from the view of those people who live in the adjacent area. Every attention has been given by every demight that gave evidence to the dangers that exist for the people who Uve nearby. The GovernCommittee determined, it, aU of the information that these dangers came to this inforit wiU mation given by people who were not quite their facts but on the advice of people suchsure the director of the laboratory and other scientistsas acknowledged not only in Australia but also the internationaUy. On their advice the Committee found that there was no danger to the surroundthe ing residents. The Committee decided that what was said by all those people who live nearby said on an emotional and not on an entirely tual basis. The Committee found for a variety ofincongruous. reasons that the site is desirable. As the honouranybody able member for Diamond Valley (Mr these MCKenzie) says, these reasons have been is outlined. In reply to a question asked by the pany- ' honourable member the Minister for Health Everingham) has said why he believes the site desirable. The Committee came to the same con-expired. clusion, namely, that of all of the sites which were proposed this is the most desirable. The overall plan for the development of the Army land is something, I suppose, for the Defence Department. In all honesty, I must say that the Department of Defence did not give evidence to the Committee, but a plan was made available the Committee. This plan is dealt with in the transcript of evidence. The plan which was made available to the Committee showed the future development of that land. I believe that those who were present at the Committee hearings those 2 days when the plan was before the Com-that mittee did take note of the planned development by the Department of Defence. As in aU matters, an owner of land can do what he likes with that land provided he abides with aU of the ordinances and regulations to prescribed by the local authorities. The evidence shows that the Commonwealth departments did abide by such ordinances and regulations even though there is no statutory requirement for Aus-erly traUan Government departments to do so. Howtive ever, they went out of their way to ensure that their proposals did come within the scope of ordinances and regulations and they planned within the confines of those ordinances and regulations. But it is true that anybody who land can do what he likes with that land build how he likes on that land. required to consult his neighbours as to the sort of buUding that he wants to erect, provided, said, that he does not breach any of the local buUding ordinances.

139,Mr LES JOHNSON,RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS,"in reply-The proposed construction of an Australian radiation laboratory at YaUambie, Victoria, has been the subject of continued interest by the honourable tomember for Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie). I have studied very carefully the papers associated with this matter, including the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and I think I am able to say in answer to on the honourable member for Diamond Valley any cause for anxiety which he may have had in respect of environmental matters and things of that sort, including danger from radiation, can be removed from his mind and the minds of the people in that region. I believe that every possible consideration has been extended the welfare of the residents there. I know that the views of progress associations, the local councU, the Centre for Environmental Studies and the Institute of Technology have been taken propinto account. I have in front of me a perspecof the proposed project. It is extremely aesthetic. It is a very modern, contemporary style suchbuUding which has a fine break-up of contours. As the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) has said, there are to be 1,000 native ownsshrubs and 1,000 trees planted around it. It and seems to me that it is going to represent a He is not desirable development. as II thought I should mention the other sites that were taken into account, since this question was raised by the honourable member for Diamond The report I have in front of me says that, in particular, consideration was given to sites at Broadmeadows, Bundoora and Keilor and the in Tullamarine and Essendon airport areas as well as to sites at the Watsonia Army Camp. Certain criteria were laid down which had to be met. These concerned the fact that the laboratory me needed ready access to Tullamarine airport for the receipt and dispatch of radio-pharmaceuwasticals for medical diagnosis and treatment Australia and that it was also essential to consider its location with respect to the hospitals in Melbourne, which at present are the using and which in future will be using the important scientific services that this facility vides. The disadvantages of the other sites meninternal tioned included vibration, high noise levels to aircraft, remoteness from the hospitals which use the scientific services of the laboratory and the lack of road access and of public transport. Taking all those criteria into account the site Yallambie proved to be by far the most suitable one. I wanted to say that because it was not just matter of picking this site because by the Commonwealth but because in so many respects it had a very significant advantage the other locations. As afinalremark I would like to offer this ment: I know that some concern was felt by residents about possible radioactive effects. have in front of me the following comment which I think came from the report of the Public Works Committee: The Committee noted with satisfaction that the design the proposed laboratory incorporated radiation protection faculties such that an additional safety factor of 100 applicable to the dose limits laid down by the NH and the International Commission on Radiological tion. The effect of this safety need to live at the boundary fence 24 hours a day 365 the year to receive one-hundredth of the above dose limits. So one can say that the possibility of anybody being adversely affected is infinitesimal. This project represents a very great development for Australia. It is a $3.6m project. It is long overdue. I think that in time to come the honourable member for Diamond Valley will be able to establish that there have been no adverse effectsshould suffered by the people whom he so effectively represents in this Parliament Question resolved in the affirmative.

140,Mr LES JOHNSON,RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969-1974, it is expedient the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of an animal health laboratory at Geelong, Victoria. The facility is required to provide a complete integrated diagnostic service and as a vaccine testing and production facility in the event major exotic disease-for example, foot mouth disease or other highly virulent virusestographic penetrating Australia's quarantine barriers. struction of the major elements will be of ced concrete, partly poured in situ and partly pre-cast panels. Other elements will be of brick construction. An insulated pre-cast concrete panel sun screen will be provided probuilding. Epoxyfinisheswill be employed on walls. Highly specialised and sophistidue cated engineering systems-for example, mechanical, electrical and hydraulic services-wil l be installed to cope with the stringent design criteria of microbiological security to specified areas. at Conventional air conditioning and engineering services will be used in non-hazardous areas. The a site will be fully landscaped with an internal road it was owned system and car parks. The estimated cost of the proposed work when over referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works was $56m at March com1974 prices. The updated and reappraised estithe mate presented to the Committee was $67m. The I Committee concluded that there was a need for the facUity, that the proposal was economicaUy justified, that the 'box within a box' principle of design of the laboratory will ensure of microbiological security, that the proposed functions of the laboratory are appropriate, that the will be precautions taken to prevent the escape of infecand MRC tious disease viruses have been based on and are Protecan improvement on measures which have been factor is that a person would days of successful in a number of simUar laboratories overseas, that after a suitable period the laboratory should be authorised to handle the foot and mouth disease virus prior to an outbreak of the disease in this countiy, that the site is suitable and that the work should proceed to construction. The Committee also concluded that the construction and establishment of the laboratory proceed as a matter of urgency. This will be done. Upon the concurrence of the House in this motion, detaUed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",64
141,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIF F PROPOSALS," I move: Customs Tariff Proposals No. 16 (1974). Customs Tariff Proposals No. 16 (1974), which I have just tabled, give effect to the Government's decisions on recommendations made by the Tariff Board in its report on photographic and cinematographic apparatus and by the Industries of a Assistance Commission in its report on food and processing machinery. The report on phoand cinematographic apparatus was Conreceived prior to 19 July 1973 and the duties reinforadopted by the Government are those recommended by the Tariff Board less the 25 per cent tariff cut. This will mean that a rate of 15 per cent will apply to the majority of goods of the over the main type made in Australia. The Government has accepted the recommenthree-tiered dations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on food processing machinery and a result mmimum rates of duty will apply to maimportant chinery for working bread grains, cereals or dried leguminous vegetables or for the proquaUty duction of pasta products; a general rate of per cent will apply to machinery for sugar facture, brewing and confectionery and chocutions olate manufacture; and a general rate of 25 cent will apply to other food processing machinmental ery covered by the report. The Proposals provide for the elimination of duties on certain items of imitation jewellery which are included in Schedule 'A' of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, together with several minor changes of an administrative nature. The new duties will operate from tomorrow. A prehensive summary of the changes and the duty rates is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals.

143,Mr LYNCH,LOCAL GOVERNMENT GRANTS BILL,"The Bill bewages fore the House seeks authorisation for the payment of $56,345,000 to local government bodies during 1974-75. The grants proposed by legislation are identical to those recommended by the Grants Commission in chapter 5 of report on financial assistance for local governrepresents ment. The Opposition supports this legislationnot because it represents an adequate response thefinancialproblems of local government, because the funds proposed will be of assistance to those municipal bodies which are at a comAssociation parativefinancialdisadvantage. This debate provides an appropriate opporciple tunity to reiterate the Opposition'sfirmcommitlocal ment to the importance of local government Australia. We believe that the maintenance of a Council. structure of government in Austrahan is essential. There is no doubt that an as effective system of local government can play an part in increasing our standard of living and in achieving substantive changes in the of the community environment. Local 15 government has a capacity to achieve local conmanusensus and to provide community based solto local problems. It permits increased per individual involvement in Australia's governprocess and encourages diversity and also imagination in what is regrettably an increasingly standardised society. Local government provides protection against the bureaucratic forms of over-centralised administration. In short, it represents a practical expression of the decentralised form of democracy which is a comfundamental aspect of my Party's platform. The economic viabUity of Australian local government has, of course, been devastated by Government's gross economic mismanagement. The Government's monetary policy has raised the cost of local government borrowings COMMISSION by an unprecedented margin and severely restricted the avaUabUity of funds for councU proThese facts were well documented as long ago as June this year by the Leader of the Oppopre-sition.

No Second Reading aggregated statistics are avaUable from the Federal Government with respect to the increased costs now being incurred by local government. Nevertheless, major councUs such as the Melbourne City Council are facing increases in their and salary bUls of around 50 per cent. In my own electorate of Flinders, the Frankthe ston Council has reported to me that its estimated payroll for 1974-75 wiU be $2.5m its first compared with $1.4m in 1972-73. This an increase of around 79 per cent during a 2-year period. Many councUs have reported to even larger increases in respect of their capital but works programs. This week the Leader of the Opposition met a deputation from the Municipal of Victoria which drew his attention to the impact which the Federal pacesetter prinis having in terms of its flow on effect to government- a problem which has also in been emphasised to me by the Frankston City Unlike the Federal Government, local governfinancial ment is not a beneficiary-in the revenue senState se-of inflation. Local government in Australia unable to insulate itself from inflation in the sence of a growing revenue base. It cannot expected to meet the increase in its financial liabihties arising from inflation simply by ing compensatory increases in its rates and charges. But, because of the general revenue assistance provided to the States, State governments are unable to provide an adequate level of funds to local government during 1974-75. Funds made available to local government, either directly or indirectly by of section 96, will in no way provide adequate compensation. As a consequence, local governgraph ment rates will increase by varying amounts to around 35 per cent thisfinancialyear. This an excessive burden on Australia's ratepayers and it will contribute materially to the cost-push process of inflation. It must be emphasised that local government taxes, such as property rates, are not related to an individual's capacity to In many instances increases in property values have-and therefore in assessable rates-fa r stripped increases in incomes. This is especially true with respect to retired persons on fixed incomes. There is, therefore, no inbuilt this area of taxation to provide equity as taxpayers. Furthermore, a growing proportion services required of local governments is resident rather than ratepayer oriented. In those circumconcept stances, ratepayers are being asked to contribute local a disproportionate degree of local government conducive revenue. The Opposition believes that there is an urgentgovernment. need to establish an advisory council of interreport governmental relatioins to examine the problems which arise between the 3tiersof government Australia. We also believe that a national inquiryexpanded, to investigate and report on local government finance should be instigated. Both the inquiry and the on-going advisory councU would provide a real basis for action to meet many of the financial difficulties now arising in the area of local government in Australia. The Opposition suports the appUcation of thefiscalneed principle local government This principle,firstenunciated by the Grants Commission in 1936 with respect to State governments, is clearly set out in section 6 of the Act. Nevertheless, we do not believe thatto this principle can be properly appUed by Grants Commission to the 902 local government bodies throughout Australia. In view of this, we believe that there is a need to establish, in operation with State governments, Grants missions within each State to determine the requirements of local councUs on a by State basis. Local government grants is commissions already operate in New South ab-Wales and Western Australia for the purpose of be distributing funds provided by those State governments. The Queensland Premier announseekced his Government's intention to establish a State grants commission during his policy speech inadequate level of on 4 November. The Federal Grants Commission does not now have, and is unlikely to develop in the future, the capacity to make the type of detaUed financial way assessment required. Although the Commission was subject to a limitation oftimethis year, para2.11 of its report notes that the Comup missioners were unable to undertake any sysistematic inspections of local government areas. With due respect to the Commissioners, it is simply not possible for a Federal instrumentality to fulfil this function satisfactorily. Paragraph 3.9 of the Commission's report adverted to its depay.cision to base its recommendatiions on an assessment of the relativefiscalneeds of individual outlocal governing bodies rather than on the needs of regional groupings. This was contrary to the submissions of the Treasury, the Department of system inUrban and Regional Development and the betweenStates of Tasmania and South Australia. of The Opposition Parties will not support the of regionalism imposed on Australian government simply on the ground that it is to administrative efficiency insofar as the Federal Government is concerned. The issues raised in chapter 3 of the Commission's report are, in fact, critical to the futurefinancingof local It is clear from the Commission's that it accepts the need for assessment of individual local government bodies. It is also in clear that the Commission, unless vastly has no real capacity to perform this function on a satisfactory basis. However, I believe that no alteration to the existing method of financing, provided for by this legislation, is warranted without the creation of local government grants commissions such as those now operating in New South Wales and Western Australia, and to the commission proposed by Queensland. If funds are to be provided to State governments to achieve thefiscalequalisation of local government there must be State authorities established assess the relativefiscalneeds of local govern the ment. Federal funds granted on a needs basis must be treated separately to other forms of financial assistance to local government. It is true coto say that much of the confusion now surroundComing the Grants Commission's local government responsibUities arises from a misconception of its role. Paragraph 3.4 of the Commission's report states, inter aha: In a general sense, the purpose of the financial assistance being recommended for local governments is to enable governing bodies to functon, by reasonable effort, dard not appreciably below the standards of other bodies. The funds, therefore, are not a substitute for revenue raised by councils or for assistance vided by Stage governments. While they will assist in achieving a greater degree of fiscal equaUty as between individual councUs, they can in no way be seen as part of a program to deal with the general inadequacy of local government finances. Australian local government has suffered ditionalfinancialproblems in the past 12 months. These problems derive principaUy from the credit squeeze and from the proOn portionate decline in general revenue, as opposed to specific purpose revenue, provided State governments. Payments made to local government by the States derive substantiaUy from the general revenue assistance of the Fedsocial eral Government. Althoughfinancialassistance to the States increased by over 38 per cent for 1974-75, the increase in general revenue funds was 22 per cent. Specific purpose funds now represent 44 per cent of Federal advances pared with 22 per cent in 1972-73. Given the present rate of inflation and the high cost of rowing, this trend has severely depressed flow of real funds to local government. The Fed-resources. eral Government has not made complementary adjustments with respect to local government by way of section 96 grants or by way of direct grants to local government bodies. Payments made directly to local government for aged permissions sons homes, deUvered meals, home nursing, fiscal sheltered employment, Aborigmal advancement and local aerodromes amount to $9.1m. Payensure ments made under section 96 for home care, regional organisations, area improvement, vision sewerage, community facUities, and through the Grants Commission amount to $85.8m. Includible ing the $2m made to local government in the Northern Territoiy the Budget Papers indicate that $96.9m is to be provided for local governlocal ment directly by the Federal Government during 1974-75. Thisfiguredoes not include payments for such programs as the Regional Employment Development Scheme or the Australian Assistoffinancerequires ance Plan as the Government was unable to provide expenditure estimates in the Budget Papers. According to the Australian Bureau of Statnow istics, during 1972-73 total funds avaUable local government authorities amounted to Party $938.8m; 53 per cent of those funds were derived from taxes and fees 19 per cent from State grants and 18 per cent from borrowings. This Ulustrates local the extent to which local government is depenat a standent on its own revenue and loan raising calocal pacity. It also highlights a further associated problem-that of debtfinancingand debt redemption. Debt financing charges account for proin excess of 10 per cent of local government financing. If total debt redemption is considered-the repayment of both principal and interest-it amounts to around 20 per cent calculated as a proportion of funds avaUable. These figures differ slightly from the 15 per cent quoted by the Grants Commission in respect of debt servicing for 1972-73. The difference arises from the admethods of assessment adopted by the Bureau course of the and the Commission. the expenditure side, two significant features deserve comment. First, more than 60 per to cent of local government expenditure is directed towards capital items. Second, local government is playing an increasing role in the provision of welfare, recreational and cultural amenities. It has been a common practice in this country to overlook these two significant elements of local government. If local government is to provide an increasing measure of our community's comphysical amenities and welfare services, as opposed to the more traditional forms of basic boreconomic assistance clearly it requires greater the recourse to the nation's general revenue I have already mentioned my Party's intention, in government, to establish an inquiry into local governmentfinances,an advisory council of inter-governmental relations and grants comwithin each State for the purposes of equaUsation. It is clear, however, that the Federal Government must devise a method to that local government is given access to growth revenue. Our poUcy already makes profor this with respect to State governments. In thefirstinstance, I believe that it will be possto devise an arrangement whereby some proportion of federal funds provided to the States are, in turn, passed on for distribution to government on a per capita basis. This in no way impUes that the States would not maintain the primary responsibility for local government. It is simply a recognition that an adequate level Federal involvement. Our policy intention to devise a more adequate finance base for State and local governments is being examined by a special committee esto tabUshed by the Federal Council of the Liberal during October of this year. This particular matter and a wide number of related questions with respect of local government is being examined in very great detail by a special committee of the Opposition Treasury ComAustraUa's mittee chaired by my colleague, Senator John Carrick. The detailed consultations which SenaThe tor Carrick has undertaken with Austrahan muaddition nicipal authorities on behalf of the Opposition and the most extensive research work which he has undated will provide the basis for the Oppothe sition's definitive policy determination in this on area.

The Federal Government's poUcy taxation of regionalism has been made clear by the Prime the Minister for a long period of time. It new. It is relevant to quote but ments of the Prime Minister, the self-styled LuciAlthough fer of centralism in this country in relation to this in matter. He said: We would not have a Federal system of overlapping parliaments and a delegated but supervised system of local government. We would have a House of Representatives for nationwide and international matters, an Assembly for each of our dozen largest cities, and a few score regional assemblies for the areas of rural production and resources development outside those cities. The Prime Minister's concept of local government is, therefore, a 'few score regional assembUes'. This is the very antithesis of the poUcies advocated by the Opposition Parties. There can be no doubt that the Grants Commission is a device devised by the Labor Party to accelerate the achievement of poltiical centralism in Australia. This is the Labor Party's philosophy. It was reflected in the submissions made to the Commission by the States of Tasmania and South Australia-both Labor States.

Level of Allocation Frankston's pressing needs are far in excess of the allocation made ($235,000), Frankston Council is hardly a position to be over critical of the allocation as it compares quite favourably with the treatment of many other Councils. 3. Basis of Allocation The criteria used in distributing the grants between Municipalities is somewhat obscured, despite the provisions of Section 6 of the Grants Commission Act. It appears from the Grants Commission's First Report (page 34) that the rate of inter censal population growth was the dominating factor in making the allocations. This is not without some merit, particularly in Frankston's case as our growth rate is high but there are many other factors that should not be overlooked. These include Frankston's regional role as a shopping centre, the popularity of its foreshore for swimming and boating, the parking problems associated with railhead, the youthful population and the disadvantaged Pines Forest area. These factors contribute materially to Frankston Council's financial burden and they probably do not apply to the majority of other municipalities with a population growth rate similar to Frankston. 4. The role of the Regional Organisation This is a mystery. In thefirstyear the Regional Organisations were described from Canberra as merely being a post office ing of submissions of individual Councils to Canberra. Despite this unglamorous role, it was fairly Municipality to be part of a grant. The allocations bear this out The regional organisations of ively for the purposes of the Grants Commission Aa, but it now appears that the Australian Government favours these organisations accepting at least some degree of responsibility in relation to other programmes in the field of Urban Regional Development and social welfare (Australian Asrequired sistance Plan). The notion of the Regional Organisations of Councils coming a sort of regional umbrella in respect to the planning and implementation of a wide range of government proGrants grammes has been extemporized by spokesmen while carefully placing on record of laying the foundation for a fourth level of government. Quite apan from these extraneous functions, it also hinted by DURD spokesmen that with the appointment of a new Chairman of the Grants Commission, the role of the Regional Organisation will in future, be much more meanmission ingful than a mere 'post office' for sending on the subinto missions of individual CouncUs. The whole question of the present and future roles of these regional organisations to which CouncUs have needs clarification and a firm policy statement by the Government is required. 5. Use of Grants Commission Allocations According to the preliminary literature produced by DURD and the Prime Minister's telegram of August 23, the allocations from the Grants Commission are to be unconapplication ditional. On the other hand, the Minister Mr Uren has been reported in the National Press as warning misuse of grants. These contradicting statements have caused some dUemna at local level as to the projects or programmes to be financed from the allocation. CouncUs should know whether they have complete discretion to spend the allocations on what they regard as most pressing local need(s), or whether they would be advised to select projects that will make someone in Canvolves berra happy and in the interests of next year's allocation. In discussions by Frankston Council in relation to the spending of the Grants Commission allocation, wonhy projects have been considered. Land purchase for recreation, erection of community buildings and several much needed welfare and youth programmes that would volve the appointment of staff. Worthy though these proreasonable grammes are, Council is naturally Grants Commission funds to any project recurring expenditure when there is no indication whether there will be any grant next year, and if there is, how much. The idea of allocation commitments over a of say 3 to 5 years with provision for adjustment to allow inflation and materially changed local conditions is perhaps wonhy of some thought. The saving at both local and Canberra aration of and processing of annual applications would be enormous, and if there was some guarantee of continuity, Councils would be much more inclined to take on larger projects on recurring programmes. 6.

(b) DetaUed submissions to be forwarded through the important for a Regional Organisation. region otherwise it didn't get a (c) Attending Regional hearings and providing such funher information as may be required by the Grants ComCouncils were set up exclusmission. Regarding item (a)-the Return of Accounting and Other Information-this requires quite lengthy and painstaking exand traction offiguresfrom annual accounts. The returns are to be forwarded to Canberra by November 11 and as the books of accounts are balanced to September 30, the timetable is fairly tight. Although the returns this year are besomewhat more simple than last year, a number of items are stUl far from clear, and more precise information from the Commission would be appreciated to facilitate the of DURD compilation of the return. that there was no intention As regards (b)-the DetaUed Submissions-it is understood that some CouncUs are using Public Relations Consulthas been ants to produce eye-catching presentations.

CouncUs against 7. Gearing up at Local Level The adage that suggests that you should not put new wine in old skins, applies to some extent to local government's present situation in being called upon for the first time to administer new and much larger programmes at the instigation of the Australian Government. Having beentightlycontrolled for so long in respect to the spending the meagre handouts from State Governments, the well notion of untied grants and exciting new programmes inquite some readjustment of thought and outlook at Council table level. In many cases considerable gearing up will obviously be required before new programs can be satisa number of factorily undenaken. I suggest that local government should not be judged too harshly on its early performances in thisfield,and that the inAustralian Government should give it more guidance and a time to respond to the taste of the new responsireluctant to allocate bility. that will involve 8. Recapitulation The idea of a partnership between Canberra and local government to provide financial assistance under the Grants longer period Commission Act is basically sound. for The role of the regional organisations, particularly the possible futureroleis not clear, and accordingly is to some extent suspect. Immediate action should be taken to clarify level in the prepthis position. The effectiveness of regions in this context is a matter for conjecture. Municipalities are by their constitution and role, parochial in their outlook. Councils of adjoining municipalities engage in friendly competition and constantly vie with one another in a genuine attempt to improve local conditions. Some facets of municipal endeavour can certainly be conveniently administered on a regional basis, e.g., library services, outfall drainage (D.V.A.) and town planning. However, in the main, Councils prefer to 'go it alone' and in this respect the compulsory setting up of regions is rather idealistic. The Australian Government should acknowledge this fact and adjust to it. The question of whether or not allocations are completely unconditional should be clarified. The criteria for deciding the level of grants should be clearly stated and re-examined. The idea of grant commitments covering several years rather than one only ought to be investigated. Application procedures should be simplified and firmer guidelines provided to local government. Local government should be given a reasonable time to 'gear up' and adjust to the new relationship and added responsibility. Civic Centre, Frankston. November 11,1974. NA 8 November 1974 The Hon. Phillip Lynch, M.P., P.O. Box 322, Frankston, Victoria 3199. Dear Mr Lynch, I desire to bring to your attention some serious anomalies which have occurred as a result of the Grants Commission allocations for 1974-73. As you are well aware this Municipality did not receive one penny from the Commission and in fact were seriously inconvenienced and considerably 'out of pocket' as a result of the involved and complicated procedures adopted by the Commission. The statistical return required to be submitted prior to the lodgement of applications for funds involved considerable research and took almost three weeks to complete. The cost to the Council was amplified as whilst the Accountant, Rate Collector and myself were engaged in the research and preparation of these returns, other important Council works were consequently neglected resulting in the necessity for overtime payments later to catch up on this work. In addition my valuable time was virtually wasted in later preparing a detailed submission in the form When the above is multiplied by approximately 800, representing the Municipalities throughout Australia, the overall cost to Local Government would have represented a staggering figure. We have been informed that the allocations were assessed on the needs of each Municipality and its ability to raise funds from its taxing sources and that the level of rating was not main criteria. However Commissioner Walls at the hearing of applications indicated that the rate level in the Shire was low, apparently ignoring the fact that the general level of values on which the rate is assessed is some 30 per cent higher than in adjoining Municipalities. I have read with some interest the statement issued by the Commission headed 'Revenue and Expenditure Disabilities in the Provision of Local Government Services', a document of commendable ideals if all factors are thoroughly investigated and assessed in relation to each Municipality making submissions for a grant. However to include accurate information on all matters suggested by the Commission a Municipality would require much larger administrative and research staff than is presently employed. It is the firm view of the Council that the Commission should, in the first instance make a per-capita grant on an equal basis to all Municipalities; after all, every ratepayer contributes to the tax pool from which such grants are obtained. Secondly the Commission should make available to those Municipalities having special needs or disabilities grants calculated on an assessment by the Commission after thorough investigation of all such applications. Whilst we agree that this Municipality may be somewhat more favourably situated than others, we cannot see that the Shires of Flinders and Hastings are so advantageously G. C. Pentland located to justify a nil grant whilst our three immediate adTown Clerk joining neighbours received almost one-third of a million dollars. In view of the fact that this year the Council was forced to increase its rates by 34 per cent to wipe off a deficit of some $130,000 and meet increased costs of services. We hope that the Commission will view our 1975-76 submissions in a more realistic and favourable light. / Yours faithfully, L. A. Walker, Shire Secretary. 11 November 1974. The Honourable P. R. Lynch, M.P. Re: Grants Commission 482 Nepean Highway FRANKSTON 3199. Dear Mr Lynch, NA NA NA OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION ACT 1973 Please find enclosed a copy of the above submission and also a further submission specifically related to a series of questions posed by the Grants Commission early in 1974. You will appreciate that there are many areas of great concern to municipalities such as this which might well form the basis of a submission for such 'topping up' grants. However, during the last period of assessment by the Grants Commission four major topics were selected. These are main drainage works, private street construction, reconstruction of worn residential streets and tourism. of an apphcation for a grant. The level offinancialassistance sought in respect of these items relates to a consideration of need on a continuing yearly basis and therefore the one million dollars applied for should be viewed as an amount capable of making a reasonable initial inroad into the major areas of concern rather than a once and for all solution. However, the lack of adequate guidelines at the time of the first application for fuids did not assist in the formulation of a submission which would necessarily either be consistent with the thinking of other municipalities, or for that matter, with the Grants Commission itself. A subsequent reconsideration of this submission, particularly in view of the fact that private street construction is financed from loans funds rather than general revenue, has led to a change in emphasis in the forthcoming submission, away from private street construction. However, this does not detract from the problems which these streets pose to the Council. The latter continues to provide substantial assistand ance funds for temporary maintenance in the interim period prior to their construcuon in order that access may be proforeseeable vided for essential services. Therefore the particular position of the Shire of Flinders with a legacy of over 160 miles unmade private streets, many quite densely populated and requiring urgent construction is, nevertheless, a financial burden and a distinct area of disadvantage. Moreover this problem is exacerbated by the vasdy tinue increased traffic volumes utilising older tial streets which were only meant to cater for minor volumes of local traffic. In addition, in an area as yet unsewered, with a steadily rising urban populace, the problem of adequate stormwater drainage in a pollution conscious society continues to be major concern. In the field of tourism it is the feeling of this Council that the unique nature of the southern highlighted by the Government's Statement of Planning Policy No. 2, is deserving of special order to ease the burden on ratepayers who currendy pay for many tourist oriented facilities. In this respect the allocation of grants for tourist development by the State Ministry of Tourism in the past has in no way adequately fortius burden. Further submissions to the Grants Commission are now under preparation by the Council in the hope of meeting with more success than hitherto in the obtaining ation grants during 1975. Whilst basically emphasising the topics outlined in the first submission, certain other concern will be introduced, in vironmental protection and the Council's increasing involvement in welfare. As has been previously pointed out in the verbal submission at the Grants Commission hearing, this Shire is in unique position as toresidentpopulation. population of some 16,500, a significant proportion are ceipt of superannuation, on a fixed income or inreceiptof some sort of social security pension. Of these, the far greater number are in the aged bracket, although there are large numbers of one parent families, especially deserted wives who are moving into the area constantly, seeking cheap tion rents. This type of population economic problem. Whilst they are people at mostrisk,they are also the people with restricted incomes. When the economic situation was stable, they were able to Regional manage, but with inflation and erosion of any savings, superresearchers annuation or other pension, their plight is unenviable and tion practically insoluble. The Council is most conscious of this such problem and, whilst it must raise the rate to give revenue to stantial meet rising costs, it is loath to add a further burden to those basis. The whom, in many cases, are unable It must berememberedalso, that a large number of these visionsbeif complemented people are beset by many other difficulties and may be in illtime preserved health or other infirmity and this, coupled with money worpeople who are yearly ries, contributes to an early reached where a broader look should be taken of the Welfare Scheme. This Shire is not only unique in the composition of the offunds population, but is also seriously disadvantaged by its topenvironment ography and geography. Although the Shire is some 125 square miles in area, the bulk oftheresidentialdevelopment is in a ribbon strip fronting the shores of Port Phillip with growth centres intermittently spaced along the length Nepean Highway. Thus a situation is created where a mand for facilities is in each cluster development, instead in one central focal point. Therefore we find six (6) Elderly Citizens' Clubs, seven (7) Infant Welfare Centres, six Pre-school Centres, library service, extensive street lighting so on through the whole gamut of municipal activity. Although grants are available, it would appear that in the future, the Council will be required to provide an estimated $50,000 for another Elderly Citizens' Club and of pressures are mounting for an indoor sporting complex, estimated cost $400,000-grant $150,000. Surely the overburdened ratepayers will not berequiredtofinanceprojects such as these to their funher deprivation. This list could conto the point of tedium, the matters referred to are only constructed residento make the point. Of recent date, a Welfare Officer was appointed to the Shire and he is undertaking a study of the critical areas. It has already become evident that this municipality, in common with many others, is faced with a major social problem, of more particularly severe in this area because of the retired person. It is vital that in the near future the following projects be Mornington Peninsula, undertaken: (1) A Meals-on-Wheels service be instituted on a larger financial assistance in scale. (2) A Community Health Centre be established. (3) A Geriatric Hospital Wing to be attached to the compensated Southern Peninsular Hospital. (4) A Geriatric Day Care Centre be opened. (5) The Home Help Service be expanded (at present of equalisattending 180 homes per week).

However, recognition represents empty if well meant idealism, Government land purchase notwithstanding, without subfunds to bring this idealism to reality on a continuing increasing complexity of planning controls must to meet an increased rate. surely by well thought out man made prothe very uniqueness of this area is to be at the one yet made available for all those thousands of drawn to the area. demise. The point has now been In thisrespectthere can be no better placed authority than the Council to achieve these aims if only an adequate supply were made available. Already this Council is deeply financially involved in measures to protect or enhance the often at very high cost. Since 1962 the development of a highly sophisticated Bay Planning Scheme has aimed at properly channelling the of development sector of the local economy without sacrificing dethe character of the Southern Mornington Peninsular. of Indeed, the initiation of the Western Port Regional Planning Authority has not decreased the Council'sfinancialcommit(6) ment to town planning but has actually increased it. Moreover, the cost implicit in this vital area is greatly increased if one considers the high price of legal fence of the Planning Scheme to say nothing of the very stantial direct subsidy to the Western Port Regional Planrelates ning Authority itself. At the design and contructional level our environmental awareness has influenced for example construction with the initiation of more attractive street design. In an effort to preserve indigenousfloraand particuquestions lar landscape features this municipality has pioneered curviably linear road alignment which in certain cases has even been combined with environmentally selected coloured pavement aggregates and colour tinted roll-over kerbing and nelling. This re-thinking of traditional to road design but involves a wide spectrum of concepts from toilet blocks to public furniture. However, it would be unrealistic to expect that every one of these developments can be achieved for the same price as the more traditional solutions to these problems. In a more direct sense Council's commitment to the environment has led to a continuing program for the cation of noxious weeds from road reserves and parklands which in the case of South African Boneseed has become urgent as it is costly. Also, massive tree replanting have been undertaken throughout the shire, in particular the enhancement of parkland, road reserves or in special projects such as the Rye reclamation project. Perhaps such activides are grams are nevertheless extremely important. The worth projects such as dune stabilisation, erosion control renourishment, is neither heralded by fanfare helpful public commentary but been continuing since long before environmentalism became a catch phrase. This Council is engaged in certain specific projects bear a direct relationship to our quality of life yet themselves have been unrecognised in the environmental field. A prime example is the tions now in operation in Dromana, Sorrento and Flinders. Development by the Flinders Shire Council and established at considerable initial cost this system has relieved payers and visitors of the one-time proliferation garbage tips and their degrading ment. The continuing operation of this system is sorbed by ratepayers who in this context must pay the of breaking with traditional and inadequate solutions benefit of all those who visit the area. It is perhaps repetitious to continue this catalogue of the costs to the local community of environmental protection, however, in an area held by so many respected of scenic individuality and so needful of preservation, in which the future Government rate revenue even further, it must surely be recognised the case forfinancialassistance in the years to come very strong indeed. However, the disappointing results from the first of the Grants Commission naturally surround any plication with an aura of doubt unless precise reasons original failure can be obtained. nation by the Grants Commission and an unfulfilled promise of explanation by an officer of the Department of Regional Development, no detailed and precise reasons this Council's failure have been forthcoming.

Without grants from the Grants Commission local government bodies in my electorate would never and will never have sufficient funds to provide a decent range of municipal services which every Austude trahan citizens by right should receive. I am honoured to be thefirstspeaker from the Government side in this debate. In my opinion the Grants Commission at long last is fulfilling the very purpose of its existence by making grants to local governments. The stated objective of the Grants Commission is to ties between States and thereby inequalities tween citizens in various States. But until Grants Commission has never been allowed to play its full role. As aresultof this Bill introduced by the Labor Government the Grants ComLabor mission will be able to make grants to local government The States which complain of starby vation from Canberra are insensitive to the needs of local government which is their own creation. They have welcomed many millions of dollars that the Grants Commission has allocated to themselves but they have turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to the needs and the cries of local government I cannot understand Opposition members who continually draw attention to the plight of government bodies but who, when a national Government sets out to do something about the problem, put every obstruction in the way of that Government and even spend campaign financeto to confuse people and to try to make them lieve that what the Government is doing is not the best interests of local government. A member of this Parhament would have very poor powers of observation not to realise that many councils have to face cripplingfinancialproblems in order to provide a decent range of municipal services. Local government bodies in the Western Divshires ision of New South Wales have not been able collect overdue rates because of long droughts and a lack of markets for primary industries which have resulted from the actions of the prereceived vious coalition Government as well as the declinthe best interests ing mining operations at Broken Hill due to the must not forget that policies of the previous Government. As a resulting they have had to curtail essential municipal services. I can wellrememberthe period before Labor came to power when every Federal member of Parliament was sick and tired of trying to get financial help for local government. We remember the old shunting treatment and how the Federal Government at that time would say that the provision of funds to local government authorities was a State matter. When an appeal was made the State government would recognise the need and say it was justified but would then say that the Federal Government would not give it thefinance.Let us hope that this sort of attiis gone forever because it should be obvious to anyone interested in the welfare of local government, which is related to the welfare of disadvantaged citizens and_ areas, that the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government and its counterparts in the State governments had no intention of giving any real assistance to reduce inequalilocal government. beDuring the life of the previous coalition now the Government I and my colleagues fought for finance for local government. We were determined to do something about this matter when came to power. I did this not only within the Party but during thereferendumcampaign appearing on television and by using my own personal funds for printing material to support a case for the allocation of loans and grants to local government. During the campaign some shire presidents and mayors supported my efforts and the policy of the Australian Government. Others remained silent. But today it is a different story. Most of the local government bodies in my electorate have written and asked me to express their local appreciation to the Australian Government. Others have conveyed the message verbally. One thing we can be sure of is that no future Liberal Country Party government will have the courage discontinue these grants. Many of the councils bewhich were afraid to come in by the front door in during the referendum campaign are now most vigorous jostlers to queue up to receive this finance. They do not care whether they get it through the front door or the back door. My electorate has done well out of the Grants Commission. I have been asked by grateful and councils to express my appreciation to to the Cabinet and the Austrahan Government. I admit that some local government bodies which large grants have remained silent. This to me seems a short sighted attitude and not in of the citizens of Australia. One the Government is also makgrants under the RED scheme, grants for sport and recreation and grants for Aboriginal advancement and, of course, we still have to feel the full impact of social development under the Austrahan Assistance Plan and the National Estate grants that were spoken of this afternoon. all The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) has stated several times in this House that my electorate has one of the highest job vacancy ratios. He has said that I will never let him forget that fact. I am pleased to say that at thefirstopportunity he has done something about it. I express my thanks to him. My electorThis ate has received a fair share of the grants under the Regional Employment Development omic scheme. I ask those councils and shires that have remained silent to come out and support openly my efforts to have the grants continued. After 23 thirdly, years of Liberal-Country Party Government, our needs are extensive and cannot be met unless these grants continue for a long period. The role that the Labor Government has assigned to local government is the real answer to the charges made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we are trying to bring in centralist federalwhich ism. The grants are spent in any way that local government wishes. This proves that the real danger is not Federal centralism. What the Libexpand eral Party and the Country Party are afraid of is increases that this new co-operation between the national Government and local government will end State centralism. Our aim is to promote equality not only between the States but also between regions. At long last I can say that the Darling electorate has received something like a fair Probably, it is thefirsttimesince the last Labor government was in power.

147,Mr BUNGEY,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,"One clear ture and indisputable fact emerges to anyone looks at the position of local government today. It is that local government is in grave financial30 difficulties. Inflation and the credit squeeze the cause of these difficulties. Local government is in the grip offinancialstarvation. Thus, we are thermore, considering this Bill, which endorses grants recincrease ommended by the Grants Commission for local government authorities, against a background local government authorities in critical positions because of uncontrolled wage increases, rapid rises in costs for materials and machinery, repair services and the like, critical shortfalls in the alisation of borrowing programs and effectively reduced grants for roads through Commonwealth Aid Roads funds. This is the dismal backment ground against which local authorities are workfacUities. ing at the moment This is the background against which this House is approving these grants to local government authorities. bleak outlook is caused by the inability of the Labor Government to exercise sensible econrestraints and sound economic management. We are looking at this Bill against a background in which councils are being forced to consider 3 alternatives. Firstly, to reduce substantially services and new works programs; secondly, to reduce substantially rates or charges; or to lay off men. Let me refer to certain local government authorities in Western Austraha to illustrate the current dire straits of local government. Western Australia local government authorities are not alone in experiencing such difficulties. No doubt during this debate the same story will emerge in respect of other States. In my electorate of Canning, in there are 33 local government authorities, the story is one of savage increases in local government rates. These increases are not to or upgrade services and facUities; they are merely to keep abreast of the vicious in costs incurred by local government authorities because of wage and cost increases. Let me cite some of the rate increases appUed thisfinancialyear by some shires in my electorate. The Armadale-Kelmscott Shire Council has go. increased rates by 52 per cent; the Boddington Shire by 40 per cent; the Brookton Shire Council by 30 per cent; the Corrigin Shire Council by 30 cent; the Gnowangerup Shire Council by 29.8 per cent; and the Kent Council by 64 per to cent. The whole Ust goes on in this way. These are the rate increases for this year. These shires represent the storyrightthroughout the electorate. I expect also that they would mirror the picthroughout Australia. I understand that rate who increases by local government authorities throughout Australia are overaU of the order of to 35 per cent this year. These increases have are taken place directly as a result of the Government's inabUity to manage the economy. Furmany of the shires which I have mentioned are in rural areas and their abUity to rates are inhibited by thetightliquidity position and the poor situation of the grazing of industry for both wool and meat. It would be quite unrealistic and probably irresponsible of local government authorities in grazing areas to increase rates severely when wool prices are rebeing held at below cost of production and beef prices are at their lowest level for many years. The second alternative open to local governis to reduce the provision of services and A deal of this is happening on a voluntary basis as shire councUs prune their programs and expenditures. It is even clearer that more of this wiU happen as thisfinancialyear progresses, as prices and wages continue toriseand as shire councils attempt to balance their budgets for thisstaff financial year. Councils will have no option to retrench employees. Retrenchments by government authorities will increase during the rest of thisfinancialyear and will become nificant factor in increasing the total of the ployment pool. Many retrenchments will not be made voluntarily. They will be forced. In this regard, the failure of the local government authorities to satisfy their borrowing programs will add to the number of people thrown out of work. Let me cite an example from a shire in the electorate of Canning. The shire of Mandurah has in recent years used the full extent of its rowing powers to provide sewerage for the town.

This year the borrowing program is $330,000 and at this late stage in financial year approximately one third only this amount has been raised. The position is clear. Unless this money can be borrowed the work must stop. If so, at least 100 people curping rently employed on the project will be joining unemployed labour pool. This is an area where the unemployment rate is substantial-and where almost $60,000 has been allocated for the RED scheme. The same story emerges if we look at the Stirling City Council- a story which will be by my colleague, the honourable member for these Stirling (Mr Viner), much more forcibly if he gets an opportunity to speak and if the debate not gagged. The Stirling City Council contemlimited plates the dismissal of another 100 employees within the next two or three months if its borrowregion ing program is not realised. It has a loan ceiling of $ 1.7m but to date there is still a shortfall $lm. The cases of Mandurah and Stirling illusmulate trate the point that I am making, that is, massive retrenchments of staff by local government authorities are imminent. In a situation overall unemployment, it is both unnecessary and foolish to force local government authorities into the position that they have to the ever-growing and ever-increasing pool of unemployment. The Government can come back and say that there is the RED scheme-th Regional Employment Development scheme. authorities This scheme does help local government to some worthwhile work. But what is needed is schemes such as the RED scheme and the impact National Employment and Training Scheme to sop up the unemployed, but action to support those councils which will be forced to retrench in the near future because of unparalleled butprice and wage increases and because of grave local deficiencies in borrowing programs. a sigThe position is clear. The Government must unemact to prevent retrenchments in local government before they take place, not to applyfirstaid after the retrenchments have been made. The grants made to local government authorities under this Bill will not significantly alleviate the position. Generally, the grants do not cover the increases in costs incurred by the councils because of inflation. Road funds allocated under the Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation passed earher this year reduced the effective size of local governborment road programs. Local authorities in Western Australia are receiving grants this year equal money terms to the grants received last year. real terms, the grants, eroded by inflation, are CouncUs are restricting their road maintenance and extension programs for this very the reason. Despite increased ratings, these grants ofwUl not even compensate councUs for the rate of inflation or the lower grants in real terms for roads. These grants are supposed to be for topup purposes. In effect, the beaker is leaking the at a faster rate than it can be topped up. There are a number of other carrots being dangled before local government at the moment. These include area improvement schemes, sports and recreation grants, the Australian Assistance Plan, Aboriginal training programs and the Uke. put When one analyses the amounts coming from schemes, it is easy to reaUse their limited contribution to the overaU contribution of local is government. The area improvement scheme is in Western Australia to one trial region. The Australian Assistance Plan in the southern was the greatest blunder imaginable. Many people, leaders in their communities, of sacrificed considerable time and expense to forproposals. For administrative expendithat ture of $40,000, total grants received were $22,350. Some eight of 128 schemes were apof proved, 9 were referred for further information and the remaining 111 were fobbed off to other departments where no doubt they will be descontribute to tined for the archives. These other carrots being offered to local e government authorities through regional or otherwise do not add up to much. do They certainly do not compensate regions or notshire councUs or municipal councUs for the of inflation. They do not compensate for the reduction in services by local government authorities because of inflation or inadequate loanfillings.In total, they are relatively insigprojects; nificant or no more than mere decoys to persuadeNo local government authorities and the people they are being adequately catered for. When the Grants Commission Bill was before equate the Parliament in 1973, the Opposition the regional concept. We still oppose the regionalcorrect Unes. The sameadequate concept being developed by this Government. We do not condone the by-passing of State Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen). Special governments in the allocating of funds to government, whether the scheme be adminisreport'. tered by the Grants Commission, the Area sistance Plan or in any other way. The regional concept developed by this Government has Grants'. proved a failure. In his address to the annual conference of the Australian Council Government Associations at AUce Springs on 11 November the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said: I believe the new work of the Grants Commission, unfolds, will promote another development of profound nificance to the shape, importance and effectiveness government. I refer to the creation of regions and development of genuine regional thinking. The regions as they are now drawn in Western Australia are ludicrous. CouncUs in regions do not necessarily have common interests. For instance, in my electorate the shire of Boddingother ton is included in the Perth region. Thus a smaUregion. rural shire dependent on agriculture and forestry some 80 miles from Perth is lumped with the Perth City Council, the Stirling City Council the Fremantle City Council. What community of interest can there be between a smaU rural shirewhy so far from the city and radically and municipaUties in the metropoUtan area? questions by How can such a shire contribute to the 'genuinethe next round regional thinking' referred to by the Prime help. But councUs Minister? The Grants Commission reports indicate grants are determined by deviations from dards and using comparisons both within regions and between regions. What meaningful comcation parisons could be made between a rural shire such as Boddington, with a population of than 1,000, and major city councUs metropoUtan area? Yet they aU are part of the same region. The Grants Commission has indigroupings cated that it will make inspections in regions. It isincreasinglyofbecominglocal hard to envisage how inspections of the Perth reportCity Council area will give the Commission appreciation of the problems and disabUities of Boddington. The operation of the Grants determining the 1973-74 grants left much desired. CouncUs did not know what was wanted. Some presented large shopping lists others attempted to show disabUities. guideUnes existed and so there could be no that uniform approach. Since the recommended grants have been announced, shires with inadobtain grants or no grants have not been able to meaningful information as to whether attacked their submissions were old or were along standard reply has been churned out by the office of the It says: local 'Read chapter 3 of the Grants Commission It gives a broad and meaningless attachAsment which is headed 'Summary of Grants Commission Method of Assessing Equalisation It is of extremely Umited value to any shire or municipal clerk as a guide to preparing a of Local submission for 1974-75 In my electorate 8 local government authorities were denied grants.

Two other shires, the Beverley and York, also did not receive grants.

The seminars different shiresproposed the Minister and the promise that will be answered by the Commission at of hearings are welcome and will are already preparing their submissions for 1974-75 in the dark. So that that action should be taken immediately. stanI shaU cite another area where confusion is being spread. I refer to an article in the pubU'Community' issued by the Department of Urban and Regional Development. The article is less headed '$56 MUUon to Local Government'. The in the Perth final paragraph reads: The Grants Commission is using a framework of regional councils, and regional organisations are active around Australia. Although the any That is the Grants Commission reportmakes no recommendations this year for grants for regional projects, applications for such assistance are expected to Commission in increase next year. to be Thus we have the Department of Urban and Regional Development publishing its views on of how the Grants Commission will operate. On reading this article I checked with the staff of Special Minister of State to get clarification, see whether shire councils had been told, to whether I could tell my councils of a new shires development. The staff knew nothing of it. The best I could get was a statement that the comsubsidise ment was a kite-flying exercise. This is of scant comfort to shire councils who are now submissions for the next round of Grants Commission hearings. On the one hand we have the Special Minister of State saying that grants will be judged assessment of the revenue disabilities and the expenditure disabilities of the respective local government authorities within a region. We simiment, larly have the Grants Commission in its report stating that this will be the basis of assessment. On the other hand we have the Department of Urban and Regional Development indicating that regions or regional groups should be making(Mr up shopping lists for submission and considersupport ation by the Grants Commission. No wonder the local government authorities are confused. Not only are they denied a clear answer on their apwas plications as to how grants were decided, they are also being given a dual set of standards for the presentation of their submissions for the next round of Grants Commission hearings. This is a question which the Special Minister State should answer today. The simple question is this: Should council submissions be made the basis of the disabilities as the Grants Comtations mission and his views seem to support, or are they also to submit applications for grants for regional projects as recommended by the Dements. partment of Urban and Regional Development? The question of disabUities should be looked afresh by the Grants Commission as that it in many areas important factors have been ignored. I refer particularly to areas which tourist and hoUday centres. With a population approaching 20,000 shires such as Mandurah cater during the summer period for populations of up to 50,000. No aUowance appears to have been made for the additional burden on Shire Council of providing facUities and services to provide for this influx. Other regional centres appear to have been similarly treated. They have expenditure disabUities because of the need to provide facUiquently ties for people from well outside their shire municipal boundaries. Adequate weight does not appear to have been given to this factor. The Commission in its report discounted as a disnot ability factor the rural recession. This clearly needs reassessment, particularly in many grazing the areas. I hope that in the 1974-75 round of appUcto tions this will be given further and adequate consee sideration. In Western Australia a number of are required, because of their location and difficulty of acquiring doctors and dentists, to these services. I see no provision in the report of the Commission to indicate that this has preparing been given sufficient weight. I support this Bill not because I endorse the principals behind it, but because local government is in such a seriousfinancialposition that on an every bit of money is needed. The money granted by this Bill will not be significant in solving thefinancialpredicament of local governnor will it substantially reduce the bleak fact that mass retrenchments are Ukely by local government authorities in the near future.",74
148,Mr KEOGH,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,"Not as reluctantly as the honourable member for Canning Bungey) but rather joyfully and proudly I the Bill. I congratulate the Government on taking this forthright stand to honour the election promise of 1972 on which this Government elected and which was part of its progressive but platform at that time.The Government pledged to raise the status of local government, to introduce a new deal for some 900 of these local authorities throughout Australia, to relieve those people of the thirdtierof Government responsiof bUity in Australia of the burden that for far too long had forced them to the position were their on development was restricted by thefinancialhmithey were very unjustly forced to carry because they were not being looked at on a fair and equitable basis by the various State GovernAs I have said, we espoused that policy in 1973 and again in 1974 when the Government at was re-elected. Of course, an indication of the seemssupport given by the local authorities in Australia and the confidence that the local are authorities generally have in the Australian Government today was the invitation extended to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to open the annual conference of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, which he did at the Alice Springs on Monday, 11 November. The honourable member for Canning referred to local authorities in his electorate that missed out. They were not successful in their submissions to the Grants Commission and consewere not awarded grants in thefirstalloor cation by the Commissionfor1974.1 realise that perhaps it is with some concern that he brings this to the attention of the Parliament, but I canreaUy say that it is reasonable and fair for him to suggest that the local authorities he mentioned or all of those who did not receive a grant could really be in a position where they do not know why they missed out. The criteria are clearly set out in the Commission's report, which is available to all honourable members and to all local authorities that are involved in this exercise. They are clearly enunciated in the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen). He said: The grants are designed to reduce inequalities between local governing bodies in the provision of ordinary services. The grants will be made to the States for payment to these bodies to supplement their general revenues so as to enable them to provide a standard of service comparable provided by councils elsewhere. The oveiwhelming majority of local authorities have benefited from this decision. Some 92 per cent of those that submitted cases to the Grants Commission were successful. When one considers that only 8 per cent missed out and came into the category to which the honourable member for Canning referred, I do not think it is reasonable to suggest that they do not know why they missed out. As I say, those that missed out must accept the decision of this non-political organisation. No one can point afingerat the Government and say that any political influence was exerted on the Grants Commission or that the Government exerted any influence at all. The criteria were established by the Grants Commission on the same principles as it established for determining the grants that go to the mendicant States. On these principles grants were allocated to local shires. I support the honourable member for Canning on one point. The Grants Commission, the Minbane ister and anybody else who has the responsibility of seeing that this measure is carried out effeccity tively should, on the next occasion when the local authorities appear before the Grants Comthe mission, spare no effort in seeing that complete and full explanations are given to the authorities on how to prepare cases and perhaps guidelines should be laid down for them so that they can quite clearly understand how best to present their cases so that they do not miss The Redland Shire in my electorate received grant. The Brisbane City Council, which is remajor sponsible for the greater part of my electorate, received $2m. It is explained quite clearly in the Grants Commission's report why this $2m was granted to the Brisbane City Council. Generally speaking, looking at the Redland area and the development there, I can understand why under the terms of the criteria laid down the Redland Shire would be ineligible for a grant when coming pared with other shires throughout Queensland. But I must say that I am very heartened by suggestion in the Minister's second reading speech that local government authorities should not take the attitude that simply because they missed out on this occasion they will miss out again. He said: It is in the nature of the Commission's task that in any year some local authorities will receive lower grants than their neighbouring councils or shires, and some authorities will not receive any grants. Consequently, the fact that a council receives a grant this year does not necessarily mean that the same council will receive a grant next year. This is because the Government has asked the Commission to recommend the amount offinancialassistance needed to equalise the fiscal requirements of all local authorities, either individually with those or as regional groups. In supporting the attitude put forward by the honourable member for Canning I say that it is important that every effort be made to see that local authorities are properly briefed and are adequately equipped and competent to undertake the task of putting forward their case. I am sure that the Minister's Department will offer these services and facilities to local authorities. I support the advice given to local authorities earlier by my colleague, the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick). He impressed upon the local authorities in his electorate the need to put forward competent cases. Throughout his electorate he has urged them to see that they put forward a case and that they put it forward in a correct fashion to the Grants Commission when the Commission is considering grants for 1975. The $2m to which I referred earher which has been paid to the Brisbane City Council is naturally very welcome. It was appropriate that the Grants Commission looked at the Greater Brisarea in isolation. Naturally it was impossible for the Commission to compare the Brisbane area with any of the other capital cities because Brisbane is in the unique situation where whole of the metropolitan area comes under the responsibility and authority of one council, local the Brisbane City Council. To my way of thinking- I think generally speaking this is accepted in local government-this is the blueprint for the ideal form of local authority government out. in any metropoUtan area and an example which no could well be copied by other capital cities and provincial cities throughout Australia. Recently I was amazed beyond beUef to discover the situation that exists in the city of Geelong in Victoria, where half a dozen local authorities have responsibUity either in the city itself or in close adjoining areas. It isridiculousin the extreme that a city of that size has such an untidy and antiquated form of local government operatin the area. It is up to the Victorian Government to get cracking to see that the level of orthe ganisation in local government is upgraded in that State. Of course this appUes in respect of many of the local authorities even in my own State. There is no doubt about one of the reasons ing why the State governments try to keep such a next occasion tight rein on local authorities always want to remind the Australian Governthis development andwe ment of the fact that the local authorities chUdren of the State government and reiterate that they want it kept that way. This is certainlytheir because local authorities are kept under trol, power and influence of State governments. Many times State governments actively use this situation to their own poltiical advantage. cetient example is what happened recently Brisbane. Dissatisfied with the fact that were unable to defeat the very popular and dy-Australia namic Labor team in Brisbane led by Lord Mayor Clem Jones, the State Government benefit changed the rules. Previously there had been wards patterned on the State electorates in the Brisbane metropoUtan area. The State governpast ment decided to cut the number back to 21 anding to change the City of Brisbane Act on the advicecontacted of the Mmister for Local Government and Elecfinancial tricity Mr MCKechnie. To convince the people Brisbane that his advice was well founded and that he was doing the correct thing by the peopleto of Brisbane he disclosed on a television show that he had consulted taxi drivers, who had him that the idea was popular. He decided that these the Lord Mayor would have to be elected by people of one particular ward rather than citizens of Brisbane as a whole. Of course, outcome of this is well known. It was an overdifficulties, whelming victory for the Labor Party in the tions, when it won aU but one of the seats. course, much to the displeasure of the funds Queensland Government, Clem Jones is still pity. there to cany on the good job that he has been doing for Brisbane since 1961.

An ex Mr OKEEFE (Paterson) (5.17)-The purin pose of this Bill is to authorise payments of they $56,345,000 to local governing bodies in in 1974-75. It is noted that 806 local governing bodies throughout the country will by the passing of this Bill and, with the 28present position of local government, the sooner the money is appropriated the better. During the few weeks there has not been a local governbody in the Paterson electorate that has not me to express concern about its dire position and to ask when the money ofaUocated by the Grants Commission would be made avaUable by the Government. So it is good know that the Bill which we are debating here today will be passed quickly and should alleviate toldthe problems being experienced by many of local governing councUs. However, many theshire councils throughout Australia have been the cut down on their Commonwealth Aid Roads the grant money and are experiencing financial and the grants that are being made to elec-them by the Grants Commission and by the Of Government will not make up for the loss of from the CAR grants, and this is a great My own association with local government has over a 31-year period, so I have been able to see the great change that has taken place into this sphere of government over a long time-on e could say from the horse and buggy days, with inrequirements only for the repair of footpaths and roads and items of that nature, to the present the time when local government is required to proall modern amenities with an outmoded paid tomethod offinancing.There are many instances Clemwhere local governing bodies have possibly over-stretched their resources and have endeavoured to do too much with too little; but most modern local governing bodies are required to services such as libraries and child mindthating centres and recreational facUities like sportcan being ovals and swimming baths; in many see instances they undertake the operation of meat They are part and parcel of electricity reticulation authorities, gas reticulation authoriquite ties and weed eradication bodies. You name it, local government is expected to play its part With the increased costs and the greater needs government of local governing bodies it is only reasonable that they should receive an adequate part of the country'sfinances.I have always been in favour of local governing authorities receiving assistbeing ance from the Australian Government of the day, but I have some reservations. With the great experience, expertise and know-how of the variThe ous local government departments in the States, it would have been more economical, more efficient and in many ways much better for the Grants Commission to have made this money be available to these departments, which have the know-how and expertise, and which could have the then made it available to the local governing bodies in their respective States. A big commission has been built up here to deal with grants when the Government could have made the money available to the States, which already have the set-up which is required to distribute the funds. There have been instances recently increased where town and shire clerks have again had to supply to the Australian Government further information in regard to the Grants Commission. If this had been handled by the local government departments in the States, which already had this information, the payments could have been expedited and the money made available much more quickly than has been the case under the Grants Commission. Thefinancesof local information government authorities have certainly been tested to the full. Local government's problem has not been one of loan moneys; there has been sufficient loan money available to local governI ment throughout Australia. What has not been avaUable is revenue funds. Loan moneys are very nice when you get them, but they have to be serviced over the years. The capital has to be paid back and the interest has to be paid, and this involves local government in increased costs and in problems in repaying loan moneys. What local government wants is to have revenue funds made avaUable to it. As I have said, sure that there would have been a great saving costs had the money been channeUed through the State local government departments. I am very pleased to see that Mr Justice Mitchell has been appointed as Chairman of Grants Commission. This appointment could result in changes in methodology within Commission. Mr Justice Else-MitcheU has spent a lifetime of investigation into thefinancesof local government, particularly in New South Wales. I have discussed this matter with him a few occasions and he was of the opinion that it was essential that Australian Government in it. money should be made avaUable to local to help it overcome its financial difficulties. After discussion with members of the Commission the view can be expressed that the short time span avaUable for the formulation of grants for 1974-75 resulted in many short cuts taken, and one can readUy see why this was so. However, many lessons have been learnt and these wiU be taken into account in the future. operation of the Commission in thisfield,of course, is regarded as evolutionary and the first attempt has been very much a trial attempt. I think that in fairness we must say that this would so, because it is thefirstgrant to be made by Australian Grants Commission. There will be teething problems in this field. GuideUnes, of course, and methodology are thesedeveloping further and future recommendations may be expected to take this into account. The Commission gives no guarantees that changes in guidelines or in methodology will be reflected in grants in the future. I feel that this is a wise precaution. I believe also that the quality of the submissions had no adverse effects on the level of the grants that were recommended, and this should put shire councU clerks at ease. The Commission has informed us that it is anxious to continue to receive submissions from councUs and that it will undertake to inspect problem areas to correct data deficiencies and supplement received. The Commission wishes to be informed in writing of any queries or observations in respect of thefirstgrants or lack of grant well in advance of the next hearings which, understand, are due to commence shortly. Many councUs have expressed the view that a base grant should form part of the recommendagot tions so that each councU would receive some got amount. Unless the Government is prepared to issue such instructions to the Commission this would not be a possibUity, and honourable members would readUy see this to be so. I feel Although the Commission makes working inpapers avaUable to State governments it is not prepared at this stage to make working papers available to local government bodies. In my own electorate of Paterson there are 16 purely local Elsegovernment councUs and most of them have the received grants from the Grants Commission. Most of them are in extremefinancialdifficulties. the The shire clerk of the Coolah Shire Council, which is in my electorate, was here today and he expressed great concern about the fact that this councU will have to lay off employees unless this on grant money is made readUy avaUable to him. An amount of $58,000 has been made available to that shire. If this Bill goes through promptly that appropriation should be made by the Minisbriefly ter for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) early in December. These amounts which are to be made available to these councils should help them over their problems and difficulties. is noted that weed eradication authoriues, reticulation authorities, abattoir processing plants and gas distributing authorities do not come under the Grants Commission for assistble. ance, and I think that this is a fair thing. They trading undertakings in the main and no grant should be made to them. They should be endeavouring to put their own houses in order and run their own undertakings on enonomic lines, which they can do. I have noted that the Special Minister of (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said in his second readout ing speech that the Commission will continue rely heavily on the co-operation of councils in work. The Minister continues: Its methods require that comprehensive and up to date financial and statistical information be submitted a basis for its assessments. There is also the need first-hand appreciation of the problems of Councils and, in the course of its second round already commenced, Commissioners will be making direct inspections in all regions. The nature of the program provide the Commission with opportunities to keep needs of Councils under continuing review. I notice also that in the Minister's second reading speech great reliance is placed on the formation of regional councils. I would agree with this also agree with the Minister that the formation these regional councils in the formulative stages has been quite successful. I was afraid that they were first formed parochial attitudes of the constituent councils would show themselves very forcibly. But in the main these regional councils have appeared to work extremely well. Those councils which have received grants are, in the main, satisfied with the grants they have received. I heartily support the Bill. I have condemned in one aspect, and that is that I feel- I reiterate this-that the money could have been made available to the local government departments the States which have the expertise and know-how so that they could allocate it according to the information that they have. But that the Grants Commission, having been set here in Canberra, will continue to function, and as it gains more knowledge of the local govern the ing bodies and their requirements Australia it will be able to handle the grants in a more equitable and more efficient manner. port the Bill.",77
149,Mr UREN,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS," I wish to reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe). He started out by being critical of the Government's action to assist local government bodies, but he mellowed Ittowards the end ofhis speech. The Bill provides the Grants Commission with $56.3m for allocation to local governing bodies by way of grant. Such grants wiU be interest free and non-repayaThe honourable member for Paterson went areon to criticise the fact that Commonwealth Aid Roads moneys were being cut back. The Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) today clearly stated that the amount of money made avaUable under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement this year was 30 per cent greater than that provided during the last 3 years of adminisState tration of the previous Government. He pointed also that if there was any cutting back of to Commonwealth Aid Roads moneys this was its being done by the respective State governments which were responsible for its aUocation. by them as Let us just briefly examine the real debt burto have a den of local government bodies under the administration of the previous Government of of public hearings, which have which the honourable member for Paterson was will also a supporter. The whole debt burden of the Comthe monwealth government during the 23 years of reign of the previous Government remained static. The debts of the States increased sevenfold. The debt burden of local government and bodies increased by some 2,000 per cent, and in of the case of semi-government authorities it increased by 2,800 per cent. That is the record of when the previous Government. We know that local government authorities are in a difficult financial situation. What is proposed under this Bill is one of thefirststeps that we propose to take. It is only one step of the many that we are taking to try to assist local government bodies. Might I say that the region which the honourable member for Paterson represents received a total of $2,719,000. For instance, the Maitland City it Council, which is in the area that the honourable member represents, received $228,000. The MusweUbrook City Council received $70,000; in the Scone Shire Council received $62,000; and the the Singleton Municipal Council received $60,000. All of these moneys were made availI know able from the Australian Government to the up respective councUs by way of non-repayable grant. It is this type of positive action taken by Whitlam Labor Government which has been throughout of assistance to these bodies. I supDuring my contribution I shall make further references to other areas in which we are trying to assist local government authorities. I welcome this Bill introduced by my colleague, the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen). For the first time the Australian Government is to maketo assistance directly avaUable to cUs. The Bill provides a total of $56,345,000 to local government bodies in accordance with recommendation of the Grants Commission. the Honourable members will recaU the pledge On made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) durnon-metropolitan ing the debate in June last year on the Grants Commission Bill. The Prime Minister said: The Government is determined to make the third tier of government a genuine partner in the system and to give government adequate access to the nation's finance. We have honoured this commitment with the State changes we have made in the functions of Grants Commission. Grants are now flowing from these changes. The grants to individual local government bodies were announced by Special Minister of State, Mr Lionel Bowen, and me in August. Since the announcement we have been gratified by the generally favourable response to these grants. Wherever I have travrural eUed in Australia in recent weeks I have found that local government is thankful for the assistthosefiguresgive ance given. There have been some knockers there has been some Ul-informed criticism, but for the most part the response has been heartendo ing to the Government. It would be impossible to pioneer a new system of assistance to local government without some defects occurring. The apphcation of printhe ciples of fiscal equaUty to about 900 local government bodies is a tremendous task. Unance doubtedly there are anomaUes in the Ust of grants; there may have been injustices. It would be impossible to introduce such a sweeping scheme without a few rough edges showing in its first year. If there are cases where it can be shown that the principles have been unfairly appUed there has been a lack of consistency we will certively tainly have a look at them. I should point out my Department is entided to go in and support the apphcation of any local government auththan ority before the Grants Commission if there is any injustice. So far no example of unfairness been brought to my attention. Some of the State branches of the Opposition Parties, in particular the New South Wales Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia, have had a very close look the grants and have been unable to uncover any bias or unfairness. There are always complaints about poltiical bias in the apphcation of broad scheme which brings benefits across board. There is no doubt in my mind that grants have been based on a fair and impartial bodies. assessment by the Grants Commission. I stress that these grants are completely free of strings. Each local government body is completely free decide how it willfitits grant into individual shires and counspending programs. the Another important point about the grants is high level of assistance given to rural areas. a per capita basis the shires and councUs in areas have done better than their urban counterparts. If we were to break down thesefiguresfor the whole of Australia we wouldfindthat the grants went to metropoUtan local local government bodies on the basis of $2.92 a head and to non-metropolitan bodies at $6.88 a head. If we were to break down thefigureson a by State basis we would get these results: the New South Wales-metropoUta n $2.87 a head and rural $7.28 a head; Victoria-MetropoUta n $2.96 a head and rural $7.13 a head; the Queensland-metropoUta n $3.12 a head and rural $6.23 a head; South Australia-metropoli tan $3.02 a head and rural $6.36 a head; Western Australia-metropoUta n $2.92 a head and $8.85 a head; and Tasmania-metropolita n $2.04 a head and rural $5.16 a head. I hope that the Ue once and for all to the andclaims that the Government's programs discriminate against the rural areas. The rural areas as well as or better than the urban areas in the programs of the Australian Government. I would Uke to look in a little detaU at one of important principles which is embodied in the Government's approach to providing assistto local government, that is, the use of regions in the context of Australian federal government. The subject of regions has aroused considerable public interest and debate in the past few months. The focus of the sort of examination is the development of a system of regions or so that the Grants Commission can work effecin assisting local government. It is a fact thatthat attitudes to regionalism are much more strongly developed in some parts of Australia in others. Bringing local government bodies together in broader groupings is essential if the has rather clumsy structure of federalism in this country is to be made to work. The Australian Government is developing new programs which getrightdown to the day-today working of local at government. This is a great step forward in the working of Australian government, but it brings many problems. An obvious difficulty is coany ordinating the administration of programs the involving the Australian Government, the State these governments and some 900 local government Finding the tools to get this structure to has been one of the important tasks of the Government in urban and regional developthe ment. For this reason we have sought to revive the concept of regionalism to link the shires and councils in a number of loosely based groups. Tbis sort of association is designed to bring together councils which have some common regional identity. With this aim in mind we defined 68 regions for the purposes of Grants Commission assistance to local government. The Grants mission was given 3 choices in applying the ciples offiscalequaUty to local government: It could use comparisons betweenregions;it could use comparisons between individual local studies government bodies; it could use comparisons of regions with other regions or with individual local government bodies. The Commission decided to base its work on comparing individual local government bodies. That meant the exacting task of looking in detail at more than 800 shires and councUs. The there reasons for that choice are set out in the Grants Commission's report onfinancialassistance to basis. local government. Those reasons are sound enough and I do not dispute the course adopted by the Commission. At this early stage it would not be wise to base a strong case for assistance toexpertise local government on theregions.But it is encourlocal government aging to note that 2 States-Tasmani a and Southploy the engineers,has Australia-were prepared to put their appUcations on aregionalbasis. As the regional conmentalists cept is developed it should be possible to shift theof whole basis of assistance to local government basis. onto theregions.I know that this will taketimetoincludeItthe evolve, but it is not the Government's intention to push too hard. We want it to evolve at a local government level and we want the local governLocal ment bodies to put their appUcations on a environmental regional basis. We want to bring the regional concept along graduaUy and to blend it into the process of transmitting Australian Government money to local government bodies by way of regional organisations. For thatreason,the 1974-75 Budget makes special provision for grants toregionalorganisations set up for Grants Commission purposes. The regional organisation assistance program has 2 aims. We want to encourage local governGovernment ment to tackleregionalproblems in co-operation by setting up regional organisations. We want these regional organisations to be active assessing the needs of theirregionsand in making submissions on their behalf. The annual apphcation to the Grants Commission is the most important of these submissions. There are other work Australian government programs where an approach on a regional basis would greatly assist flow of assistance. The whole concept of regional organisations must remain an empty sheU if the organisations lack the resources to service their needs. TofiUthis need we will provide 2 levels of assistance under the program. AU organisations wiU qualify for $2,000 to assist them to meet such basic out-of-pocket expenses as travelUng and secretarial expenses. ComGrants up to $8,000 per region may be paid to prin-organisations which spend money on other approved regional purposes. This will assist with costs, such as for the preparation of regional and the holding of regional conferences. Not all of the regions will be eUgible for this second grant immediately, but we expect that within 3 years most regions will have developed sufficiently to claim it. Thisrepresentsa modest start to buUding up the sort of machinery that will be needed to service these regional organisations. Beyond this, we look to the day when will be a much greater concentration of the resources of local governments on a regional One of the great flaws of local government at the moment is lack of resources to provide the that is necessary in an increasingly complex era of technology. The single unit of not the resources to emthe managers, the environand the planners. It is so much easier to provide these essential people if the resources local government are pooled on a regional is also much easier for government- I State governments here-to channel its assistance to local regional organisations. government mustrealisethat we live in an age and that it will have to adjust to meet new challenges and demands. I referred earlier to the scope of the Australian Government's programs which impinge directly on local government. This involvement has been extended greatly by the measures contained in the Budget. Ireferhonourable members to Budget Paper No. 7 on payments to or for the State and local government authorities for 1974-75. Table 86, at page 134, gives a broad indication of the range and possible size of the Australian payments to or for local government authorities thisfinancialyear. This gives an estimate of $96.9m for Australian Government in programs thisfinancialyear. If we take out $56.3m for the Grants Commission program and $2m for the Northern Territory we get a total of $38m for specific purpose assistance to local government. It should be stressed that this is not a total figure as estimates are not available some important programs. Allowing for this shortfall, there is no doubt of the scope and generosity of the assistance we are giving to local government programs. We have extended the national sewerage proage gram to cover cities with a population of between 20,000 and 60,000 people. We have extended sort the area improvement program from 2 regions is this year to 13 regions. Local government will member also receive substantial assistance from the urban local roads program which allocates $30m in grants over the next 3 years. A substantial partIasuggest of this money will go to local government. For blackmaU thefirsttimedirect assistance will be given for upgrading the quality of residential streets. These programs derive from the work of my Dewere partment. There are many other Australian traUan Government programs linked to the day to day work of local government. My colleague the So Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) has devised a number offineprograms to give better amenities for recreation in towns the and suburbs. The Australian Assistance Plan, dibe returned rected by the Minister for Social Security (Mr December. The Hayden), will gather greater momentum in the months ahead. It will link aU levels of governin ment with local communities in the provision of greater range of welfare services. Under the Alderman scheme the Australian Government is giving the at the moment. money and the back-up for programs which local communities can identify and fulfil. These two examples could be multiplied. the moment there are 34 programs administered by 13 Australian Government departments and 5 Australian Government authorities. More grams are being added aU the time. The ment will continue to extend these programs. These programs have teething problems and there needs to be a role of co-ordination. It be the task of the Department of Urban and Regional Development to iron out these probabout lems and ensure that aU programs of assistance to local government are co-ordinated in a proper way. The Australian Government aims to give local government the money and the tools its proper role in the federal structure. The ance given by the Grants Commission represents a great stride forward in achieving this aim. grant of $56.3m in thefirstyear is interest and non-repayable. I support the Bill.",81
150,Mr HODGES,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,"Firstly I must take to task the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick). He made the statement that State governments were not assisting local government. Tbis is totaUy incorrect. State governments are assisting local government for I think honourable members shouldrefrainfrom statements of that nature or, if they are Ulinformed, should make no statements at all. I was rather flattered by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Keogh) who tried to get mileout of me by suggesting that I was agreeing with him during the debate. That shows what of tactics Labor Party members will resort to, particularly as the Queensland State election to be held on 7 December. The honourable referred to Alderman Jones as having done such a good job as Lord Mayor of Brisbane. to the honourable member that this was personal vote. As a matter of fact it was a vote because during the campaign for the last Brisbane City Council election people told that if they did not vote for the AusLabor Party they would not get anything from Alderman Jones, because he is a dictator. it was a blackmaU vote. But it also shows the complete impartiality of the Queensland Government which has been impartial towards Brisbane City Council. It shows also the success of the State Government which I know will with a resounding majority on 7 Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), addressing the Council of the Local Governa the ment Associations conference, said that he was lucifer of centralism. I suggest that, like Jones, his Ught is burning rather dimly Yesterday the States Grants (Special AssistAt ance) Bill debate was gagged in this House. The Opposition was denied therightto adequately debate it. I am pleased that the Bill we are now prodebating has notreceivedthe same treatment. Govern-Honourable members from Queensland and South Australia were denied therightto debate yesterday and this indicated the interest of the will Government in those areas. That was a substantial Bill which involved expenditure totalling $48m. The present Bill involves an amount of about $56m. However the proceedings are being broadcast at the moment and I guess the Government regards this as a good opportunity to fill to show up the good points of this Bill. assistI support the Bill, as the Opposition has done, and I am happy to do so because it relates to an Thisarea that has concerned me for about 8 years. In free recent times we have heard and have seen reports in the newspapers of the State Opposition Leader in Queensland, Mr Tucker, making statements to the effect that the Commonwealth Government has made greater per capita grants to Queensland than elsewhere-grant s of the order of $380 as compared with the Australian and average of $360.I am surprised that Mr Tucker is so naive that he is not aware of the way the Grants Commission operates. The Grants Comvious mission seeks to bring equality to States that below the standard States of New South Wales and Victoria. The claimant States, of course, are to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States without levying extra charges and taxation. Therefore their revenue has to be supplemented, because they have a lower cain pacity to raise taxes and revenue and because they incur higher costs in order to provide parable services. This Bill provides that $56.3m is to be spread among 806 local authorities. When averaged out, although it might sound a lot this is not great deal of money to each authority. approximately $70,000. If it is averaged over 900 local authorities, the amount is reduced to $60,000 to each authority. What amazes me about this move by the Government is this: Whytely has it applied a ceiling of $56m. We find that $41.6m is appropriated this financial year to the Albury-Wodonga concept which I support are whereas only $2.4m was spent on that project last year. I would suggest to the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) and to the Governbetween ment thatfirstthings should comefirst.Why not upgrade the existing facilities we have in our ies and towns? Why are we spending so much money on Albury-Wodonga? Is it because we have a glory-seeking Prime Minister who wants to be known as thefirstPrime Minister to do so many things? Perhaps the name 'Alburythroughout Wodonga' is rather cumbersome and he wants to be renamed 'Whitlam City'. We have seen 3 Budgets presented in 4 months. As far as I can see, in this House a get seems to have no significance at all. The Budget proposed a deficit of $570m. Eight weeks later, that deficit is $ 1,300m. As reckless spendnew ing seems to be the order of the day I call Government to double at least, or perhaps trecaught ble, the $56.3m that is provided by this Bill. The sum of $56.3m causes me to claim that the these Government's generosity is really at stake. Having been present at hearings of the Commission on behalf of one local authority, feel that I can speak with some authority on Bill. I played a part in the preparation of the mission for and also appeared on behalf of one authority. One fact is abundantly clear in Australia today. This is that local government not receiving sufficient revenue. It is required carry out so many important services including the provision of water supply, sewerage, roads, kerbing, channelling and drainage, parklands and pubUc toUets to mention a few. It is quite obthat, if we are not to experience stagnation, are extra revenue must come to local government. It is interesting to note that local government's share of total Government spending in Australia is shrinking steadUy. Instead of increasing, unfortunately it is declining to such an extent that 1969-70 only 7.4 per cent of total government expenditure in Australia was spent in the local comgovernment area. A committee of inquiry into local government affairs in New South Wales-it was caUed the Barnett report-clearl y Ulustrated thisfigureof 7.4 per cent. This is in stark contrast to the expenditure of 21.6 per cent in Canada, a 25.4 per cent in the United States of America and It is 34.6 per cent in Great Britain. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) stated earUer that afigureof approxima20 per cent of all revenue coming to local authorities is expended on interest and redemption payments. I can assure the House that there many local authorities in this country which have interest and redemption payments in excess of 50 per cent of their revenue. Rate increases of 20 per cent and 50 per cent are rather the order of the day. In the city of Ipswich, which citis in the electorate of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden), complete uproar recently occurred with petitions being presented to the councU calling on the councU to resign and for rates to be reduced. This is typical of the position Australia and demonstrates the fact it that local government obviously must receive more revenue. The question is: Where is that revenue to come bud-from? Many people in our community today are firstunable to meet the increased rates which are being levied. The capital cost of services today in estates is being provided by sub-dividers. But on the there is a tremendous backlog which must be up. It is not only a question of who provides capital costs; the cost of the maintenance of services and the replacement of vital equipment is involved. Grants This Government is able to indulge in a I differential taxing system. Unfortunately, that this system is not avaUable to local government. subWhen we talk of the average size allotment in a residential street-that is, a 24 perch allotment-w e mightfindliving in that street a penis sioner, a low income bracket earner, a middle to income bracket earner and perhaps a high income bracket earner. Local government has not at its disposal the means to levy a differential rate on those people in these various income brackets. It does have by the operation ations some power to vary rates m certain areas. Let me return to the reaction of local ment to these grants. I make the point that these Grants Commission hearings were held in 1973. ""We are now towards the end of 1974. The reacdeflated tion I receive from local government authorities is: 'When are we to receive the money?' It fairly plainly stated in this Bill that the grants to be paid out before 30 June 1975.1 would hope for the sake of local government and in view of the number of persons unemployed-this number is increasing all the grants will be made available almost immediaI tely. I come again to a point that I made earher inam reply to the honourable member for Darling and made refer specifically to the generosity of the stated by Queensland Government. Honourable members Development will recall that he mentioned that no State These remarks would indicate to the Australian authority government gave assistance to local government. ution of these funds.on people that this Australian Government only Government that has ever done anything for local government Let me assure honourable members that non-repayable grants are made by going when it is given to the regional State governments and that in Queensland in not decrying regional planning. I am very particular subsidies range from 15 per cent for in favour of it because there are very great roadworks and drainage up to non-repayable grants of 40 per cent of cost for sewerage works and up to 50 per cent for new water supply we schemes. Mr Millar-It is a very sensitive Government",84

On average- a generous average-2 0 per cent of that sum comes by of non-repayable grants. I make the point quite strongly that this Government is not the only government that assists local government in Australia. Local government certainly is deflated and depressed by the approach of this CommonThe wealth Government to morefinancefor local of assistance authorities. One might say that it is in the dolment drums and that aU the wind is dropping out of its overcome saUs. Local authorities thought that this Governmission hasthehad ment was Santa Claus because it told them so. This was a good selling point. Government members proved that they were good salesmen.

It is just as disadvantaged, I would say, as other governlocal government areas in Australia. This Government has not done too much for it. Local government is a Uttle dejected and a Uttle by and a Uttle distrusting of this Government. But the main difference between is the chUd who beUeves in Santa Claus and the are local government child, so to speak, is that the confidence of the chUd in the first instance returns pretty quickly; let me assure this Government that the confidence of local government time-that these will not return. make the further point that the Grants Commission, as we know, is non-poltiical. But it operates only within the charter that is given to it. I most fearful that, in the future, if grants are to regions-this has been quite clearly the Minister for Urban and Regional (Mr Uren)-w e will have greater E roblems our hands with respect to the distriWhat will happen if a local is the have not in these hearingsaof has not received grant, as a number the Grants Commission, and a grant is made to the region in the future?

I might add that regional planning in the State of Queensland, as I have said in this House before, is to the forefront in Australia and many of the ideas that instituted by the Queensland Government authorities. Let us ment of actual have in fact been copied by the DepartUrban and Regional Development I would Uke to talk a little about members of way the Grants Commission because I believe that they are well qualified and competent people. They are people who did their utmost to do an honest job. The following statement is made at page 40 of the report of the Commission: Commission has not been able to compare the extent provided by the various States to local governin any explicit way. Better information will be sought from States and local government authorities in order to problem. But for the ume being, the Comto resort to broad judgment. The operative phrase there obviously is 'broad judgment'. I sympathise with the commissioners in their task. Obviously it was a major one. But distressing thing, I think, is that there was an admission of these difficulties in the report in that the commissioners, of course, had to use their 'broad judgment'. I want to make the point that local government grants commissions do operate in New South Wales and Western Australia. These grants commissions provide grants to local authorities. I suggest to the Government that it lays down suggested guidelines for State governments and in consultation with the States sets up State Grants Commissions. The Federal Government should let the State governments assess the needs of local government. After all, they have local knowledge which is important. The various State government departments know the intricacies of their own States. I believe that a greater uniformity of operations of local authorities can be obtained by consultation rather than by confrontation. This Government seems to be making a habit of forcing its views on the States rather than seeking their co-operation. I now turn to the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen). I want to refer to a couple of points. Firstly the Minister said: There will be no conditions attached to the expenditure grants. It is very nice to see that there are to be no strings attached to grants which will be allocated to local authorities. But what guarantee have local authorities of that in the future? What guarantee is there that this Government will not endeavour to control what happens to their funds in the future? The Minister also said: The Government believes that these grants will go a long way towards alleviating these deficiencies. This is utter rubbish. I pointed out earlier that $56m spread over all local authorities in Australia is an exercise in window dressing. Mr Millar-It isa fleabite.",86
153,Mr HODGES,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,"It is afleabite,as my honourable friendremindsme. The final point is that a number of local authorities missed out on grants. I want to know whether these local authorities were told why they missed out on grants. Was it because their rates were too low and they had the capacity to levy higher rates? Was it because their operations were inefficient? What was the reason? I would suggest to the Special Minister of State that he might look into this matter and provide an explanation either directly or through the Commission to local authorities that were unsuccessful inreceivinggrants. I also suggest that the money should be made available immediately. Many local authorities cannot raise this money from loan funds. This problem is widespread throughout Australia today. Of course, the money will help to prevent retrenchments which at this point oftimeare inevitable. I sum up by saying that the system is too complex and too loose to determine fairly and accurately amounts of grants. I would suggest that the States be allowed to handle the distribution of money provided by way of grants.",87
154,Mr VINER,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS," I enter this debate because of the position in which the City of Stirling now finds itself with regard to its finances. The City of Stirling is shared in area by my electorate of Stirling and the electorate of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson). Outside the City of Perth it is the largest local authority in the metropoUtan area. It is significantly larger than the City of Perth in area. It has some 160,000 people to cater for and it might properly beregardedas big business in its own right. It has a budget of $15,708,834 for the 1974-75financialyear. It is to receive a grant of $490,000 from the Grants Commission by virtue of this legislation. I think that it is about the eighth largest grant that is to be allocated. The of City of Stirling obviously is to receive that grant because of the wide range of social commitments it has within its local authority area. The City of Stirling is concerned about 2 things,firstlyits immediatefinancialplight and secondly, when it will get the money from the Government. I notice in that regard that clause 4 of the Bill provides that grants are payable in the financial year that commenced on 1 July 1974 and that the payments to the State, being the channel through which these grants will be received by local authorities, shall be made at suchtimesand in such amounts as the Treasurer approves. Implicit in that, as Ireadit, is that the Treasurer can put out this money in dribs and drabs as he chooses to do so rather than in a single lump sum. Clause 4 goes on to provide that the payments to the States are made on the condition that the State concerned will without undue delay and before I July 1975 make unconditional payments of these grants to the local authorities. Therefore there is a double-edged sword in the provision of this Bill. Firstly, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has at his discretion the right to pay this money out in bits and pieces, and secondly the State has until 1 July 1975 to make payments to the local authorities. Conceivably, therefore, the Treasurer could wait until 29 June 1975 to make the money available to the State of Western Australia and so the State of Western Austraha would have one day in which to make that money available to the local authority. I do not believe for one moment that that sort of situation would occur. But in pointing out what is permissible under the terms of the Bill, I seek to highlight the urgency with which local authorities within Australia, and in particular my own, the City of Stirling, require this money because of the immediatefinancialplight with which they are confronted. Let me demonstrate this plight by looking at the budget of the City of Stirling. This large budget of $ 15.5m is to be balanced by rate income which accounts for $5.5m, loan requirements which are $1,700,000, government grants for buildings and reserves which will bring in $250,000, road grants of $1.5m and town planning scheme grants of $1,824,000. The rating income represents 33.3 per cent of the City of Stirling's budget.",87
155,Unknown,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,88
156,Mr VINER,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was speaking about thefinancialsituation in which the city of Stirlingfindsitself in view of the current economic situation in Australia and making the point, which I will develop in the course of the time still available to me, that the $490,000 which the city of Stirling will obtain through the Grants Commission will not serve the purposes intended for it because of the finanavailability cial plight in which the cityfindsitself. I pointed financial institutions out that the city has a budget of $15,500,000.1 pends upon-the savings was giving a break up of that amount rate income, loan requirements, Government where the money can be borrowed.institutions grants, road grants and town planning schemes. known throughout the financial institutions In order to obtain the rate income of $5,500,000 the city was obliged in thisfinancialyear to increase its rates by 34.5 per cent. That is a sigimposed nificant increase by any standard impost that not very many, if any, of the ratethe extent that theirbusiness, payers of the city of Stirling would like But I hope that they appreciate that the city bound to make that increase in rates in the face out those works that the ratepayers carry of the inflationary situation it is to provide those municipal services that ratepayers depend upon. As I pointed out, of a total loan program $1,700,000 since March of this year the city been able to raise only $500,000. This amount > represents less than one-third of what it will - require before July 1975. The significance of is that the loan program supports the engineering work carried out by the city. The engineering tion employs 150 men. I have been informed by the city that 96 of those 150 men are directly employed by the use of loan funds. The inevitwithout able is obvious: If the balance, the amount $ 1.2m, is not raised by way of loans the employIndeed, ment of those 96 men is in jeopardy. I have further informed by the city that the situation so acute that unless a substantial amount of loan money is found within 9 weeks, those 96 may well face redundancy. It is also important to realise that the loan program must support grants made by the States. For example, the States provide grants for urban local roads. The city is required to match what the Government provides on the basis of $2 for each $1 allocated by the State. An amount of $411,080 has been allocated by the State. But the city depends on its loan funding to provide this matching money. Therefore, again, if its loan program fails the city cannot provide the money which entitles it to obtain a grant from the State Government. Therefore it is squeezed in 2 directions. It is unable to raise loan funds itself and therefore it is ineligible to obtain grants from the State Government. I know from inquiries that I have made-w e have heard this from other speakers in the debate tonight-that this is not an unusual situation in Australia today. It is a situation which arises directly from the economic measures of this Government and principally from the credit squeeze that the Government implemented from September 1973. The credit squeeze has put a squeeze on the of loan funds from the traditional that local government debanks, trading banks, between State banks and otherfinancial As is well of Austraha, the dire credit squeeze which was last 12 upon them by this Government over the months has meant that local authorities, and will be an as well as private cannot borrow. To to bear. works programs are so heavilyprograms spending and their is loan funds, they are denied the ability to upon dependent are in Australia today if dependent upon. In the current situation of rapidly rising unemployment, it is not only private industry which of will add to the numbers of unemployed by not has being able to afford to continue to employ people; also, great employers such as local authorities will be hit equally as severely and this their former employees will add to the growing number of unemployed. This is precisely the situsecation with which local authorities such as the city of Stirling are faced. The city officers have not lain down quietly and let this situation occur trying to avoid it. They have explored of every possible avenue of raising this money. they have sought the assistance of the been honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson) is whose electorate, as I have said before, crosses into the city of Stirling, as does my electorate. I men know that the honourable member for Perth, who I am glad to see is in the House tonight, has made approaches to the Government on behalf of the city of Stirling to see whether there is avenue from within the Commonwealth itself or any of its institutions like the Reserve Bank of Australia to provide loan funds to a local ority which is in the kind of economic that the city of Stirling is in. Regrettably, the honourable member for Perth was given a descheme finite negative answer. The Government could before amust not help. I would not say that it would simply said that there was no way in which it ority such as the Citybe could help to support the loan program of the said, Ues down idly and lets city. The city has sought funds in every area that the Commonwealth Government has opened up loan to local authorities. These areas include grants for community and recreation programs through the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) and cultural grants for a cultural centre. The city has gone to the extent of seeking amount of $247,840 for buildings and reserves.so. Of a whole range of projects which have been put before the appropriate Ministers since about April or May of this year, there on any of those projects. There has been neither a yea nor a nay. For all this time the city has waited for an answer because it is in dire need the funds so that it can maintain its program and equalthe continue its employment of its employees, let with alone provide all those welfare services for which would have made the people of Stirling are clamouring. It has sought access to funds through the Regional Employment Development scheme has operated by the Minister for Labor and of Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron). The city has done. sought some $300,000 for unemployment relief under that scheme. Rather significantly, it has this sought the bulk of that money-som e the discretion $209,000-for the most labour intensive area, Crean) to make that is, within the engineering department deals with the construction and reconstruction footpaths. Yet I was informed yesterday by the ates, the funds that will be avaUable whenoperDepartment of Labor in Perth which is handling legislation the applications made by local authorities in Western Australia that that $209,000 for the specific works of construction and reconstruction of footpaths has beenrefusedbecause the Delate partment considers that it does not come within to paramaters of the RED unemployment relief an assurance scheme. Yet if funds were provided, it is this veryany delay in providing area which would maintain employment some 100 people. It will go into the engineering State Government to see thatbe department. So we have the absurd situation thatmaking these moneys avaUable to local before the City of Stirling can get relief grants it must see these 100 people discharged from employment so that they can then register for unemployment benefits at the office within the region and, having shown in any such a dramatic fashion that there are so many people unemployed, may be the City of Stirling will be able to obtain the funds in the very area authwhich would have prevented the unemployment situation in thefirstplace. It is an absurd situation where the RED local operate to create unemployment authority will be given money to not help; it alleviate it. It cannot of said that a local authStirling Council, as I these events take their course. The City has explored every avenue for obtaining funds which would replace those funds which it presently cannot obtain. As I have said before, the reason why these loan funds cannot be obtained in the ordinary finance market where the City has obtained them before is the credit squeeze which has been brought on an by this Government over the last 12 months or It is a credit squeeze which has affected not only private industry but also the great employers within the community like the local is still no answer authorities. If the Prime Minister were true to all that he ofhas said about local government-makin g it an third arm of government and providing it resources that it requires-in the miniBudget that he announced last Tuesday he special provision for local authorities. One would expect that from the great interest that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) shown in this area he would at least be aware what the poUcies ofhis own Government have I come back to the point that I made early in debate about the provisions of the Bill and that is given to the Treasurer (Mr payments at times and in such that amounts as he approves. of things, in the way in whichByadministration the very course of this is passed will not go through the pipeUne, or even start in the opening to the channel, until about January. But January will be too for a local authority Uke the City of Stirling have keep in employment those 100 men that I spoken about. So I ask the Minister to give to the House that there will not be these funds to the State for Government. I will certainly it approaching the does not delay in authoriunemployment ties in Western Australia. If local authorities throughout Australia could local be given some kind of indication that the Government is aware of the situation with which local authorities are confronted not delay the provision of this money, will not leak it out in dribs and drabs, there is some measure of hope for local authorities. Many them, like the City of Stirling, are faced with credit squeeze. Money is the thing they require urgently. It simply cannot be obtained quickly grants from the Department of Tourism Recreation or the appropriate Minister who handles cultural grants. It cannot be obtained quickly from the Minister in charge of the RED scheme. So where is a local authority to get money? I ask the Special Minister of State to ensure that the Treasurer makes at least this grant money available quickly to local authorinobody ties throughout Australia.",88

171,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,"Yes , Mr Speaker, but there is a listening audience as well. Mr Garland-There are 2 sides to that story.",90
172,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,"It is a question of people wanting to get on with the legislation. I want to make this clear, Mr Speaker: When arto rangements are made by people appointed by was both the Government and the Opposition those arrangements should be adhered to. Dealing I with the matters that were mentioned by the member for Stirling (Mr Viner), the issue in the whole of this debate, as far as the Opposition is concerned, is not to give any item of praise because of the $53.6m which will be think given-for thefirsttime I might add-to local government. The members of the Opposition, in pregovernment for 23 years, gave nothing to local the government and when we asked for a referennot dum of the people to decide whether local government should be allowed to make an apphcation to the Loan Council, they opposed it. Let us put that on the record from the point of view of the merits and the bona fides of the Opposition's case. The next question raised was this: Why has the money not been granted urgently? Until about 6 p.m. this evening the Appropriation Bills had not been passed by the Senate. What is the attitude of the Opposition in delaying them for so long? I give this undertaking now that the Bill is passed by the Senate there is no reason why all these moneys should not be in the hands of the State governments within 14 days. It would then be up to the State governments. Those honourable members who have some influence with the State governments in New South Wales and in Western Australia might encourage those Governments to do something to get the money distributed. I have an assurance from the honourable member from Perth (Mr Berinson) that he has made special arrangements for the money to go to Stirling. It will be there, subject to the Premier of Western Australia co-operating, by the end of this month. That is the situation. It is quite clear that this could have been dealt with a lot more expeditiously if the Appropriation BUls had been passed a lot earUer. But members of the Opposition have aU complained about how they wanted to talk on the Estimates and how much time they needed. They had 36 hours on the Estimates alone, apart from the Budget itself. And now they talk about the delay on this Bill. The real issue is this: Only for this Government there would be no money going to local government this year-and $56.3m is going. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch), who led for the Opposition on this Bill, raised a number of issues. AU of them relate to the fact that he proposed to move an amendment unless there was an assurance that the money would be paid promptly. I reminded him that we were relying on the Appropriation BUls being passed in the Senate. There was no need to move the amendment if the Appropriation BUls were passed. I am happy to say they were passed today. They should have gone through about 3 days ago. Mr Chipp-Would you not breathe a sigh of reUef?",90
173,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS,"Not at aU. We will take you on anytime.The honourable member leading for the Opposition felt that it should be left to the State governments to work out criteria for each State. The whole idea of the Grants Commission is to estabUsh uniform criteria. That could not be effectively done if the matter was left to the State governments because they would aU have their own criteria. In fact at the moment New South Wales has its own Grants Commission. It gives a Uttle bit to each councU. That is good poUtics. It has nothing to do with the needs of the councUs, but provided they all get a little bit nobody complains. Because there is not a good State government in Victoria the councUs do not get benefits. That is their problem. In Queensland the Government is starting to do something. The amount of $8.9m which is being given to Queensland councUs would be double what the Queensland Government gave them last year. Let us look at what is happening to the moneys. We might raise, say, $1,079 per head in taxation, but we are giving at least a third back to the States under the reimbursement formula. The amount paid to Queensland is $ 1,020m or $509 per head. Compare that with what is coming directly to Queensland in taxation. Do not let it be said that there is not enough money going into State coffers. The States should have some idea of what they can give to local government. They stand criticised and forever damned because they prevented local government authorities from making applications to the Loan Council. They opposed the referendum that would have allowed that. The other matters are machinery matters, but I want to refer to the question of regions. They are acceptable because the councUs themselves have agreed to form themselves into regions. Evidence of that acceptance is the fact that this year 20 regions have applied in their ownrightto be considered for grants. It is worthwhile because it was never thought and never intended that this money was to be in lieu of rates or in lieu of existing personnel. If the local authority in Coolah is going to sack 2 men, that has nothing to do with these grants. In fact the amount of money going to Coolah is twice what the State Government is giving to it. The whole idea of the grant is to level the amenities in an area or a region. That is the objective. The proposition that the grant is to be made in Ueu of rates or on some other basis is untenable, and that was made clear in an answer to a question. There are areas that are under-privUeged and need assistance other than what they can get by rates. Take the position that exists, for example, in Stirling. It has a big grant of $490,000. I understand that there was some criticism that it was not getting its money under the regional employment development scheme. I am told that it would be the only council that has not qualified. am told that there must be some problems with its application, because all other Western Australia have been able to get these benefits. I understand that there was some tardigovernment ness in Western Australia because the State other matters. Government did not make the appropriate be due in the main appointments to the State committee in the apgovernment becausetovoting propriate time. These are matters that have noth-elections is now voluntary.in ing to do with this Bill. The real issues are these: For thefirsttime money has been given to local government, despite the fact that the Opposition for 23 had a chance to do something. We have heard criticism to the effect that inflation has taken away the value of all those benefits. We are the Party which went to the people and asked for power to control prices and we were refused. lost a referendum on the question because Opposition vigorously fought it on the basis there was no need to control prices because the States could do it. These are the real fundamenthere tals of why we have problems in the prices and incomes areas. We do not have the power to con-ordination trol the situation. The spokesman who led for the Opposition this debate said that the Australian Government was the pacesetter in the wages it was paying public servants. Let me remind him that as at June last a clerk in the Austrahan PubUc Service was receiving $1,600 less than a clerk employed by the Melbourne City Council. An analysis of organisation. comparable wages and conditions clearly shows that clerical employees of semi-government authorities in Victoria particularly are $1,000 $1,600 better off than their counterparts in the Australian PubUc Service. So that argument has no weight whatsoever. It is a faUacy to say that pacesetting arrangement has been made by Australian Government. I give the assurance, as I have indicated, that the Grants Commission will be looking again new formats and perhaps new methods of taking evidence. In support of my colleague, the ter for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), let me say that die regional concept has good deal of merit. People within regions use each other's faculties irrespective of the local government area they are in. It is important that those regions be buUt up. Every region received an aUocation from the Grants Commission. the Admittedly some councUs within the regions did not get a grant but every region got a grant. sum of $56.3m is a very substantial contribution. I The aUocations show that all States got substantial amounts of money that they could not councils in have got otherwise. If there are problems in other areas of local they could be due to a number of In New South Wales they would the loss of status by local local government About only 20 per cent of the people bother to vote. It takes about 800 people to elect an alderman. Very few people are interested, and local government has lost its status in New South Wales. It will take years compulsory voting and other measures to get people involved and interested. It may take the organisation of councUs into groups to overcome the spurious situation that exists in Sydney when the city was hived off so that it could be politiWe cally dominated by one Party. If we continue to the fragment local government with every councU that running its own works program with its own engineers, its own steamroller and its own truck, wiU be very Uttle chance of getting efficiency. We need to get co-operation and coso we can build up a good works and construction program, particularly where there is an opportunity to do massive work. That is why in in many areas local government is pleading for somefinancialsupport It will be noticed from to some of the submissions that the whole of the revenue is taken up in wages. There is no money for other activities, including the purchase of materials. This just could not produce efficient The upshot of all this debate is that the Oppoto sition is not opposing the Bill. We welcome that. The guarantee we give now is that the Bill will be passed by this House this evening and should be a passed by the Senate next week. The allocation the should be made the following week. That satisfies the sole complaint of the Opposition.",91
174,Mr VINER,FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TERMS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. at Mr SPEAKER-Order! Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? Minis Mr VINER- I do. I claim to have been misrepresented by the Special Minister of State (Mr a Lionel Bowen). Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I had spoken for two or three minutes. After the House rose for dinner I spoke to the Minister and told him that I would expect to speak for another 10 minutes. I sat down before clock had run its course. I would have spoken for 12 or 13 minutes. If I went two or three minThe utes over I apologise, but I had something to say on behalf of the city of Stirling and I wanted to say it. If the Minister is not prepared to grant an indulgence of two or three minutes in the spirit in which I was prepared to cut down my speaking in order to meet the desires of the Government, then I am sorry for him. I do not believe that in any way I breached an agreement that was reached with the Minister. Quesuon resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) read a third time. NA The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or request: Appropriation Bill (No. I) 1974-75. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1974-75. NA NA",92
175,Mr SPEAKER,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"I wish to inform the House of the following nominations of members to be members of the Select Committee on Specific learning Difficulties: Mr Innes, Mr Mathews and Mr Oldmeadow have been nominated by the Prime Minister; Mr Cadman and Mr Wilson have been nominated by the Leader of the Opposition; and Mr MCVeigh has been nominated by the Leader of the Australian AGED PERSONS HOSTELS BILL 1974 Debate resumed from 2 October, on motion the by Mr Hayden: That the Bill be now read a second time.",93

Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I should Uke to suggest that it may the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering the Bill, the DeUvered Meals Subsidy Bill and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Bill as they are associated measures. Septo arate questions will of course be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the ject matter of the 3 BUls to be discussed in debate.",93
177,Mr SPEAKER,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",93
178,Mr CHIPP,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES," Mr Speaker, we are debating 3 BUls-the DeUvered Meals Subsidy Bill, the Aged Persons Hostels Bill and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Bill. I have music for the Minister's ears because not only is the Opposition going to support these 3 Bills but it is going to commend the Government and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) for the Third Reading reforms that have been included in the BUls. The charge is often made against the Opposition that it is obstructionist, that it opposes for the sake of opposing. I want to go on record as saying quite categorically that these are very commendable amendments that have been made in these 3 areas of social need. The Minister has a passion for quoting me; he has a passion also for speaking loudly whUe I am talking. The Minister has a passion for quoting me, not only in answer to questions and not only in the House but also in documents printed by his Department. He has an equal passion for misquoting me on occasion, and I do hope that the remarks I have just made at the opening of my speech commending the Government for these reforms are not used out of context, because we in the Opposition still find some areas in the BUls about which to be critical. Indeed, in relation to the Aged Persons Hostels Bill, in Committee I shall be moving an amendment to extend the operation of that Bill for another 2 years.",93
179,Mr HAYDEN,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,Are those the notes I gave you Country Party. for your speech?,93
180,Mr CHIPP,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"One thing about the Minister Second Reading that does not improve is his sense of humour. ThefirstBUI is the Delivered Meals Subsidy Bill, purpose of which is to give effect to one of the items mentioned in the Budget, that is, to increase the rate of subsidy payable under the Meals Subsidy Act by 5c a meal. That an increase from 20c to 25c a meal deUvered, or 30c if the meal includes an approved vitamin C supplement. The Minister has not heeded my suit suggestion that he might include a subsidy for vitamin E. I might add that, as the Minister said, while many very good services are being developed in some States of the Commonwealth supplement what we are doing, the Australian Government is far from satisfied with the rate of their growth. The Minister said that he hopes to subexamine ways and means by which a greater this coverage of these services can be obtained. I agree with what the Minister said then, and I commend him for saying that he is looking at ways and means of getting greater coverage. I should also like on behalf of the Opposition to join with the Minister when he congratulates and thanks the hundreds-o r is it thousands?-of volunteers around Austraha for their continuing assistance in supporting the Meals on Wheels service. It is a selfless, sometimes thankless of many hundreds or thousands of women who is serve in an honorary capacity. The Minister also said that in many cases the social contact with Meals on Wheels volunteer is as welcome to the aged recipient as is the meal. Both the Governsubsidy, ment Party and the Opposition Parties agree that it is best to keep aged people in their homes long as possible, and the Meals on Wheels serthe vice allows that to be done. I believe that only do the meals provide nutritional value aged people but that the Meals on Wheels concies tact performs an even more important social function. To many old people livmg alone it the only social contact they have for that day that week. Those of us who live the kind of life we Uve can never appreciate the loneliness that there must be for an old person who is friendless, $13,000. quite often without relatives, Uving alone without any social contact at aU. I also commend the Government on the publications that it has issued-the Meals on Wheels Food Guide and the other pubUcations which have been updated. The Opposition agrees with aU this. But we disappointed that the Government has not for implemented that part of the Liberal poUcy-it becoming quite tedious now that almost every day the Government is stealing Liberal-Country Party poUcy-in relation to Meals on Wheels, which the Liberal Party wants the service exisation, tended to 365 days a year for certain elderly people for whom a doctor's prescription has been obtained. The Opposition believes that this is a service that would not cost very much and is one part of its policy which it would implement as soon as it returned to office. The history of the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Bill is that under the Aged Persons Homes Act the Australian Government makes grants to non-profit organisations and local governing bodies towards the cost of providing homes for aged persons. When the Act was inaUy introduced by a Liberal Party-Country Party Government in 1954 the subsidy was on $1 for $1 basis. In 1957 the rate of subsidy increased to $2 for $1 and has remained at level ever since. This Bill does 4 things, the of which is to aUegedly-and I say allegedlythinking double the rate of the present subsidy from for $1 to $4 for $1.1 point out that thisnot dare use a term such as lacking in honesty or deceitful as far as the Minister is concerned, but I would say that the promise of the $4 for $1 subsidy could be quite illusory. I am not happy with the maximum ceiling Umits which are contained in the Minister's second reading speech on this Bill or the associated task Bill. I believe that the maximum limit of $11,700 unrealistic, in terms of today's buUding costs, for the buUding of such a unit. I had in fact the drafted an amendment forcing the Minister to have as a floor $ 13,000 as a minimum amount of but I withdrew that because I did not believe it was responsible to impact that kind of as limitation on the Minister when I had not done sort of detaUed research that I should like to not have done. Also, I understand that because of for the Government's catastrophic economic polithere are many motels and the like coming onto the market because they are not economiis caUy viable and these are avaUable for the or Government to purchase and would make ideal aged persons' hostels. In those circumstances the cost of the units would be considerably less than Can I Ulustrate how the $4 for $1 subsidy can be deceptive or Ulusory? Assuming the actual cost of a unit is $13,000-that seems to be a figure that is a median, according to those from whom I have inquired-the maximum subsidy on are that is $9,360, which would mean that on a $4 $1 basis the organisation would have to conis tribute $2,340. That makes a total of $11,700, which I submit is not enough to buUd a unit these days. This would mean that another $1,300 by would have to be found by the voluntary organwhich would mean that the relative contributions would be $9,360 from the Government and $3,640 from the voluntary organisation, making a total of $13,000. On that basis it the rate of government subsidy is therefore not $4-for-$ 1; it is less than $3-for-$ 1. Mr King-Closer to $2-for-$ 1.",93
181,Mr CHIPP,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"In some areas, as my friend reminds me, it goes down as low as $2-for-$l. The second provision of the Bill is that it extends the provisions of the Aged Persons Homes Act to orighandicapped adults. Again we commend the Government for this enUghtened move. Prea viously anybody under the age of 60 years was was forbidden from being accommodated in an aged that persons home if it attracted a subsidy. This first impacted great hardship on many people. I am of the elderly parent who has had a $2 mongoloid chUd, for example, and who has nurI wouldsed that child through to adulthood. When widowed that parent cannot be admitted to aged persons home because she does not want leave her mentally retarded child and she cannot take that child into the aged persons home. While we commend the proposition of opening aged persons homes to handicapped adults we would hope that it is not extended to the extent where teenagers are mixed up with elderly people as a matter of course. We are very aware of the multi-purpose institutions established the Victorian government in the early 1900s. only in recent times that they have been slowly converted to special hospitals for the aged. would be a retrograde step to go back to that when they were multi-purpose institutions. think it would be disastrous to make it a matter of course that such institutions take in young people.",94
182,Mr HAYDEN,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,I would agree with that.,95
183,Mr CHIPP,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"I take the Minister's interjection and thank him for it. The third thing that the Bill does is to extend the personal care rate from $12 to $15 a week. This is absolutely necessary. the Minister said, hostels play an important role by providing accommodation for elderly people who, whilst no longer able to look after selves in independent units, do not need the more expensive medically oriented care provided by a nursing home. We would welcome this proposal but would ask the Minister review it continually because the rate of inflation would soon erode the additional benefit given. The fourth measure in the Bill allows local councils to attract the subsidy on moneys boris rowed. We welcome this proposal but we wonder what it is worth because, although this now allows a local council to attract the subsidy to build an aged persons home on moneys it obtains from loans, I am informed by many councils with whom I have spoken that they not get enough loan funds now to meet their other needs, and one would wonder what practical benefit of this so-called reform However, we would support it on principle. The Minister also said that he wanted to an announcement concerning the maximum subMinister sidy Umits payable under the Aged Persons matter Homes Act and the Aged Persons These announcements were made following a report presented by a working party of officers the Department of Social Security and the Treasury. It did essentiaUy 5 things. First of increased the maximum subsidy Umits payable under the Aged Persons Homes Act to $7,800 a single unit and $9,100 for a double unit. ondly, it increased the subsidy limits for aged persons hostels to $11,700 for each person an accommodated. We had contemplated, as I say, to an amendment to that, but I was dissuaded from it for the reasons that I gave. Thirdly, the Minister announced that it had been decided that the present maximum subsidy Umits which took effect from 1 April 1974 shaU apply to projects which were in the course of construction at that date and, I presume, beyond that date. I would commend that proposition. Perhaps the most sigby nificant thing that the Government has adopIt is ted-and this has been largely through Opposition prompting-is that cost increases due to the It rise and fall clause in buUding contracts in era respect of work carried out since 1 April 1974 We will be subsidised. If the Minister would look carefully at that paragraph and ifi am any judge of the meaning of English words, I think he wouldfindthat the Uteral interpretation of it is that theriseand fall clauses would apply to those contracts between 1 April 1974 and the date upon which royal assent is given to this Bill. I would not imagine that that is what the Minister meant. I believe that the Minister meant that the As rise and fall clauses in buUding contracts will now be a permanent feature of this subsidy legislation. I would like an assurance from the themMimster on that point when he responds. Thefifthannouncement was that the introduction of zone loadings for country areas where to buUding costs are abnormaUy high should be given further study. I think my friends in the Country Party and those rural members of the Liberal Party would join me when I say that this one area in which we can be critical of the Government. Surely this proposition has been proved beyond doubt, namely, that to build an aged persons home in Rockharnpton is more costly than buUding one in Brisbane. Why that would need so much further study, I do not can-know. In fact, the Seaman Committee of the Social Welfare Commission estimated that the the cost of buUding an aged persons home in is. Rockharnpton-m y friend from Kennedy (Mr Katter) might support me in this-is 40 per cent higher than the cost of buUding an aged persons make home in Brisbane. For how much longer is the and his Department going to give this further study before some relief is given Hostels Act. to these people? of FinaUy on this Bill I would like to say that we believe that Australia needs a complete plan of aU, it aged care which includes accommodation as only one of its aspects. The present Aged Persons for Homes Act and Aged Persons Hostels Act are Secisolated programs which, whUst good, should be seen in a complete picture. I would Uke to see the Government give more emphasis to preventive, remedial and rehabilitation programs, because the less emphasis there is given in those areas more the need forflats,hostels, homes and nursbut ing homes. Surely the whole thrust of a social curity program should be to keep people as are aging out of institutions, whether they be by the State, whether they be run by the Governicy ment, or whether they be run by somebody else. days. One of the issues implicit in a debate such as is the aged who cannot care for themselves. There are only 3 groups of people who can care for elderly people. They are the person's own family, a voluntary organisation or the State. One of the sad things about the 20th century is the nuclear family and the decline of the exbuUdings tended family unit which has left thefieldof carare ing for the aged largely in the hands of voluntary organisations or the States. Because of rising buUding costs the voluntary organisations are finding it more difficult to keep in the running. The Mmister has indicated that the capital costs met by voluntary organisations over the last 4 years has fallen from 20 per cent in 1970-71 to 10 per cent in 1973-74. Donations from residents have increased to more than quarter of the capital cost in the same period. example of a percentage of total cost of aged sons homes is that in 1973-74 the Government contributed 61 per cent. The residents who were going into the home had to contribute 29 per and the voluntary organisations contributed per cent. We believe that a voluntary organisaUow ation run by a charitable, religious or which philanthropic institution is much to be preferred to a government institutionalised set-up. Theresuch fore, if one accepts that, does it not make sense encourage people to give to voluntary organisThe ations? In a situation in which the proportion given by voluntary organisations is falling cause of inflation we now have the position where absolute insanity is beingfloatedby Government about doing away with taxation deto ductions for donations to religious, phUanthropic and other bodies. The Government hasflowna . kite about this matter. It has flown it on more than one occasion. The Government has leaked out its intentions in its normal way awaiting reaction.

Mr Berinson-Did you not hear the Treasurer say that that was not under consideration?",95
184,Mr CHIPP,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"That gives me Uttle comfort. I do the not want to be a smart alec in retorting to that, we do not know for how long the Treasurer se- (Mr Crean) is going to be Treasurer. We have they had countless examples of Ministers making run statements in this chamber about matters of poland of those poUcies being reversed within this There is one other point that I should make about who is paying for what proportion of the cost of homes. I share the Minister's concern that voluntary organisations, through no fault of their own, are contributing less and less to the capital costs. They are in charge of mUlions of dollars of and equipment; yet their contributions diminishing. I hope that from the statements that the Minister is constantly making on this matter he is not foreshadowing a further intrusion of the Government to the extent of running completely institutionaUsed aged persons homes. I believe that that would be a retrograde share of step to take in our community. In speaking of the importance of an aged persons homes scheme, I would like to pay a tribute oneto one organisation involved in this field, An namely, the Italian Community Service Fund. perThis organisation has acquired 25 acres of land at South Morang in Victoria and wishes to set up a 3-stage complex for elderly Italians. This site cent has the advantage of being very central to the 9.7 ItaUan population and of being large enough to for the development of a total care project could include self-contained flats, hostel units and, ultimately, nursing care. Already one complex has been funded at Austral in Sydto ney under the auspices of the Scalabrini Fathers. problem that the Italian Community Service Fund is having is one which is common to the bewhole community, that is, of inflation leading to massive increases in buUding costs. The Italian the Community Service Fund estimated in relation thefirststage, which was to be a self-contained units stage, that the cost as at June 1974 would be $13,500 per unit. However, by October 1974-onl y 4 months later-the projected cost for each unit had risen to a staggering $16,075. I some commend the ItaUan Community for its selflessin doing that in the face of the fearful odds pubUc which are besetting the community. The third and final Bill is the Aged Persons medHostels Bill. The Opposition welcomes the in caramendments to the Aged Persons Hostels Act is provided for in this Bill which was intTDduced by a Liberal-Country Party Government in 1972. But the Opposition fears that the amendments contained in this Bill are too little too late. We estimate that there are 50,000 pensioners who are neither in their own homes nor in some form of subsidised accommodation or paying reasonable rents. The immediate need for aged persons tels has only to be stated to be proved. The legisnext lation we are now debating is complementary to the Aged Persons Homes Act EUgible organismid-November. ations receive entitlements on the basis of 2 beds for every unsubsidised bed they currently operend ate or one bed for every 2 beds subsidised in first few years of the Aged Persons Homes Act on a$l for$l basis. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to Government's announcement of March, which has been referred to on a number of occasions since then, that the capital grant payable under the Aged Persons Hostels Act would be ganisation increased from $7,800 to $9,000 per person retrospective to 1 April 1974. In a subsequent statement the Minister has announced that that figure has been increased to $11,700. We agree with the Government that there is a need for ping more hostel accommodation for the aged, ticularly for hostels in which personal care vices can be provided for those who have come fraU but do not need nursing attention. Unfortunately the lack of suitable hostel accomaccept modation in the past has resulted in the less ceptable and more expensive nursing beds being utilised for such purposes. I share the Minister's concern about that This Bill also seeks to do something progressive with which we are entirely in agreement know that many organisations which have entitlements under the Aged Persons Hostels Act do not propose to take advantage of them. That is for a variety of reasons. They might want to specialise in some other area of social need, they might not have the funds at thattimeor they might have some other reason. This Bill will allow a voluntary organisation to transfer its entitlement to another organisation. We lotted thoroughly support that. In the period of the eration of the Act since 27 September 1972 tel accommodation has been approved for 2,111 aged people. National entitlements to a total 14,000 or more free hostel beds exist. In other words, with less than one year of the Act left run options on 12,000 free hostel beds remain be taken up by voluntary organisations. In the Committee stage of the debate on Bill I will be moving an amendment which seeks to extend the period of operation of this Act another 2 years. I appeal to the Minister, if i have his indulgence for just 10 seconds, to conMinister template the stupidity of refusing such an he amendment. This legislation will cease to be Act of Parliament at the end of September next year. The Mmister has tried to window dress the situation to some extent by saying that these hosamendments will not operate from 1 January year but from when the Bill receives royal assent. He has made a big deal of that. It is now This Bill has to go through the Senate. It will not receive royal assent until the of this month. So what is the Minister doing? the He is saying to everybody: 'You have another month', as if that is some sort of great concession. Let us contemplate what is going to happen in the the 10 months before this legislation ceases to be an Act of Parliament. There are 12,000 entitlements to beds under this legislation. Does the Minister seriously think that a voluntary orUke the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Uke the Council for the Aged and like many Catholic, Jewish, Salvation Army and phUanthropic societies would do a deal with another voluntary organisation, arrange a swapof entitlements, call in architects, get plans parprepared, obtain estimates, mount a pubUc serappeal and obtain the necessary funds by 27 beSeptember next year? The Minister must know that the period has to be extended. If he does not the Opposition's amendment he will not acbe giving any confidence to those voluntary organisations to start planning because those voluntary organisations have to spend real money and devote a whole lot oftimeto planning. In the State of Victoria public appeals are We organised by the Hospitals and Charities Commission. The Brotherhood of St Laurence, for example, cannot decide to build some aged persons hostels and expect to be able to conduct a pubUc appeal next month to raise $ 100,000 to do so because it is illegal to conduct an appeal in a month other than that which is allotted by the Hospitals and Charities Commission. It might not be until 1976 that an organisation can be ala month in which to conduct an appeal. I opwould like the Minister to contemplate accepthosance of the Opposition's amendment so that these organisations can be given some assurance of that they can go ahead and plan and spend money, confident that the Act will be continued. to With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to to get some indication from the Minister as to whether he would be prepared to accept such a this sensible amendment from the Opposition.",96
185,Mr BERINSON,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"The honourfor able member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) started his can speech by saying he had music for the ears of the for Social Security (Mr Hayden) in that intended not only to accept these BUls but also an to commend the Government upon them. I think that the least one can do, reciprocating in the same spirit of friendship and co-operation, is to case say to the honourable member for Hotham that resident I, in turn, agree with him in his commendation of 1973 the Government for this legislation. It is a great eligibility pleasure to be able to do this if only because on ageso many occasions he and I seem to follow each other in social security debates under different sets of circumstances. I propose to deal mainly with questions arising Who from the Aged Persons Homes Act. This Act has been subject to regular amendment since it was first introduced in 1954. Amendments have come with increasing frequency in the last 5 years. During that recent period I think I would have spoken on most of the debates on this subject but, frankly, I must say that this is a task which becoming harder astimepasses, especially as the Government's term of office lengthens. This viously is not because the scheme has become of any less important than it was or that the Labor Government is less interested in it than were predecessors; on the contrary, very close attenmedication tion has been paid to this scheme by the Governassistance ment and so many useful changes have already that been made over the past 2 years that one starts run out of hopefully helpful suggestions as to how it might be further improved. Particularly welcome in the present Bill is the proposed change of title of the Act from the Aged Persons Homes Act to the Aged or DisanomaUes abled Persons Homes Act, reflecting as this does the extension of the class of eUgible residents from aged persons only to disabled persons as well. In previous debates I have had occasion comment on the pecuUar emphasis which crops up in so many areas of our social security legisscheme, lation based on old age consideration. The fact that people of 65 years and over have never, as matter of necessity, had greater need of the special benefits and subsidies of the old persons' homes provisions than people who are under the age of 65. Indeed, as a means test has never apity plied under this scheme, the reverse could well have been the case in a number of situations. In that context I refer in particular to people the invalid pension, for example. The same well be said of the personal care subsidy. The description and background of that scheme may be found on page 58 of the latest providing annual report of the Department of Social Securnursing ity. I think the description is worth quoting and I This commend it. I reads: This subsidy is intended to assist organisations conducting hostel accommodation for the aged to meet the cost of providing meals and to employ sufficient staff to assist hostel residents who need help with bathing and dressing, the cleaning of their rooms, their personal laundry and the oversight of their medication, and to be available at all dmes in of emergency. Until the earlier part of 1973-74, payment was made on the basis of $10 a week for each hostel aged 80 years and over, but as from 4 December the rate of payment was increased to $12 a week and extended to also cover residents under 80 years of I interpolate here to say 'to over 65 years of age' because that was the lower Umit of admissions to these homesrequire and receive the specified personal care services. I trunk it would be clear, without having to stress the point, that the age of 80 which was originally imposed was a completely arbitrary line to draw. I suppose aU honourable members know people of 80 years and more and who are still very spry and completely able to look after themselves. is Conversely we know many people well under the age of 80 who are unable to care for themselvesobfor that matter we know of many under the age 65-and , in fact, are in need of help with bathing and dressing, the cleaning of their rooms, its their personal laundry, the oversight of their and the same sort of availabUity of in the case of emergency. The point arises from this is that the original limiting to age of 80 was obviously an arbitrary age. After the initial amendment in 1973 we were still left with what is after all an arbitrary age of 65, and it is quite difficult tofindany justification for it. To the extent that both of these age based are now corrected-that is in respect of both the personal care subsidy and the age of admittance-in what will now be known as the aged or disabled persons homes, this Bill is very to welcome. I wonder if I could stretch a point sUghtly and draw an analogy with another still old age based, which I think should is be subject to the same considerations now apa pUed to the aged persons homes. I refer again, as I have done in previous debates, to the domiciliary nursing care benefit. I again refer to the annual report of the Department of Social Securfor a description of this scheme which I think very will again make the argument I am trying to present almost self-evident. The description on appears on page 87 of the report under the headcould ing 'DomicUiary Nursing Care Benefit' and reads: A domiciliary nursing care benefit is payable to a person care for an aged relative who requires professional care to an extent that would otherwise justify admission to a nursing home. The rate of benefit is $ 14 a week. benefit was introduced in March 1973 as an incentive to people to care for sick and frail aged people who are in need of continual nursing care and supervision in the home environment. In addidon to being an incentive payment, the benefit has enabled families to meet the extra costs involved in caring for the aged. Such costs could include special diets, laundry and visiting nurse payments. Here again I think the same argument is relevant-ther e is no problem. In a previous debate the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) interjected during my speech at about this point to remind me of the position of quadriplegics or paraplegics. Of course that is a situation which can arise at any age and which needs precisely the sort of services mentioned here. In fact, with respect to the desirability of maintaining disadvantaged people in their own home environment, that could be a matter of even greater concern with younger people than with aged people who are at present the only beneficiaries of this domicihary nursing care benefit. I urge the Government- I am sure this would be one of the many continuing proposals under review-to keep under active consideration extension into field of the domiciliary nursing care benefit of the principle that this Bill. Apart from other considerations, such change wouldfillin the gap which now seems me to exist between the domicihary nursing care benefit which provides this assistance for care home for people over age 65 and the handinelled capped child allowance which provides a similar sort of benefit for the care of people under 16. If I understand the position correctly we are left with a rather odd and anomalous gap bea tween those 2 age limits. I go on to discuss briefly, as the honourable member for Hotham did, this question of ing shires to use loan funds. With him I agree that this is probably something worth doing while the whole scheme is under review. But a different reason from his, I doubt whether there is very much in it. If I understood the honourable member for Hotham, he was really arguing that this amendment was not of much use because local governing bodies in any case were short loan funds for their ordinary would put the limitations on the usefulness of this amendment on the different ground, namely, that for all practical purposes this has a limiting factor on any local government body which really wanted to involve itself in the field. Minister It has always been possible for local governWhip ment bodies wanting to use loan funds rather than rates to sponsor an organisation into their loan funds can be channelled. This has been speech. done in many of the cases. Nonetheless, fact that such a roundabout procedure is availappeared able and that the availabihty of it was always known-w e had the peculiar position of the Department and Ministers always writing to councils who raised this question and saying: 'Well, you can always get around it'-lead s me say that it seems to me that if there is this roundabout method of achieving this end and if no secret is being made of it, it might as well be made a direct method instead of a roundabout method. That, for what it is worth, is what this amendment will achieve. I hope that it may have at least some marginal effect in encouraging local government bodies into thisfield.So far as I am aware- I think I am correct on this point-ther e is only one aged persons home sponsored by a shire in my electorate. There are many aged persons homes there. But the only one sponsored by a shire is in the shire of Bayswater, Mertome Village. This is a first class development. It is still in the course of expansion and, I think, a model which other the local government bodies might well follow. Hopefully, this small amendment will encourage is involved in them along that line. a Referring again to this recent annual report to from the Department, onefindsthat in the last financial year, 1973-74, a very significant drop at occurred in the amount of money being chaninto the operations of the Aged Persons Homes Act. That sum fell from $22m in 1972-73 age to $ 17.4m in 1973-74, using roundfigures.That is a drop of roughly 20 per cent. It occurred over period when building costs, I think, would have increased by 20 per cent. So, adding both of those factors together, one can readily appreciate that the development in thisfielddropped sigallownificantly in the pastfinancialyear. The annualreportmakes the point that this for was more than covered in terms of accommodation by expansion in the hostel area. But I think that does not really answer the point of concern as I doubt whether anyone could really question that there exists as much potential deof mand for this sort of accommodation now as in purposes. But I previous years. Mr Adermann- Iriseto take a point of order. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that never been no Minister is present in the House.",97
186,Mr SPEAKER,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"It is the usual practice for a to be at the table. I ask the Government to see that a Minister enters the House to take up that position. In the meantime, I ask the which honourable member for Perth to continue his the very Mr BERINSON-I was pointing to what to be a very serious slow down over the past year in this scheme and suggesting that the obvious reason for it was a combination of increased costs of building and also the subsidy Umits. These have both been increased. The proto portion of subsidies increased from $2 for $1 to $4 for $1 in the legislation. As the Minister Social Security indicated in his second reading speech, although he did not require the Bill to achieve this, the maximum amounts of subsidy have also been substantially increased. I intrude into the comments that I wish to make at this point to draw some attention to what I think may have been some sort of misapwhom prehension by the honourable member for be Hotham when he was quoting some of the new figures and what he said was still their easy insufficiency. The. honourable member for own Hotham, if I understood him correctly, said relation to the hostels legislation that only $11,700 a unit was now being allowed, that he estimated that costs would be approximately $13,000 a unit and that he then did a calculation of four-fiths of $11,700, assuming that the other fifth would be by way of donor entry, and said that that still left an organisation $1,300 on top of the aUowance. If I have understood the honourable member for Hotham correctly I think that he was confusing 2 separate schemes. The legislation relating to hostels is subject to the $4 for $1 subsidy-the outright grant. That is thefirstpoint. The second point is this: I wonder whether the honourable member for Hotham in making his own calculation of about $13,000 a single unit might have been once including in thatfiguresome estimate of the cost of land a unit. If so, that would tend to balance out his concern. The position with respect to hostels legislation is that subsidies of $11,700 a unit for the buUding are additional grants up to $2,400 a unit for land are also avaUable separately. The changes which have been brought about by this Bill and by the associated regulations in respect of the increase of the proportion of subthat sidy to $4 for $ 1 and in particular the increase the maximum aUowable amount of subsidy should quickly reverse the trend which we saw last year of a decline in the growth of units under this scheme. I wish to make one point about the reversion to rapid growth of scheme. I personaUy welcome that at this point. am aware that a number of people are now ing to question the desirability of the sorts of aged persons homes developments that we have. When these first started with individual units being provided, the argument was developed Act that this was unbalanced and that what we had to have was a sort of triple layer scheme of independent units, accompanied by hostel units and nursing homes, to complete the normal requirements. That seemed to be accepted as highly desirable. for In later times questions have arisen with people arguing about the possible undesirabUity of what they are starting to call aged enclaves or old people's ghettoes. I am not equipped to enter into that argument very well. What I can say from my own observations of many of these homes is that they have performed a remarkably useful function for people in the age groups for they are catering. My own position would that I like this scheme until somebody can actuaUy come up with something better. It is very to talk in terms of keeping people in their homes, to claim that the environment is betin ter, and that we should concentrate more on domicihary care. The truth so far as I can observe is that it has been extremely difficult to develop an adequate domiciliary service. If we are to change to emphasis on domiciUary service, let us make absolutely certain that this is avaUable first before we start talking about scrapping or reducwith a deficit of ing this scheme. I end with 2 questions to the Minister. These not again are matters which I have raised very often but which I feel become more pertinent, given our increased aid. Firstly, I think we should look again at the possibUity of reducing donor entries to first entry only, eliminating altogether, and and for aU, 'resale' of these units. The second question that I would put to him, also arising from this extended support of the scheme, is: the Could we not develop a system by which mainup to tenance charges in these homes come under avaUable but Commonwealth review.",99
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES, Order! The honourable member'stimehas expored.,100
188,Mr WILSON,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"The legislation we are considering this evening is legislation in that has developed over a number of years. The germ of the idea inherent in the 3 BUls now under discussion wasfirstidentified many years built ago when the Liberal-Country Party Government was in office. When the scheme known as this the Aged Persons Homes Scheme was first I introduced the crying need in the community comwas to provide self-contained units for aged people. It is useful for us to look at the purpose of the legislation because it is still there and it has remained there unamended. The purpose of the is to encourage and to assist in the provision of suitable homes for aged persons, and in particular homes in which aged persons may reside in conditions approaching as nearly as possible domestic Ufe, and in the case of married people with proper regard to the companionship of husband and wife. When the scheme wasfirstintroduced it got under way slowly and then it captured the imagination of many charitable, religious benevolent organisations which could see here that people in need could be assisted if those ganisations organised themselves to take advanThere tage of the capital funds that were available fromin the Government. So the scheme was expanded to a point where it provides accommodation for over 50,000 senior citizens. But in the process of this expansion, as the needs of those who of required self-contained accommodation began to be met, other needs rose in priority. Do not we so often find that something which seems urgentfore today tends to obliterate some underlying need criteria which in later time as we relieve thefirstpressure then assumes equal proportions. So the Liberalment Country Party Government identified the need for an expansion of hostel units, an expansion nursing home accommodation and the Aged Persons Homes Act was therefore amended to incorporate those provisions. The Act was also added to so that the personal care subsidy could be paid to organisations providing hostel care. This enabled these organisations to provide ditions for which patients or residents could afford to pay if they had only a pension on to Uve. In addition, of course, the previous Governproved ment introduced and expanded the concept of nursing home benefits, the domicUiary nursing represent care benefit, the deUvered meal subsidy introduced the Aged Persons Hostels Act separinvestigation ate and apart from the Aged Persons Homes Act. AU of these initiatives were taken by a LiberalAs Country Party Government. What we nowfindis that the present Labor Government is claiming lot of credit for the idea of a scheme, the founthat dations of which were laid before it came to office. We welcome the legislation now before the House, but we welcome it only after a period of time has elapsed during which this imaginathe tive scheme was nearly strangled by the faUure the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) to exercise his administrative authority to Uft tain Umits, which I wiU describe in a moment, realistic levels. But before I come to that, I would Uke to touch on a point that the honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson) raised, namely the question of the personal care subsidy. The legislation before is designed to increase the personal care subsidy from $12 to $15. The honourable member talked about an age Umit as if some great importance was attached to that. He talked about aboUtion of the age Umit making the benefit avaUable to aU persons who qualified according to criteria estabUshed by the Department of Social Security. and When the age Umit of 80 years appUed it was estimated that 41 per cent of patients in hostels orwere in receipt of the personal care subsidy. were wild estimates as to how a reduction the age limit would increase the percentage of patients receiving this benefit. It was suggested that the percentage would go up to 67 per cent of the residents of hostels. If one looks at the report the Director of Social Security onefindsthat a number of residents in hostels who receive this benefit has risen to only 54 per cent. One is thereleft in a quandary as to whether or not the that are being set are tootight.I raise this issue to urge that the Minister and his Departhave a look to ensure that the criteria are not tootightand that people who should be of receiving the benefit are in fact given it. It is becoming increasingly important-and much of what the honourable member for Perth had to say underiined this point-that detaUed statistics and information as to the needs of the conaged in the community be sought. There was a time when it was thought that for each indepenwhich dent Uving unit buUt under the Aged Persons Homes Act there should be one hostel unit and one nursing home bed. It is quite clear from the experience of the estabUshed organisations apunder the Aged Persons Homes Act that the arbitrary allocation of priorities does not the facts of the situation. I think there is and a need for a broad and wide-ranging into the needs of aged persons. I mentioned at the outset of my remarks this evening, the Aged Persons Homes Act began a to identify a problem, a problem of recognition there was a need for assistance in a wide and comprehensive area. I would therefore urge that such an investigation be set in train so that when we come to allocate funds we are able to identify order of priorities according to what people ofwant and not what people in authority think they want. I would also raise the point touched on by certhe honourable member for Perth in regard to to the existing anomaly in the domicUiary nursing care benefit. It is quite unreasonable to retain the Umit at 65 years of age. I have to my own knowledge come across 2 cases in which an aged person is caring for a sick wife who happens to be aged 60. She is not eligible for the benefit. But if us the ages had been reversed the fanuiy would have been entitled to the benefit. It seems to me-and I urge that this be done-that the age Umit should be reduced to comply with pensionable age and that the benefit should also be expanded so that it is avaUable at least to those sick persons who are being cared for by another person who is himself or herself in receipt of age pension. I would now like to turn to the building and provision of accommodation for the aged under the Aged Persons Homes Act. There has been a tragic decline in the building program under this Act. The number of units built under the Act declined in 1973-74 by 572. That means that over 600 senior citizens who today could be in this type of accommodation are deprived of it. Why is this the position? the Labor Government came to office it found that the annual review of subsidy benefits availthat able under the Aged Persons Homes Act was due. In fact, the benefits had last been examined in January 1972. In the past the subsidy benefits had always been adjusted to take account of building costs and changes in the price of land. happened But the Minister said that he would examine the again sees that matter. He told us this very early in 1972. He halt. This requirement continued with that process of examination whenever asked about it indicated that he was and the way in which thepressures still awaiting the report. Then in November 1973 he received a report and as at that date his own committee of inquiry about recommended that the subsidy increased substantially. The committee recincrease ommended that the subsidy for a single unit avaUable. should be increased to $6,000 from $5,200 with the provision of a new benefit to take account the cost of land. Similar increases were urged double units. But in spite of the pubUcation that report and in spite of the fact that by report's recommendations becoming known, raising the expectations not only of those isations providing accommodation for the aged but also of the many hundreds of thousands of appUcants who were waiting for the various oris ganisations to say that they were going ahead with their buUding programs, this Minister nothing. He did nothing until April of this year. Even then he only Ufted the subsidy in accordunder ance with the recommendations of the Comrelate mittee that he had asked to investigate the ter. In ordinary circumstances, one would say 20 that that was a good thing, that is, the Minister the per accepted the recommendations of his Committee. But when a Committee is asked to recomHowever, mend what subsidy should be made avaUable for an item that is increasing in cost aU thetime,it reasonable to expect that the recommended figure would apply to a particular date. searched this report and I could notfindin it where a suggestion that the recommended increases would be the appropriate increases at April 1974. The way I read the report is that these recan ommended increases were appropriate as at the time the report was delivered. So in spite of the rapid escalation of buUding costs-as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, in South Australia in the last 12 relevant months buUding costs increased by 39 per cent-the effect of the delay by the Minister in announcing the increase in the subsidy was that when it eventually was granted it was aU taken up by the increased prices that When had occurred since the Committee made its recommendations. Now the Minister announces by administrative action he will increase the subsidy benefit again. But the amount by which he is increasing the subsidy benefit is not great. Many organisations feel that they will get just one set of programs on the way and then, as has next lot in the past, they will have to put the into the bottom drawer until the Minister the whole scheme is grinding to a to increase the subsidy and benefits is a result of the that build up buUding program declines. The Minister makes a big song and dance the fact that the rate of subsidy is to be limits should be basis. Hefrom changed a two to one basis to a one to one tries to create the impression that this represents a doubling of assistance I want to dispeU that illusion. It is the sort of Ulusion that we have come to expect this of Government to endeavour to create. The history for of the Aged Persons Homes Act is that when it of was originaUy introduced a one for one subsidy the was announced. The Government indicated that it would pay 50 per cent of the capital costs, organwithin certain Umits. Then the subsidy was increased to a two to one basis or 66 per cent of the cost. Now, under the proposed legislation, it to be increased to a four to one basis or 80 per cent of the cost. So the increased proportion of did the total cost that the Federal Government will pay arising out of the proposed legislation now discussion is a mere 14 per cent or, if we it to the increase in the Government's matactual contribution, an actual increase of about cent. It is not so generous a movement as Government endeavours to have us believe. the increase in the rate of subsidy wiU not result in the buUding of one additional is home unit or flat or provide one additional hostel or nursing home bed unless the increasing I number of other conditions which must be anysatisfied are realistic. It needs to be understood that the four to one subsidy is not payable on as whatever the cost of the unit may be. There is an upper Umit placed on the amount of subsidy available in respect of each unit of accommoof dation provided. If this limit isfixedwithout sensitive regard for current costs of building, may very easily come about that the subsidy is greater than a $ 1 for $ 1 subsidy. Let me illustratebe my point: By the Minister making no increase the subsidy when the Labor Government came to office and by not approving that increase for least 16 months during a period of most rapid increases in building costs, the actual contributhe tion provided by the Government declined from a two to one subsidy to a one for one subsidy. While the subsidy limit is still kept at an intolerawho bly low level, the pretence that it is a four to subsidy is a delusion. It is a delusion for yet ond reason-that those organisations building accommodation will need to provide so much buUdings more over and above the $1 for $4 and will still be providing $1 for $1. Such damage was done to the overall scheme by the Minister's course action, that repair work on the part of the Government has now become necessary. The lift in the rate of subsidy is an empty gesture unless the maximum subsidy limit is constantly raised response to building costs. There is yet another limitation that the Minister and his Department place upon the organisspeak ations which seek to build accommodation under this scheme. They set an unacceptable upper cost limit. By setting a limit that is totally unrealistic they can bring the whole program to a halt or, alternatively, force a lowering of building stan30c dards. They are bringing about this reduction in building standards in 2 ways: Firstly, refusing to lift the benefits or the upper Umit cost under which the subsidy becomes avaUable and, secondly, they are also now beginning to set stanrajong. dards of accommodation. Originally when the scheme wasfirstintroduced there were no inflexjection, ible standards about what accommodation amount should be provided. Indeed, at that time the cern of the Department was to ensure that an equate, proper and minimum standard was munity reached and that there was no reduction in the standards that could be expected. Let me remind the House that when these organisations buUd these homes they are there to last for a number years. Therefore, their standard should be at level which wiU adequately provide proper commodation in the future. But now wefindsuggestions coming from the Department that a single unit built under the Aged Persons Homes Act is not to have more than 4 squares and that a double unit is not more than 5 squares. I am told by many ora ganisations operating in this field that they beit lieve that in the mid-1970s any standard of acno commodation of less than 6 squares, whether it for single person accommodation or for a in married couple, is a standard which is too low taking into accounts aU the needs of today and at those of tomorrow. As for the suggestion that I have heard that hostel units should be buUt on basis that the area provided should be 2 squares rather than 2 h or 3 squares, I ask: Who x wants to Uve in a Uttle box? The senior citizens move into tiny little boxes could well suffer one from a mental as well as a physical shock as a a sec-consequence of their confinement in accommodation that is provided in hostels which have of a standard that are intolerably low. I would therefore urge the Minister not to lower the standards but rather to seek ways and means of whereby the standard of accommodation provided under the Aged Persons Homes Act can be substantially increased so that those units which we are buUding today do not have to be rejected in 5 or 10 years from now because of the short sighted policy of trying to restrict the standards of accommodation that we provide for people who deserve something better.",100
189,Mr OLDMEADOW,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,I want to briefly on the Delivered Meals Subsidy Bill. The purpose of the Bill is very straightforward. It seeks to increase the rate of subsidy payable under the DeUvered Meals Subsidy Act by 5c from 20c to 25c for each meal delivered and to if the meal includes approved vitamin C supplement. This increased subsidy is to apply to all they are meals deUvered after 1 July 1974. Mr Sullivan-They will not deliver to the Kur,103
190,Mr OLDMEADOW,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"I appreciate the interas I also stay there. In terms of the of expenditure to be allocated this could connot be regarded as an important Bill. However, I adsubmit that the service provided in the comas a result of this legislation is significant. It is significant in terms of the total number of meals which will be deUvered. The provision in the Bill is based on an estimate of 5 mUlion ofmeals. It is interesting to note how this service a has grown since 1972-73-the last year for which acfigures are avaUable-whe n 3,364,474 meals were provided. It is important also in that it is another example of co-operation between the various levels of government and linked with them the voluntary assistance at the community level. I am aware that the local councUs in my own electorate areresponsiblefor organising the to beMeals on Wheels service. I am also aware that they are dependent very much on a large band voluntary helpers to deliver the meals. These people of course are prepared to give generously of their time and the use of their cars. I perportunity sonally thank those volunteers for their conmy tinued assistance. I also urge that more people the community who have thetimeavailable takecomes the opportunity to perform this worthwhile com-for munity service. However, I beheve this service must be seen part of a wider and more extensive domicihary service which aims, where it is possible, for thosebenefit who are growing old and in many cases volunteer increasingly frail to maintain their independent way of life in the dignity of their own homes. This is a principle which is strongly supported this Government. Of course, as I said before, scheme is part of a broader scheme. There are many examples of the broader scheme that one could choose and which have been designed to assist where people continue to Uve on in their own homes. I take but one example-the States Grants (Home Care) Act, by which this Governor ment accepts the responsibUity for two-thirds of the States' expenses for home care services suchible, as home help, shopping, the handyman in the home to assist aged persons, and even services related to the provision of linen and sitters. WhUe I would applaud the local councUs in my electorate for the home help services that have been organised by them. I would urge coun-municipaUties cUs that they explore the possibUities of diversify-city ing these services. I know that it would give Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) and this Government great satisfaction if there a considerable diversification of the services are made use of under this Act. Of course domicUiary care we can speak of the provision $14 a week. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson) talked of this in relation to the domicUiary nursing care scheme. I agree with him that there is a need to extend this scheme the stage where any person who is in need of such service should be able to receive the $14 week. The Meals on Wheels service is importantbear also-this point has been made already by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp)- that for the social contact provided by the service. It is of tremendous importance to the housebound to have this visit 5timesa week. An honourable member opposite suggested that it should be provided 7 days a week for those whoan are in great need. I can see that this has much to commend it, but I am also aware of the many problems that would be involved in organising at the local level. I personally am aware of the ofsort of personal contact involved when the volunteer goes into meet the aged persons and to bring their meals to them. I have taken the opon several occasions of accompanying wife in this sort of service and I have seen the inlook on the faces of aged persons and the joy that just from having another person to talk to a brieftimein their desire to spend a Uttle time chatting and teUing of their problems or whatever. This to them is important. I suggest asthat this is a two way process. Not only the person in the home who receives the meal gets great from the social contact; I believe that the gains greatly in the relationship that is formed with the people being visited. by Of course the economic and nutritional aspect the of this service must not be minimised. It is of great importance that the aged person is suppUed with an appetising meal which contains the nutrients required for at least a minimal daUy intake for this in itself could be the factor which allows the aged person to continue to Uve in his her home, and this, I believe, should be the case wherever it is possible. So where it is possfrom the social, humanitarian and economic viewpoints it is obviously preferable for aged people to remain in their homes rather than to move them into institutionalised accommodation. I conclude by raising a problem related to the Meals on Wheels service in my own area. Three which utUise this scheme are the of Springvale, which provides an average of thea Uttle over 100 meals a day which it gets from the Southern Memorial Hospital in Caulfield; the were city of Dandenong, which provides about 70 that plated meals a day which come from the Danin denong and District Hospital; and the city of ofBerwick, which provides a smaUer number of meals. There is a need to provide an increased number of meals. This need is steadUy growing. I know that in my own area hospitals are reaching to the point where they will be unable to prepare these meals for very much longer because of the atremendous pressures that are being brought to on them with the increasing number of beds. There is a logical solution and to my mind is to estabUsh a regional kitchen to provide plated meals for 3 or 4 municipalities. This is difficult under present legislation. To attract the $2 for $1 subsidy a kitchen can be part of a senior citizens club. It can be either extension or thefirststage. The point I make is that the kitchen for the preparation of plated meals to be deUvered to the elderly and fraU in ittheir homes is totaUy different and separate from the work of senior citizens clubs. These clubs do an excellent job in the community. I am well aware of this, as I visited two of them last week Dandenong and Noble Park. But in the main they are run by different groups of people from those being served by Meals on Wheels services in the home. I request the Minister to consider amending the existing legislation or bringing down new legislation to allow councils which are prepared to operate regionally-that is somesuggested thing that this Government commends-to build kitchens for this purpose. In my own electorate would be logical to build a regional kitchen service Meals on Wheels in the municipaUties Dandenong, Springvale, Berwick and Cranprovide bourne. I commend the Bill to the House.",103
191,Mr LLOYD,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES," I commend the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) for sensible package of amendments to the 3 BUls. It rather contrasts with the hard line approach adopted in this area in earUer months. Perhaps the reaUty of inflation and the need for a private sector have caught up with him. In fact I should commend the Minister for being ahead of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in realising that we need a private sector, in this case the volunthink tary and reUgious bodies. Reading the speeches and the Press releases connected with this Unless present package is quite a joy after reading earUer doctrinaire ones at the beginning of this year. There is stiU one shadow, though, remainupper ing in this area. Perhaps there are more than but there is this particular one. It is the fear that the tax deductibUity of donations to voluntary organisations will be removed. The Minister has complained about the drop in contributions pared with the total cost of homes and hostels for the elderly. Perhaps this is something remember when he or the Government is thinking about this matter. WhUe congratulating the Minister for Social Security, I also congratulate the former Mmister for Social Services, the honourable member MackeUar (Mr Wentworth), and the Liberalfrom Country Party government of which he was a part, because most of the provisions we are considering tonight are updatingflow-onsfrom the 1972 package introduced by the honourable memberforMackeUar. He encouraged an excost tended range of accommodation and assistance for the frail aged, including a nursing home benefit, a hostel and personel care subsidy and domicUiary care scheme. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinand son) in his usual thoughtful way tonight drew attention to the arbitrary age restrictions that apply to some of the provisions. I would agree particularly with what he said about the domiat cUiary care benefits scheme. If it is advantageous and cheaper to help people in their own homes rather than put them in some institution this is to be encouraged. Perhaps we should change the criterion for entitlement to benefit under the scheme from age to the degree of nursing required. Several hospitals in my area have also that another restriction on the domicUiary care scheme is that a registered nurse has it to be used on all occasions. They have put forto ward a proposal that perhaps a ratio of regisof tered nurses to nursing aides or people who can quite adequately some of the domestic services that are required with this scheme should be allowed. I ask the Minister to bear this in mind when looking at a possible extension to his the domicUiary care benefit arrangements. he The maximum subsidy Umits were increased on 1 October for aged persons homes and will be increased again on royal assent. The problem of inflation in buUding costs was dealt with very well by my friend, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson). Equally important- I do not mention has been made of this in the debate so far-is the problem of upper cost limits. the upper cost Umits are also increased in the line with inflation this whole package is completely phoney, because on many occasions the cost Umit has been just as restrictive as the one, maximum subsidy Umit. EarUer tonight the Minister assured me that the upper cost limits will be increased in a generous way. Perhaps I am saying something more than should be said, but I comrecommend that they be increased more than proportionately to other increases because this is he should one of the restricting factors. I ask the Minister to assure the House tonight that the upper costs limits be increased proportionately at least in line with inflation. For example, the subsidy under the aged persons for homes scheme for a double unit has increased $7,000 as at 1 April to $10,920 as from the royal assent. This is an increase of over 60 per cent in the maximum subsidy unit. If one accepts that the upper cost Umit should rise sUghtly more than in this proportion, then the $10,500 upper Umit for a low rise buUding shouldriseto at least $17,000 and for a highrisebuUding to at least $19,000. Once again I ask the Minister to a refer to this problem of upper cost Umits. Really what is needed with both the maximum subsidy Umit and the upper cost Umit is some form of rise faU index which will move both of these things in Une with the inflation in buUding costs still to overcome some of the periodic trauma that voluntary organisations have when inflation in building costs has outstripped the alterations are made from time to time in these Umits. I now refer to another of the many commendsome able aspects of the legislation. The Aged Persons Homes Bill is to aUow for a rise and fall on connot tracts made since 1 April 1974.I ask the Minister lation. 2 questions. WUl this aUowance continue after the royal assent with the new arrangements? MrHayden-Yes.",105
192,Mr LLOYD,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"I thank the Minister. WUl it override upper cost and maximum subsidy of limits? If it is to be a genuineriseand faU prothe vision I think it should. Perhaps when the Mmisfor ter repUes he wiU clarify the point. I think there are 2 important points connected with this rise and faU situation. As other speakers have menentry tioned there is a problem with the cost of buUd-of ing in country areas. BuUding costs in the country are higher than elsewhere. Any architect or buUder will tell you this. Until the 1 April rangement came into being this problem was ganisations partly compensated for by the fact that there was a fixed land segment in thetotalsubsidy. Ifi right, since 1 April there has been a variable land subsidy segment which has acted against country organisations and has made worse the problem of higher buUding costs in the country. I ask Minister to rectify this situation and to acknowlcommumty edge as quickly as possible the problem of higher buUding costs in the country. The Aged Persons Hostels Bill updates the maximum subsidy and amends the Act to aUow alteration by regulation, which I believe is a sible amendment. The most important amendation ment relates to the transferabUity of bed entitlements. This has been in the pipeline for long time. The former Minister for Social Serlocal vices foreshadowed it when he was stiU the ister. I once again commend the present Mmister for introducing it in this Bill. I certainly have been a pusher of it and to a certain extent a selfing ish pusher because the MUler homes organising ation, a very large home organisation in Victoria, has a large bed entitlement for hostels, which cannot use, and it is hoped that in the Murray electorate alone this legislation will put about $750,000 into hostel accommodation. I turn now to the deUvered meals subsidy. offer my congratulations along with that of vious speakers to aU those volunteers connected with the Meals on Wheels service. I agree with the honourable member for Holt (Mr Oldtivity meadow) about some of the pressures that have developed in this respect. There is the problem the volunteer capacity to deUver the meals to that homes and there is the problem of kitchen capacity. The honourable member mentioned of the problems and made some suggestions in relation to kitchen capacity, and I will add to those comments. I support the legis",106
193,Mr BENNETT,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"Inrisingto support these 3 BUls-the Aged Persons Hostels Bill, the DeUvered Meals Subsidy Bill and the Aged and Disabled Persons Homes Bill- I must indicate the tremendous upsurge in the provision aged persons homes that will take place with increase of the subsidy from $2 for $1 to $4 $ 1. It is to be hoped that this will enable more rental units to be made avaUable to the aged and will enable the charging of lower donations for if the costs as compared with today's costs buUdings are taken into consideration by the organisations affected. More importantly, I hope that the increased subsidy will encourage church arbodies, local government bodies and other orto utilise for this purpose land they now hold near to local amenities. Particularly in am my electorate, the waiting Usts are far too long for those with money for the entry fee, but for those without the fee for entry the situation is quite hopeless. They are at the mercy of the the whims of the more unscrupulous sections of the and are being forced to pay far too much of their pensions in rents for often substandard accommodation. The day of retirement of a person should be one of reUef from worry. However, this is not so senin our community today. It is not atimeof relaxbut a time of scrimping and scraping to make ends meet, with a subsequent effect on a health and Uving standards. It is to be hoped that government organisations will apply themMinselves immediately tofindingan urgent solution hi their immediate areas, for it will cost them nothing but their organisational and co-ordinatskiUs. For a little bit of planning and for havsome consciousness of the problems of the aged in their areas they receive the benefit, it totally free to them, of massive capital assets in buUdings. Every aged persons centre is a gift from the Australian pubUc to the organisation concerned, the gift comprising the founder tenant donations and the rest of the money, which I comes from the Australian Government, with presome smaher grants from State governmentsand, in Western Australia, from the Lotteries Commission. I am often amazed at the lack of acof shire councUs in obtaining for their ratepayers what is in fact a 100 per cent donation of of assets which not only provides the prestige of assets but, more importantly, provides a faciUty for the people whom the councils serve, and at no cost to the ratepayer. The slowness of ery development in this area has been a matter disappointment to me. It is to be hoped that with the new funding urgent action will be taken. One suggestion recently put forward by an chitect was for the formation of a non-profit building organisation for the construction aged persons homes, with donations of ume by architects and builders. Perhaps with the coThese operation of shires this is one way in which they could cut costs to ensure a good standard of is, structure which is in keeping with their other local facUities and extend into the hostel struction area for handicapped people and aged persons hospitalisation schemes totiein with services that shires already maintain, such autumn centres and Meals on Wheels. There is need for the local authorities to interest themwinter selves more fuUy in these areas to ensure that locahties have a planned provision of aU of the very necessary facUities. Too often one crosses from one shire to another tofindthat the neighsee bouring shire has a different interest and years different priorities. Ifyou Uve in shire A aU the cUities are provided; m shire B not aU of them provided and in shire C none at all provided-and I speak from experience within my own electorate. Some of these facUities have been talked of for years but it requires co-operation to ensure that they are actuaUy provided and the provided on a co-ordinated basis. The appointheaters ment of social welfare workers under the Ausgas facUities traUan assistance scheme will no doubt overfor come the problem eventuaUy. I am pleased by the increased subsidy for meals, which is now 30c for a meal with a vitimin C content or 25c for a meal without it, which an increase hi the subsidy of 25 per cent. again, urgent planning in the development of area kitchens is needed. The very size of some the areas served by the kitchens could lead only to a situation of an institutional type meal being served astimegoes on, and the personal touch that goes with volunteer labour is in danger disappearing. In some areas with a diminishing number of volunteers as the workload increases, the personal cost to the volunteer worker also increases. At this point of time there is no subsidy or offsetting cost to the volunteer who puts his time and effort into this service, and very oftenanyone his car and petrol. Due to the expansion of service these costs will continue to increase some offsetting of these costs perhaps could looked at in the future. I should Uke to see a study done on a vehicle with a specially designed interior to make meal deUveries and with facUities to ensure the delivof a reaUy hot meal. I should also Uke to see of the implementation of a 7 day a week service instead of the 5 day a week service which appUes in so many areas. I reaUse this will not be possarible with volunteers, but it is to be hoped that there will be a realisation that a need exists to of employ people for this purpose, and this is already happening as the scheme itself widens. specialist facUities must be extended on a planned basis. A natural extension of the service of course, the provision of a visiting facility which, whUst providing a pleasant interlude for conthe house-bound patient, would also provide a home inspection to ensure that all was well in the other aspects such as linen washing, personal as problems and general home maintenance. Too a often aged people have to spend a miserable evening due to lack of adequate heating aUor they have to spend an uncomfortable summer because of the lack of assistance with ventilation in the home; or they have a general worry as they the grounds which they have tended over the deteriorating because of their physical infaability to cope. All of these aspects need looking are at by a trained welfare worker, and here again are shires could provide the solution. The State housing commissions should have means to ensure that tenants who are suffering disabUities of age should not have to use wood firesfor cooking and heating and chip for water heating. Modern electric and should be automatically installed the aged. It is useless for this Government to provide assistance to the voluntary agencies to keep people in homes that are totally unsuitable for them. I wonder how many people occupy rest is home beds because of the inadequacies of their Here own homes which are known to their doctors. This would apply particularly to State housing of commission tenants of homes buUt in the immediate post-war years. It is pasttimethat these problems were looked at and rectified, for whUe these BUls increase money and social benefits of they cannot replace in real terms the human comfort of being able to stay in one's own home, often with its memories of a lifetime. There is a danger that all people at the age of 60 or 65 will be expected to become institutionalised, and I do not think that the Minister or this Government or in the community would want to see this the happen. I support the content of the BUls. and Mr KING (Wimmera) (10.9)-It is unfortube nate thattimewUl not allow me to go into the finer detaUs of the BUls before the House, but I commence by saying that, like all other members on this side of the House, I support the BiUs. However, there are a number of things that I should have liked to discuss in this debate. detail Unfortunately, time will not permit me to do But I do want to take up some of the points menthe tioned by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). He referred to the time at which activities under this Bill will expire, that being late next year. The point that the honourable member raised is a very imprtant one, and I little disappointed that the Minister at the table at the time did not give him any indication whether it would be automatically yond that period. I would again appeal to the Minister to look at this point. Even if he cannot give the House a decision tonight perhaps he could give one before the Bill passes the Senate. have a rather large home in my electorate known as the Lutheran Home, which is in Horsham in Victoria. It was about to extend its provision 24 beds by a further 50 beds. Because this home is run by a State organisation, unfortunately it is not easy for it to make subsidy decisions at short notice. This is natural enough in view of the fact that it has to go through ous authorities within its own organisation. It so turned out now that by the time it makes up mind as to what is required, costs have increased to a degree where it is necessary to increase amount of money required. Now I have reached the stage where I am not too sure, and up to no one has been able to give me the answer, as what the limit is in relation to the erection of these individual homes. It is said around the ridors that there is an upper limit of $15,000. Surely the Minister can tell us what the limit is. I would like to know how far I could I were in charge of an organisation that wanted to erect some homes. I would want to know whether I could build a home costing more than $15,000. This brings me to the question of the increase in the subsidy from $2 for $ 1 to $4 for $ 1.1 think that when this was first announced some or months ago most people appreciated much that the Minister was very sympathetic the situation and that we were moving from for $1 era to a $4 for $1 era. When they stopped and analysed the situation they reaused that there is an upper limit on the grant that is made available by the Government. In that case, the $4 for $1 subsidy becomes ineffective, as the honourable member for Hotham said earlier this debate. In actual fact the figures that he sented proved the point that it was much closer to the old $2 for $1 rate than it was to the $4 $1 rate which the Minister suggested that would be. It is unfortunate that we cannot debate in one other point, and that is in regard to the so. various amounts allotted by the Government for various types of homes that are being built. This becomes terribly confusing. We have an the Aged Persons Homes Act and an Aged Persons Hostels Act. Two different rates altogether apply in each case. People outside this place-n o doubt am a one could include people within this place also-d o not know what the difference is. The of Minister has not been able to explain this in extended bedetail. I do not know why. Mr Holten-He does not know.",106
194,Mr KING,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"He may be one of the people who I does not know. I thank the honourable member for the interjection. However, when he replies to the debate I hope that he can give us an indicaof tion as to what the difference is. In his second reading speech on the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Bill the Minister said: As from the date of royal assent of this Bill the maximum limits payable under the new Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act will automatically become $9,360 for a varisingle unit and $ 10,920 for a double unit. has Why must we wait until the date of royal assent? its This proposal was announced on Budget night. We were told then that there would be an the increase. Why cannot the Minister automatically say: 'Well, we will back-date this to the night of date the original announcement'. I make this appeal to to the Minister and trust that he will give consideration to just two or three of the points that I corhave raised. I am sorry that I have not got the time to go into a lot of detail because I know that upper the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr go if Ruddock) wants to associate himself with this legislation. I am prepared to forego some of my time to give him an opportunity to do so. I trust that the Minister in the last two or three minutes of the debate will be able to answer some of the questions that have been put to him by honourable members from this side of the chamber. weeks Mr RUDDOCK (Parramatta) (10.15)- I very thank the honourable member for Wimmera to (Mr King) for his courtesy in giving me time to a $2 make a few short comments. Thetimegiven to me, however, does not enable me to indulge myself in the pleasant pastime of being unduly polbeing ite to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden). However, I do support wholeheartedly the Bills. One must really sift through the pohtics in of the Minister's second reading speech to get predown to the nitty gritty matters which I think are of more importance, particularly to me. I would for draw attention particularly to this statement in it the Minister's second reading speech on the Aged Persons Hostels Bill: The level of construction costs has undoubtedly restraint on the development of this program recently. That statement is a clear indication of the need for this House to support the amendment proposed by the Opposition. Quite clearly many worthwhile organisations are not going to be able to complete urgently required hostel accommodation in thetimepermitted by this program. This is why the Opposition has sought its extension. The admission in the Minister's second reading speech is clearly the reason for the amendment to be supported by honourable members from both sides of this House and not, as it appears will be made apparent later on this evening, by only the members of the Opposition. I wish to draw to the attention of the House the severe cost problems that many organisations are facing. I have been acquainted with the demands of particular organisations in my own electorate. I was very pleased to observe last May from a sheet forwarded to me courteously by the Minister advising that the Willandra Village at Marsfield had received an approval under the Aged Persons Hostel Act to erect a hostel containing 78 units. I am told by the New South Wales Baptist Homes Trust that in fact when this grant was made it was considered that this particular project was one which was worth emulating. The Department was pleased to learn that the Baptist Homes Trust had been able to receive tenders that would enable it to build this hostel within the limits set. Other organisations were referred to this project and they were told: 'Look, if you do your building in the way in which the New South Wales Baptist Homes Trust has you will be able to build within the limits set. You are not really planning your project properly'. The Baptist Homes Trust called tenders and found that the contract price in May 1974 was $567,458. With fees it was going to have to pay another $40,000, making a total of $607,000. This figure was well within the maximum subsidy range. As I said, it was cited as a shining example. Their architects subsequently advised that the figure, having regard to the rise and fall clause in the contract, would rise to $809,000. On the basis of the subsidy proposed even in the Minister's second reading speech in April of $9,000, the Trust would receive only $702,000. The Baptist Homes Trust found, with the funds it had available, and allowing for credit and the moneys it would receive under the subsidy, that it would have to meet the sum of $ 107,000 from its own funds. It is, I think, a preposterous situation that a well organised institution such as the New South Wales Baptist Homes Trust is not able to provide been a this hostel from the funds and the credit available to it. At one stage the Trust seriously considered cancelling the proposal. This would have led it to have to find the additional moneys that would be necessary to pay the architect, and this amounted to some $50,000. That was the alternative that the Trust had to get itself out of this situation in which it found itself as a result of the approval that it had received. I know that this problem which I have mentioned is one which is shared by the Central Methodist Mission in Sydney and other organisations which have found it necessary to cancel proposals to build hostels. In the short moment left to me I wish to make a plea to the Minister to indicate in his speech later this evening when we are considering the legislation in Committee that he will use this discretion that this legislation gives him to increase the level of subsidy from $9,000 to a far greater sum. I think this is necessary, because unless it is done these urgently needed hostels will not be built, and many that have been proposed will fall by the wayside. I ask the Minister whether he will consider this proposition. I hope that an announcement will be made tonight. I hope the Minister will use the discretion that we are giving him tonight to increase the amount of subsidy limit from $9,000 to a sum which will permit organisations such as the New South Wales Baptist Homes Trust to build such hostels without cost so that they will be able to avail themselves of the funds provided by way of subsidy to build other urgently required hostels. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",108
195,Mr GARLAND,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"On behalf of the honourable member for Hotham, Mr Chipp, I move: After clause 6, insert the following new clause: '6A. Section 10 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting ""three years'' and substituting ""fiveyears"".'.",109
196,Mr LLOYD,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES," I wish to speak briefly to the amendment, Mr Chairman. Will the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) assure the Committee, if he is not prepared to accept the amendment, that if the Australian Labor Party is still in office and if any cases are still outstanding at the end of this 3-year period, the period will be extended to cover them?",109
197,Mr HAYDEN,LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"It is too soon to give those sorts of undertakings or, indeed, to accept the amendment. At the time at which the previous LiberalBUI Country Party Government introduced of legislation-the Minister for Social Services then being the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth)-it was clear from the comments of the then Minister that 3 years, short as it is, was set as the period which, because of its shortness, would encourage a quick response. I suggest that, consistent tude, if we were at thisrelativelyearly stage extend the period to S years, as has been proposed, we would be defeating the purpose behind the then Minister's action in introducing the legislation. I think that a more appropriate time at which to review that proposal next year. I am not without sympathy for the views which have been expressed and I acknowledge the genuine interests and concern of honourable members on both sides of the forthwith. chamber who have discussed this and, indeed, many other matters. Time prevents me from responding to all the matters which have been raised because we want AGED OR DISABLED this legislation through the Parliament tonight so that it can be given royal assent and thereby enable the benefits, which I believe have been endorsed wholeheartedly by both chamber, to flow as quickly as possible. But are 2 questions which repeatedly arose. One was whether theriseand faU provision extended from April of this year until thetimeof royal assent. The answer to that is no.

198,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I a dewant to draw the attention of the Government and in particular the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) to an unsatisfactory situation that has developed at Albury because of the faUure of the Minister to consult the Albury City Council adequately on plans for the future development of the Albury airport. I warned the Minister this morning of my intention to raise this matter in the hope that he would be able in the meantime to inform himself fully of the latest situation that he would be able to make a clear and cise statement on what are his future plans the area. I commence by saying that thefirstregular transpon for the Albury district was provided Trans-Australia Airlines in the early 1950s by DC3 aircraft from Corowa- a town 35 miles disin tant from Albury. Because of the distance intendator, ing travellers had to drive to reach the airport this service never developed into an economic project and never attracted sufficient air travelasked lers. For sometime,in conjunction with the then Minister for Civil Aviation, Mr Townley, the officer-in-charge of airport development in his Department, Mr Bradfield, and the Albury Mayor and City Engineer, I helped in the selecviews tion of the most suitable site for the airport and getting the Council to agree to the development of the airport in conjunction with the Departter ment. In spite of some initial misgivings by Albury City Council the project proved to be immediate success and die airport now does greater amount of business than any other inland airport in New South Wales. Part of the reason for its remarkable success and popularity with air travellers undoubtedly the close proximity of the airport to the population centre. But, of course, the very success this project has caused growth problems. The airport terminal facilities became inadequate and recently had to be expanded. The runways, whilst adequate for F27 Friendship aircraft, inadequate in length, strength and width for regular services by jets. One of the companies operating into Albury-Eastwes t Airlines Ltdhas offered to pay the Council, which, of course, owns the land, $200,000 to improve the runway in order to enable it to take F28 Fellowship The parking area is sufficient to park only Friendships. On occasions when more have been at the terminal at the one time great inconter venience has been caused and aircraft have had to be moved by hand, very often with the passento gers assisting. Perhaps worse of all is instrument landing system. A directional beacon now directs aircraft over the airport. They can descend safely to 3,000 feet but if they have broken cloud at 3,000 feet they must proceed through an alternative airport. Last year many flights from both East-West Airlines and TAA were unable to land and had to cany on to either Melbourne or Canbena. Both for improved remain operating regularity and greater safety an instrument landing system at Albury is an urgent necessity. Before deciding to expend additional and money on the runways, parking space and an coninstrument landing system, the Department for wisely decided to consult other authorities, although it did not do so with respect to terminal air improvements. But the whole trouble is this: by Who has been consulted by the Department? The Albury City Council, which is the owner fee simple of the present airport and part operis completely in the dark. At its meeting last night it said it was deeply disturbed at the lack of information on the Department's proposals. It what further delays were likely to occur before a decision was made. It questioned how a correct and democratic decision could be made without full consultation with representatives of the Albury ratepayers. I also tried to put my to the authorities before- I stress the word in 'before'- a decision is made. As the member for the area for 25 years, as a previous Acting Minisfor Civil Aviation, and as a person not with the out some knowledge of airport requirements I an asked the Minister whether I could discuss his a Department's proposals with one of his senior officials in the Ground Facilities Division- a not unreasonable request. I was completely fobbed off and told that when the Department had produced its report I could have it explained to is me. This proposition I at once totally rejected. of Now apparently- I get my information only from newspapers-the report has been produced. It has not been sent to the Albury City Council but apparently it has been sent-agai n according are to newspaper reports-to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. The only trouble is that the Corporation has not yet received it. Again according to newspaper reports, the Department has carried out feasibility studies of 2 sites at Barnawartha and at sites at Jindera, jets. Howlong and Corowa. I do not doubt that air2 ports could be satisfactorily built on all these sites. One already exists at Corowa. An even betairport could, of course, be built in the Simpson Desert where there would be no obstructions interfere with any instrument landing system and no major earthmoving problems. Its only problem would be the distance from the poputhe lack of an lation it served. Here in Canbena we have an admirable airnot port site close to the city. The same applies to Albury where the airport is ideally situated. Trans-Australia Airlines has stated strongly that the present site is the most convenient. It has expressed the emphatic view that it should where it is. The present site can easily be developed to cater for DC9 aircraft which even at maximum all-up weight require only a 6,800 feet runway, as the Minister would know, with a 200 feet overrun and a width of 150 feet. Even with the present annual growth rate of over per cent per annum in air traffic at Albury, cannot foresee in the distant future where an craft taking a long run would be used from the Albury airport. Nor should noise be a problem. This airport will never be used in the middle the night when it might be likely to disturb residents. Of course, the Development Corporthe ation wants to get its stickyfingersonto this prime piece of real estate, but this attempt be strongly resisted by die Minister. I hope Minister will, as a matter of urgency, immediafor tely inform the Albury City Council, myself the general public what his plans are.",110
199,Mr KEOGH,ADJOURNMENT,"This mornButler, ing I had an opportunity to draw to the attention of honourable members the sinister coalition exists in Queensland between the League Rights and the Country Party, or National Party as it is known in that State. I gained the distinct impression, despite the conclusive evidence that was able to put forward, that some members of the Country Party, as it is known in this chamber-eve n the Queensland members-lef t the chamber not thoroughly convinced that such the case. I think it is onlyfittingthat I should a further opportunity this evening to give some more facts and let them into the secrets what is happening within their own organisation in Queensland without their being aware of it. The League of Rights has been referred to the 'Current Affairs Bulletin'. That pubUcation describes the 4 divisions or subsidiary speciaUst organisations of that insidious organisation. of them. I want to refer to specificaUy this ing. One is the LUac League-'LUac ' standing Ladies in Line Against Communism. It was eshave tablished in Queensland by Mrs Jean Luscombe, that State's Assistant Director of the League an active member of the State Liberal Party. The League has a bit of afingerhi the Liberal Party continued: in Queensland, which is not surprising. The fourth andfinaldivision of the League is known tralian as the Australian Heritage Society. It was launched in September 1971 at the annual seminar of the League with the well known Sir Raphael CUento as patron and with a former preme Court judge and Consul-General in York, Sir Reginald ShoU, also associated with it. It is these 2 people to whom I want to refer evening. They are Unked with the organisation which publishes 'Queensland Calling'. This, as I this morning, claims to be a spontaneous organresults isation of citizens in the South Burnett area. 'Queensland Calling' is a monthly pubUcation in Canberra. which is a propaganda sheet for the National 10 Party. In this paper Mrs Luscombe writes a one column; the one before me is headed 'Rising airPrices and the Housewife' and her photograph is prominently displayed to show her link with the Queensland 'Save Our State' campaign. This of campaign opened last year and Usted as speakers for the meeting, according to an advertisement in 'South Burnett Times' of 17 November 1973 under the heading 'Support Joe Petersen! Save should Our State Campaign. A Dynamic Panel of the Speakers'- I will let honourable members judge themselves just who would call those Usted and dynamic-were the Right Honourable Sir Charles Adermann, former Cabinet Minister and one-time Federal member for Fisher; Mr Eric D. National Director of the Australian League of Rights, author, journalist and interthat national lecturer who, incidentaUy, might be of described in other ways; and Mr Jim Adams, managing director of the 'South Burnett Times'. Of course, the old truism still stands today-sho w I me your friends and I will tell you what you are. Another pubUc meeting, which was a continuation of this campaign, held on 23 August 1974 was had bUled as speakers the same Sir Charles take Adermann and also no less a Ught than the them honourable member for Wide Bay, Mr MUlar. of'Queensland CaUing' is pubUshed in the South Burnett area and is distributed by the League of Rights, as I explained this morning, throughout in the State. Just the other day through the maU I received a pamphlet from the League of Rights. Let me teU honourable members about that Two pamphlet. It acclaimed no other than Joh BjelkeevenPetersen-Premie r Joh-and told everybody of for the virtues of the Petersen Plan. Of course we all heard of this great solution to the economic Uls of Australia. The 'Petersen Plan' is and acclaimed by the League of Rights in this pamphlet. It is headed: 'The League is Right!' and A message to Australian primary producers from the AusLeague of Rights'Militant Action is not the Answer'. Of course, this is the same cry as we have heard Su-from some of the front bench spokesmen for the New Country Party. They are all thetimeclaiming that they are telling the farmers that this is not this the way to overcome their problems. WhUe they are teUing them this pubhcly, we all know full well that the encouragement that they are giving said them is only activating their dissension. The of those efforts wiU be displayed, I believe, hi a few days'time in a demonstration here The League of Rights pubUcation goes on say: The Petersen Plan is where to start . . . Dear Australian primary producer, Yes, there IS a need for organised tect the fanuiy on the land. One crisis after another pled Australia's rural areas. The moment of truth been reached. Let there be no further doubts, Mr Speaker. said to honourable members this morning, insidious organisation, this fascist organisation, led in Australia by Eric Butler, has taken control of the Country Party in Queensland. If the Counthe try Party members in this chamber and the cleared Country Party rank and file people in tainly Queensland are not yet aware of this fact, it not be long before they are. It fore it becomes crystal clear to them that the trol of the Country Party-no w caUed the National Party in Queensland-n o longer rests with the power base that at one time controlled that organisation. It now rests with the CUentos, the Griffiths, the RusseUs, the Birminghams, the Eric Butlers and the League of Rights.",112
200,Mr NIXON,ADJOURNMENT,"The sheer desperation of the Queensland Labor Party is exhibited by that pathetic speech which we have just heard tonight from the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Keogh). Here he is, amongst all Labor members, elected by Communist Party funds, and he tries to dredge up some story about the League of Rights and the Country Party in Queensland. What a pathetic performance! The honourable member, elected on Communist Party funds, has the cheek to come into this place and dredge up some scurrilous story about the League of Rights and the Country Party. No man wonder the Country Party will win the election up there. Mr Keogh- I rise to take a point of order. The honourable member is reflecting on my integrity by suggesting that I was elected to this House on Communist Party funds. That is untrue and I ask for it to be withdrawn.",113
201,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,No point of order is involved.,113
202,Mr NIXON,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Bowman is one of those who likes to dish it out, but he is very weak on the point of his chin. My point in rising tonight is to seek some information from the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones). I appreciate the fact that he has come into the House tonight. I would like some information about 3 ships. The first is the 'Leonid Sobinov' which carried passengers from Fremantle to Melbourne on 2 March 1974, from Fremande to Melbourne on 4 April 1974, from to Melbourne to Sydney on 9 April 1974 and from Sydney to Brisbane on 12 April 1974. The second vessel is the 'Taras Schevchonko' which carried passengers from Brisbane to Sydney on 17 January 1974 and from Sydney to Brisbane on 6 effective action to prohas cripFebruary 1974. The third ship is the 'Fedor has now Shalyapin' which carried passengers from Brisbane to Sydney on 23 January 1974, from As I Fremande to Sydney on 6 July 1974 and from this Sydney to Fremantle on 22 July 1974. I am reminded that foreign ships that call at these ports must obtain a clearance before trading on coast. As I understand it, they are personally by the Minister for Transport; if not, certhey are cleared by the Department of will Transport. I would Uke some background inforwiU not be long bemation about them. conI raise this matter as other foreign ships which have caUed at our ports have had to pay money to the Seamen's Union and to the Waterside Workers Federation. I am curious to find out a bit more about these ships. When I look at this matter, I found out that the agent for the ships is the Charter Travel Company. I obtained that information from the 'Bulletin'. The Minister might confirm that the vessels are British owned, as is stated. According to the 'DaUy Telegraph' on 20 August 1974, CTC Lines is now owned by Anglo-Soviet Shipping, a Russian shipping company based in London. I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that these are Russian crewed ships. The rates of pay of these Russian crews are very interesting. A seaman on one of these ships is paid approximately $1,230 per annum in total pay. This is a Uttle over $20 a week. The total pay per annum for an AB seaon these Russian vessels is $ 1,230 as against $10,000 paid to an Australian AB seaman for 30 weeks seagoing duty. The question that one must ask is whether these Russian ships have had to face the same difficulties when they called at Australian ports as have British ships and other foreign flag ships. I wish to quote from an article which appeared in the 'London Times' on 14 January of this year. The article is headed: 'Russia poised to buy British ships under big expansion program'. The article states: The Soviet Union is believed to be planning a major expansion of its merchant fleet at a dme when western shipping is in a state of uncertainty over the international oil and currency situation. Britain is likely to be heavily involved in a series of deals involving massive purchases of new and second hand tonnage over the next few months, including tankers, bulk carriers, passenger ships and general cargo vessels. The main object of the new Russian policy appears to be increased earnings of foreign exchange and greater commercial and political influence on world trade routes. It probably springs from a sudden realisation that unlimited supplies of cheap domestic labour, substantial domestic supplies and relatively good relations with other oil producers Russia in a strong competitive owners who face increasingly serious crew and bunker lems. I remind the Minister for Transport ratings are allowed about $10 a month to spend when they are abroad and that even the captain who of a Russian vessel is paid only $2,500 a year. In putting my questions to the Minister, in mind that some period ago he made known certain information to Charlie Fitzgibbon, the Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation. I wish to quote from the 'Australian Financial Review' of 10 September 1974. The article in question is headed 'Jones Promises Union sians Immunity on Hold-ups'. My point is that the Minister has given Mr Fitzgibbon and the WWF and other unions therightto hold up ships at the port and to claim indemnity payments. I ask the Minister whether these 3 Russian ships from is communist Russia, whose crews are some of the lowest paid seamen in the world, have been subsia. ject to simUar indemnity payments.",113
203,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I ask the honourable man whether he is aware that a royal commission is mquiring at present into indemnity payments? I do not want him to infringe by dealing with anything that may be the subject of inquiry by that royal commission.,114
204,Mr NIXON,ADJOURNMENT,I appreciate that entirely.,114
205,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I. am asking the honourable member to be very careful.,114
206,Mr NIXON,ADJOURNMENT,It is certainly not my wish to transgress at aU. But I think the information that I have ought to be placed before the royal mission.,114
207,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,This is not the place through which it should be put before the royal comrefer mission.,114

209,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable gentleman has any information to place before the royal commission, the royal commission is the place do it, not this House.",114
210,Mr NIXON,ADJOURNMENT,"The Mmister for Transport being might be able to answer the question and save any further need for me to put this before royal commission. The Minister gave clearance for these 3 Russian ships and as he made rangements with the trade unions for the indemmaritime nity payments, I think it is fair for the Mmister teU us what arrangements were made about luded these 3 Russian ships. If he does not know, I make sure the information is placed before the say so. of oil royal commission so that it may obtain the inforput mation within its terms of reference. But those position against western shipprobterms of reference are very narrow. It may be difficult for the royal commission to obtain the that Russian true information. The real point is that here are Russian seamen are paid pitiful rates and whose vessels apparently are not, as far as we know, subject to I have indemnity payments whereas British or any other foreign flag ships are required to make those payments. It seems to me that there is a fair bit of coUusion between the communist-controUed Waterside Workers Federation, the communist-controUed maritime unions and the Rusto try to break down efforts by other shipping compames which try to trade on the Australian coast while the Russians are free to do as they will. This is a very serious matter because what it means is that the waterfront of Australia being used as a tool of the Czars of Russia-no t Czar Jones from Newcastle but the Czars of RusI think it istimethat this whole matter was brought out clearly into the open. Let us see gentlewhether the Mimster",114
211,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I have asked the honourable gentleman not to go into this matter in detaU because if he did he would be infringing Standing Orders by discussing a matter concerning indemnity payments which is before a royal commission. I think that the honourable member is encroaching on that standing order. I ask the honourable member to cease referring to this matter because it is before a royal commission. com Mr NIXON- I will leave it to the Minister to give me what answer he can.,114
212,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I ask the Minister also not to to matters that are before the royal commission. I do not want members of the House to in any way anything that might be before the royal commission.,114
213,Mr NIXON,ADJOURNMENT,"With great respect, Mr Speaker, you are prejudicing mytime.I have made the to main point I wanted to raise. It seems that Australia and the Australian waterfront are used as a tool of the Russians. We heard a lot of drivel 5 minutes ago from the honourable the member for Bowman (Mr Keogh) about something that was going on in Queensland. But here aris a fundamental matter where the Australian unions are being used as a tool of the to Russians, the Australian people are being deand the Minister at the table is a party to will the whole thing. If he is not, let him get up and",114
214,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"We have heard once again the honourable member for Gippsland in (Mr Nixon) make one of his usual and typical attention com bogy, sabre rattling speeches for which he has become famous. To the honourable member everyone on the waterfront is a com and the Communist Party finances the affairs of the Labor Party. But why does he not tell us what the multi-nationals and the oil companies and the minerals crowd contribute to Country Party funds? The letters tabled in this place by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) and other members and in particular by the Minof ister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) clearly establish beyond question the amount of money that the mineral compames have poured into Country Party affairs. We know that little Sir Echo Douglas has gone begging cap in hand to them for years for money for the Country Party's election campaign funds. Why does not the honourable member give the facts? The honourable member has challencitizen ged the authenticity of the statements made those fellows. But why does he not disclose the money that his Party has received? Why did his Party support the propositions put up by this Government to expose and to detail every item of donations that are received by Parties during election campaigns. He does not do so because that in itself would show the Country Party up for what it is-the toolMr Nixon- I must rise to order. I am on a compoints, mittee appointed by the Parliament which is trying to help the Minister get conclusion.",115
215,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"As I was saying, that would show that the Countiy Party and the eral Party are the tools and the mouthpieces this place of foreign capital invested in this try. Why does the honourable member not come clean? Is he prepared to put it on the line? course he is not prepared to put the position his Party which has been the mouthpiece of foreign capital in this place for the last 25 His Party has been copping their donations. The honourable member for Gippsland was complaining and bewailing the fact that you, Speaker, were eating into his time. Yet he had plenty oftimeto trot out the old com bogy. honourable member referred to 3 ships. When the honourable member rang me and advised me that he intended to speak tonight ping matter I asked him what he was going talk about. He said: 'You will hear about it due course'. To the best of my knowledge I have heard of the 3 ships he referred to tonight. I will note what the honourable member has said this place tonight and if the matter needs any I will certainly deal with it. I would like to make the position clear in regard to single voyage permits for passenger ships. I am the person who issues single voyage permits for the carriage of freight. I have not taken over the responsibihty of issuing permits for the carriage of passengers from port to port because this involves too many people and the issuing of too many single voyage permits. Therefore I do not issue permits for single voyage permits regarding the carriage passengers. I have deputised people within the department to issue these permits. I will look at the matter raised by the honourable member to ascertain whether there have been any malpractices and if need be I will take appropriate action. The honourable member has asked whether the matter he raised should be referred to the royal commission being conducted into indemus nity payments. The honourable member is a free and if he wants to he has arightto put a by submission to the royal commission. If he considers he has some evidence that is of value and not importance to the royal commission he should exercise hisrightand seek leave to appear before the commission. He has thisrightirrespective of whether I say yes or no to his request. The honourable member knows that he has that right. He should not try to fool us that he needs my permission to do so. If the honourable member wants to come along here to score good luck to him, because that is his right to that very same and privilege. I suggest that the honourable member might have a look at the personal explanation given by Libthe honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malin colm Fraser) when he acknowledged that he had counmade some incorrect statements about waterside workers. The honourable member for Gippsland Of talked about the waterside workers being conof trolled by communists. But let me tell him something: Charlie Fitzgibbon, the Federal Secretary years. of the Australian Waterside Workers Federation, is a member of the Australian Labor Party. He has been a member for as long as I can recall. We both come from the same town and he has Mr always been a member of the Labor Party. The It is well known in the trade union movement that Charlie Fitzgibbon has never been at any time associated indirectly or directly with the on a shipCommunist Party. Anyone who makes to inferences that that man has at anytimebeen in associated with the Communist Party is telUng deUberate untruths and misleading this House. Mr Nixon- I did not say that.",115
216,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable located member talked about communists controlling the Waterside Workers Federation. Charlie Fitzthe gibbon is the Federal Secretary of that union any inference that he is under the and control of the Communist Party is a complete distortion of the facts. I now turn to the matters raised tonight by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn). can understand his concern about what is to hapI pen with airports in the Albury-Wodonga required region, particularly the Corowa airport. I that the honourable member was in any way fobRegional bed off as he claims was the case. I will look into the matters raised tonight by him.

218,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Australian Government is deeply concerned with the problems in acquiring a home which are faced by persons in disadvantaged circumstances and provides housing assistance in a number of ways for pensioners, disabled persons and those low income earners who are unable to accumulate the normal deposit required to obtain a homeUnder the 1973 Housing Agreement the Australian Government provides substantial financial assistance to the States for welfare housing and the Agreement specifically provides that the advances may be used for the purpose of providing accommodation for couples of which the main breadwinner is an invalid, and for single invalid persons as well as for families in receipt of low incomes. Under the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act grants, currently on a 12 for SI basis, are made to charitable, benevolent and other non-profit organisations to assist them in providing residential accommodation for handicapped persons who work in sheltered or open employment. In certain circumstancesfinancialassistance is also made available under the Repatriation Act and the Social Service Act towards the cost of installing in a disabled person's home ramps, handrails or other special aids to daily living. Provision is made in the Defence Service Homes Act whereby the Director of Defence Service Homes may, in special circumstances, reduce the deposit below the normal minimum deposit of 5 per cent of purchase money. This power is being exercised to assist eligible widows, seriously incapacitated applicants and other whose family obligations make it difficult for them to accumulate the normal minimum deposit, and to purchase a home on a minimal deposit. ' (3) As therighthonourable member is aware the Government proposes to introduce legislation in the current sittings of Parliament to establish an Australian Housing Corporation which will be empowered to cater for homeseekers within the Australian Government's constitutional responsibilities. The provision of housingfinanceto disabled persons will be one of the matters which will be closely examined by die new Australian Housing Corporation when it is established. NA upon notice were circulated: Nursing Homes: Privacy of Inmates (Question No. 906), (Question No. 937) Mr Adermann asked the Minister for Social Security, upon nouce: (1) Is it a departmental requirement, covering registered nursing homes, that inmates leaving homes on outings should sign out and sign in, and for umes and dates to be recorded. (2) Is it also a requirement for inmates to have entered in a register, later inspected and stamped by a Government inspector, the fullreasonsand details for afl such outings; if so, will he reconsider the severity of this requirement. (3) If an assurance of the rcputability of nursing homes is required, will he consider some other course which docs not intrude into the privacy of the inmates and which does not give such an appearance of minute 'Big Brother' supervision and regimentation of nursing home inmates.",117
219,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable right member's question is as follows: (1) Nursing home proprietors arerequiredto keep a register showing periods of temporary absence of patients. However, in regard to. theregisterthe Department requires only that simple details of departure and return for the pauents concerned be recorded. The onus is placed on the nursing home proprietor for the keeping of the register and all entries are made by members of the nursing home staff. Signatures are not required either from the pauents or staff members as certificauon of the periods involved is incorporated into the nursing home benefits claim form which is signed by the proprietor or his agent. (2) Where a patient is absent from an approved nursing home in excess of 72 hours, except in certain circumstances, e.g. special consideration is given at the Christmas and Easter holiday periods, the panent must be formally discharged and a fresh application for approval of admission must be submitted to, and approved by, my Department prior to the patient'sre-admissionto the home. This requirement is waived where the patient is transferred temporarily to an approved hospital. Also, the present Government has allowed the 72 hour period to be extended during the Easier and Christmas holiday periods to enable patients to visit relatives without any unduerestrictions.While it is necessary for nursing home proprietors to record briefly the reason for any leave-of-absence, only a minimum of details are required, e.g. 'patient visiting relatives . . .'or'. . . patient admitted to (tide) approved hospital for treatment'. (3) As stated in my answer to question (1) it is necessary that temporary absences of patients from approved nursing homes be recorded so that effective control can be maintained over the payment of Australian Government nursing home benefits. It is not considered that the minimum details required, concerning a patient's absence from a nursing home, constitutes an intrusion into the privacy of the patient The only 'supervision' or patients in approved nursing homes is the minimum necessary to maintain effective control over the expenditure of public money on nursing home benefits, which it is estimated will exceed SI60m in the currentfinancialyear. I would point out to the honourable member that the existingrequirementsinregardto the keeping of aregisterof absences were introduced by the Liberal-Country Party Government. Another requirement aimed at providing supervision over periods of accommodation by patients in nursing homes was waived from 1 January 1973. Prior to January 1973 each nursing home patient was required to sign a form each month certifying that he was accommodated for the period or periods for which the nursing home claimed nursing home benefits.
