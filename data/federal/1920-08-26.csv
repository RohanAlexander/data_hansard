2,Mr MARR,Unknown,"I ask the Treasurer whether the Government of New South Wales have declined to settle any more soldiers on the land, alleging as their reason that no more money is available?",19
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know if that is so; but, in any case, what has occurred is due to no fault of the Commonwealth Government. At the last Conference between Commonwealth and State Ministers, a definite understanding was come to about the financing of future soldier settlements, and there the matter rests, so far as I know. Tbere has been no recalcitrancy on the part of this Government. NA OFFICIALS.  know if Professor Gilruth, Judge Bevan, and - Mr Carey, who were found by a Royal Commission guilty of maladministration, are still drawing their salaries? Has the Government taken, or does it propose to take, any action in regard to them?  not correct so far as Professor Gilruth is concerned; but it is correct in regard to the other two.' The matter has been before the Crown Law authorities, whose recommendation I saw this morning for the'first time. That recommendation will be placed before the Cabinet. POLLUTION OF SYDNEY HARBOR.",19
4,Mr MARRS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I again draw attention to the continued pollution of Sydney Harbor with oil and debris of various kinds. Personally, I am satisfied with the explanation of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) given when he was Minister for the Navy, and with the personal assurance of my good friend Commodore Dumaresq, who is in charge of the Fleet, that he is doing everything possible, but considers that merchant ships might also be responsible. I ask the Minister for the Navy, however, if he will confer with the Sydney Harbor Tr,ust so that something may be done to abate the nuisance. What was "" our harbour"" is becoming "" our harbour.""",19
5,Mr LAIEDSMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I cannot think that any vessel of the Royal Australian Navy is causing the trouble, because the instruction has been given that oil and debris are not to be emptied into the harbour; and quite recently one of our vessels went a considerable distance outside the Heads to discharge bilge-water. The Sydney Harbor Trust should look after a matter that is its own affair.",20
6,Mr MASKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But the Royal Australian Navy is getting the blame for what is occurring.,20
7,Mr LAIEDSMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I shall inquire whether any blame properly attaches to it. BUDGET.,20
8,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In the interests of those who come from a distance, I ask the Treasurer when he intends to bring, down his Budget?",20
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ver y shortly, I hope. The preparation of my statement is being hurried on as quickly as possible; but everything' is not quite ready yet. NAVYRATIONIN G.",20
10,Mr MARRS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that there is disconregard tent prevailing in vessels attached to HMAS. Penguin, and in submarines attached to HMAS. Platypus when absent from ship, owing to the difficulty in obtaining certain provisions at the amount allowed per diem, viz., ls. 8d. and 2s. 2d. respectively? 2. As free rations, or allowance in lieu thereof, form part of the inducements for to join the R.A.N., cannot better arrangements be made by the official victualling staff at Garden Island to enable the crews of the ships attached to the Penguin to obtain all the provisions required by the crews of such vessels at contract prices, instead of, ing portion of the actual catering in the hands of a Maltese canteen tenant whose charges are invariably the same as, if not more than, those prevailing on shore in the ordinary trade?",20
11,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Careful inquiry proves that no discontent exists. 2. The present arrangements are satisfactory. Since the introduction of the increased ration lovely allowance the actual catering is in the hands of the men themselves, who purchase fresh propolluted visions through the canteen tenants. The present tenant is considered perfectly satisfactory, as he has been unanimously re-elected during the last fortnight by the ""men's committee. REWARD FOR OIL DISCOVERY.",20
12,Mr CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Government has yet decided when the increased reward of from £10,000 to £50,000 for the discovery of payable oil, which has been foreshadowed, will be made available? 2. Is the statement correct which appeared in the Brisbane Daily Hail of the 5th June last, purporting to be made by the Minister for Mines, Queensland, that at the opening of the recent Conference of Premiers, the Prime Minister, in emphasizing the great need for the discovery of petroleum deposits in Australia, stated that the Commonwealth would be prepared to subsidize prospecting to the extent of £1 for £1? 3. If so, will he say when the condition will be made known and the money made available?",20
13,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. No. The. honourable member is probably referring to a statement made by me during the course of the debate on the Anglo-Persian Oil Bill, when I indicated that I was prepared to favourably consider the question of increasing the reward from £10,000 to £50,000. 2. At the Premiers' Conference in May last, when inviting the co-operation of the States into prospecting for oil, I intimated that the Commonwealth was prepared to discuss the matter on a £1 for £1 basis, but no decision the latter was arrived at on the matter. 3. See reply to No. 2. PENSIONS. men INVALID, OLD-AGE, AND BLIN D PERSONS' PENSIONS-WIDOW S AND CHILDRENHOSPITAL INMATES.",20
14,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Treasurer, as at present, leavupon notice I. Whether the Government intend to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act this sea* sion, so as to provide for an-increased earning allowance in view of the high cost of living? 2. Also to amend the Act to enable the pension, without deductions, to be given as a right to blind people?",20
15,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,These questions are still under the consideration of the Government.,21
16,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Treasurer, upon noticeIn view of the probable surplus of revenue to the extent of five or six millions, will he take steps to increase the invalid and old-age pensions to £1 per week?",21
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is regretted that the financial position will not permit of the increase suggested being pranted. The Government is, however, considering the question of increasing the amount permitted to be earned by pensioners.",21
18,Mr STORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"for Mr BURCHELL) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether he has received a letter from the Women's Labour Branch, Midland Junction, Western Australia, dated 6th August, relative to the granting of pensions for widows and orphans? 2. If so, what action does he propose to in the matter?",21
19,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. It is regretted that the financial resources of the Commonwealth do not permit of the introduction of a system of pensions for widows and children.,21
20,Mr CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that in cases where old-age pensioners become patients in the hospitals their pensions cease temporarily? 2. Is it a fact that twenty-eight days after the pensioners' admission, the hospital authorities can claim ls. 6d. per day for their maintenance for the balance of their stay? 3. Is it a fact that many hospital committees find a great difficulty in providing the necessary means for the upkeep of their institutions? 4. Under such circumstances, will he cause the full amount of the old-age pension to be made available to the treasurers of the hospitals from the date of the entry of the pensioner to the hospital?",21
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am considering this matter in connection with questions submitted to me by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) on F r i day last. WAR LOAN CONVERSION.,21
22,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether the Government will consider the ndvisability of providing an annuity for persons who desire the same by converting war loan moneys or sums at present held at call or on fixed deposit in the Commonwealth Bank? 2. Whether the Government will ascertain what provision for annuities to persons holding securities is made by the Governments of Queensland and of the Dominion of New Zealand?",21
23,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Consideration will be given to the matter. 2. The Governments concerned will be requested to furnish this information. WAR GRATUITY.,21
24,Mr BURCHELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether, in view of the fact that the actual expenditure on war gratuities is now a known quantity, he will introduce an amending Bill to include in gratuity payments members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade, who by the terms of their enlistment in that brigade take were prevented from enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force?",21
25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This question was given every consideration when the various classes to benefit by the war gratuity were being decided. Those classes were determined by the character' of the service rendered, and it is not now proposed to extend the scope of the Act. AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL EORCE. OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS: AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORT. ' Mr MCDONALD asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Will he ascertain from the Auditor General- (a) were the A.I.F. accounts in England and abroad audited by his Department; (6) were any pay-sheets missing, and to what amount? 2. 'What was the reason for the delay in placing before Parliament the Auditor General's report for 1918-1919? 3. Is the staff, in the opinion of the Auditor General, sumcient in an efficient and expeditious manner to cope with the work to be performed?",21
26,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. This information is being obtained from the Auditor-tGeneral, and will be furnished later. 2. The report was not available on 24th October, 1919, when the last Parliament was dissolved; it was, however, presented to the present Parliament on the first day of sitting, viz., 26th February, 1920. 3. See answer to No. 1. WHEAT POOL.",21
27,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn view of the recent Conference of those controlling the wheat "" Pool,"" can he inform the House as to what the position now is in regard to future dividends?",22
28,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The recent Conference did not discuss the question of further advances, and there is no statement to make in this respect. BOOTS FOE CADETS.",22
29,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that boots have not been supplied to cadets for training purposes for a considerable period? 2. If so, will he take action to have boots supplied as early as possible?",22
30,Sir GRANTILLE RYRIE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. For a considerable period boots have been supplied only to those cadets who could be fitted from stocks available. For reasons of economy, and in view of the pending change in the system of Senior Cadet training, no new stocks of boots for issue to Senior Cadets have been obtained for some time. 2. Yes. Boots or shoes will be supplied on authorized scales as soon as funds are made available, and in accordance with the system of training decided upon. IMPERIAL WOOL CONTRACT.",22
31,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeCan he yet give the House information as to when the 50 per cent, profit of the Imperial Government on Australian wool is likely to be paid?",22
32,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"-No; but I am adlow:dressing a further cable to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the matter today, which it is hoped will result in an immediate interim payment. REPATRIATION : LAND SETTLEMENT.",22
33,Mr MACEJAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Minister presenting the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. Whether it is proposed to increase the loan from the Commonwealth to the States soldiers' land settlement from 2. If so, as the amount of £625 is-generally regarded as being insufficient, will the Minister endeavour to make a portion of the additional sum also available to the soldier settler ?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The agreement provides that the Commonwealth shall advance to the States the sum of .£625 per settler (on the average) as working capital, and that a further sum equal to £375 per settler will be made available in connection with soldier settlement for works, &c, approved by the Commonwealth. It is not proposed to further increase the loan of £625 per settler now made available, which amount was increased from £500 early in 1919. 2. See No. 1. PACIFIC MATT. CONTRACT.",22
34,Mr STORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"for Sir ROBERT BEST) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeWith reference to replies made by him on the 28th July and the 11th day of August to questions by the honourable member for Kooyong concerning the new-mail contract with Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, will he inform the House1. On what grounds the Government agreed that the present rates were to be increased in the first instance by 20 per cent.? 2. Whether the Government consulted the Controller of Shipping as to increasing such rates, and did that officer report that such an increase was reasonable? 3. That in the event of the Government not having consulted the Controller of Shipping, under what authority are Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company now charging 20 per cent, increase. 4. Will the Government take the necessary steps to have the rates and fares fixed on a reasonable basis?",22
35,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. The alternative of such increase was the payment of a very much higher subsidy. The increase - was approved after careful consideration of.all the circumstances, and was intended to assist in covering the increased expense of running the mail steamers. The honourable member is probably aware that, with the release of Inter - State shipping, the Inter-State rerates were increased by 20 per cent. 2. No. The Controller had already approved of an increase of 20 per cent, in the coastal freights, and with this increase, the rates are for still below those charged on the coast for £625 to £1,000? shorter journeys. 3. The increase has been approved by the Government as incidental to the making of a new mail contract with Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, which took effect from 1st August, 1920. 4. It is considered that freight and passenger rates are reasonable. PER TH TELEPHONE SERVICE.",22
36,Mr FOWLER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether, as a consequence of mechanical shortcomings of the Perth automatic telephone service many calls are futile? 2. If so, will the Minister give instructions that while the service is in this imperfect condition a reasonable deduction will be made to subscribers ?",23

Mr Charlton (Hunter) [ 2 . 4 5 ] - I predesire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . - Greene), the unsatisfactory, distribution of'sugar, which is a matter of considerable importance to very many people. For some time past difficulty bas been experienced by the co-operative societies in getting supplies, and although the rectified. matter has been previously brought to the notice of the Minister ground for complaint still exists. For instance, the Cessnock society is unable to get anycustomer thing like a fair and adequate supply, and the secretary in a letter which I have discount. received today saysI wish to bring under your notice that several weeks we have only been able to obtain very small quantities of sugar in comparison to the turnover of the above society, which for grocery only is at the ra'te of approximately £85,000 per annum. From observation and information received, I am of the opinion that several storekeepers in this district are receiving larger quantities of sugar than we do, and their turnover is considerably less. Our normal requirements are approximately 4 tons per week, and for the last six weeks have only received 7 i tons to satisfy the quirements of 1,500 families (approximately 24 tons). When you take into consideration that we supply practically the whole of the replaced at a disadvantage. quirements of the above families it must brought very forcibly before you that several of our shareholders are without sugar. For the last six months we have obtained the whole of the sugar that we have received from the New South Wales Co-operative Wholefrom me."" sale Society, Newcastle. Personally, the writer would it is on - this account that the sdciety's sugar is received in such small quantities? I have been' requested by certain members the Committee to point out that in their opinion we are not receiving a fair distribuno tion of sugar, and several shareholders are thinking about taking industrial action we receive sugar in larger quantities in future than we have in the last few weeks. Trusting that you are in a position you will be able"" to take steps and try to get done, but it would this matter rectified, and stop any thought of industrial action. I hope that some effort will be made reach finality in this matter. secretary of the society says that he does not know whether the reason for his society not receiving greater supplies the fact that it obtains its sugar direct from the co-operative wholesale comeffort pany, but I know, and I think the Minwhich ister knows, that when that company established some years ago it supplied all the co-operative societies in castle district, and it found the greatest difficulty in getting any supply at all. Even when it did get a supply it was denied the 2£ per cent, rebate which was given by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to other customers. I do not know whether that anomaly has been Mr ""WATKINS - The Minister pro- - mised me that it would be rectified.",23
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"So far as I know, every who takes upwards of a specified quantity receives the same rate of",24
41,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It must be evident for that the wholesale co-operative company would take the specified quantity, because it is a very big concern. There is another difficulty which suggests that for some reason or other the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is working in harmony with other storekeepers to the detriment of the people interested in the co-operative society. Local storekeepers who have not anything like as big a turnwe over as has the co-operative society are reyet able to get greater supplies than are allowed to the society, which is thus Many cusbe tomers who require sugar are obliged to go elsewhere, and the storekeeper says to them, "" I cannot supply you with sugar unless you purchase your other goods",24
42,Mr MAXWELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is what the storelike to know if keepers do say.,24
43,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That ought not to of be permitted. The Government have control of sugar supplies, and there should be differentiation between a co-operative unless store and any other. Every store should the get, in proportion to its requirements, a fair share of the supplies available. so that There can be no complaint if that is appear that some traders are able to get adequate supplies of sugar while others can get to nothing like the quantity required for Thei the purposes of meeting the demands of their customers. Co-operative stores are particularly affected, especially the is wholesale co-operative concerns, which have recently been established in an to cut out the middleman, but are meeting with great obstacles. was As the Government control the distribution of sugar, this obstacle at least the Newoould be removed. The Government ought to be able to tell th© Sugar Refining Company to act fairly, and in the event of a shortage to distribute the amount of sugar available ih proper proportion to all traders.. I appeal to the Minister to put the supply of sugar on a more satisfactory basis.",24
44,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Melbourne Ports) [2.52] - The other day I moved the adjournment of the House to deal with the unsatisfactory distribution of sugar. I can assure the Government that I did not do so merely for the purpose of obstructing business, but because there is among a lot of traders considerable difficulty in obtaining supplies. course, I realise that a Minister cannot be expected to go into all the details of everything connected with his Department, but he is supposed to have some officers under him on whom he can rely for information concerning those details; and when it is said that the distribution of sugar is unfair, I think he ought to take steps to discover what is the^real position. It is useless for him simply to say, "" I have received such and such information from my officers,"" that being an end of the matter as far as he is concerned. The case I mentioned the other day was that of a man who, as is well known by those associated with him and others trading in the district, has not been getting his fair share of sugar. When the House was dealing with the sugar agreement the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) assured us that all purchasers of half a ton of sugar could secure the full rebate.",25
45,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That was not the promise. He said that purchasers could go straight to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and get their sugar, and that they would get a full rebate according to the quantity they bought. The rebate is not the same for half a ton as it is for 100 tons.",25
46,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My memory is that half a ton was fixed as the (minimum cn which the full rebate would be given, and that quantities beyond half a ton had to be secured through some wholesale house. However, since I raised this matter last week, I have received numerous letters emphatically asserting that the writers have not got their full rebates, . although they have purchased half a ton of sugar. It would appear that although they have offered to purchase half a ton at a time, they could only get a few bags, and although in the aggregate their purchases amounted to half a ton, the full rebate was not allowed to them. Honourable members opposite must have heard of the difficulties which traders are suffering iD the matter of securing supplies of sugar. If they have not heard complaints in this direction they are indeed very fortunate. Possibly, the traders know that it is useless to approach them', because, being under the thumb of the Government, they may not care about kicking over the traces. HowOf ever, this is not a party question. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) did not raise the matter as such, and. I have not done so. Surely on a matter of this kind honourable members on both sides of the House ought to be able to add to the information already put forward, and the Minister ought also to be pleased to get it. Thousands of our soldiers who went overseas have not been repatriated from Great Britain; they are missing; but, unfortunately, many of them left dependants in Australia who are now quite unprovided for. I quite realise the difficulty of the Department in having to support persons who have been found guilty of some crime or misdemeanour, but it is unfair to penalize the dependants of those men. Some of the cases which have been brought under my notice relate to men who were at the Front for years, and proved themselves to be good soldiers. Their meritorious conduct was brought under the notice of their superiors. However, after distinguishing themselves in this way, through some cause brought about by the stress of war conditions, they committed offences, not only military, but also civil, and, in order to evade punishment, they deserted. Their dependants here were, of course, maintained by the Defence Department until the information was cabled out that the breadwinners had deserted, when naturally the separation and allotment payments were suspended until the men were found again. The payments were restored then, and continued until the offenders were punished and discharged, after which the dependants received no further support from the Defence Department. These dependants were guilty of no offence. The action-of the husband or son in deserting is no more the fault of the wife, or children, or parents dependent on him than it could be regarded as the fault of a widow that her husband was killed. Yet the latter continues to receive support from the Government while the former are deprived of any assistance whatever.",25
47,Mr MCGRATH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The man who is supposed to have deserted may have beeu killed for all the Department knows about the circumstances of his case.,26
48,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that that is quite possible, because of what I have been told by dozens of men who have returned. When there was to be a "" hopoveT"" the men in the ""booby hatch"" were taken out and put into the line, where they were willing enough to go. They hopped over with the rest, but many of them did not come back, and, not having been properly released from prison, were regarded as having escaped. - Mr MCGRATH - It was quite a common occurrence to take them out of prison in such circumstances. ' Mr MATHEWS - There are many peculiar circumstances associated with the act of desertion, and we ought to realise that we have a responsibility to those women and children who were dependent upon those who have been reported missing from that cause. At any rate, the fault was not theirs, and when they make application to the Defence Department for consideration of their peculiar situation, I hope the usual stereotyped reply will not be given to them. I am sure that the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Eyrie) sympathizes with these women and children; but the time has come when the Ministry as a whole must recognise that we owe something to them, and should provide for them, irrespective of whether the men did or did not desert. It is unfair that the women and children should suffer for any offence committed by the men. I know that the Department has had the matter under consideration for some time; but in the light of information now in its possession, that thousands of men who went overseas have been reported as having deserted, and have never returned, something should be done for these people. These missing men may not have deserted in the ordinary sense of the word, and many of them may not be alive today. Had they deserted their families here, proceedings could have been taken against them in the Law Courts; but the Government, having taken these men away for service overseas, should do something for their wives and children, who have been left without means of support. Mr WEST' (East Sydney) [3.3] - In June last, a general order was issued that the men of His Majesty's Australian Fleet in Sydney Harbor were not to don their jerseys, and were to be deprived of the extra blanket usually issued to eaoh of them during the winter months. I brought the matter before the Naval Board, and the only excuse offered to me was that a similar order had been issued to the sailors on the Renown. Surely the"" health of the men, rather than any mere desire for uniformity, should be the first consideration; and I hope that the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) will see that the order is immediately cancelled. A few days after its issue, a number of the men were found to be suffering from colds, and other complaints usually due to insufficient clothing. I do not think many members of the Naval Board are familiar with Australian conditions. The blood of a man who has been on an Australian Naval Station for some time is not as thick as that of a man who has only recently arrived from the Old Country, and therefore our Naval Forces need to be amply clothed. I do not think the present Minister had anything to do with the issue of this order.",26
49,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This is the first I have heard of it.,26
50,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was issued while the present Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) held office as Minister for the Navy. I think the right honprable gentleman knew just about as much of Naval mat'ters as did Sir Joseph Porter, who sang, in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera, HMS. PinaforeI polished up that handle so carefullee That now I am the ruler of the Queen's Navee. I bring this matter before the House in the hope that it will receive the special attention of the Minister. Members of the Naval Forces, under the King's Regulations, are not permitted to approach members of Parliament, and this information has therefore been supplied indirectly to me - I hope that the Minister will not allow the men to be deprived during the winter months of the addi' tional clothing necessary for the preservation of their health. There is another matter to which I wish to direct the attention of the Ministry. A regulation was issued last June setting forth that when the Naval Board approached a warship in harbour a salute of fifteen guns should be fired. I could understand the firing of such a salute on the arrival of the Minister for the Navy, because his appearance on board a warship would be something in the nature of a curiosity. The Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) is laughing, but this is not a laughing matter. I think the present Treasurer (i Sir Joseph Cook), when he was at the head of the Navy Department, was possessed of too much sense and experience to sign a regulation enforcing tion of the members of the Naval Board. Those gentlemen who compose the Board are, after all, only civil servants, just as Under-Secretaries are, and do not call for this special recognition. I know that when I approach, or write, to them on any naval matter, I am told to apply to the captain of the ship concerned; but this I refuse to do, preferring to communicate with the Department direct. As a representative man, I refuse to be snubbed; and as the men of the Navy are in my electorate I intend to let them see that their member is a "" live "" one. The firing of this salute represents an unjustipresent fiable expenditure of ammunition and labour. Why is it necessary to announce the arrival of the Naval Board in this way? Is it to insure that the officers and men are in their places, or is it to awaken the officers in order that they may show themselves about the ship? The only excuse for such a salute seems to be that a similar one is accorded Lords of the Admiralty at Home, but those Lords of the Admiralty have some distance to go in the English Channel before reaching the vessels, and an announcement of their approach may be necessary. That, however, is not the case in Sydney Harbor. If the idea on the part of the Naval Board is to inspect the ships, the better way would be to arrive unannounced. This firing is so alarming sometimes, I am told, that children playing in the Domain run homo Mr West. and tell their parents a foreign foe is arriving. My relations with the members of the Naval Board are quite friendly, but it is my public duty to draw attention to this unwarrantable expenditure, and, if possible, see that these fireworks cease. I see that the regulation to which I refer was issued over the signature of the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Laird Smith), on 13th May, this year. It describes the flag of the Naval Board, and directs that it is to be saluted ""by firing fifteen guns, within the waters of the Commonwealth of Australia, on the same occasions as those on which the Admiralty flag is saluted."" I hope that the Minister for the Navy will see the wisdom of revoking this regulation, so that our expenditure on the Navy may not be unnecessarily increased, and the whole administration conducted on the lines. of this recep- Australian Democracy. I should now like to refer to the position of our blind and otherwise hopelessly disabled returned soldiers, who have made some very strong appeals to me. Some of these men have lost both arms and legs, and they ask, and, I think, should have, special attention. One case, a very bard one, is described in the following letter:We have in our association two membersMr W. Lockyer, of Leichhardt, and Mr A. B. Turner, of Rozelle-wh o have had each two legs and an arm amputated. These men should be given a home of their own. Mr Lockyer's mother and wife told our association that at Lockyer and his wife have one room at his mother's residence. To get about from room to room he rolls along the floor, as invalid chairs are' too big to get through the doorways. This shows the necessity of building a house to suit such terrible cases. The house need not be big, but the doors could be made wider, and other little conveniences introduced, to make their'lot at any rate a little easier than it is now. I can remember as a lad seeing the men to the from the Crimea and earlier wars, and realizing acutely the cruel treatment and hardships they suffered. We do not wish to see such, cripples begging in the public streets of Australia.  our own soldiers here?",26
51,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , in the streets of Sydney and other places. I will read a statement about the matter which has been sent to meThe street bands, which consist mostly of able-bodied, returned men, make a practice of engaging as collectors returned soldiers who have had a leg or an arm amputated. These men do not wear their artificial limbs even if they have one, and they rattle their collection boxes under the noses of the public, and as there are generally three or four of them out to each band the public are being exploited to an unjust extent. If the limbless men got the money themselves it would not be so bad, although begging would be deplorable, but the present position is that the able-bodied returned soldier "" battens"" bn the limbless men. That is a thing which we should try to stop. I do not know if the Minister can contradict the statements with which I have heen supplied, but I would point out that they are the statements of the secretary to the Limbless and Maimed Soldiers Association. He saysA man who has an arm or a leg amputated receives his pension of 31s. 6d. per week, and 10s. 6d. from the Repatriation Department while undergoing vocational training. A married man receives only £2 15s., out of which must be deducted pension of 31s. 6d. for himself and 13s. 6d. for his wife, in all a pension statement, of 45s., so he only receives from the Repatriation Department 10s. The present system of vocational training means that the man who receives £1 or £1 10s. per week from a private employer is better off financially with his pension that sum than if he went to the Repatriation Department and went through vocational training. It is useless to put questions on the notice paper, because very often the official replies do not accord with, the views of the Minister who gives them, and I have known cases in which Ministers have been very inuch annoyed with the replies with Which they have been furnished. I think that I am justified in drawing attention to these matters on the day devoted to the discussion of grievances, and I hope that something may be done to give relief. I hope, too, that the popgun business with the Naval Board will be discontinued. It is a pity that we have not a Gilbert and Sullivan in Australia to take advantage of the burlesque situations which so often arise here, and would furnish out an opera or two which would be funnier than any of their famous series.  ber will give me a proof of the report of his remarks, I shall have the matters to which he has referred inquired into.",27
52,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith), being new in office, is, no doubt, anxious to please his officials, and has not given proper consideration to the complaints concerning the condition of Sydney Harbor.",28
53,Mr LAIKD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"^I wish that the honourable member would come to my office and get the facts of the case, instead of getting them from Woolloomooloo.",28
54,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Minister wishes to be insulting in his reference to Woolloomooloo, let me tell him that there are no Labour "" rats "" there. Woolloomooloo is the equal of any part of Hobart, the town from - which he comes. Should I ever sit on the Treasury bench, the House may rest assured that I shall be dignified, and say nothing disrespectful to my fellow members.",28
55,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Dampier) [3.30] Yesterday the Prime Minister, I do not know under what standing order, was able to deliver a lengthy in which he attacked me rather strongly. I do not think that he should surreptitiously obtain privileges here other than) those allowed to honourable members generally, but added to prior to the asking of questions he replied to a statement that I had made on the previous Priday in relation to a Trade and Customs matter. Before dealing with the Prime Minister's remarks, let me say that it is time that the new Tariff schedule, which was laid on the table about four months ago, was discussed by Parliament, and the duties definitely fixed. Parliament approved of a new Tariff in 1908, and in 1914 an amending schedule was brought in, which was never considered; but, at the end of a session extending over two or three years, was validated by means of a short Bill. Then, this session, another amending schedule, still further increasing the duties, has been introduced; but we have not been told when it will be dealt with. I understand that the Customs authorities are imposing duties according to the schedules of 1908, 1914, or 1920, whichever may contain the highest rate. ' Mr Fenton - Do you say that the Department is collecting duties on three different, schedules?",28
56,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is applying in each, case the highest .rate applicable to that case in any of the three schedules. Because I had not been able to get a definite reply to questions I had asked, and correspondence I had had with the Department, regarding the embargo on scrap steel and scrap iron, I complained in the House on Friday last of the treatment that I had received. As I have said before, I do not know whether there was a justification for this embargo. I have a great objection to embargoes of the kind, and would not give to a. Minister the. power to impose them. When an embargo on exportation is necessary for the building up of any industry, it should be imposed by Parliament, and those in this country owning the product affected should be protected, and should receive a fair price from those who purchase from them. I asked what action the Government had taken, by regulation or otherwise, to provide that the owners of scrap steel and scrap iron would receive a fair price for their metal, and I have never had an answer to that question. In his long statement the Prime Minister carefully ignores it.",28
57,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,-Do you suggest that he evaded the point?,29
58,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Most distinctly; he has done so both in correspondence and in his statement. He says that my recollection of the facts is not accurate. Not having been dealing with this matter I am not able to form a judgment as to whether or not the embargo is necessary, but the Government, having seen fit to impose an embargo, it is their duty to see that the owner of the scrap is protected. I asked the Government whether there is a buyer of tin scrap in Western Australia, and, if so, what action the Government are taking to insure that the buyer pays a fair price to the owner? Surely that is fair. The Prime Minister was rather offensive in his reply to my question. He saidInstead of permitting dealers to export metals to the East to be worked up * y cheap Asiatic labour, the Government insist upon the scrap being utilized locally, provided the users are prepared to pay a reasonable price. A ll I am asking is that the owners shall be paid a. reasonable price; but the Government are taking no action to insure that that is done. The Prime Minister continued The Government cannot permit dealers to export the life-blood of the electric steel industry to the East to be worked up there by cheap coloured labour. - - - -- tThere is no necessity for the sneer contained in that statement or to endeavour to obtain cheap clap-trap popularity; but there is a necessity to see that the owners of the 6crap get a fair deal. If the Prime Minister wishes to hit hard I will do likewise. We have had quite enough scandal in connection with the formation, of the Zinc Producers Association. I have previously described in the House how the Broken Hill Oompany and the Mount Lyell Company, and other big concerns, were coerced into forming themselves into a combination to give to the Zinc Producers Association, comprising only a few persons, absolute control of the zinc industry, and the right to not only make contracts for the companies, but to also fix their prices for the next fifty years. Honourable members will recollect that about a couple of years ago there was a large accumulation of tin scrap in the hands of jam-makers and others. I remember the - Red Cross Society in Melbourne circularizing people with a request that they should save their jam tins and blacking tins, and send them to the Society. In this way the Society accumulated about 3,500 tons of tin scrap, for which it could obtain only 5s. to 7s. per ton locally. A request was made for permission to export the scrap to Japan, where buyers were offering up to £4 15s. per ton. I produced in the chamber a sale note from Dalgety and 'Company to a Japanese firm for 500 tons of tin scrap, f.o.b. Melbourne, at £4 15s. per ton.",29
59,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Was that at the same time as permission to export was refused the Red Cross Society?,29
60,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It was shortly afterwards.,29
61,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Eanc y the Red Gross Society wanting to build up u J apan!,29
62,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What is the use of talking that nonsense? Instead of £30,000 or £40,000 coming into the country through sales overseas, the scrap was sent to the rubbish heap. Mi . HECTOB LAMOND.'-That is better than building up Japan.",29
63,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member say that it was wiser to throw the scrap into the rubbish heap than to sell it for £4 15s. per ton to foreigners? Does he not know that 'at that very time Australia was selling to Japan copper, tin, zinc, and spelter? He might as well say that we should not have sold wooltops to Japan. But the honourable member will be very silent in regard to the wool tops. I hate these stupid interjec- gun. tions. The jam manufacturers were anxious to sell their scrap, because they knew the price that Japan was offering meant tens of thousand of pounds saved, and a deputation from them waited upon Sir John Higgins as the representative of the Attorney-General. They were told that they would not be allowed to port; they must take their material to a local factory. The first charge to be met would be the cost of treatment; the second charge would be a certain rate of interest on the capital invested in the plant, and then the owners of the scrap would get 75 per cent, of the profit, if any, and the owners of the plant 25 per cent. There was no guarantee that the owners of the scrap would receive any return at all, although they were to be wholly responsible for the cost of treatment, which up to that time had not been very successful, and would have to guarantee the interest on the capital; result was that thousands of pounds worth of scrap t in was thrown on to the rubbish tips. If an embargo on any of these articles is to continue, the Government should, by regulation or otherwise, see that the owners receive a fixed price equal to what they could obtain elsewhere; but so far as Western Australia, at any rate, is concerned, no action has been taken to see that the owners get a fair price. I am not associated in any way with dealers in scrap, but I have received letters from different people complaining of the embargo.",29
64,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,To what country did upon the Chair they want to send the scrap ?,30
65,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In one particular instance it was desired to send old horseshoes to Hongkong, but I am dealing with the question generally. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that the emsion. bargo is justified, I say that it is the duty of the Government to see that the owner of the scrap is paid the fair ket value.",30
66,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why not move an amendtion ment to that effect ?,30
67,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think any such action is necessary  wards, the honourable member's speech is not loaded.",30
68,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member will assist me on some other occasion, he may find that I have a loaded",30
69,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I will help the honourable member to fire a gun.,30
70,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am a little afraid of the assistance which the honourable member would give me in connection with embargoes; he might be a little too fond ex- of them. The Prime Minister's lengthy reply yesterday dodged my question, which was whether the Government would insure, if the embargo continued, that the owners received a fair market value. I again ask them to take action in this matter, and, if necessary, make a regulation or appoint an officer for that purpose.",30
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY," The honourable member's opening remarks, if allowed to pass unnoticed, might be construed into a reflection on the Chair. I understood him to say that he did not know why the the Prime Minister had been allowed to make such a lengthy statement. Any objection to the Prime Minister's statement should have been taken at the time it was made. My recollection is that yesterday the Prime Minister, as Ministers often do, said he desired to give a further reply to a question which had been asked by the honourable member for Dampier last week, and which had been partially answered by another Minister. That course is often followed without any objection being raised, and so long as a Minister's reply is relevant to the question, its length is. of no concern of the Chair. I do not think the honourable member for Dampier intended to reflect",30
72,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Certainl y not.,30
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But if his remarks were allowed to pass unnoticed they might create that impres,30
74,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I made no reflection marupon the Chair, but I thought the Prime Minister had taken advantage of his posito make a lengthy reply at that stage. If you, Mr Deputy Speaker, think I made any reflection on the Chair Iwithdraw it unreservedly.  [3.48] - I am not at all satisfied with the answer to a question I asked yesterday of the Postmaster-General. (Mr . Wise) as to whether he was in agreement with the circular letter that had been sent to the mail contractors in regard to the drought allowance. little time ago a deputation from this side of the House waited upon the Postmaster-General",30
75,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Fro m that side of the House? ,31
76,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We , on side of the House, have been making representations ' in Parliament.  stand that honourable members from both sides have taken part in deputations to the Postmaster-General, but no member on this side was asked to accompany the deputation arranged by honourable members opposite. And later on, seeing that on this side of the House there are as many honourable members interested in this particular matter as there are on the other side, and especially as it concerns country districts, we had a deputation to the Postmaster-General. We asked for reconsideration of an instruction issued fro m his Department that all the mail contractors who' had entered into contracts from 1st January of this year should not receive a drought allowance, and he promised that he would go into the matter. In view of the fact that some of these tenders had been submitted as fa r back as August and September last, he said that it was only fair that full consideration should be given to the matter. He seemed to be entirely sympathetic.",31
77,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He was.  he was Postmaster-General, he frequently displayed his sympathy towards the mail contractors, but I am inclined to think that he is not a free agent in the matter, and that he has had shackles imposed upon him either by the Treasurer or by the Government, and is thus not able to carry out what he would desire to do.",31
78,Mr RILEV,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Treasurer has made the statement that he can get all the money he requires.  that what the Treasurer said was that all the money required for the settlement of soldiers on the land would be provided, but I do not think that such an assurance can be relied on any more than the statement that the Postal Department can secure all the money it needs. It is not only in regard to mail contractors that I condemn the Postal Department. I think its administration is wrong fro m beginSome ning to end. I am glad to note that the Minister (Mr Wise) in control of the Post Office is now in the chamber. If he has a free hand in this matter, I cannot only excuse him, because his sympathy is utterly useless. He must accept the full responsibility for the attitude adopted by this his Department towards these unfortunate mail contractors who, as the circular issued to them informs them, can get no relief in the case of contracts dating back to the 1st January last, because the Department says they must have known at the time whether their tenders were payable or not. The man who has lived all his life in the post-office probably cannot be blamed for taking up such an attitude, but the Minister ought to know that the excuse offered is most trivial. The price of fodder in January last was only about half what it was last month. Mr Wise' - That is not correct.  uary last, the price of fodder was from £ 7 10s. to £.9 per ton.",31
79,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Where ?  with me a letter in which the writer states that he purchased chaff in January last at £ 7 10s. per ton, and that it cost him £ 1 6 10s. to £ 1 8 per ton last month.",31
80,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In January last the price of chaff in South Australia was £ 8 per ton, and to that price must be added the cost of removing it to New South Wales.  could be purchased in New South Wales in January last at £ 8 to £ 9 per ton, and this mail contractor informs me in his letter that he was able to get it at £ 7 10s. per ton, whilst last month he was obliged to pay £ 1 6 10s. to £ 1 8 per ton. All these facts indicate that the statement that the mail contractors in January last were in a position to know whether their tender would be payable or not was entirely erroneous, and one the Minister should not have sanctioned.",31
81,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Specia l relief ought to be given for an extraordinary drought year; otherwise tenders will all be double what they have been previously.  drought in New South Wales extended over a period of three years, and the honourable member must be well aware that many mail contractors have been absolutely ruined.",31
82,Mr EICHABD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That must be the case.  cannot carry out their contracts. It is useless to wink at this matter. Postmaster-General answered my question yesterday by saying that he acquiesced in the policy set out in this circular, but I am at a loss to know his reason for doing so. My interpretation of his attitude is that he does not really acquiesce in this policy, but that he is unable to do anything in the matter, because the Treasurer will not give him the money he requires.",32
83,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not blaming the Treasurer on this occasion.  the Postmaster-General must accept the whole responsibility, and I hope that he will take an opportunity of making a statement in regard to this matter, which is a very sore point with the mail contractors in the drought areas, not only in New South Wales, but all over the Commonwealth as well.",32
84,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It may be, and it would be a sore point with the Minister if he is not careful of what he is doing.  parently, it is the Treasurer who is responsible.",32
85,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No ; the responsibility lies with the gentleman who was Postmaster-General for four years.  interpretation can I put on the remarks of the right honourable gentleman?,32
86,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Le t me explain. In my young days I set out, as Postmaster-General, to do away with all the sweating on mail routes, and I gave the old contractors advantages of one kind or another that I thought were fair. But immediately I began to do so, every individual contractor or would be contractor who had sent in a tender got his member of Parliament to ask what favouritism was being displayed, and declared that if he bad known these favours were to be conferred' he would have been prepared to submit, a lower tender. Of course, I had immediately to drop all my altruistic notions, arid fall back on public tendering. That is what I mean.  Treasurer's explanation is all very fine, but it does not touch this matter at all. The right honourable gentleman was referring to ordinary times. I was speaking about a drought allowance. This is a matter which must be considered on The its merits. If"" there had been no drought there would have been no request for a revision of tenders. It is because there has been an extraordinary drought, which has affected not only New South Wales, but the whole Commonwealth, that tenders have been affected, and the contractors are askin? for some allowance.",32
87,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When the drought threatened the tenderer added to his price accordingly, but if another man did not do so, relying on action in Parliament in order to get equal, where are we?  be the case, why, was an allowance made last year on account of the drought? There was no cavilling at the allowance last year. It was considered just and equitable. It ought to be equally just and equitable to make an allowance this year.",32
88,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The drought was in existence in January of this year, when they entered into these contracts.  are getting the matter boiled down. I am pleased to hear the Minister make such a statement. It is just this one point I wish to see threshed out. The Department says that, in January of this year, the contractor ought to have known whether his tender was likely to pay him; whereas I contend that it was impossible for him to know it. As a matter of fact, the drought did not end in January, bub continued for six months afterwards. The worse part came after January, and last month the price of fodder was twice what it was at the beginning of the year.",32
89,Mr LISTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Was not the tenderer influenced by the drought of the previous three years when submitting his price for the coming year ?,32
90,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hear , hear !  have been influenced by the drought of the past, but how was he to know that it was likely to continue for another six months 1 He might have believed that it would be over in the following month, and tendered accordingly. I am disapsupport ' pointed with the decision of the master-General to acquiesce in the contents of the circular issued by the Departlock, ment to the mail contractors. His attimaking tude will be regretted not only by those contractors, but also the persons who ceive the mails through the services of these men and know the hardships they suffer, and who, in many cases, are sidizing the contractors.",32
91,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is the honorMonaro able member speaking of new contracts or old ones?  marks refer to new and bid contracts. Although a contract might date from 1st January this year, the tender might have bers been submitted some months previously, but under the decision . of the DepartThat ment, as expressed in the circular I mentioned, the people submitting tenders in August last can get no relief.",33

93,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The whole syttem of tenmasters-General dering goes by the board.  whole system is influenced by matters with over which these men have no control.,33
94,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is not point.  Subsequent to the 1st of January, there was a six months' drought, which these men could not foresee.  had fallen after the contracts were made?  event I presume the honourable gentleman would have required the mail contractors to carry out their contracts lower rates. In this case, as in every rule. other, the Department wins at the expense of the men. I would remind the Minister for Home and Territories (M Poynton) that this is a serious matter, allowance officers. not only to hundreds of mail contractors, but to many of the people who are served by them. But for the' subsidies paid by people who are served by these men, it would be impossible for many of them ho carry on. their contracts. The intimated. attitude that has been taken up by the Department is entirely wrong, and canregard not be too strongly condemned. If there is a majority in this House prepared to such an iniquity, then it is a Postreflection on the whole Parliament. The administration of the Department, stock, and barrel, is wrong. In that statement. I am only repeating what the present Postmaster-General resaid when he was not in office. On 15th July, 1915, as reported in Hansard, V o l . LXXVII . , page 4953, the honourable gentlesubman, who was then a private member, followed the honourable member for Eden(Mr Austin Chapman), who had made a very telling speech in regard to the Postal Department. He saidAfter hearing the Honourable member for Eden-Monaro and also various Postmasters General, I can only wish that honourable memwould hold the same opinion in office that they do when in Opposition. was his view as a private member, have I desire now to point out the hardships suffered by allowance officers. Everything relating to allowance post-offices in country districts is on a wrong basis. beThe present Postmaster-General, in the man speech from. which I have just quoted, 1 went on to sayOver and over again I have heard Postsay that the allowances are not intended and do not profess to be living At the same, time. I cordially agree the denunciations of the reductions that are made from time to time. Some of them are exceedingly petty. I know of one case the where, because the business had fallen off as compared with that of the preceding year, the allowance of £5 a year was reduced by £1. It a pettifogging thing for a great Commonwealth to insist upon a reduction of £1 per annum' in any individual's allowance, and I think that all these matters might very well be looked into so that some general rule might fodder be adopted upon the subject.",33
95,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The present Postmaster-General has put a stop to such reductions.  at waiting for him to adopt some general,33

99,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And I like to compare it with the past.  have to take things as we find them. The honourable gentleman, in speaking of "" your own Government,"" refers, I presume, to a former Labour Government ?",34
100,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Whic h he supported.  have here a eulogy of the Labour Government by the present Postmaster-General. Mr ""WISE - That was in regard to country telephones.  The honourable gentleman said, in the course of the speech to which I have already referredThe second Pisher Government reduced that guarantee The guarantee required of applicants for telephone lines in country districts that they would provide the whole of any deficiencyto one of 50-per cent, of the deficiency, which was a very great oonsideratonj and I have never failed to give credit to this Government for having made that reduction.",34
101,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It s own supporters would not even give it credit for that.  the honourable gentleman just now condemned that Government's administration of the Postal Department.,34
102,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In respect of allowance post-offices.  My experience' as the representative of a country electorate is typical of that of all representatives of rural districts. There is in my constituency a district the residents of which nearly two years ago supplied the poles for a telephone line, put up the necessary money, and asked for the work to be carried out. The Department, however, has not yet taken action. It tells these people that there is a shortage of material. The Department is shirking its responsibility.",34
103,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What is the district?  ferring to a request for a line from Cootamundra to a district some miles distant, the name of which I have already supplied to . the honourable gentleman. These people have fulfilled their obligations, and yet no consideration is extended to them. I do not wish to labour this question. I shall be content to quote the view expressed by the honourable gentleman when he was a private member. I have never believed that the Postal Department should be a concern run for making profits. It - We is a public u t i l it y, and ought to be conducted in the interests of the people. Those who have to battle in the back country districts are surely entitled to some consideration. When they ask for a telephone line, why should they be required to guarantee to such an unreasonable extent to make good any deficiency on its working? Surely they are entitled to reasonable facilities. If people were not prepared to go into the back country the Commonwealth would never progress. Dealing with this particular question, the present Postmaster-General said in this House on 15th July, 19151 I desire that it shall be clearly understood that, in my opinion, the Postal Department is not a Department that ought to be run for the purpose of being made to pay.",34
104,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is my view today.  when are we to have an announcement that applicants for country telephone lines will not be required to make good any deficiency, as under present conditions?",34
105,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I announced months ago that we had decided to ask them to pay only 25 per cent, of any deficiency.  orable gentleman, in this speech, went on to say- \ The Department was established for the purpose of furthering the social and commercial intercourse of the people, and the places where the services of the Post Office are mostly required, and are of most .valae to the individual, are in those country districts where the Post Office does not pay, and where it probably will not pay for very many years. The large surpluses made in the cities could not be better expended than in giving better postal communication to country districts, and I hope that we shall soon reach the time when, wherever there is a reasonable settlement, the people tliere will not only have a decent mail service, but decent telephonic communication as well, without their being called upon to contribute anything by way of a guarantee. That was the honourable gentleman's view when he was a private member of the House. Let it be clearly understood that I am not dealing with the honourable gentleman from a personal stand-point. I believe that he is more sympathetic towards the requirements of country districts than is any other member of the Ministry.",34
106,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He is probably hampered by other members of the Cabinet.  already said that I believe there are shackles placed upon him ; I hope he will get r i d of them. I shall not conclude my speech after the manner of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), who this afternoon started off witli a full head of steam against the Government, and in the end simply fired blank cartridge at them. When he was shown by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) how he could take effective action, he apparently had no desire to hurt the Government; but I do not content myself with adopting such an attitude. I now wish to refer to a postal matter which affects all the country from Sydney southwards to Albury, and I do so because it is a concrete example of the hardships inflicted on country residents. Country mails close in Sydney at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and a letter posted at, say, five minutes to 5 o'clock on the Tuesday is delivered at, for example, Wagga, next morning; but if a letter be posted at five minutes past that hour, it is not delivered at the latter place until the following Thursday.",35
107,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I should like to hear the honourable member if he were representing the postal employees in Sydney !  bhat the blame is put on to the unions, but I am going to suggest a remedy for the anomaly which involves no union trouble at all. A fast mail train leaves Sydney at five minutes past 10 o'clock at night, but it is not utilized for carrying the mails, which are sent on by a slow newspaper and goods train at five minutes past 2 o'clock in the morning.",35
108,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do you know reason for that? It is in order to give the men an hour off.,35
109,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is the fact.  that the responsibility is put on to the shoulders of the men, but no private company in any part of the world would conduct its business on such lines. The goods train in the morning takes about twelve hours longer to do the journey than does the fast mail train. The Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) tells us that this delay is caused in order to give the men an hour off-that if they were kept on duty u n t i l 7.30 p.m. they would kick up a row. But the present arrangement does an in j u r y to thousands of people, who have to wait twenty-four hours longer for their mails; and if the staff at the present time would raise any complaint about being kept at work, and allowed full overtime rates, could the staff not be increased?",35
110,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What about economy ?  economy to cause injury to thousands of people. I have already quoted the Postmaster-General himself, when speaking as a private member, as an effective answer to any plea of economy.",35
111,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who is responsible for the present arrangement - the Treasurer ?,35
112,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Treasurer has never refused the Post Oflice any money.,35

115,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Who is quite prepared to take it !  to give an opportunity to honourable members who feel strongly on this matter to express their opinion and show their disapproval of the postal maladministration, I move That after the word ""That,"" the following words be inserted:-""the Postmaster-General be requested to provide increased postal and telephonic facilities for country districts, and to grant a drought allowance to mail contractors for the year 1920.""",35
116,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Calare) [ 4 . 3 0 ] - I the have much pleasure in seconding the amendment, and the eloquent expressive speech of the honourable member who moved it does not leave much to be said. I have a very vivid recollection of a deputation from this side of the House which waited on the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) some time ago, in connection with the payment of a drought allowance to country mail contractors in New South Wales. The Postmaster-General then stated that he, or the Department, had decided to pay a drought allowance to those mail contractors in the droughtstricken areas whose contracts commenced prior to 1st January this year. This decision had been arrived at after three or four months' consideration, and after the Department had received scores of letters from, members of the House-in fact, after the Department had been flogged into action by the members of this side. The Postmaster-General informed the deputation that an allowance having been decided upon, he would see that payment was expeditiously made; but, so far as I have been able to ascertain from the mail contractors in my electorate, not one, after two months have gone over, has received any drought allowance this year. The Postmaster-General decided that the cases of mail contractors whose contracts started from the 1st January. would be considered on their merits, adding that, if any contractor put in a contract, say, five or six months before the end of the year, he probably would not be in a position to know what the conditions were likely to be at the beginning of this year and onwards, and, no doubt, an allowance would be granted. But, as a result of letters sent to me, I find no instance in which any consideration has been given to men whose contracts started at the beginning of the year, irrespective of what time they put in their tenders. Here is the reply from Mr Young, Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney, dated 20th August, this yearW it h reference to the communication presented by you from Mr W . Carbary, mail tractor, G/oolma, asking for further assistance owing to the cost of fodder, I have to intimate that, as lie must have. been in a position know whether or not the price at which hetendered for the service from 1st January, 1920, would pay, lie is not entitled to drought allowance. His request cannot, tlierethe fore, be acceded to. When this man put in his tender he could buy chaff at less than £10 a ton, whereas, today, although the drought has been broken in the district for about two months, he has to pay over £20. It only reasonable to assume that his tender was put in at the least a couple of months before the end of the year, but even supmatter. posing it was delivered in the last week of December, it was then reasonable to assume that chaff would not go higher in price, or that the drought would soon be broken. I am of opinion that the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney has liberately set his mind against granting auy allowance where contracts commenced from the beginning of this year, although there is no doubt that in the case to which I have referred, and all similar cases, an allowance should be granted. There is another section of mail contractors who happen to live in parts of the State which have not suffered from drought, but where they have to pay an additional price for chaff, owing to the fact that practically all the rest of the State was suffering. It is impossible to run mails with grass-fed horses; they must have chaff and grain; and even if it should happen that there is an ample supply of grass to keep ordinary stock alive, it does not follow that there is sufficient suitable fodder for mail purposes. As the result of the drought which prevails over practically the whole of the remaining portion of the' State, these men are penalized, also. The - Postmaster-General, I repeat, promised to give the mail contractors consideration, but, so far as I have ascertained, none has yet been shown to them. The Department should realise its debt, and that of the settlers, to the mail contractors. In a great many instances, persons living in outlying parts are subsidizing them to enable (.hem to keep going, notwithstanding that they themselves have been so hard hit. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see that his .Deputy for New South Wales gives mote consideration to the request made to him. I might say that I hope that the conhonorable gentleman will run his own Department. The Treasurer stated today, as on half-a-dozen other occasions, that he has to never yet refused the Postmaster-General's Department money required by the head of any that Department. I hope, therefore, that Postmaster-General will see that an adequate allowance is paid in every instance, and that the payments are expedited. The lack of adequate telephone communication is a crying grievance in every is part of Australia, and I hope that the Department will give earnest consideration to the needs of the people in this If any section of the community deserves more consideration than another in the supplying of telephones, it is that section which lives' in the inland districts of Australia, where the conditions of life are far from pleasant. More brightness, dehappiness, and contentment might be given to these people if the Department would provide them with adequate postal and telephone communication. On the eve of an election, some persons term the men and women of the country the backbone of Australia, but, after the election, they leave these people in isolation and loneliness, without adequate means of communication. I hope f i at the Department will get to work immediately, and see that the grievances to which I have called attention are rectified ",35
117,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Illawarra) [4.39] - I am sorry that the amendment has been moved, because it prevents us from discussing a number of matters affected by the administration of Ministers other than the Postmaster-General.",37
118,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No ; we can have a division now.,37
119,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There can be a division when the amendment has 1 been discussed, but the discussion of it may not conclude until the small hours of the morning. The action taken is a selfish one, and, if for no otber reason, I shall vote against the amendment. The affairs of the Postmaster-General's Department are admittedly in a deplorable state. Some of the defects are due to the war, and, as I and many other members have said, Australia will not enjoy the services that she should have until, the funds at the disposal of the Postmaster General have been enormously increased. Another thing needed is the abolition of the centralized administration of Melbourne. Could I control the actions of the Postmaster-General, I would insist on his spending half his time in States other than Victoria. I have before me some startling figures indicating the advantages that Victoria derives through Melbourne being the temporaryseat of government. These figures were given in another place in reply to a question, and have to do with the applications for the instalment of telephones that are awaiting attention. Let me quote the figures for two States only. This is the state of affairs disclosedKew South WalesSydney ... 517 Suburban ... ... 3,770 Country districts ... ... Totals ... 5,166 VictoriaMelbourne ... Suburban ... 1,104 Country districts ... Totals ... 2,191 So that in Victoria the number of applications awaiting attention is less than half the number in New South Wales. Melbourne is not so large, nor so important, a city as Sydney, but the difference in size does not justify the facts to which I have just drawn attention.",37
120,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Nothin g can justify the provinciality of your observations.,37
121,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The evidence of provinciality is in the figures themselves. The honourable member is one of those who is trying to prevent New South Wales from having the Federal compact carried out, and the Seat of Government removed to .the Federal City, so that this Parliament may not continue to be shackled by Victorian influences. The return from which I have quoted demands the serious attention of all members representing New South Wales constituencies. Excuses founded on the war, the shortage of material, droughts, and the like, do not avail to explain the facte. The figures show that when material is available it is used in Victoria, and that New South Wales applications do not receive the same treatment as applications made in this much-favoured State. The position of affairs would be bad enough if the two States contributed equally to the revenue of the Post Office; but between 40 and 50 per cent, of the money that is expended is contributed by New South Wales, and considerably more than 50 per cent, of the available money must be spent in Victoria. A trip through Queensland would open the eyes of the Postmaster-General to the real difficulties of Australia. Victoria is a small State, which one could almost walk across in a couple of days, but the Department has to provide means of communication for States as big as Queensland, where the honourable member for Grampians has his far-flung domains; and I am surprised that, deriving so much from that State, he should take up the cudgels in defence of the parochial administration which favours Victoria.",37
122,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have not said a word 879 against any State in Australia.,37
123,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In defending administration that discriminates against New South Wales and in favour 347 of Victoria, in the way I have shown, the honourable member is practically con740 demning the State of Queensland.",37
124,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am not defending the Postal administration; I condemn r.t.,37
125,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The same titled to expect. sort ot thing as I am complaining of pens in the administration of most of Departments. When the lists of new pointments are published, it is Melbourne nearly every time that benefits. When Commissions are issued, there are two Melbourne Commissioners to every Comthese missioner from another State. The Go the vernment of this country is, in short, conducted from Melbourne, and everyso thing is seen through Melbourne eyes. should not object to that so much were this capital the head of a big State, which Australian couddtionsgenerallywere represented.

I hope that he will take an opportime. tunity to visit and live in some of the other States, and to administer his partment there, so that he may learn something of the problems which have be solved, and the condition of the and thus be able fo take a broader larger view.",38
126,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He knows what to do, but he requires more money.",38
127,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Treathe surer has told deputations, arid has said in this House, that he has not withheld monev from the Postmaster-General's Department. I admit that the errors the past have been such that no master-General, no matter what his or his knowledge might be, could bring the Department to a state of efficiency within a year or two. I am glad to from correspondence that I have had from the present occupant of the office, that he sees eye to eye with me on matter: the need for doing the utmost to bring about the use of material which can be manufactured or procured i tralia. I doubt, however, that he is ceiving from some of his officials the port in this matter which he is Much material is hapused which, it seems to me, could easily the be obtained in this country, especially apif sufficient inducement were offered. If the Postmaster-General wishes, as I believe he does, to make his administration effective, he must not only say that things should be done, b'ut see that officers intrusted with the doing of them do their duty. We ought not to be much dependent upon foreign countries I for a great deal of the material used in the Postal Department, and we would not in be if an advanced policy were pursued. The cheapest market is not the best for of our Departments. ' Everu if we had to pay a good deal more for them it prowould be infinitely better if we could us; obtain in Australia many of the requirements for the Departments, rather than the that 5,000 people in one State should be unable to get telephonic communication these and be deprived of those conveniences so which, in a modern community, people concerned. I have a right to expect. The state of some of the post-offices is appalling. In my own electorate there is a post-office in the centre of 12,000 to or 15,000 people where the accommodation for the public will allow only about persons - to be present at the one At times the street traffic is blocked by people waiting their turn to enter the Depost-office. About £400 is required to improve the accommodation, yet year after to year goes by without the conditions being people, altered from what they were when the and building was erected twenty-five years' ago. That centre would be called in some States a city, yet the post-office accommodation is only equal to that in some ef small country towns. When the exPostmaster-General (Mr Webster) visited the place he decided immediately that the accommodation must be extended; two of years have gone by and njothing has been Postdone. The excuse at that time was that gifts the Treasurer wpuld not find the money, but today that excuse is not valid, because the Treasurer will find the money. know Urgent works of this character should be put in hand at the earliest possible moment. The whole administration of the one Postal Department calls for a thorough investigation at all centres of administration, and I plead for a policy of giving n Auswider power to the Deputy PostmastersreGeneral. This centralizing of every petty supdetail in Melbourne should give place to ena policy by which the people who are nearest to the job, and know most about it, should have the right to decide when a work is necessary in the interests of the Department. As to the subsidy for telephone services, I think the present Postmaster-General is deserving of thanks for what he has done. I was surprised to hear some of the criticisms of him today upon that score, because it must be admitted that one of the first things he did on assuming office was to endeavour to make easier the conditions of people living in the remote districts where the telephone services were unprofitable. When one criticises a Department it is only fair to try to look at it from the point of view of the man in charge. Whilst everybody will endorse the proposition that the people who go into the remoter parts of the country to develop the land and produce those things which are necessary to our financial stability, should be considered, little reflection is needed to convince one that there must be some discrimination as to the extent to which these benefits can be given is the different ties. We cannot say that because one man chooses to go 500 miles away from the bigger country centres the Commonwealth must immediately - spend £500 cr £1,000 in giving him the same facilities as he would have had had he settled nearer a town. There must be some line of demarcation between the things that can be done and those that ought to be done. But ,when all this is admitted, the policy introduced into the Department a few years ago of attempting to make the post-office a commercial concern was entirely detrimental to the settlement of the country. If we are to ask people to go into the remoter districts we must provide them with facilities, and the proper course is to charge more for the facilities given in populous centres, and apply the profits therefrom to the extension of telephonic and telegraphic services in the districts further out. That is the policy upon which the Post Office should be operated, and if there still remained a claim upon the general revenue for postal facilities, Parliament should be anxious to see that the Postmaster-General had . sufficient money to enable him to carry the benefits of civilization to the remoter districts.",38
128,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Grampians) [4.56] - I rise to support the amendment in favour of giving increased mail and telephonic facilities in country districts and the granting of greater concessions to mail contractors, who have been placed in a most unfortunate position owing to their contracts having covered a period of severe drought, which could not 'have been anticipated by them when the contracts were made. First of all, I desire to express my regret that' an entirely foreign matter has been imported into the discussion in the shape of an unprovoked and unjustifiable attack upon the State of Victoria and its people. The professed justification for this attack is some statistics which show that there are more applications for telephones which have not been supplied in New South Wales than there are in Victoria. The explanation of this state of affairs given by the honourable member ior Illawarra (Mr. Hector Lamond) is, apparently, partly . that the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) is a Victorian, and also that practically everything in the 'Central Department of the Post Oflice is seen solely through Victorian eyes, and that there is no one locali- to take the larger and broader vision which the honourable member for Hia-. warra always has taken, andj no doubt, always will take. Although I have not been a member of the House as long as has the honourable member, I have some recollection of past Postmasters-General, and it will be interesting to refresh the memories of honourable members as to the States from which these Ministers came. Of course, it is obvious that a large number of the telephone applications which have not been met were overdue before the present Postmaster-General assumed office. It will be remembered that up till December last the PostmasteTGeneral, an exceedingly able and efficient Minister, was Mr Webster, the then member for Gwydir, in New South Wales, and practically the whole of these overdue applications accumulated while he held office. It therefore seems unreasonable to blame the present Victorian Postmaster-General for the present overdue accumulations. And as regard the past, I find from the Tear-Book that the Postmaster-General in the first Federal Administration was the late'Lord Forrest, of Western Australia, who was succeeded by the Hon. J. G. Drake, who came from Queensland, and later, Sir Philip Fysh, who was a Tasmanian representative. Therefore, at the commencement of Eederation, at any rate, the control of the Postal Department was in the hands of men from the more distant States. They were men of wide vision and mighty capacity, who were able to handle these Australian and almost Imperial problems in a way which the honourable memibar for Illawarra apparently thinks that no Victorian could do. In Mr Deakin's first Administration the Postmaster-General was again Sir Philip Eysh. When Mr Watson formed his first Ministry the Honourable Hugh Maihon, from Western Australia, took control of the Postal Department. He was not one of those narrow-minded and short-visioned Victorians. In the fourth Eederal Administration the Postmaster General was the Honourable Sydney Smith, who came from the State of New South Wales. The next Postmaster-General, not' least honoured of them all, was the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin,Chapman)-agai n a representative of the Mother State.",39
129,Sir GRANVILLE EYRIE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member does not infer that we are still suffering from his administration.,40
130,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , the Commonwealth has survived. The Postmaster General in the first Fisher Administration was the Honourable Josiah Thomas, yet again a representative of the great State of New South Wales. I regret that that gentleman is no longer a member of this Chamber, but he graces the proceedings in another place. In the next Administration the Postmaster-General was a Victorian, Sir John Quick; I do not know whether it will be alleged that this was the reason why that Ministry was so short-lived.",40
131,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He was a very good Postmaster-iGeneral.,40
132,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He was one of the ablest men who ever graced this Chamber, and was one of the founders of the Constitution.",40
133,Mr EYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,To what is the honourable member leading up?,40
134,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The remarks of the honourable member for Illawarra seem to imply that much of the trouble that befalls the administration of the Post Office and other Departments of the Commonwealth is due to the fact that certain gentlemen representing and residing in Victoria are in office.,40
135,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And he accused the honourable member of having "" Canberraitis,"" and of having thrown stones at Queensland at the dictation of the Age.",40
136,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If I replied to all the accusations made by some honourable members, who are obsessed absolutely by the word "" Canberra,"" there would be no time left for me between now and 10 o'clock to-night in which to say anything in regard to other matters.",40
137,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member's statement that he would not reply to certain interjections from honourable members whose brains had been eaten into by suggestions of Canberra reflects very seriously on certain honourable members who represent New South Wales constituencies, and wish to have a solemn compact honoured. It is an affront for a member of a provincial and parochial State like Victoria to refer in such a manner to those who represent New South Wales constituencies, and are quite within their rights in claiming that a solemn compact should be honoured.",40
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY, That is no point of order.,40
139,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I ask that the statement be withdrawn.,40
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member made use of the words attributed to him, I ask him to withdraw them.",40
141,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have much pleasure in withdrawing any reference to Canberra if it gives offence to others. If the subject had not been mentioned by way of interjection I would not have raised it. The next Administration I quote is that of my right honourable peerless, priceless, friend, Sir Joseph Cook. In his Ministry, it is true, the Postmaster-General was the Honourable Agar Wynne, who was a Victorian, but, at any rate, the Prime Minister represented a New South Wales constituency. In the Third Fisher Administration the Postmaster-General was the Honourable William Guthrie Spence, a splendid Minister, whose absence is a great loss to this House. He represented a New South Wales constituency. The next Government was the First Hughes Administration, and the Postmaster General .in that Ministry was the Honourable William Webster, again a representative of a New South Wales constituency.",40
142,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What happened to him? .,41
143,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"To my deep regret and that of an immense number of people of Australia, he is no longer in this House, but he was a great statesman, a great Postmaster-General, and a distinguished member of this House. was also Postmaster-General in the Second Hughes Administration, and in the Australian National War Government. Of course, the present Postmaster-General is a Victorian, as we all know, but I have shown conclusively that there is not the remotest justification for the narrow minded charge, the most absurdly ridiculous and trumped-up implication that the destinies of the Post Office have suffered in the past or are suffering at present by being placed in the hands of Postmasters-General representing Victorian constituencies. Now, having shown that the omissions of the Department are not in the remotest degree due to the fact that its administration has been in the hands of honourable members representing any particular State, I approach the question raised by the honourable member for Hume, that of giving relief - to mail contractors who took up their contracts as from 1st January of this year. said in defence of the attitude of the Department that when the contracts were entered upon, the tenderers knew that the drought was in progress, and no doubt took into consideration the cost of feedinc their horses. I maintain, however, that it was impossible for any one working stock in the interior of Australia on 1st January last to take a contract based on the existing cost of fodder in the belief that, if the drought continued, he could carry it on profitably, and I doubt very much whether a contractor would make any profit on a contract for five years to cover the losses sustained during the last six months. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) knows well that the people living in the interior of Australia are a sanguine, optimistic race, and that they would not have taken on the confracts unless they believed that the drought would break up almost immediately, or that they would be able to continue to buy fodder at the price ruling in January when their tenders were submitted; but we did not get the summer rains we expected, and the price.of fodder, instead of decreasing, went up bo a figure never previously known in the history of Australia. Lucerne hay fetched as much as. £20 a ton.",41
144,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Price s doubled.,41
145,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , they increased to He at least double what they were at the beginning of the year.",41
146,Mr BELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That could not have been the case.,41
147,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It may not have been the case in Tasmania.,41
148,Mr BELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Tasmanian prices are ruled by the Sydney market quotations.,41
149,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As a general rule, they may be, but it was not the case during this year because of the grave difficulty in regard to shipping.",41
150,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Mai l contractors are paying £20 per ton for chaff in my electorate.,41
151,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , and they are - paying the same price in many other parts. A few months ago I met two farmers returning from South Australia to the Darling Downs district in Queensland. The people there were paying £17 or £18 a ton for lucerne hay, and it was almost unprocurable; but hearing that fodder was cheaper in South Australia, It is they had sent these two gentlemen to that State to make purchases on their behalf. When the delegation got to Adelaide they found that they could buy chaff at a much lower price than was ruling in Queensland, but they found also that it was absolutely impossible for them to get freight to take it to their State. The position may have been the same in Tasmania. Fodder might have been cheap and abundant in that State, but there was not sumcient freight available to enable it to be shipped to the mainland, where it was so badly needed to keep stock alive. Some bf my honourable friends speak as if I took a provincial view of these matters. I probably know more of every State in the Gommonwealth, with the exception of Western Australia, than does any other honourable member.  member is deeply lacking experience of a great State.",41
152,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I may be deeply lacking experience of a great State which will ever be associated with the name of a great statesman, the late Lord Porrest; but I hope to have anopportunity to acquire that experience. The result of the difficulties in the transit of fodder from one State to another, and the extreme drought in northern New South Wales and Queensland, was that it was absolutely impossible for mail contractors to foresee on 1st January last the price to which hay would soar during the remaining half of ""Che financial year.",42
153,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Can the honourable member tell us roughly what is the difnected ference in price ?,42
154,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Not from memory; but for quite a considerable period in northern New South Wales and Queensland, lucerne hay was selling at £ 2 0 a ton.",42
155,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,As against £ 1 3 or £ 1 4 per ton at the beginning of the year.,42
156,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes ; that was a ruinous rise. No man would have taken of extreme drought. up a mail contract had he thought that he would have to feed his horses throughtime out the year on fodder costing even £ 1 4 termination ? per ton. When, instead of an anticipated reduction in the price of hay, maize, oats, they were compelled to pay pracany tially double rates, they were brought face to face with a very real grievance.",42
157,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I can conceive of fodder being dearer, but in some parts there might be plenty of grass for horses.",42
158,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,My right honourable friend's point is a very good one.,42
159,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In the days, many mai l contractors never dreamt of buying fodder for their horses. Their horses were all grass-fed.",42
160,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not suppose that there is any district in Australia where the mail contractots did not have to feed their horses during the first six months of the year.

164,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That was my impression.,42

166,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so. I remind the Treasurer that if the seasons were good for the next two and a half years, the contractors might be able to recoup some of their losses, but who has ever known of consecutive good seasons over a long period? I have been closely conwith the pastoral industry for something like for ty years, and I cannot remember anything of the kind^",42
167,Mr BELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then the contractors must also have known that it was unreasonable to expect good seasons for two and a half years.,42

I do not know whether honourable member has ever been reminded of the state of his banking account, but I am quite sure that many mail contractors during the last six months have had very serious reminders from their bankers. That being so, if any relief is to be granted, it must be-given immediately.",42
171,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable bad old member make the considered statement that he has never known of two and a half consecutive good years in Australia ?,42

175,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My honourable friend the honourable member for Barker (Mr . represents a particularly favoured spot in the neighbourhood of Mount Gambier, which is probably freer from drought than is any other part of the Commonwealth. Valuable though his testimony may be, I must, therefore, put I wish now to deal with the general question involved in the amendment submitted by the honourable member for  I take it, improved telephone and postal facilities for country districts, and also the payment of allowance omcers. As I have no wish to weary honourable members, I do not propose to exhaust all the subjects that have been touched on during this debate; but I would impress upon the House the fact that any money expended on granting improved telephone and postal facilities in country districts, must be a very profitable investment. If it is. not profitable, then there is something ab fault, and action should be taken to remedy it. Residents of country districts, as well as of our cities, are crying out for better telephone facilities, and are quite prepared to pay for them at remunerative rates. The Postmaster-General (Mr. Wise), new as he is to office, is ripe in experience of this subject, as has been evidenced by the quotations made this afternoon from his magnificent speeches. I shall simply conclude by inpressing upon the Postmaster-General in the strongest terms that there is every justification for expending, as an investment outlay, very largely increased sums on telephone services for country districts.",42
176,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member were to address a few words on the same point to the Treasurer, it might be help- ful.",43
177,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Treasurer, like Pilate of old, has alreadv washed his hands of "" this just man,"" the Postmaster-General.",43
178,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member surely does not suggest that the Postmaster-General is to be crucified ?,43
179,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not quite sure whether the process of nailing his fingers to the political cross has not already menced this afternoon, and I therefore shall not add to his tribulations. simply implore him to give the fullest and most sympathetic consideration to the terms of the amendment, which I intend to support.  no desire to ""stone-wall"" this amendment. I want to vote upon it , and, therefore, I shall not enter upon a discussion of the genealogies of past Postmasters-General. Having regard to the important work which the people in the out-back districts of Australia are doing for the nation, I feel that more attention should be given to their postal requirements, and to the provision of other facilities for them. Mr Knibbs, the Government! Statistician, tells us-1917-191 8 - that the Australian primary producers contribute 76 per cent, of the wealth of the Commonwealth, and the secondary industries 24 per cent. In that State, to which an honourable member has just referred as one of '' sin, sand, and sorrow''",43
180,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And ""sore eyes!""  honourable member interjects, of "" sin, sand, sorrow,"" and "" sore eyes,"" from which I come, the primary producers are responsible for 86 per cent, of the wealth of the State, and the secondary industries for 14 per cent.; in other words, throughout the Commonwealth the wealth created by the primary producers is £56 7s. 6d. per head, and in little Western Australia £56 10s. per head. If we go into city factories we find three or four telephones, one in each room, so that there may not be the inconvenience of running from one part to another, whereas those who produce 86 per cent, of the wealth have to drive 20 miles to. a railway station to see whether their goods have arrived; and, on many occasions, only to be disappointed, and faced with a long, wet, and cold drive home, when a telephone would have saved this valuable time. At the same time, a surplus of £500,000 resulted last year from the working of the Postal Department of Australia. That money goes into the general revenue, and is devoted to other purposes than postal extension, although the Department should be conducted solely as a service in the service of the compeople. This is not the way in which real statesmanship should apply the I money; and the present ""cheeseparing"" must cease. I am not saying anything against the present .Postmaster-General (Mr Wise); indeed, conditions have been somewhat liberalized since he assumed office, though they are still cramped. There seems to be no vision of Australia as a great producing country, which requires all the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities that modern ingenuity can devise. We are a producing country, and the first consideration of this Parliament should be the provision of facilities for those people who are the most likely to lift the burden of debt from our shoulders. I suppose I have written 150 applications to the Department for telephones for the homes in the back blocks of Western Australia, and of these about 2 per cent, have been granted. My communications have been answered courteously, and, in explanation of the lack of telephonic communication, it has been explained that there are not sumcient people in the localities concerned. But do the Government desire to have cities in these country places? Are we to wait for a congested population before a modern time-saving invention is applied to enable us to compete with other countries? It would be infinitely better to add another halfpenny to the cost of our postage stamp in order to provide these postal facilities, which undoubtedly would prove reproductive. No longer ought a profit to be made by means of a Department which should be administered solely in the service of the people. - Some mail contractors are placed at such a disadvantage at present that they cannot fulfil their contracts, and they should be given some consideration. Fortunately the land they speak of as one of ""sin, sand, and sorrow"" is so fertile that we have not suffered from drought; indeed, we could supply the droughtstricken eastern States with fodder. I support the amendment, not in the interests of my own State, but because it is right and reasonable that consideration should be given to the conditions under which these mail contractors work, and that the rural postal services should be rendered efficient.",43
181,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Barker) [5.39] The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is an authority on all Australian matters, but when he says that he has never known two and a half years of good seasons in Australia, he makes a statement capable of doing more damage to our financial institutions than any that could be made.",44
182,Mr ROBERT COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do you wish him to tell lies?,44
183,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would not be lies, as the honourable member knows. There' is not the slightest doubt that every derogatory statement of that kind will be cabled to London, and Australia [162] will be again represented as a droughtstricken country, whereas it is one of the finest in the world. As a matter of fact, Australia at the present time is suffering from too much water. In South Australia some £2,500,000 is being spent in drainage work which, when finished, will render the State one of the most fertile in the Commonwealth, if not in the Empire. At a time like this, when we require money, statements such as that made by the honourable member for Grampians ought'not to be allowed to go forth and reach the ears of those who lend money. The Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) has duties of the greatest importance, and I think he is one on whom we can rely to perform them. As pointed out already, all our previous Postmasters-General came from New South Wales, and there is no doubt we had a very good one in the person of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman). Now we have the present Postmaster General, who is alive to the fact that we must have postal facilities, and all he requires to provide them is money. Previous Postmasters-General did very good work indeed; so good, indeed, in my constituency, that, when we get telephonic communication between Mt. Gambier and Adelaide, our system will be about complete. Apparently, whenever it is thought fit to economize, the Postal Department is selected as that in which to begin, though it is the very last place where there should be any lack of expenditure. People must have telephonic and telegraphic communication and general postal facilities in the cheapest form; and until these are provided we cannot blame r>eople for electing to remain in the big cities. Given good roads, schools, good mail services, with telegraphic and telephonic communication, and other conveniences, we should find our young men and others quite willing to settle in the country. It is to that end we should work, instead of wasting so much time in idle talk here. We have been sitting now for three months and have practically done nothing, and, under the present system, I am afraid we should do no more if we were to remain here for three years. If I had my way I would put a stiff time limit to speeches, so that we might get on with the work of the country. We, as a Parliament, ought to meet prepared to work all together in the interest of the country, and not be so continuously fighting one against the other. One great change that might prove effective is the institution of elective Ministries, which would result in our getting some men from the other.side, and so unite the talent and brains of the House. W it h elective Ministries I believe we should be able to pul l together in the interests of Australia and of the Empire.",44
184,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Barrier) [5.45] I am glad to hear the honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston) advocate elective Ministries, with the object of obtaining some ' ' t a l e n t ' ' from this the House; and the protest made by the  Moloney) shows the necessity for the adoption of some such suggestion, or, fail i ng that, turning the Labour minority into a majority . The amendment is very appropriate in view of the many protests and applications sent by mail contractors in the district I represent to the Postal Department. In a number of cases the Department has recognised the disadvantages under which these mail contractors suffer and has afforded some sort of relief. The telephonic and telegraphic facilities in my electorate are by no means what they should be, or what they were. They have been reduced to such an extent that protests are continuously being made, but, from what I hear, from other honourable members, that is characteristic of the postal service throughout the country.",45
185,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The district of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston), who is a Government supporter, is better off.",45
186,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not know why that constituency should happen to be a postal paradise. The Postmaster General (Mr Wise) knows that prior to his taking office I several times emphasized the necessity .for the extension of postal and telephonic facilities in the country; indeed, ab various times during the life of the last Parliament, even Government supporters threatened the Government because of their lack of such facilities. The promises of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ), when Acting Prime Minister, in this regard have not been carried out, for the curtailment of services still goes on, while there has been a reduction i i i the remuneration paid to post-office attendants.",45
187,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where the business falls off.,45
188,Mr CONSIDIN E,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Business can easily f all off if , as in my own electorate, between Wentworth and Broken Hill , a stretch of country of about 55 miles, is left with no facilities for the carriage of correspondence. Prom time to time, members representing country constituencies are informed by the Postmaster General's Department that, unless the residents within a certain area are prepared to subsidize the existing postal facilities, these will be cut off or reduced, side of because the revenue from them is not sufficient to carry them on. Thus country residents are asked to pay out of their own pockets for conveniences that are part of the ordinary requirements of civilization. There is no sense in thus penalizing those who earn their living in the back-blocks. Such action discourages them from remaining there, and others from going there. As I have pointed out in other speeches, the Department took upon itself to reduce postal services at a time when, above all others, the people were interested in obtaining news speedily, that is, during the war, when most radical alterations were made. While on my feet, I wish to draw attention to the fact that information respecting weather conditions is not posted on the postal premises at Broken H i U . That city is the centre of a fairly big pastoral district, West Darling, which contains quite a large number of graziers and others engaged in pastoral pursuits. These persons are unable to obtain at the Broken Hill post-office information regarding weather variations, which have a profound effect on their industry, because they govern operations like the shifting of stock. In a letter, a copy of which has been sent to the Department, a correspondent saysFor many years past when rain does fall in this dry area, the fact bas been made known to the pastoralists, the stock agents, and the public at the local telegraph office. The registrations at the telegraph and telephone stations have been freely issued. These records have been of important value and equal interest to all concerned in the pastoral industry in the far west. They have facilitated business, and have helped to assist pastoralists to move stock from place to place to meet the changes of weather. These movings were, and are, not of individual importance only, but concern the whole of the West Darling pastoral industry, a vital factor in not only the State's, but Australia's economic welfare. Wileannia and Menindie are enabled to gather and issue these so important rain figures; why not Broken Hill, the centre of the district ? The writer points out that the posting of the information to which he refers would not cost much labour, and would greatly benefit those interested in pastoral pursuits. In Sydney and in Melbourne, shipping and other intelligence is posted at the General Post Office. labourers and others interested in shipping can thus study the movements of vessels. Why should not a similar convenience be given to the pastoralists of West Darling by providing them with in 4 formation respecting rainfall and weather changes? It would not cause much expense to do this.",45
189,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That information posted in many places, the service now costing over £50,000 a year.",46
190,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is posted i Wileannia and Menindie.,46
191,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Hav e they given .reason why it is not posted at Broken Hill?,46
192,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; my corresponbring dent asks that the practice may be sumed. I gather that the information being was posted, and that the practice of postthe ing it has been discontinued.",46
193,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It should be posted at a place like Broken Hill . ' Mr Considine - The Treasurer and the Postmaster-General will readily understand that Broken Hill is a large centre where it is most important that this in formation should be made public. I do not know whether other constitution to reply to his statements. encies have suffered as much as mine from the cutting down of mail services and the withholding of telephone facilities. Postmaster-General is in the best position to know what is taking place, but if other constituencies have suffered as much as the Barrier, the country people of Ausgetting tralia are getting a very rough deal the Commonwealth Governmenb. It is about time that we ceased to treat the Postal Department as a business concern. I have always claimed that postal and telegraphic facilities are the right citizens, and that the granting should not be on a revenue-producing basis.",46
194,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is not to say that the Department should not be conintentions. ducted as a business department, for that. [162]- 2",46
195,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not say that it should not be conducted with business method; but there are businesses and businesses. The Treasurer knows that sometimes businesses are conducted not with a view to making a profit, but to support other businesses which are producing revenue. If you study the good of the community, and desire to keep Wharf people in the back country by making life worth living there, the least you will do is to grant the minimum facilities of communication required by a civilized community. In t i e city, postal, telegraph, and telephone conveniences are always at hand. If revenue must be considered, let the burden of providing it be placed on the shoulders of the townsis people, who are not under the same disabilities as country residents. It is not fair that the people in the country should n be penalized as they are being penalized. It should be laid down as a guiding prina ciple for all Postmasters-General that services should not be cut out, or reduced, as they have been in the past, in order to the expenditure of the Department rewithin its income; the comfort and wellof the people, especially of those in country, should be the first consideration .of every Administration.",46

197,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This is not "" the following Wednesday,"" and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro did not carry out his I had no notice of the attack all which has been made on the Department bhis afternoon. I do not consider that the Department of the Postmaster-General is to be regarded as an ordinary commercial undertaking. Not long after I assumed office I - was waited upon by a large deputation of members representing country constituencies and of honourable senators, to which I quoted the remarks made by Mr Deakin, when Prime Minuter in 1908, in reply to an attack made on the Post Office. I heard his speech, and it expressed my own views on the subject of Post Office management and the reasons which should govern its administration. Mr Deakin said in effect that the Post established to produce a money return for the Government as an ordinary revenueearning Department; that its object was to promote social and commercial intercourse among the people. Prom that it naturally followed that country districts would be given services quite disproportionate to the amount of revenue they contributed. I myself have given credit both here and in reply to deputations, to Ministers and Governments that have made concessions to country districts. I have said that it was the first Pisher Government that made the original concession regarding country trun k telephone lines. Previously the people of a district had to guarantee a certain revenue from such 1 a line, and to u,p the whole of any deficiency between the required and the actual receipts. That Government at first undertook to pay 25 per cent, of that deficiency, the people in the country to contribute on the 75 per cent, basis. Just prior to the 1910 election, the Government reduced the country people's contribution to 50 per cent., which remained u n t i l this year, when, in order to carry out the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) at the last general election, that every possible facility would be extended to country districts, special concessions weTe made. There is no excuse for any honourable member saying that he did not know of them, because every honourable member was furnished with a copy of the concessions that have been granted in regard to both mail and telephone services.  adequate.",46
198,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unles s we are prepared to render every service for nothing, I do not think they can be regarded as in adequate. All we ask now is a contribution of 25 per cent, of the difference between the required revenue and the estimated revenue.",47

202,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But that is what the Department does in crowded centres.,47
203,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No . I tell the House, as I repeately tell my own constituents, that the distances throughout Australia are not as small as those in Victoria. Distance does not trouble us much in this State. If we had to deal with only Victorian distances, we would not have much trouble in making the country lines; but we cannot grant fifty or sixty people in a Victorian district telephone communication, and deny it to 200 or 300 people in remote districts of the larger States like Queensland and Western Australia, where the erection of 200 or 300 miles of line may be involved. We can only have make one policy for the whole of Australia, and that is to lay down all lines upon the same conditions. These are the concessions that we have made in regard to telephone servicesNA LINES, UNDER GUARANTEE, UNDER THE NEW POLICY OUTLINED BY THE POSTMASTERGENERAL. 1. In the case of lines which are estimated to yield within eight years an annual minimum revenue covering an amount sufficient to provide for the cost of operating the line, plus 10 per cent, of the cost of constructing the line, and supplying the instruments, or where the estimated cost of a line does not exceed £100, no guarantee or contribution will be required from those concerned. 2. In the case of lines which are estimated to be unfinancial on erection, but which are estimated to earn the minimum revenue, i.e., an amount which will cover the cost of operating the line, plus 10 per cent, of the cost of construction and supplying the instruments, within a period of seven years, the Department will bear 75 per cent, of the difference between the estimated revenue and the minimum revenue if those concerned pay down an amount equal to 25 per cent, of the deficiency for the first two years and enter into a bond guaranteeing to make good a like proportion of the loss for a further period of five years if necessary. 3. Lines which are not likely to be financial on erection and which are not estimated to earn the minimum revenue within a period of seven years will be erected by the Department on those interested making a contribution in cash, labour, and/or material to the extent of 25 per cent, of the estimated annual deficiency capitalized at 10 per cent., the Department bearing 75 per cent, of the deficiency. 4. In cases where these lines prove financial after three years' experience, refunds will be made to those interested, who will - also get credit for surpluses under certain conditions. Where lines prove financial at the end of the agreement period, the amount contributed, 'together with interest accruing thereon, is refunded to the persons concerned. 5. Steps are being taken to obtain as quickly as possible the necessary material, and when this has been obtained preference will be given to lines which have already been approved, but which the Department has been unable to erect owing to lack of funds. Some time must be allowed in which to obtain the necessary material. A copy of that notification was supplied to every member of .the deputation, and to every other honourable member who desired it . In regard to mai l services, honourable members will recollect that, at the beginning of this year, we received protests from many districts to which circulars had been sent, stating that the tender for the following three years would be so much, and that unless the people were prepared to contribute a certain amount, the service would be discontinued. That I regarded as a very .great hardship, and we overcame it by introducing the following conditions, as from 1st July lastNEW MAIL SERVICES. When the frequency of the service is once a week, or less, and the distance does not exceed 75 miles, and five residences or ten adults permanently benefit, the Department will bear all the cost, if the amount is reasonable. If, however, the lowest offer is unreasonable, the Department will call on the residents, to provide a service at a reasonable cost, 'or pay the difference. Twice a week. When the cost exceeds the revenue, the Department will bear the whole cost, if the difference between the cost and the revenue does not exceed 50 per cent, of the revenue. If the loss exceeds 50 per cent, of the revenue, the Department to bear 75 per cent, of the deficiency, or that proportion of the deficiency which equals 50 per cent, of the revenue, whichever is the greater; the residents to contribute the balance providing such contribution exceeds £10, but if under £10, the Department to bear the whole of the loss. Three times a week. When the cost exceeds the revenue, the Department will bear the whole of the cost if the deficiency does not exceed 50 per cent, of the revenue. If it exceeds 50 per cent, of the revenue, the Department to bear 65 per cent, of the deficiency, or that proportion thereof which equals 50 per cent, of the revenue, whichever is the greater; the residents to contribute the balance with a similar provisio as in the case'of the twice-aweek frequency. More than three times a week. Same conditions as for a three times a week frequency, with the exception that the Department will bear 55 per cent instead of 65 per cent, of the deficiency, or that proportion thereof which equals 50 per cent, of the revenue, whichever is the greater. Cost of receiving-offices not to be debited against the service. Intermediate receiving-offices not to be established on non-paying services, where the residents to be served can be given reasonable facilities by means of a free bag, delivery into roadside boxes, or by private bag. EXISTING MAILS. If a tender reasonable for the service to be performed, taking local conditions into consideration, no contribution to be required. If the tender is unreasonable, a contribution to be asked for. Those conditions are a great improvement upon those obtaining before 1st July last, and I think ib is unfair to say that f a c i l i -' ties to the country districts have not been extended by the present Government. Much of the trouble in connection with telephone services, both trunk lines and private services in the cities, is due to the circumstances arising out of the war. .During the last two or three years we have been handicapped, not only by the shortness of money, but also by the cost of material and the difficulty of getting it at all. Even at the present time, for t ordinary galvanized wire, when we are able to get it , we pay £ 6 5 per ton, as against the pre-war price of £12 per ton. Honourable members will see, from that one item alone, that the cost of installing and extending services has increased enormously, and the expenditure of the Department has grown accordingly. H y predecessor in the last financial year had the misfortune to experience one of the worse years since the outbreak of war. The Government were unable to spare money for the Postal Department as they wished, just as they were unable to find money for expenditure in other Departments. There was, necessarily, a general cutting-down of the Estimates in aU directions. This year I have been more fortunate; at the very earliest opportunity the Treasurer gave me authority to call for tenders involving a very large amount of money. If I had been prepared for this debate, I could have told honourable members the exact amount represented by the tenders which we have already accepted. Of course, it will take some time ior the material to be supplied.",47
204,Mr WEST,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Tw o thousand five hundred people in Sydney are waiting for telephones.,49
205,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I know that. The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) quoted figures which show that on 1st July over 9,000 people throughout Australia had applied for telephone services and were still waiting to be supplied. Many of them will have to wait a considerable time longer. Those who are seeking connection with the North Sydney exchange will have to wait, from the time the new switchboard was ordered^ about fourteen montohs before they get any remedy at all. The tender has been .placed abroad, and foreign contractors for this class of material will not bind themselves to deliver within any specified time.",49
206,Mr FENTON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Is there no hope of getting material in Australia?,49
207,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Not switchboards. Honourable members may have read in the press recently that after a tremendous amount of work, the United States of America is just overtaking telephonic and telegraphic arrears which accumulated during the war. They will understand that until those arrears are overtaken American manufacturers will not be sending , any material to other countries. We anticipate getting the switchboard for North Sydney within about ten months, and a further three or four months will be occupied in installing it . All the applications for telephones which have not been met are held up for one of three reasons: Either the switchboards in their districts are full and we have to wait for other switchboards, or they are in localities where the telephone line is carried in cables which are full and we have to wait for a fresh supply of cables, or they are in districts where the telephone lines are carried by wires on poles and we have to wait for a further supply of wires. Orders have been placed for considerable quantities of these various materials, and until they come to hand, we can do nothing at all. So far as the Treasurer is concerned, the only question he has asked, when I have requested monev, has been as to whether the amount can be expended within the financial year. He has pointed out that it is useless to load the Estimates with votes for works if there is no possibility of the requisite material earning to hand within the financial period. That is the only limitation placed apon the Department in regard to the extension of telephonic and telegraphic services. Tenders are being called or nave been accepted for all requirements, and we are endeavouring to obtain the material as quickly as possible. Both honourable members and the public will have to possess themselves in patience, because no matter what is said or done, we cannot move more quickly than we are doing at the present time.",49
208,Mr CONSIDINE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Does the shortage of material apply also to wireless?,49
209,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"In a much smaller degree, but wireless is a very big question. I shall make only a passing reference to the miserable parochial remarks of the honourable member for Illawarra. Mr HECTOR .LAMOND -^Because there is no possible reply to them.",49
210,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Unfortunatel y the honourable member thinks that everything a man does is coloured by the State in which he resides. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has already shown that nearly every Postmaster/ General has been representative of a New South Wales constituency, and as a Victorian I have no complaint to make against any of theni in regard to the equality of treatment all States received from them.",49
211,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"In view of the figures I have quoted, the Minister would be most ungrateful if he thought otherwise.",49
212,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"That , of course, is an insinuation that these representatives of - New South Wale3 did not play fair with their own State. I maintain, emphatically, that the three Victorian Postmasters General who have preceded me in the office, including Mr Mauger. who was in control of the Department for a few months, and whose name was not mentioned by the honourable member for Grampians, did not care whether applications came from the east, west,- or north', from Tasmania, Western Australia, or any other State. A member of a Government who views matters that come under his notice from the basis of the State from which he hails is utterly, unworthy of being in a Government.",49
213,Mr HEOTOB LAMOND,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"What is the explanation of the .5,000 applications not attended to in New South Wales as compared with the 2,000 in Victoria?",50
214,Mr WIPE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I shall get the figures detailed, but I thought the honourable member was one of those who are always boasting about the greater progress and greater population of New South Wales as compared with Victoria. If one State is more progressive than another, and has a greater population, we would naturally expect it to have a larger number of applications than would be received in a smaller State.",50
215,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,The implication therefore is that New South Wales is two and a half times more progressive than Victoria. I do not think the Minister means to imply that.,50
216,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Does the honourable member claim that New South Wales is not two and a half times more progressive than Victoria? No; he will not answer that question. Ever since I have been in this Parliament, complaints have been made by honourable members about the allowance paid to postmasters and postmistresses who are in charge of receiving and allowance offices. Every Postmaster-General finds that it is a most difficult matter to deal with these people.",50
217,Mr CONSIDINE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Are not they supposed to live on - the allowance they re' ceive ?,50
218,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"No . It is utterly impossible to pay a living allowance in all offices. The idea has always been that they should be attached to shops, and premises occupied by people with other means of earning a livelihood, and who thus may get a fair remuneration for the work they do for the Post and Telegraph Department, which is merely an adjunct to their other work. Unfortunately, however, in many cases these offices have fallen intothe hands of women who have no other means of obtaining a livelihood, and it is on their behalf that representations are made by honourable members,, who, however, are not prepared to recommend that for these small post-offices an adequate living allowance should be paid. There is hardly one of these officers who is not being paid more than the amount of revenue derived from the office.",50
219,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,-Shoul d there not be some increase in the allowance because of the increased cost of living?,50
220,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"As announced about a fortnight ago, the Government have agreed to increase the allowance paid to these offices by £67,000, based upon the principle of making some recompense for light and accommodation. It is certainly a small increase, but in many cases it will be a welcome one.  age will that increase represent?",50
221,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I cannot say from memory; but it is based on a certain amount per week, according to the size of the office.",50
222,Mr CONSIDINE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Is the Postmaster General of opinion that fifty or sixty residents in a certain district should be deprived of postal facilities if there is not sufficient revenue from the allowance office?,50
223,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,No.,50
224,Mr CONSIDINE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Then some one must be paid to do the work in that office.,50
225,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"But payment for work done is quite different from the payment of a living allowance. The drought allowance for mail contracts is another matter of considerable difficulty. We must remember that contracts are entered into as the .result of tenders. As the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) interjected, one man puts in a tender at a price which he thinks will cover all possible contingencies, whereas another man puts in a much lower price, making no allowance these whatever for the risk of contingencies, believing that he can rely on the Government to make up to him any loss that he can show. One has to be careful in giving assistance in such circumstances, because it is a matter that strikes at the very root of the system of tendering. If a man knows that he can get his loss made up to him by the Government, he submits a tender at a lower price, and secures a contract over a man submitting a price to cover contingencies. Consequent upon the severe drought which prevailed in New South' Wales and Queensland last year, the sum of £25,000 was made available by Cabinet for the purpose of assisting mail contractors in those States. The maximum increase of subsidy in any case was not to exceed 25 per cent., and the period for which the increases operated was from the 1st January, 1919, to the 31st December, 1919. The actual amount paid to those mail contractors was approximately £18,000. However, since these payments were made, drought, conditions have, to a large extent, continued in New South Wales and Queensland, and, in the circumstances, it has been decided to afford further assistance to mail contractors in the drought-stricken areas whose contracts were entered into prior< to the 1st July, 1919, and where it is shown that such assistance is warranted. The assistance will cover the period from the 1st January, ,1920, to the 30th September, 1920, and it is estimated that the amount required will be about £14,450. The honourable member for  the. allowances should not be granted to those contractors whose contracts commenced on the 1st January of the present year, and the answer given was that the man who took up a contract on the 1st January of this year had a pretty fair idea-h e was in the middle of the drought then-that he must look forward to drought conditions prevailing, and was not entitled to the same consideration which was extended to a.man who had entered into a contract commencing in the middle of last year.",50
226,Mr STEWART,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,And who was unexpectedly met 'by a drought.,51
227,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Yes . That was the reason why the allowance was limited. However, it is for the Treasurer to consider whether there are specially hard cases in which an exception might be made. The man who entered into a contract at the beginning of this year is not on the same footing, so far as the merits of his case are concerned, as is the man who entered into a contract at the middle of last year, and might easily have anticipated the breaking up of the drought in the followDepartment ing spring. In any case, the man who entered into a contract which was to mence at the beginning of this year had the opportunity of asking the DepartBut ment to relieve him of it, and if he been held to it by the Department, i would then have been fair for him to claim consideration on the ground that he was forced to continue his contract. But not one application as far as I know was received from any man asking to relieved of his contract.",51
228,Unknown,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m.,51
229,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Hume in his amendment urges that further facilities should be granted, but he has not given us any idea of what in his opinion those further facilities should consist.  set out everything in a simple amendment.",51
230,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Quite so; but "" further facilities "" might mean anything. I have pointed out that the last concession to country districts in regard to the guarantee required in connection with the construction of telephone lines was made ten years ago, and that we have made a further concession of 50 per cent, in the then existing conditions. I represent a country constituency which, with the exception of part of the electorate of Indi, has fewer railway facilities, and is, perhaps, more inaccessible than any other division in Victoria, and my constituents appreciate very much indeed the concessions that have been made. So far as I can remember, all the applications for telephone services which were held up because of the large contributions which the people concerned were informed they would have to make are now being taken up under the recent concessions. In every case the new conditions laid down by us have been readily accepted, and the people concerned have undertaken to supply the cash, labour, or material required of them by the Department. As the result of these new concessions I do not think that in any one case the contributions which the people were originally told they would have to make have been required. As I said at the outset of my remarks, I do not take the view that the Postal should be a revenue producing service. At the same time, since it comhas been made to pay its way I should like it , if possible, to continue to do so. I am not out for any surplus. I had would prefer to extend any anticipated t surplus in the provision of further facilities for country districts. One honourable member said during the debate that the conditions laid down in respect of the construction of country telephone lines be were notinsisted upon in the case of telephone trunk lines, or town or city services. I can only say in reply that the same conditions apply all round. If a projected country line will pay from the start it is erected free of cost to the persons to be served. It rarely happens, however, that a country line will pay its way from its inception. In my own electorate only two lines-one long and another 6 miles in lengthhave been erected without any contribution or guarantee being required from the persons to be served.",51
231,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,'But the ment as to a contribution or guarantee works great hardship in some cases.,52
232,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"No doubt it does. should like to see the whole country riddled, so to speak, with telephone lines. I do not agreed with the statement once made in a rural district by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews), that telephones are a luxury. When he made that statement no doubt he had in mind telephone services in our large cities; but in country districts they are not luxuries, but absolute necessities. One of the difficulties in the way of our complying with applications for new lines at the present time is the heavy cost of material. W it h wire, for instance, costing us £ 6 5 per ton, as against £ 1 2 per ton prior to the war, and the cost of other material having gone up proportionately, it will be readily recognised that we have not the opportunities for extending the service that were offering before the war. Then there is the further trouble that great delay is experienced in obtaining supplies of material. The Department, however, is doing its very best to meet the applications for telephone services now in hand. It is the policy of the Government to assist the country districts in so far as these matters are concerned in every possible way, and honourable members will discover later that that policy applies also in other directions. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Oook) has placed no difficulty in the way of the Department so far as money is concerned. When he is asked to supply funds to enlarge the activities of my Department, his only inquiry is, "" Can you spend the amount for which you ask within the financial year ? If you can, you can have the money."", Honourable members know perfectly well that, although provision is (made for a large expenditure on the purchase of material, that expenditure is often unlikely' to take place in the .year for which it is provided, because of the difficulty in securing prompt delivery of ma-terial. Some of the material which wasordered as a result of the grant made to the Postal Department in February of last year is only now coming to hand. In the 4 miles beginning of the present year the Treasurer gave me authority to call for tenders for the supply of material to the value of £500,000, but the great bulk of that material will not come to hand u n t i l the require- beginning of next year. I repeat that we are doing all that we .can to meet the requirements of country districts, and that there is no hesitation on the part of I the Treasurer in supplying the necessary funds. The real difficulty lies in the fact that we have to wait some time for material to come to hand. . In that respect, we are not singular. Like the rest of the world, we are trying to overtake the arrears which accumulated during the war.",52
233,Mr RILEY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Is the Department doing anything in regard to the demand for city telephone services?,52
234,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Yes . I have already referred to the difficulty we experience in obtaining supplies. One trouble in connection with the Sydney telephone service, for instance, is the delay in obtaining the large switchboard required for the City North exchange. The contractor whose tender was accepted for the suppiy of that switchboard would not bind himself to deliver it within any specified time. We expect it to arrive, however, within the next ten or twelve months, and an additional three or four months will be spent in putting it in position. We are doing everything within our power to overtake arrears, and to bring all our work up to date.",52
235,Mr LAZZARINI,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Werriwa) [8.9] The Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) has said that the reason for the delay in proceeding with the erection of country telephone lines is the shortage of material. If there is an absolute shortage of material, we cannot expect these lines to be b u i l t ; but not one of the many applications for telephone lines in my electorate has been turned down by the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales on the score of lack of material. Such applications have met with the objections that the lines would be too costly; that they would involve too great a loss; or that if they are to be built a proportion of the cost of construction musb be borne by the people applying for them. At the beginning of this session the Postmaster General promised a liberal policy of phone extensions, and I am disappointed at the failure of the Department to carry out that policy. Many of my constituents are 20 or 30 miles away from the nearest railway station , and, owing to the lack of 1 telephone services, are practically cut off from civilization. Sickness, as we know, enters every home, and when any of these people need the services of a doctor, a ride or drive of 30 or 40 miles has to be undertaken to obtain one. I cannot square my experience with the statement of the Postmaster-General that shortage of material is the main reason why telephone lines are not being constructed, as requested, in. country districts. I wish now to refer briefly to the tion of mail contractors and the drought allowance. I endorse everything that has been said by honourable members of my party in regard to that matter. It is time that the Postal Department realized the serious disability under which mail contractors' are suffering. If they do not receive reasonable treatment, and are unable to make their contracts pay, many of those who now have a mail delivered to them once, twice, or three times a week will soon be deprived of such a service. is an absolute negation of the policy of the public Departments of the Commonwealth' to say that these men are not entitled to an increased allowance. We have tribunals which fix the price of various commodities, and Courts which make awards as to wages. As the economic position becomes more aggravated, prices are increased and new awards are made. Following up that policy, mail contractors, having regard' to the adverse conditions with which they aTe confronted, should be granted an increase. It seems to me that the Postal Department is a sweating institution. I have had brought under my notice today the case of a postmaster in a small country town, who is a returned soldier, with a wife and family, and receives the princely salary of £130 per year. The whole service needs to be looked into. The Government is not doing the fair thing in any branch of the Postal Department. I strongly support the amendment, and hope that it will be carried. Mr Lazzarini.",52

We cannot possibly have these facilities, particularly in the cases that about are dependent upon materials which are unprocurable, all at once; but we are assured that a very definite step forward has been taken, and that, if not within a few weeks, at any rate within a very few months, a great many of the works that have been promised for a long time will be put in hand. We in South AusI t tralia are greatly indebted to the Deputy Postmaster-General there.

246,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"There is no threat at all. Nothing we can do in this House will alter the present state of affairs. Le't me remind honourable members what the position is. It is not so much lack of money, but it is lack of material. If there had been four times the amount of money available, it could no't have been spent to advantage, a3 the material was simply unobtainable, and much of it is still unobtainable. It now takes twelve months 'to get an order for telephones executed; and in some cases much more than twelve months.",54
247,Mr MAHONY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,That shows a lack of foresight on the part of the Department.,54
248,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"It shows the great scarcity there is all over the world of many things that we need. Every day a' shortage of something or otheT is occurring. To-day it is telephones; yesterday it was sugar; the day before it was butter. Every day some trouble arises, all owing to the one fundamental fact that supplies cannot be obtained. That is the first fact we want to get our minds.  plain how it is that in some country places, where the people have had to provide a part of the material, they have been able to get their part of it, and the Postal Department has not provided its part?",54
249,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I cannot tell the honourable member about these isolated cases. J am speaking of the position generally. If some people are getting services and others are not it is not due to any lack of competency or anything else, but to the clear fact, which we have to face, that we cannot install these services under present conditions. There are 10,000 telephones wanted today. They cannot be supplied. I am in trouble every day about* telephones, and so is every other honourable member; but what can we do ? The telephones are not here. They are on order, but they cannot be obtained. It is not a matter of foresight, or even a imatter of money, but a matter of the impossibility of obtaining supplies.",54
250,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Is that the reason why you have reduced some of the country services?,54
251,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I am talking of one thing at a time.

255,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I am afraid that we can never satisfy the honourable member. I am trying to address myself now to the reasonable members of the House. The honourable member tells me quite plainly beforehand that I cannot satisfy him. Well, I shall not try to do so. There is no lack of funds so far as the Post Office is concerned. The Postmaster-General was told on almost the first day on which I took control of the Treasury that whatever money he wanted he could have in reason, and he has been proceeding ever since to into overtake the arrears; but, do what he will, it is impossible to rectify in a short space of time a situation which has been getting steadily worse for four or five years, mainly owing to war conditions. We are after those arrears with the utmost possible expedition, and the sooner they can be overtaken the better the Government will be pleased, and the better I hope honourable members will be satisfied.",54

257,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"As-to the mail services, the Government is giving its best to the country at the present anoment; but even those services cannot be reorganized in a moment. Conditions of drought have prevailed in the country, and there are all sorts of hindrances even to the establishment and organization of the vast mail routes of the Commonwealth; but re-organization is proceeding even there, and we are doing our very best to overtake the arrears. It is our purpose and intention to give better and more frequent services in the back country districts. I have all my life been an advocate of good treatment for the back country districts. These instrumentalities are - the very essence of decency, and even livelihood, .to say nothing of comfort and luxury, out there, and any man who thinks rightly of his country, and sees things in their proper setting and focus, must admit that everything that can be done for the country should be done.",55

That is the attitude of the Government generally. The rest is a matter of organization, spending money, obtaining materials, organizing those materials, and establishing and re-adjusting the whole of the services as far as that may be done. I assure honourable members that, so far as the Treasury is concerned, there will be no stint of funds, and our efforts will be limited only by the reasonableness of the matters with which we have to deal, and by the service which we can obtain from overseas. That is the fundamental trouble which is keeping everything back now. One honourable member is concerned about the mail contractors.  drought allowance.",55
260,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"That position is not free of difficulty. It is of no use to say that there is nothing to be said on the other side, because there is. At the beginning of this year fresh' tenders were called, in every case, I believe, for a period, owing to the abnormal conditions obtaining. When these contracts were called, drought conditions obtained, and all the difficulties were thoroughly in sight and well understood. ",55
261,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I will come to the difference in fodder prices between then and now. I shall not burke anything, but the point I wish to put is this: Here are two contractors at the beginning of the year facing this abnormal condition, of things. One puts in a tender for £100, and the otherj looking at all the conditions surrounding the situation, puts in a tender for £120. He is ruled out, and the man who puts in the lowest tender gets the contract. What is the position today ? If we say to the successful tenderer, - "" We will give you another £30 on your £100,"" will not the other man who was ruled out because he was sane and wise enough to look at all the conditions, and put in what he bboup-ht a reasonable price, have a right to complain when he finds the other man being paid £130, after his tender for £120 has been rejected? The first thing to do in that case, as a matter of equity, would be to give the contractor the right to surrender his contract, and for us to go on the market again.",55

In those circumstances, he might very well have taken that course; but as surely as he accepted a tender which was higher than a rejected tender, there would have been a storm.",55
264,Mr FENTON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,It is done every day in the week by sensible men.,55
265,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"It is not done. I have been through this trouble many times.

266,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,I think you are correct.,55
267,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I know I am short correct. There is only one thing to do, and that is to accept the lowest tender, other things being equal. It is the only safe course for the Minister, and the only sane and salutary rule for the Department and the House. The position as we find it is that things have not got any cheaper, but have become very much dearer, and I can quite conceive there may be a number of cases of real, genuine hardship which should be looked at.",55

Sydney) [8.39] I regret the remark of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), to the effect that it will not matter what the result of a vote on this question may be-that it will not alter the state of affairs. I represent a city constituency, and I can tell honourable members that Sydney has been deprived of its usual facilities, pillar boxes and letter boxes having been removed from one end of the citv to the other. That is a scandalous state of things, and I ask the Government whether it is to be alPost- lowed to continue, or whether the letter boxes are to be replaced. The Treasurer tells us that the Government cannot obtain telephone instruments. That seems most remarkable in a country like this, which is able to turn out turbines and the best and finest classes of machinery at the Shaw Wireless Works at Randwick. Suppose we were cut off fromany other country, is it to 'be supposed that there are . not enough bTains and talent here to make telephone instruments?",57
297,Mr LAIRD SMITH,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,There are patent rights to be considered.,57
298,Mr RILEY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"That is the reply I re- . ceived from the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney; but patent rights should not have stood in the way when the war you was o n ; indeed, we can ignore those patent rights now if we cannot get supplies, and manufacture our own instru",57
299,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Are you advancing the theory that the Government should member, and ignore patent rights?",57

301,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,You are suggesting that a Government which makes laws to protect patent rights should ignore them.,57
302,Mr RILEY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I ask the Treasurer to reason the matter out for a moment. The Government tell us that they have placed Postorders for instruments in America and elsewhere, and that those orders cannot supplied. If that be so, are we to do he without the instruments just because rethere are patent rights? Having given an order for instruments, we can say that if they cannot be supplied we shall feel ourselves justified in ignoring patent rights, and making them for ourselves.",57
303,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,The Government will buy all the telephone instruments in Australia that the honourable member can bring.,58
304,Mr RILEY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I know, but that is not the point I am on. We have works at Randwick which can make all the instruments we require;, indeed, those works are now providing some equipment for the Post Office.",58

308,Mr RILEY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I have not the time to find out. The honourable member is a practical man, and I ask him whether he suggests that, in the absence of any supplies from outside, we should not take steps to manufacture instruments for our own requirements. The Treasurer says he has the money to pay for instruments, and we know that we have the timber and metals and the necessary mechanics here. It shows a lack of organization on the part of the Government that steps are not taken in this direction. I do not blame the Postmaster-General so much, but he should instruct his mechanical engineers to see to the manufacture of instruments. It is a very sim ple matter to take a screwdriver and look at a telephone instrument; but then we are bold about patent rights. We must let patent rights go, if it be necessary, and see that the people of this country are supplied with business facilities. No Government is worth its salt unless it sees that local requirements are met.",58

310,Mr RILEY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Mr Hoskins, of Lithgow, who has invented an improvement in connection with motor cars, recently visited America in order to patent it. There he was asked where he intended to undertake the work of manufacture, and when he replied '' In Australia'' he was told that if he was going to patent his invention in America he must also undertake the work of manufacture there. The same principle should be applied to patentees in this country. I should like to know how the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) can justify the removal of letter boxes from thickly populated areas around Sydney-lette r boxes which have been in position for the past twenty years? No excuse can be urged for such pay arbitrary action. A motor car passes the sites upon which these boxes were located, and could easily pick up correspondence placed in them. Is it the policy of the Government to cut down postal facilities? This debate has not been initiated one day too soon. I hope that the Government will see that the letter boxes of which I speak are speedily restored to their original positions.",58
311,Mr CUNNINGHAM,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Gwydir) [8.47]. - - I have very much pleasure in supporting the amendment of the honourable  We were all pleased to hear from the Treasurer that, he is not withholding financial assistance from the Postmaster General. I trust that the latter will avail himself of that assistance to the full, in order that he may provide the residents of country districts with adequate mail facilities, if only for the purpose of compensating them for the lack of telephonic communication which obtains there. The position has became very acute-so acute, indeed, that a previous Postmaster General lost his seat in this Chamber in consequence of it. I am very much afraid that his successor will lose his seat unless a vast improvement is effected in this (great arm of the Commonwealth service which so vitally affects our country interests. The position is worse than a scandal. Mail facilities which existed thirty years ago have either disappeared entirely or have been curtailed to such an extent that today they are not recognisable. The buildings of the Department are entirely inadequate. I want to draw attenyou tion to one of these at Narrabri, in my own electorate, which was erected with a view to accommodating eight employees, but which today houses no fewer than twenty-eight officers. This buihicig is located in a hot climate, so that honourable members may readily imagine the conditions under which these employees work. One great facility which country people formerly enjoyed was that of travelling post-offices. These were withdrawn by a previous Administration, and thus the delivery of mails has been rendered slower than it otherwise would be. Repeated applications to the Postmaster General only elicit the reply that he cannot see his way to restore these facilities. In view of the enormous shortage of telephones which exists ab present, the best thing that the Government can do is to increase our country mail service, order that rural residents may be able to deal with correspondence more expeditiously, and thus secure quicker communication with our towns and cities. The argument adduced by the Treasurer in regard to madl contracts is scarcely a sound one. He stated that one contractor may have contracted to provide a service for £100 a year, whilst another contractor has tendered for it at £120, and that if the successful tenderer were now granted a fodder allowance, his unsuccessful competitor would have cause for complaint. May I say that those contractors whose tenders were not accepted during the recent drought period have reason to thank their stars for it. The attitude which has been taken up by Ministers to-night, when the numbers are against them, is in vivid contrast with that of the Postmaster General, who, yesterdey, stated that he entirely concurred in the view of this matter which had been expressed by the Deputy Postmaster-General. I do not think the contention thab we cannot manufacture telephones in Australia is a correct one. TheTe are hundreds of returned soldiers undergoing vocational training here, and there is nothing very intricate in the manufacture of a telephone.",58
312,Mr LAIRD SMITH,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,How does the honourable member know that? He should read the evidence which was given in the Arbitration Court upon that matter. His statement is a libel upon telephone employees.,59
313,Mr CUNNINGHAM,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"The Minister for the Navy can bring forward evidence of a certain character, and twist it to suit himself, but the fact remains that no effort has been made to manufacture telephones in Australia. If we never attempt anything, we shall never achieve anything. So long as Ministers are permitted to retain their positions, and to do nothing, so long will residents in the country be deprived of necessary telephonic facilities. Members of the - Government are prepared to go to any length in order to build up surpluses in the Postal Department, and we know that the late Postmaster-General claimed that he had made a profit of £500,000. He affirmed that this amount had been paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and kept from in him, and that, as a result, he was prevented from effecting improvements in the service owing to lack of funds. He blamed the Cabinet for having placed him in a false position. He did not admit that he had allowed himself to be placed in that position. But when he knew that country residents were not getting a square deal, he should have resigned his position. That would have brought matters to a head. The position that we are in today is the result of funds having been withheld when they were urgently required for the development of this particular arm of the Commonwealth Service. I may perhaps be permitted to mention one or two instances of the way in which country residents are suffering. In the electorate of New England, there is a town which thirty-five years ago had a daily mail service from Tamworth, but which today has a service upon only three days a week. Take the town of Bingara, in my own electorate. In the municipality there are 1,400 inhabitants, and of this number about 700 live in the town itself. Eor many years there was a letter-carrier in the township, but owing to' the enforcement of a policy of economy, he has been withdrawn. Another ease which may be mentioned is that of Longueville, in the Treasurer's electorate of Parramatta. Thirty years ago there were two mail deliveries there daily, but today there is only one delivery. Repeated requests for an additional delivery 'have met with a blank refusal. Notwithstanding that these districts have grown considerably during the period I have indicated, the people were better off thirty years ago than they are now. Great loss is being sustained, particularly by business men, the majority of whom absolutely depend upon the mail and telephone services for the transaction of their business-as the result of the curtailment of these mail facilities. To-night the Postmaster-General made a statement, but there was nothing very definite in it. When he approaches the Cabinet upon these matters, we have no assurance that his proposals will not be turned down. The Treasurer has told us that he will not refuse his colleague financial assistance; but, even if he does not, the point is whether the Cabinet will do so. I understand that the amount provided on the Estimates for the purchase of telephones is likely to undergo serious revision. Only a few days ago, I asked that tenders should be called in Great Britain and America for the requisite supplies of material. Upon that occasion, I was asked to give notice of my question. To-night I understood the Postmaster-General to say that tenders had been called in those countries.",59
314,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Tender s have been called for the supply of some materials, and contracts have been accepted for the supply of others.",60
315,Mr CUNNINGHAM,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,I am very pleased to hear that. I am under the impression that proper efforts have not been made to scour the world in an attempt to procure the materials that are necessary to keep the services up to a good standard.,60
316,Mr FENTON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,A sufficient endeavour is not made to get them in Australia.,60
317,Mr CUNNINGHAM,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong represents a manufacturing district, and I have no doubt that he will be able to point to many instances in which the requisite materials can be obtained in Australia, though no attempt has been made to get them. The Postmaster-General was not present when I was referring to the question of travelling post-offices. In view of the fact that the Treasurer has stated that ample funds are available. I would like to know whether he will restore to country residents the facilities which they formerly enjoyed in the shape of travelling post-offices upon mail trains? There was a travelling post-office on the north-west mail from Sydney to Moree which proved a wonderful convenience to the population all along the line. That service was abolished by the last Postmaster General, and thereby the back country districts were made to suffer great inconvenience. Droughts or shortage of material cannot be urged as excuses for the cutting off of this service. That action was taken in pursuance of a policy which must be recognised as false economy. I should like the present Postmaster-General to say that he will re-establish the travelling post-offices.",60
318,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Step s are being taken to arrange for the conveyance of correspondence between railway stations, and if the means provided are not satisfactory, something else will be done. I am determined that this convenience shall be restored.",60
319,Mr CUNNINGHAM,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Do you mean that the travelling post-offices will be restored ?,60
320,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Yes , if they become necessary; but if the other means are successful, they will not be necessary.",60
321,Mr CUNNINGHAM,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I do not know what other means are contemplated, but I am"" prepared to await the honourable gentleman's scheme, to see if it will redress OUT grievance. If it does not, I hope that he will give, immediately, consideration to the reasonable request of the people of the north-western districts of New South Wales, that the travelling post-offices may be restored in order to improve their mail service. I could deal at length with the treatment of the employees of the Postmaster General's Department, but the motion to-night complains of the lack of postal facilities, and the conditions of the postal employees is a proper subject for a separate .discussion, which, on another occasion, might well engage honourable members to the exclusion of all other subjects. The conditions of the employees of this Department are deplorable, and until they have been improved, and the employees are satisfied, efficient service is not to be looked for. The employees are underpaid and overworked. I have already spoken of the application of the third degree at the General Post Office, Sydney, in connection with the employment of telephone attendants. It has come to such a pass that on one occasion a girl was questioned and crossrquestioned for over an hour, until she fell hysterical to the ground, and six other girls had to be carried out of the room, work on theswitchboard being suspended for some time. This may appear amusing to some honourable members, but it is a serious thing for the young women themselves. I hope that not only the Postmaster General, but the whole Cabinet, will recognise that the services given by his Department are of vital importance to the residents in country districts, more so than any of the other public services of the Commonwealth, and that they will, therefore, give the Postal Department more consideration than it has yet had from the Ministry.",60

The Government cannot complain of any backwardness on. the part of honourable members in speaking their minds. There are a number of .grievances which I wish to have redressed, and I propose to speak frankly regarding them. I do not blame the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) personally, because, having had experience in the office that he holds, I know that he does not lie on a bed of roses. He has special difficulties to face, because the war has made it very hard to obtain supplies; but there is a good deal in the complaints which have come from all sides of the House. I resent the statement of two or three prominent members of the Labour party about a deputation from that side of the House. They forgot to say that that deputation followed a general deputation. I had no invitation from them to attend on their deputation. We all advocate the rights and exclaim against the wrongs of the people in the country, for the reason that we are all interested in them; partly because of their votes. If we had not their support, it would make a big difference to us. But we shall not succeed in helping them if we take action in a party spirit. A party proposition cannot be supported by honourable members who do not wish to displace the Government.  this a party question?",61

324,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,It has everything to do with it. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - The troubles in connection with the Post Office are not entirely due to lack of coin or material.

327,Mr WEST,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I would alter it very quickly. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I thought it was the Treasurership that the honourable member had arranged to take.

333,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I have great sympathy with the telephone attendants. The telephone room is a very trying place, and attention to the switchboard severely taxes the patience of the attendants. I looked into this matter last week, because I am interested in these young ladies. . The Deputy Postmaster-General informs me that they are having trouble because so many of the attendants are getting married, and have to be replaced by inexperienced girls. I have suggonted to the Postmaster General (Mr Wise), and do so again, that he should try to ascertain the causes of the trouble that arises in his Department. It is those in control who are to blame. not send the Victorian Deputy Postmaster-General and a dozen of his principal officers to Sydney, and bring the New South Wales Deputy Postmaster General and his staff to Melbourne, and see what the effect of the change is? Like other honourable members, I get notices from the Department telling me that, owing to the failing off of revenue, the payments to allowance offices must be reduced. Recently I was informed that the payment to one of these small offices had been reduced by £2. I do not hold the Postmaster-General personally responsible for these reductions, but he is the man to whom we must make our complaints about them. I desire to endorse the suggestion made by some honourable members as to basing the allowance on the revenue received instead of on the work done.",62
334,Mr WISE,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"That is how they are paid-o n the work done. Mr AU ST IN CHAPMAN - If the Postmaster-General makes that statement seriously, I beg to differ, because they are paid on the revenue received at the office. Will the Postmaster-General say 'that if he discovers, on inquiry, they are not paid on the work done, they will in future be remunerated on that basis. In many of the offices where the revenue is comparatively small, a great deal of work has to be done, and sometimes at great inconvenience. In some country centres the .persons employed, who are sometimes women, have to get up in the middle' of the night to hand out a bag; and such work should not be paid for on the basis of the revenue received. I invite the Postmaster-General to fully inquire into this question. Personally, I am in favour of a Commission being appointed to administer the Postal Department, because I think the work should be taken out of politics altogether, as some, at least, are inclined to make use of the Department for political purposes. The Department should be conducted on business lines, and should be under the control of a Commission.",62
335,Mr WEST,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Unde r such circumstances the country people would be the first to suffer.,62

I aim pleased that this resolution had been moved, and I am glad that the Treasurer has made sucb a-generous promise.  surer has not made any promise. Mr AU STIN CHAPMAN - I understand he has promised to find the money if he considers that it is required.  the Postmaster-General, who is the responsible Minister, make the promise? I Sir JOSEPH 'COOK - Honourable members opposite do no't want these troubles rectified.",62
337,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"That is not a generous thing to say. ' I think the Postmaster-General will admit that it is time that those in charge of country offices were paid for the work done. The other day a young person was placed in charge of the all-night telephone exchange at Yass, and when an attempt was made to raise the attendant to secure the services of a doctor, there was no response. The result was that a death occurred; and when I wrote that to the Department complaining, I was informed that the officer concerned had been suitably dealt with. Such occur- . rences should be prevented; - and, although 'the Postmaster-General may consider my criticisms somewhat severe, he must remember that we have to hold him responsible, because we cannot go direct to the omcers. I feel sure that the promise made will be kept, because if conditions do not alter in connection with the administration of the Postal Department, a change will have to be made. I also desire to know what the Government intend to do concerning old age pensions. Honourable members have been informed that the Government have not sufficient money to increase the amount; 'but, at the same time, no effort is being made to bring in an amending Bill to allow the pensioners to earn a little money.

At the present"" time, the Government are charging too high a price for the tweed. The factory will have nothing to do with Flinders-lane. Senator E . D .

370,Mr ATKINSON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Wilmot) [9.45] - Every session we have a debate of this character; generally it occurs on the Esti- settlement. mates. I have been!-in this House a good many years and session after session we have debated the question of mail, telephonic, and telegraphic facilities in country districts, but very little has ever come of the discussion. Something ought to have been done, but the amendment which is before the House is not required, because the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) has already made an honest attempt to do something in accordance with the requests we have made in the past. I am told that in parts of my own electorate the postal facilities are not as good as they were fifty years ago, and reference to the records proves that ment to be true. I have never been able to understand the policy of carrying mails past the station for which they were intended to the terminus, and then sending them back next day. I was glad to hear the Postmaster-General say to-night that he is already endeavouring to remedy that practice by experimenting with ti e South Australian system, and he has promised that if these efforts are not - a success other steps will be taken, even to the extent of re-establishing the ling post-office. The honourable member for South ney (Mr Riley) has complained of the removal of pillar-boxes and the reduction of other facilities in urban areas. What are those disabilities compared with the curtailment of the facilities in country districts-the closing of post-offices at inconvenient hours and the reduction of mail services? What disabilities are city people suffering compared with those that have been imposed upon country residents ? In any case, there is no comparison between the country and the cities so far as the solid prosperity of the nation is concerned. Where would all the dwellers in the cities be but for the country industries?' About 75 per cent, of the wealth of Australia is derived from was primary production. I appeal to the honourable member for South Sydney to look at this matter as .a business man, and if he does so, he will see that we cannot afford to dry up the main sources of our national income. The country interests must be fostered and increased by all possible means. The telephone service in the back country is a great help to land People will not live in the back blocks away from all the conveniences of civilization unless they are given rapid means of communication with the nearest town. Isolation is a very serious matter for people in| the bush. A saw-mill ie often established a long way from any township, and without telephonic communication the people working and living about the mill arc in a serious position. Accidents are frequent in connection with a saw-mill, and unless there is means of quickly summoning medical aid the results may be fatal. Very often fatalities do occur, which might have been avoided had it been possible to state- summon medical aid in reasonably quick time. Hitherto when the extension of telephone facilities to the back country has been asked for, a guarantee has been required by the Department. Now no guarantee is asked, and I am glad that the Postmaster-General is making an honest attempt to Teform the methods of the Department. We cannot expect everything to be done in a day, especially when so many accumulated arrears have to be wiped off before the travel- Minister can do many of the things he wishes to do. The present Postmaster General is the first, to my knowledge, who Sydhas made a really solid effort at reform in the right direction, and I give him all the credit he deserves. He has wiped out the guarantee, and country districts are receiving the telephones they require without having to submit to what was a very serious handicap in the past.  able member knows that that is not true. Services are not being given without a guarantee.",65
371,Mr ATKINSON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Services have been granted lately in my electorate, and I am under the impression that the usual guarantee was not insisted upon.",66
372,Mr STEWART,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Then the honourable member must be doing better than I am.,66
373,Mr ATKINSON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"At any rate, it is my impression that no guarantee was given. We know that the extension of these facilities in the country is delayed by the lack of material. We cannot expect the Postmaster-General to purchase wire at a fabulous price if , by waiting a little time, he can buy at a reasonable price. People in the country are not unreasonable; they do not expect the oarth. But they do feel that they are entitled to some consideration in their task of reclaiming the wilderness. They have gone into the back country and wrestled with the forest primeval. parts of my own electorate, where forests stood a few years ago, beautiful farms and smiling homesteads are to be seen today. When the settlers first went there they could not see ten yards ahead of them because of the density of the forest. People who have had the pluck to carve homes out of the wilds in this fashion are entitled to decent facilities, and I am glad that at last the Government are realizing that fact. In regard to allowance and semi-official post-offices, the people who conduct them confer a great benefit upon the settlers. I know that in many instances, although the volume of business is not very large, the people in charge are tied to the offices all day.  able member expects them to live on sympathy.",66
374,Mr ATKINSON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"An improvement in this matter has been effected recently. We know the record of the Postmaster General in this House, and that, as a private member, he advocated the granting of better postal and telephonic facilities to country districts. Deputations have waited upon him in the hope that he would make the best possible effort to carry out the policy he advocated as a private member of this House. I say that the honourable gentleman has honestly attempted to do that. The proof of that is that he has achieved something, and has taken steps in the right direction, which is more than can be said for any Postmaster-General who preceded him. I agree with the honourable member who moved the amendment, that telephone facilities should be extended in the country districts,'and that a drought allowance should be paid to mail contractors. But I point out that the Postmaster-General has taken steps to do those things which he is being blamed to-night for neglecting to do. He gave an assurance some days ago that a drought allowance would be made to mail contractors, and that the money to enable that to be done would shortly be available. When a request is made to the Postmaster-General in this public way to do these things, people outside will not unnaturally come to the conclusion that he has been remiss, whilst, as a matter of fact, he deserves our thanks for what he has achieved in the direction desired. In ThePostmaster-General has made an endeavour to better the lot of the people in charge of allowance post-offices. , Mr MOGRATH - We have had no promise about the allowance post-offices.",66
375,Mr ATKINSON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I presume that the honourable member knows that, some days ago, it was stated that something like £67,000 was to be added to the amount to be paid for allowance post-offices.",66
376,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"The Post and Telegraph Department received £487,000 more than the estimate of expenditure last year. That is the best proof of what the Government are trying to do.",66
377,Mr ATKINSON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I hope that officers in charge of allowance post-offices will receive better treatment than has so far been accorded to them; but I appreciate what - has been done. I know, from letters I have received from some of them, that they also appreciate what has been done. Whilst I agree that expenditure must be kept within reasonable bounds, I feel sure that the Postmaster General will not regard his Department as primarily a money-making Department, and I trust that 'the people who have charge of allowance post-offices will remunerated according to the work they perform, rather than upon the basis of the revenue received from the offices they trol.

Some of the contracts may have been entered into when the prices of fodder was were falling; and yet the amendment would compel the Postmaster-General to make an allowance to. those who entered couninto contracts under those conditions. as Under no circumstances could I be induced to vote for that. I hope that some special effort will be made by the Postmaster-General to secure to the best advice possible in order to make counwireless telegraphy applicable to the needs of the back country. Most of the pastoralists possess motor cars, and it should be possible to secure sufficient power to effect wireless installations in many outside districts. We know that men who went to the Front after a very short period of training, and very little experience, were able to send wireless messages from aeroplanes; and when it was possible for them in so short a time to acquire sufficient knowledge of wireless telegraphy to make use of it in that way, the Postmaster-General should consider whether it is not possible to make any effectual use of wireless telegraphy to add to the facilities of communication with out-back places. I should like the Government also to give serious consideration to the proposals that have been made for the purpose of carrying mails by aeroplane around the north-west and north-east coasts of this country. The Government should do aU that they possibly can in the interests of the people to make a business proposition of commercial aviation. A big proposal of this sort has been placed before the Postmaster-General and the Defence Department. We have only to look at the maps in Queen's Hall to see the necessity for developing the northern portion of Australia. We cannot expect people to go to those parts unless we give them facilities for readily communicating with other parts of the Commonwealth. I am satisfied with the assurance given by the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise), so strongly endorsed by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), who promises that all funds, in reason, will be supplied.

There is no Department under the control of the Commonwealth Government that comes in for more criticism than does the Post and Telegraph Department. It has been held up to ridicule and discussed, both inside and outside this House, ever since Federation was brought about. Quite recently, in another place, a senator described the Sydney post-office and telephone exchange as the worse in the world; but if the discription he applied to it is a correct one, it is the fault of this Par-, liament, and not of the officials of hheDepartment When the magneto exchange was in operation in Sydney, the Government of the day decided to change it to a common battery system, and the officials proposed to install a 3,000-section board, but as the Treasurer of the day cut down the vote by one-half, they were not able to install more than a 1,500-section board, to which it was intended to transfer 1,500 subscribers. But before the work was completed there were 1,500 new subscribers for whom accommodation had to be provided. The Government thereupon voted the money to install a second 1,500section board, but before that was ready there were another 1,500 new subscribers to be accommodated. This piecemeal system was followed until there was absolutely no room in the exchange in which to establish another section board, and it became necessary to put up a second exchange ; but the fault was entirely due to the fact that the Department had been starved for funds ever since the Commonwealth assumed control of it . The present Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) has not been long enough in office to accept any of the blame, and his immediate predecessors are not particularly responsible. The blame is attachable to all the Prime Ministers and Treasurers of the past.

400,Mr MARR,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"The proposals outlined in the Postmaster-General's statement. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) has referred to the question of wireless telegraphy. I think honourable members are agreed that the Postal Department has quite enough to do without taking over the control of wireless, and that the progress of wireless would be retarded by its transfer to that Department. Wireless today comes into touch with four different Departments of the Commonwealth. It affects the Defence Department, the Department of the Navy, the Navigation Department, and the Postal Department. It is time that we had a distinct Department for its control. The accountancy work relating to it might be carried out by one of the existing Departments, but if wireless is to be exploited in Australia to the extent that it ought to be, it must be made tinct branch of the Service. Wireless telephony is rapidly coming into prominence, and by means of it the back blocks of Australia could be linked up. should have a wireless department with a well-equipped laboratory for the carrying out of experiments, and tests designed to further this science. There is no science which is likely to be so applicable to the industrial and general life of Australia as wireless telegraphy and telephony, but the Postmaster-General's Department ought not to be saddled with this new branch when it cannot properly attend to all the business already under its control. It has been stated that the Commonwealth Government paid the life insurance premiums of officers who went to the war, and that they have now been called upon to make a refund. I understand that that demand for - a refund applies only to officers in the Permanent Forces. Sir JOSEPH COOK! - Whateve r promise was made will be kept.",70
401,Mr MARR,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Member s of the Commonwealth Public Service generally who joined the Australian Imperial Force have not been called upon to make a refund of the amounts paid on their behalf in respect of life insurance premiums. In 1912, there were in the Defence Department in New South Wales four warrant officers-som e of them with over thirt y years' service-wh o were in receipt of a salary of £26 0 a year. The Defence Department offered them commissioned rank, provided that they would accept the minimum rate of pay of £25 0 per annum. The majority of these men went to the war. Before they went, they had risen to the rank of captain, ""but were still receiving only £250 per annum. One of them returned with several decorations; another, who retired quite recently, had reached - the rank of lieutenantcolonel, but was still receiving only the pay of a lieutenant. Still another came back with the rank of major. I refer to Major Lynch, than whom there is no better instructional officer in Australia. The Department made him a substantive major on the staff, but he is still receiving the paltry salary of £250 a year, which he was drawing in 1912. I have brought his case before the Department, but have received no satisfaction. I make no complaint against the Minister, but I hold that the Department might fairly be exa dispected to see that proper treatment is meted out to these men. Major Lynch is to retire in September next, and in reply to an inquiry as to why he has not We received an increase under the new scale of payments, he has been told that, after bwo years' further service, he will receive an additional £ 2 5 per annum. Since he is to retire next month, however, he will not obtain any advance.

We all admit that the Postal Department is in need of a cleanthem ing up, but I do not attribute to the cials of the Department the blame for what is going on. Not only in the Postal Department, but throughout the Commonwealth Service, we are paying disought gracefully low salaries. The Chief Elecpartment trical Engineer of the Department, the inception of Federation, was paid £750 per annum. To-day he is in receipt of only £900 a year for directing the whole of the electrical services of the Commonwealth; yet the Broken Hill prietary Company pays the electrical gineer on its mine £1,000 a year.

I hope that the Government will speedily set to work to offer greater facilities to althose people who are really raising wealth for this great Commonwealth, and that it will be duly recognised that in the giving of these conveniences the people in the country are not the only ones who are benefited.

The rural community render greater serto the people in ' the centres, and, there should be a general conto pay for connecting the rural portions of the Commonwealth with the The Government made the promises referred to in the memamendment of the honourable member for Dampier, and as I wish to give them an opportunity of carrying them out, I shall by the vote for that amendment.",71
407,Mr RYAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"West Sydney) [10.29] I am sorry that the constituencies have not had an opportunity of Teally viewing now what has taken place in the House this It would be a splendid objectprelesson to them of the engineering that goes on in the House in order to save the face of the Government, and of the insincerity that actuates some of our honourable friends opposite. The honourable  has moved as an amendment, "" That the Postmaster-General be requested to provide increased postal and telephonic facilities to country districts, and to grant a drought allowance to mail contractors for the year 1920."" That is a perfectly plain and specific amendment. It is worded in the form of a request. The honourable member has been supported by speeches coming from our honourable friends opposite, some of thembelonging to the Country party. An amendment has now been moved 'by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), who belongs to the Country party, to omit all the words after "" That"" in the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Hume, with a view to inserting the words, "" This House approves of the proposals of the Postmaster-General to further liberalize the postal and telephonic facilities in country districts."" He, fore, proposes to substitute for the wordsmoved by the honourable member for Hume, words which, so far from requesting tJfe Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) to do anything, are actually an approval by members of the House of the Postmaster-General's proposals. I could quite understand that some 'honourable members, if they were so inclined, might vote against the amendment of the honourable member for Hume, if they thought that the Government was doing its duty, but I cannot understand upon what reasoning or logic a member of the Country party, above all other parties, should move an amendment actually to give the stamp of approval of the House to the proposals of the Government. I congratulate the Government, and I congratulate the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) on the success of the engineering that has taken place in the House this afternoon. I offer these congratulations in all sincerity, because he has succeeded in placing some of those who will support the honourable member for Dampier's amendment in an absolutely ridiculous position, and he will have demonstrated to the electors of Australia that those who support it and do not belong to the direct Ministerial party are dragged at the heels of the Government in the manner depicted by a cartoon published in a certain Sydney newspaper not so long ago. At an earlier hour of the day the honourable member for Dampier complained of the discourtesy of an answer given by the Prime Minister to a question which he had directed to that honourable gentleman, and I then suggested to him that he could give practical effect to his protest by moving a motion. He said he did not think that could be done. The fact was that he did not intend to do it . He did not want to do it ; but now we find that he is ready to move an amendment that will do the work of the Government better than it could be done by any honourable member sitting behind the Government.

411,Mr RYAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Well , I withdraw the suggestion that the honourable member is "" a convenient tool of the Government,"" and say that he is a convenient instrumentality of the Government, which expresses my meaning just as well. What are the proposals of the Postmaster-General that we are asked to approve? The whole phase of the proceedings in this House to-night has been completely changed; there is not now even a passive attitude on the part of some members of the Country party, b.ut a complete change to ""a vote of confidence, and we are asked to approve of everything the Government has done, and propose to do, in the Postal Department. I wish to know specifically what the proposals are we are asked to approve. So far as I understood the Postmaster-General, he referred to a decrease in the amount of the guarantee in connection with certain country telephones, and intimated that sueh a change had already heen made; but he specifically adhered, so far as I understand him, to the resolution of the Government on the question of a drought allowance. He does not intend to grant anything in the nature of a drought allowance.",72
412,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"""Who says he does not?",73
413,Mr RYAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I say that the Postmaster-General has not given any intimation that he is going to make any allowance for 1920. - Mr ""WISE - It is being made now.",73
414,Mr RYAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"In any case, the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dampier says nothing about a drought allowance, but specifically leaves it out.",73

417,Mr RYAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I do not wish that interjection withdrawn, because I take no notice of it or of the gentleman who made it . If it comes to a question of party trickery, we have had in the House to-night the best example I have seen since I came here, not only, on the one hand, of party trickery, but, on the other hand, of absolute simplicity and servility. have witnessed the party Whips running to and fro, sitting beside this and that member whose votes were considered doubtful; then there were long conferences with the Treasurer, and when the numbers were found to be against the Government, the Country party supporting the Government withdrew from the chamber to consider the position.",73
418,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Allo w meto say that there is not a tittle of truth in that statement.,73
419,Mr RYAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"We can all believe our eyes, and everything took place, not only in the presence of honourable members, but in the presence of the press. We all heard the suggestion of the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson), who was ""stone-walling""- I hope that is a parliamentary term-in order to keep the debate going until the honourable member for Dampier had put his amendment in order. It is a beautiful amendment for the Government, and I can quite understand how the right honourable the Treasurer chuckled. I admire the success of his move, because he has certainly succeeded in getting the Government instrumentality in that corner, who is the honourable member for Dampier,' to do the work of the Government ",73
420,Mr RTLET,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,We can see that the Leader of the Country party (Mr. MCWilliams) has nothing to do with it.,73
421,Mr RYAN,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I should imagine the Leader of the Country party would have nothing to do with it. With his experience as a member, whatever he might have to say with regard to voting against the amendment of the honourable member for Hume', he would certainly advise his party not to be trapped into their present unfortunate position of having to vote .for or against the amendment of the honourable member for Dampier. I do not care how those honourable members vote, it is a matter of indifference to me; but I wish to see the members of this House use the power that is undoubtedly theirs, and compel the Government to do the right thin|g in regard to the postal matters discussed.",73
422,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"We will do the right thing without compulsion. Mr Ryan.^-That power can be exercised only by casting their votes in this House. The' Treasurer has said that it We does not matter how the vote goes-that it will not affect the Government or the position-bu the onjly made that statement at a late stage of the proceedings when, no doubt, the reports of the Whips were somewhat favourable to the plan of the Government. I intend to oppose the amendment of the honourable member for Dampier. I know it is moved without any sincerity, in order to convey a wrong impression to the public, and no one knows that better than does the Treasurer. Why are we not prepared to let the people see what is 'going on? Why all this trickery ? Why these moves in order to throw dust in the eyes of the public? I am satisfied that we on this side have done good work in exposing the methods to which the Government descend in order to obtain the support of some of our honourable friends in the Government corner, who, through their inexperience, no doubt, will be induced to vote for this amendment I hope, however, that the majority of honourable members will stand by country interests, and cast a vote in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for Hume. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has not yet expressed himself on the amendment of the honourable member for Dampier, aujd we may not know where he stands until the vote is taken; but he stated plainly and unmistakedly that he was in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hume. It will be a remarkable thing, although not more remarkable than some things I have seen happen in this House, if the honourable member for Grampians and the honourable  ready to support an amendment which is the very negation of the views they expressed a few hours ago.",73
423,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"ParramattaTreasurer) [10.44] - I shall not take long, but I wish to say one or two words. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan) has for the last fifteen minutes been indulging in a piece of theatrical gasconading such as we are accustomed to see him indulge in , and all the while making clear the one fact that the ' bot1 tom has fallen o u t "" of his little scheme to-night. If one thing is clearer than another it is that fact; and no wonder he rages like the Bull of Bashan, and threshes himself and attempts to thresh others into a f u r y ; but the one thing written all over his effort is absolute and unqualified failure. That is the outstanding feature of the whole debate. I have had nothing whatever to do with it . I do not know who is going to vote with the Government, or who is not. But if I were a bettinig man, I would not mind staking a wager that when the numbers are up the Labour party will be found to be much more solid than will honourable members upon this side of the chamber. If there be anything certain in this world, that is certain. I am sure that honourable members of the Country party will appreciate all the kindly condescension which has been exhibited towards them, by the honourable member for WestSydney (Mr Ryan), who has pitied them because of their inexperience of political life. Really, they are a lot of simplelooking persons in the Corner. But may I suggest to the honourable member for West Sydney that they know quite as much about things as he does?",74
424,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,The r e are men in this Corner who will not be fooled by either of you.,74
425,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I am quite sure of that. I think my honourable friend will say that during his twenty years' experience of me I have never attempted to fool him. It is immaterial to me how he votes upon this question; but I hope that he will acquit me of any intention of endeavouring to persuade him to exercise other than an independent judgment. I am not going to lecture him as he has been lectured by the honourable member for West Sydney. I am not going to tell him that I am disposed to pity him and the other members of his party, and to look down upon them with kindly feelings. I shall not indulge in any such "" trip e . "" I shall leave that to my honourable friend opposite, who is such a past-master at the business, but who to-night has cut a very sorry figure indeed. H is trouble is not that the members of the Country party are being dragged at our heels, as he put it , but that they are not being dragged at the heels of his party. He thought that his own party were going to score tonight.  honourable gentleman do to prevent us scoring ?",74
426,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I will tell the honourable member. I will tell honourable members exactly what we have promised to-night, in order that there may be no misunderstanding about it . We have told the House plainly that we are going to extend the mail services in the interior of this country We are going to spend money more generously with a view to doing that. We have further promised-al l these things have been said before, but honourable members opposite have been so obsessed with a desire to get a political party advantage out of this debate that they did not listen to the statements which have been made-that the new services this year will be reviewed, and any exceptional case of hardship will be treated fairly. That is a distinct promise, and the honourable member for Hume (Mr . Parker Moloney) beard me make it , although he has denied it half-a-dozen times to-night.  did not hear the Postmaster-General make it.",74
427,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"It is not the oppressed mail contractor in the country that he is after, but the scalp of this Government. If he can use our mail contractors to attain his object, they will prove just as good a stick as will anything else. Anybody could see the grin which was written all over his face to-night at the turn which events had taken. Another promise which we have made is that we shall do our best to improve the telephonic services in country areas. We shall get telephones anywhere that we can get them, and if honourable members opposite know where telephone material can be obtained, I invite them to give us the information. 1 invite the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), who has said that he is an engineer, and who has made asseverations as to the qualities of steel that can be produced here, to come along with that steel, and we will try and use it in the manufacture of telephones. Does he think that we are doing what we can to prevent these services being extended to the people? Why should we? Does a Government invite adverse criticism if that criticism can be honestly avoided ? The supposition underlying all the arguments advanced by honourable members opposite is that the Government are a set of fools who court adverse criticism. I challenge the honourable member for Hindmarsh to bring along the materials of which he has spoken. He says that they are here. Let him' bring them along, and the Government, if it can use them, will buy them at a reasonable price. The Government wish to purchase materials and to install telephones. want them for my electorate, and every other honourable member wants them for his electorate. We have the money with which to purchase them, and if honourable members can furnish these materials they are acting a faithless part to this country if they do nat bring them along.",75
428,Mr MAHONY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Is it not the duty of the Postal Department to make these arrangements ?,75
429,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,What arrangements?,75
430,Mr MAHONY,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,To see that telephones are provided.,75
431,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Of course it is. It is the duty of the Government to get telephones out of the ground. Only we cannot do it. I am sure that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), and the honourable mem can do it. But we cannot do it. We shall do our best to get this telephonic material, and to see that the benefit of it is extended to the interior of this country. We shall do all that we have promised to-night as far as that is humanly possible. Do I make myself clear? OPPOSITION MEMBEBS - No .",75
432,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Then I shall content myself with making this statement to my own side of the House, the members of whom are intelligent enough to understand it.",75
433,Mr GABB,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"Angas) [10.54] - I congratulate the honourable member for Hume  submitted his amendment. During the early stage of the debate upon it , the attitude of Ministers was to turn up their noses and to say in effect, "" Do as you like."" But as the discussion proceeded, their airiness disappeared, so that I am convinced that the time that has been devoted to this matter has not been wasted. In Tegard to allowance postmasters, I do hope that a larger sum than £76,000 will be provided. There are thousands of allowance offices in Australia, and the amount I have mentioned will not go very far when it is distributed amongst so'many officials. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) spoke of the Bulls of Bashan. But whilst there may have been a roar which reminded one of the Bulls of Bashan, there was also I the shriek of the Australian parrot, and there was a bleat from the lambs over there. Like the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), I wish that the electors of Australia could hjave been here to see what was taking place in the chamber today. Since the din er - hour, the two Government Whips and another special pleader have been in company with members of the Country party, pleading with them. I have great respect for some members of the Country party, as much respect for them as for any other members of the House, but I must believe my own eyes. I saw the Government Whips and the Treasurer in company with several members of the Country party. As the evening wore on, there was a group of five country members talking together in the corner. They were pulled up, and went out, and a meeting of some kind was held outside. In fact, every member of the Country party left the chamber. Then they returned to the chamber, and one of them seems now to be inclined to reverse his attitude. Originally he supported the honourable  and now he is voting with the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), a complete change of front. When the Treasurer talked of underground engineering and political trickery, he forgot the proverb that "" those who Live in glass houses must Dot throw - stones."" On a recent occasion we, on. this side, were told that if we wished the Country party toassist us in ousting the Government, we should be less rough in our methods. Last time we attacked the Government many members on this side hit the Country party harder than I thought they need have done, but that has not happened today. We did not attack the Country party today until we saw how they had decided to go. They cannot accuse us of having driven them into the arms of the Government.",75
434,Mr JOWETT,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,Will the nonorable member allow me?,76
435,Mr GABB,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"At the present time. I am not prepared to allow the honourable member anything. I know how he spoke on the amendment of the honourable member for Hume, and if he does not support the amendment .by his vote, I shall know that my surmise in regard to the Caucus meeting of his party is correct. If , oc the contrary, he stands by what he has said, I shall think him worthy to put interjections to me in the funue, should he wish to do so. Whatever may be said about shortage of materials in excuse for the delays in providing telephone communication, that shortage has had nothing to do with the 1 reduction of the country mail services. To show how the country districts are treated, let me read a letter which I received from a constituent today. It was written from South. Australia on the 23rd of this month, and is as follows:I am writing to you for information on be- Jowpt't. K. half of the Point Pass Vigilance Association on the matter of increased postal facilities, which I hope are not all reserved for the dis- Mahonv, \V. 0. tricts of the members on the other side. liefore the advent of the train we had a daily [163] mail by road. At first we had a daily train and mail. Since the train only goes alternate days we only get a mail on those days. The most we have been able to get is that the bags go as far as Eudunda, on the other days, and we may send in for them and the papers. We suppose that-the postal authorities are keeping the telephone and telegraph revenue in mind. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Livingston), the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), and the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) seem to be thoroughly satisfied that they have been able to get from the Postal Department all that they have asked for.",76
436,Mr ATKINSON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,I did not say so.,76
437,Mr GABB,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"I have found the Deputy Postmaster-General of South Australia a gentleman to deal with, but I have not had 50 per cent, of my requests granted.",76
438,Mr ATKINSON,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,No one has said that he has got all that he asked for.,76
439,Mr GABB,EBECTION OF PUBLIC TELEGBAPH OK TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Barker said that there was only one thing more that he wanted. That is nob my experience. To send from Point Pass to Eudunda for mails and. papers means to send a distance of about seven miles. If the Country party think that that is proper treatment for our hamlets and villages, I do not agree with them, and if they keep in power the Government that is responsible for this treatment of country residents, they will find that the people who sent them here are disappointed in them.
