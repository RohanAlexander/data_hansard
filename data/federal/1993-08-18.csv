1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. MURRAY-DARLING BASIN BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Gear: That the bill be now read a second time.",11
2,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"Indi) (10.01 a.m.)......:I find it somewhat ironical to be speaking today in support of the Murray-Darling Basin Bill. The government's rhetoric about caring for Australia, encouraging incen,tive and investment and so on, which is reflected in the Murray-Darling Basin legislation, is all to no avail because of the nightmare budget the government released last night. I want to highlight the idiocy of the government's policies by talking about the Murray-Darling Basin legislation. The legislation is fully supported by the coalition because it further enhances the management systems for Australia's greatest resource, the Murray-Darling Basin. I remind honourable members briefly that this area comprises oneseventh of the continent of Australia, produces about one-half of Australia's total output from natural resource based industries, supports 25 per cent of the nation's cattle and dairy farms and about 50 per cent of its sheep, lambs and crop lands-and almost 75 per cent of it is irrigated land. Production derived is valued at some $10 billion annually-that was before the Labor budget last night. My good colleague and friend the Victorian Minister for Natural Resources, the Hon. Geoff Coleman, spoke in the Victorian parliament in support of this legislation in April 1993. It is significant that the states involved in this legislation-New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-have been able to manage their affairs so that the complementary legislation has gone through. This government was not even able to get it through in the first session after the election. I was next to speak in August when the government pulled the plug on the debate and prevented it from going on. That is another indication of the lack of sincerity or awareness-whatever way you would like to put it-of this government when this important resource management legislation that is part of a cooperative federal approach to managing a great resource is mucked up by its curtailing debate in August. I am particularly angry because one of the things I have tried to do since I have been involved in parliamentary life, in the state and now federally, is help persuade Queensland to join the Murray-Darling Basin group. As we all know the basin extends from Queensland and we cannot manage this great resource unless we have all the players involved in it. For many years Queensland has resisted attempts by all of us to get it to join in the Murray-Darling Basin arrangement. Thankfully Wayne Goss-and I give him credit-has decided after representations, perhaps helped by me when I was shadow minister for natural resources in Victoria, to bite the bullet and join. I commend him for that. .. Queensland has not been able to join and participate because the legislation has not gone through. That is one of the reasons why I am glad that this legislation has finally reached us and is going through now. There is only one way to effectively care for, manage and enhance this great resource: to get all the players around the table, working together as a team. Unfortunately this has not happened since the Murray-Darling Basin legislation was first conceived in the 1920s among the states. But now we are making good progress. I should also remind honourable members that, from Victoria's point of view, food production is one of the greatest economic activities for the state. Value added food production from our state has been helping Australia find its way and win export income, particularly in Asia and Europe. Following the Chemobyl disaster we were able-Victoria particularly and other wine producers in Australia as well-to find new markets in Europe. There is an increased awareness throughout the world that Australia produces good, clean food; in fact, Australia is regarded as the second cleanest continent in the world. Honourable members may be wondering which is the cleanest-of course, Antarctica is the cleanest. We have to keep it that way too. There are some threats there that we need to look at. We have an enormous product which we can be proud of. Australia is regarded in the rest of the world as being capable of producing clean food reliably and efficiently. Following Chernobyl we achieved a doubling of the export of bulk wine from Australia to Europe. If honourable members lived in Europe would they not want to consume Australian produced wines and food? In Asia, where diet and improved food availability is integral to the future and effectiveness of people there, Australia plays its part very well. My electorate of Indi has great wine producers. We have groups such as Uncle Tobys, Uncle Bens, Haberfield's Murray Goulburn and Kraft, which are all willing to invest huge amounts of capital. They are getting out and winning export markets and dollars for Australia and creating jobs for Australians. It is ironic that last night in the saw the very people who are getting out and taking the risk and having a go for Australia-creating real, lasting and permanent jobs-kicked in the teeth. Their reward for having a go was that their industries are going to be hit with extra taxes-wholesale sales tax and fuel tax. For country industries the tyranny of distance is one of the greatest impediments in getting our products into the marketplace, because of the extra cost of energy. Had the coalition been elected to government, we would have been able to deal with that very effectively because we were going to eliminate the fuel taxes. The stark contrast today for all of us is that we have a government that has actually increased fuel taxes on our producers. Whereas the coalition's policy was to reduce the costs of our export industries by at least $50 billion a year-five per cent overall-through the competent package of Fightback and the elimination of seven taxes, the newly elected fraudulent Labor government, elected on an absolutely massive and shameful con, within a few months of that election and the Australian people making their fateful decision, has had the temerity to increase the very taxes that the coalition said are the taxes that are stopping Australia developing and stopping our getting jobs for young people. Whilst welcoming this legislation, Mr Speaker, you will understand the mixed feelings that I have about it. Let us get down to some positives. The problem with the Murray-Darling Basin is that it has not been cared for and managed adequately. I am not on a witch-hunt. I think all Australians are responsible for that. We are more aware now of the need to do better with a great resource. Hence the reason for my welcoming the legislation that gives the states more flexibility in their management role in the Murray-Darling on a cooperative federal basis. As I mentioned before, Queensland in the group is a wonderful addition to the players around the table. But the financial commitments that are necessary to look after this resource, enhance it and make sure our productivity increases, jobs are created and clean food continues to get to the markets in Asia, Europe and America have been neglectbudget we ed and not adequately addressed. Recently, I made a private visit to America. I hope the media notes that I paid for that visit. I went to see my son who is in America as a young Australian, establishing a business and doing very well. He contrasts very much what has been happening in Australia with the opportunities over there. I was interested to learn that management of the great catchments in America is funded much more substantially by the national government. There is, of course, a partnership between the states in America, the American congress, the Senate and what they call local government. But, in a broad way, the American national policy is to provide about 60 per cent of the funding needed to manage those great catchment resources. Contrast that to the Australian approach, which in round figures is roughly 20 per cent to 25 per cent and in fact diminishing under the Labor government considering the inflation rate and the others problems that the Labor government creates. So we have a serious situation where the Commonwealth of this nation has not adequately recognised its financial responsibility to help manage this resource. The states are doing what they can, albeit inadequately in many ways when one looks at the problem of salinity and all of that, particularly in Victoria. It is an ongoing situation. While I am in this parliament, I intend to try to convince honourable members on both sides of the House that the national commitment should be greater, that we should take a leaf out of the American people's experience and put in more from a national perspective to managing and upgrading this marvellous resource. Let me give an example of one of the great problems that this government has created., Albury-Wodonga we have the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre. It is the only one we have in Australia and it is doing marveldy lous work, learning about the inland waters and their behaviour in Australia-something that we do not know enough about. The food cycle is fundamental to successful life and this centre is helping with understanding getting research to deal with the problem of algae. The funding for that centre is in jeoparia, dy and has been in jeopardy and under a cloud for more than two years. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in one of his falsehoods during the election campaign said, 'Don't worry, the shortfall will be picked up by us'. I honestly thought that the budget last night the govel'Ilrilent would provide the $300,OOO-odd shortfall which marvellous centre needs. But there was not thing in the budget. I could find no reference to it. Obviously I have not been able to see the minister, because all the ministers are locked up under siege and hiding. But I will certainly be pursuing the minister today. However, the $300,OOO-odd that is needed is to be put back on the agenda of a meeting of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial going. Council which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and state ministers will attend in Albury-Wodonga in two weeks time. The states and the federal government will discuss that Albury-Wodonga Development Corporathat tion funding at that meeting. Honourable members might say, 'Good, that is progress', but let me enlighten and tell them that the actual provision of the funds came originally from the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and were taken away by this government. So the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation ceased to provide the funds. We have now gone full circle. The corporation does not now provide the funds it used to. In December the Prime Minister said, 'Don't worry, I'll provide them'. He has not done so in the budget and now the Deputy Prime Minister has put the matter back on the agenda for the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation meeting this month. What do honourable members think of that? It is a In round robin. We all know why it is happening: they are all passing the buck. In the meantime, this marvellous centre is in jeoparand may be lost, thus jeopardising substantially the research on our inland waters. I strongly criticise the Prime Minister for failing to honour the election pledge that he gave to Australians on an important issue but and which, from our point of view, was a non-party political issue. It is a matter for Australit is a matter for good leadership and it is a matter for the Prime Minister to put right. He said he would, and now he has not. I want to record in the strongest possible terms that all Australians this morning are entitled to feel let down and disappointed that in the Prime Minister has allowed that nonsense to continue. Having spoken this way, I guess this the focus will now be on the· Albury-Woa donga Development Corporation ministerial meeting in the next week or so-and so it should be. If that meeting fails to resolve the issue and that freshwater research centre is put in further jeopardy and lost to Australia, it will be on their heads. It will have been as a result of the government having failed to find the necessary money to keep this centre It is not just me as the local member talking politics. The most eminent scientists, caring people and land managers in Australia-from CSIRO to all over the place---,all recognise this freshwater centre is an important asset to Australia which must be maintained so that its work can continue. If one wants to argue it purely on an economic basis, I have told the House about the importance of the resource of the Murray-Darling Basin. I have told the House about the marvellous productivity, the investment and jobs that it creates each year for Australia. I am getting right down to basics: we are not properly looking after the Murray-Darling, partly because we do not fully understand it. We cannot have a management plan to take that resource into the next century under our stewardship without proper research and without knowledge. I put it at that highest level for all members of thi- parliament to put pressure on the Prime Minister to at least honour one of his pledges. There must be a bit of truth in him somewhere hidde- away. It is about time he found it. It is not too late, although it is too late for many people following the disastrous budget last evening. I wish the legislation speedy passage. I hope that the minister can quickly visit the Governor General and have it proclaimed so that this negligent government can at least get on the statute books the necessary legal powers for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to get on with the job.",11
3,Mr SNOW,Unknown,"Eden-Monaro) (10.17 a.m.)The natural resources management strategy in the Murray-Darling Basin Bill is of critical importance to a whole range of areas, which most honourable members have acknowledged. Honourable members have talked about the basin covering one-seventh of Australia. Looking at a map, it goes from Omeo in Victoria, to Dalby in Queensland, across to Tambo and then down to Victor Harbour in South Australia. That is. a huge and very productive area of Australia. Honourable members. I have heard speak on this bill have acknowledged the fact that half of Australia's output from natural resource based industries is in that area, as are 2S per cent of our cattle and dairy farms, 50 per cent of our sheep, lambs and crop lands and 75 per cent of our irrigation. So the legislation is extremely important. A lot of it is involved with the commencement and the continuation of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. Clause 20 of the legislation amends section 5B of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Power Act 1949, omitting reference to the River Murray Waters Act and substituting the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993. So there is a significant involvement of the Snowy Mountains scheme in all that happens. I want to draw attention to the unforeseen effect of the Snowy Mountains scheme on the Murray-Darling Basin plan. I am perhaps the first member to be slightly negative about what has happened because east of Jindabyne, east of the Snowy Mountains scheme, there have been some very real problems. In areas like Dalgety and right along the Snowy River there is insufficient flushing of the river and the local waterways. This is to the detriment of the people in the fishing industry and also causes pollution in the river. Quite often local people in Dalgety and Orbost in Victoria have complained about the unforseen effect of the Snowy Mountains scheme. Very few errors were made at the time of the planning of the scheme, but some of the possible future problems could not be foreseen under the environmental rules that then operated. The amount of water which was then regarded as being sufficient to flush is no longer regarded as sufficient, and yet we have governments saying, 'We are sticking to the old rule. That is the rule that applied then. We are not going to change it'. I would like to speak on behalf of those communities in New South Wales and Victoria that are concerned at some of the side effects of the Snowy River. Everything else I have to say about the legislation is positive. I mention that problem because I think that it needs to be considered in relation to what happens'in the basin. Some other worries about the present situation have been somewhat exaggerated. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the federal government want to see a clean-up of major towns along the Darling River tributaries. State governments will require courage to force an increase in flow for the environmental flushes of the type I have been talking about, either by building another dam purely for those releases or ordering more releases. We could look at this sort of solution for the Snowy River as well. A lot has been written about the Murray-Darling Basin. A very negative quote in the Australian Farm Journal does not indicate what the situation is today, but what the situation could very well be in the not too distant future. In the edition of May 1993 Trevor Johnston said: The Murray-Darling Basin is now in an advanced state of pollution, degradation and decay. It carries the sewage of the slopes, the pus of the plains, the excreta of the tablelands, the mildew of the mountains, the refuse of the ranges, and the carrion of the catchment areas. It is currently like a giant malfunctioning contaminated sewage disposal unit-almost beyond repair. That article exaggerates the situation, but it seems to me that it is a timely warning of what is likely to happen if we do not take action pretty soon. Jim Della-Giacoma in the Australian of 23 September 1992 said: The level of phosphorous in laundry detergents Australia-wide should be reduced to combat outbreaks of blue-green algae in river systems, a taskforce report on the problem has recommended. The move is backed by the NSW Government and is one of a number of recommendations designed to manage further outbreaks of algae in the Murray-Darling Basin and work towards preventing the problem in the long tenn. The federal and state governments are coming to a recognition of the urgent need to take some action on what is happening in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Department of Water Resources in New South Wales has identified 16 major dams and eight country towns with old flood levies that face potential disaster due to a serious lack of funds. 1Welve New South Wales dams are menhappen downstream. tioned by Elizabeth Jurman in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 18 January 1993. She mentions Glenlyon, Pindari, Copeton, Split Rock, Keepit, Chaffey, Lostock, Glenbawn, Windamere, Burrendong, Carcoar, Wyangala, Burrinjuck....:....which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and close to the electorate of Eden-Monaro which I representrumbidgee Blowering, which is also a major dam in the Snowy Mountains scheme, and Brogo, which is in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, not from Bega. The article states: The department was unable to comply with safety requirements on the 16 State-owned dams under its control, according to its 1991-92 annual report. ""To comply with safety surveillance and maintenance protocols, which are governed by the Dams Safety Act, about $7 million should be spent on them annually,"" the report said. ""Budget constraints in recent years have made this level of expenditure virtually impossible. That is the challenge that has to be met, not only by New South Wales, but also by all the states with areas covered by the Murray-Darling Basin. We should not be without hope. Federal funding will provide $72 million over four years. An extra three years funding is available from 1994 under the natural resources management strategy. That provides hope for some very urgent action in the areas of the Murray-Darling Basin. I believe we will see average salinity drop by 20 per cent. We will see protection of some areas-particularly about 500,000 hectares which are already affected. We will see pricing changes, water transfer entitlements and some important salt interception works in Woolpunda, Mallee Cliffs and Waikerie. There will be drainage action in Shepparton, Deniliquin and the Murrumbidgee region. . The Murrumbidgee region starts in the electorate of Eden-Monaro and receives pretty careful consideration by federal, New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory governments. I - believe that consideration will result in some positive action. Those governments have had a good look at what is happening in the Murrumbidgee and what will Important action is taking place through the landcare groups throughout the Commonwealth, including those involved in the Murray-Darling Basin. I particularly congratulate some of the landcare groups in my region for the action they have taken-including the Bredbo landcare group which is on the MurOther important activities are taking place in government agencies. For instance, scienfar tists from the CSIRO are using the sewage from Forest HiIl-a small Royal Australian Air Force satellite town of 2,000 peopIe:-to grow an experimental plantation of native trees and pines. It is not likely that the sewage will ever be useful for growing hardwood trees for saw logs. The trees grow too fast and that spoils the quality of the wood. As they age and their growth slows, they use up less and less of the effluent. However, for woodchipping, eucalyptus production, tea-tree oil, tannin and firewood, the effluent plantations may well help to turn environmental problems into economic opportunities. I welcome the action that is being taken by the CSIRO which was reported by David Mussared, the science and environment reporter, in the Canberra Times on 7 January 1993. There are some very important actions taking place. One of the most welcome changes was the decision of the Queensland Government to join the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. I mention to the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) that the former Queensland National Party government would not join the commission. I welcome the statement of Ed Casey, Minister for Primary Industries in the Queensland Labor Government in a news release dated 13 May 1992. The release stated: "" . Queensland's proposed involvement would be structured around areas of the State's responsibility in the basin, issues to which it could contribute resources and expertise and projects which have a direct impact on the State. It will not work, and our outmoded federal system has meant that it has taken years. I place the blame not on any particular government but rather on the fact that our federal system has held back the sort of cooperation that it should have given years ago. However, Queensland is now in the scheme and that is extremely welcome news. I also welcome the fact that we will now have a comprehensive basin-wide nutrient management strategy. That is particularly important if we are to have a viable irrigation industry in the Murray-Darling Basin. However, we can also develop strategies outside the irrigation areas. We need a nutrient management strategy to address pollution of the river systems. The honourable member for Indi also mentioned the fact that our food is, and will be, in more demand because it is relatively pollution free. It is interesting that in Asia a number of things are happening in addition. Asian farmers are reducing their involvement in production. Some of them are leaving their farms; some of them are finding farms heavily labour intensive and less irtviting. However, with our technology and climate, and with our very clean waterways, we have some great opportunities to produce food for Asia. Asia now buys $10 billion more from Australia than we buy from Asia. A lot of people do not realise just how important the Asian market already is to Australia. All the things that we have done in the past, including giving aid to Asia, have brought about a great deal of goodwill with Asia. That has meant that we have benefited from those good relationships and we are now able to sell to Asia. I believe the next approach needs to be about food. Asians consume many millions of tonnes of seaweed. We have seaweed going to waste in Australia. Our clean waterways mean that much of the food that Asian people like consuming could be produced in Australia. The comprehensive basin-wide nutrient management strategy is extremely important. It needs to address pollution of the river system and it needs to result in more production within Australia. . We have a national resources management strategy and we have increased funding for that strategy. We have a salinity and drainage strategy. We have a nutrient strategy. The results of all those strategies hinge on the legislation we are debating. It is with great pleasure that I join with all honourable members in supporting the legislation.",14
4,Mr FORREST,Unknown,"I find it curious that, in my second speech in this House, I am standing to support a government bill when I am only the second speaker on the opposition side this morning following last night's horror budget. I find it hypocritical that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) would stand and speak glowingly about the Murray-Darling Basin when the budget that was handed down last night was clearly not in the interests of the constituents that dwell in that basin. Last night we saw dramatic increases in the cost of fuel, so that by February 1995 the cost of super fuel will rip off 36.2c per litre from the rural constituents in the Murray-Darling Basin. We also saw a small change to the age of eligibility for Austudy-from 16 to 17. That will seriously erode the ability of rural families to educate their children through their VCE because the situation is so critical in rural Australia that people have become dependent on the facility of Austudy to educate their children. It is then with some misgiving that I stand here and support a bill drafted by the government. Whilst I support any initiatives to improve the condition of the Murray-Darling Basin, I want it noted as a matter of public record that I am horrified by the budget that was announced last night. My constituents in the electorate of Mallee, contrary to what the honourable member for Eden-Monaro stated, are without hope. The switchboard in my electorate office was jammed this morning by people, representing industry organisations through to families in desperate strife, expressing their bitter disaptices. pointment with the budget because of the deliberate impact it will have on rural Australmany is. To be positive, some constructive things have taken place in the Murray-Darling Basin over the last 15 years. As someone who has participated in the debate, I am pleased to be able to stand in this House and see legislation which finally includes Queensland in accordance with the Murray waters agreement. One of my constituents, Mr Jack Larkinwhose efforts in respect of salinity and community were rewarded with an Order of Australia some years ago-would be pleased to see this legislation being put in place. Along with many of the issues confronting our nation, other speakers have drawn to the attention of the House the crisis that confronts the Murray-Darling Basin, both in respect of the problem of salinity and the ever-increasing problem of blue-green algae that is freely feeding from the nutrient loads from all over the basin. The Murray-Darling Basin deserves our ever-increasing support when we take into account that its earning capacity and contribution to the nation's wealth is of the order of at least $10 billion per annum. It certainly deserves far better consideration than it received last night. I have some comments to make in respect of what needs to be done. Like most massive problems confronting our nation, we have made some small progress but we are still confronted with a massive problem in resolving its difficulties. The salinity strategy that the legislation endorses is only a short-term strategy-it only takes us one decade into the new century-when the need for a long-term strategy, particularly for the disposal of saline effluent from the Murray-Darling Basin, is critical. Salt, and its insidious erosion of the quality of the land to produce, has been a major issue in the basin for the last 30 or 40 years, and it has been directly contributed to by a rise in the water table. In some areas of the basin, in the short space of the last 15 years, the water table has increased by 15 to 20 metres. That is a dramatic increase created by bad pracI am not here to lay blame, but with the impetus and drive to create a nation we made mistakes about the way we used the water in the Murray-Darling Basin. There is no doubt about that but we now have an opportunity to correct those mistakes. In May 1990, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission instigated a report by professional consultants, looking into the issue of the disposal of saline effluent created when the high water table is lowered by pumping. Unfortunately, that report indicated that a major engineering fix, involving a pipeline to the sea, was not economically sustainable. I have expressed some concern about the need for the commission to review that opinion. The report also states that the cost of salinity across the Murray-Darling Basin is only $43 million per annum. What it does not say is that that cost does not include the enormous damage that high water tables do to the infrastructure of the road networks, nor does it take into account the enonnous cost of degradation to the environment. I speak specifically of a particular area in the basin which is part of the electorate of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the Kerang Lakes district, 'which is volatile and environmentally sensitive, boasting freshwater lakes with world heritage listing. These lakes have suffered drama.tically in the last 25 years in respect of salt content and blue-green algae and nutrient content. The concept of Queensland participating in the agreement is an enonnous step in terins of progress, and we must acknowledge that; but the fact still remains that the largest population centre in the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin-that is, the ACT and Canberrastill does not participate in the agreement. I think the ACT's participation is a must and it is something that needs to be considered for the future. I have spoken before about the contribution made by nutrient that emanates from this area and finds its way into the Murray River system. In August this year the commission instigated the first draft of its algal management strategy. I draw the attention of the House to this report, which says that the commission calls upon the community of the Murray-Darling Basin to accept the ownership of the problem of nutrient effluent and to accept responsibility for actions consistent with basin-wide resolutions to the problems. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, speaking on behalf not only of my constituents-bearing in mind that my electorate is entirely contained within the Murray-Darling Basin-but of the community, that the community· is prepared to accept responsibility. The blame for the excess loads of nutrient in the river system cannot be targeted to one specific area. We have got contributions from urban run-off and from sewage treatment. We have an enonnous contribution from feedlot activity right throughout the basin, particularly from Queensland with the discharge of enormous loads of phosphorus and nitrates into the upper reaches of the Darling. In my electorate there is the infamous Barr Creek, which has established a reputation for contributing salt to the river. It now has 13 times the average phosphorus load of streams in Australia-two milligrams per litre of phosphorus. Unfortunately, that is finding its way into our river system. With agricultura.l run-off, there is not one member of our community who should not accept responsibility for the nutrient load that finds its way into our river system. I believe this is the greatest challenge that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission faces in resolving this problem. I refer again to the report. As well as asking the community to accept responsibility, it says this about action required of the Commonwealth Government: help promote an intergovernmental framework for improved river catchment management facilitate links with national research effort I refer to the comments made by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Liebennan) in respect of the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre at Albury-Wodonga. In addition to that centre, there is now a call to establish an additional campus with that particular activity in the Sunraysia area at the junction of the Darling and Murray rivers. I call upon this government not to consider just the needs-as the honourable member for Indi has called for-of the current facility at Albury, but to consider augmenting its activity further down the river system. The junction of the Murray and the Darling is a strategic location. The particular problems at that reach of the river are different from those of the upstream reaches. In the upper reaches of the basin the issues pertain to soil and bank erosion and to the management of rivers and streams in a much more rugged terrain, whereas downstream the issues are much different: the water is retained in tranquil and natural lakes; it is a wann environment; and it is a perfect environment to foster the growth of blue-green algae. It is important that the activities that are undertaken in respect of research and further understanding this difficult problem of nutrient and the way in which it encourages bluegreen algae to grow should be where the problem takes place. A local laboratory based in Sunraysia at the junction of the Murray and Darling rivers is consistent with the recommendations of the Industry Commission report on water resources and waste water disposal published in July 1992. I challenge the government to give consideration not just to the funding commitment to the existing facility but to extending that facility and to approve its work further down the reaches of the river. The bill requires the ministerial council appoint community advisory committeesso-called CACs. These are in existence and have been operating, but I have some concerns about them being effective community consultative bodies. I would like consideration to be given to the existing organisation, the Murray Darling Association Inc., formerly known as the Murray Valley League, which has a constituency member base from local governments right across the basin. It, is extending its membership progressively up the Darling River system. It hopes eventually to represent Queensland as well, now that Queensland is part of the agreement. It is a credible, properly incorporated association. It meets regularly in regional centres. It has an annual conference which, incidentally, will be held in Wentworth this Friday. I believe that the activities of the community consultative committees would be much improved if a deliberate effort were made to ensure that the Murray Darling Association was represented on those consultative committees. Those brief comments were designed to be constructive and not critical, because I am in support of this legislation. I am very pleased to see it finally being passed through this House and to see Queensland participating and sharing responsibility for downstream users of water that emanates from its part of the catchment, which constitutes 25 per cent of the total basin in area and 10 per cent of the water. I am also pleased about the consideration being given to diverting additional water via the Clarence River and the Bradford scheme. Whilst I would support that as a resource development that this nation badly needs, we must not do that without attempting to correct the mistakes we have made before in resolving the enormous drainage problems associated with the Murray-Darling Basin. The powers above created the Murray and the Darling river system to drain the surface run-off to the sea. Particularly in respect of the Murray, we have now made it a freshwater carrier but have not provided the mechanism to direct those drainage effluents to the sea. That has created two problems for us. One is the accumulation of salt within the region itself. The other is the accumulation of to nutrient which has provided to the natural blue-green algae-it is not new to Australia but has been present in our water system-a free feed. We need to see greater progress in terms of where this legislation takes us in the future. I am pleased to support it with those cautionary comments.",16
5,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"In supporting the Murray-Darling Basin Bill I recognise that the Murray-Darling Basin is very important to the whole of Australia. It is an area with which I have some affinity. I grew up on the banks of the Murray and for many years, when I lived in Adelaide, I drank Murray water, which is an experience to behold. I want to take up a point from the second reading speech of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) when he said that the Murray-Darling Basin produces about one-half of Australia's total output from natural resources. Important though the Murray-Darling is, it is not that important and that figure is grossly exaggerated. If he had said that it produces about 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural resources he would have been pretty right, but quite clearly the figures are wrong in the forms they are in now. I think last year Western Australia produced something like $12.4 billion net foreign earnings, primarily from minerals. I continue to note that in Western Australia there were five independent minerals which were each worth more to the state than wool and wheat combined. I think that shows how important the mineral industry is and how it is so wrong of governments of any persuasion to ignore the tremendous contribution that it makes at the moment. However, of course, the mineral industry does not produce jobs, and that will be the subject of further comment from me. One of the things that we must face up to is the economic viability of the whole Murray-Darling system. If it is not economically viable for producers there, the environ110 ment of the river is going to inevitably suffer and get to a stage where it may be beyond repair. So it is important to look at what we can do to make life economically viable on the Murray. It seems to me that here we are often shooting ourselves ,in the foot. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission is doing a very good job-and I notice in the budget that the government has allocated another $26 million over three years, which is commendable-but, at the same time, other government departments are frustrating developments, and I refer particularly to AQIS .. We hear a lot of hyperbole from governments and from opposition members about the importance of Asia. We are told that Asia must be the target for Australia's economic development. This, like so many other 'facts' one gets these days, is simply not true. That is not to understate the importan-e of Asiaof course it is very important-but it is much more important to see the world as a market. One of the honourable members speaking today mentioned that we had sold another $10 billion worth of produce to Asia. This is mainly raw materials. Asia wants raw materials from us. It does not want value-added goods. In fact, it puts tariffs on our processed goods and sometimes it puts border barriers on them. So, despite the fact that Asia is taking more, it is not doing a lot to create jobs in Australia and I think that is something we have to look at. It is also extremely foolish-and I would say ideologically hidebound-when people talk about breaking our ties with the old Europe. Of course, what they really mean is sticking one up the Poms. The fact is that Europe is a very large potential market for our produce. Europe is out of season with Australia and there is absolutely no Common Market embargo to the entry of Australian horticultural produce into Europe. In Britain, they have a fond memory of good quality Australian produce. They have a fond memory of Australia and they like Australians. They are looking for our produce because they believe-I think rightly so-that we use fewer insecticides and that our foods are therefore more wholesome and pure than any they are able to get anywhere else. REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, 18 August 1993 If one takes the market for table grapes alone, the world's largest market is the United Kingdom. It imports about $1 billion a year in table grapes and it would take Australia five years to gear up to supply. that market. There was a case a few years ago where a couple of enterprising people, from the area of Mildura, went to Europe to look at this market. They ascertained that the British market was very sophisticated; the British people knew exactly what they wanted, which was a soft-skinned, sweet, seedless, green grape-which is actually the definition of a sultana grape. They came back to Australia, packed up three container loads, and, despite a lot of messing around by AQIS, managed to get their grapes to the London market within three months-grapes, fortunately, travel very well-and they got world record prices; I think it was $5.10 a kilo. They came back to Australia with bulging order books for table grapes. The response of AQIS was to put a ban on the export of table grapes-I might sayan illegal ban, which lasted for 12 months-and, as I have mentioned before, I have never had a satisfactory explanation for this piece of economic sabotage by AQIS. I believe I have a reasonably good understanding of why it did so, but it has never been brought to account for it. Here was a case of a government department sabotaging a viable industry while another government department was attempting to correct things. I do think that we have to make sure that we work together when we are attempting to deal with something as important as the Murray-Darling Basin. I was told yesterday that at Cowana Bend, which is across the river from Mildura, there is an irrigation pipeline large enough to service the 287 growers in the area, over 60 per cent of whom still use trickle furrow irrigation. It would seem to me to make a lot more sense to use some of the capital costs involved there to encourage people to move to trickle irrigation. There is no doubt that trickle irrigation is much more effective. It also tends to stop the water draining into the aquifer beneath, and it appears that the salt water problem in the Murray-Darling is very much caused by the raising of the very salty underground aquifer. So,if we are going to spend this money on these resources we should be making sure that we are doing it in technically the best possible way to get the results that we want to get. Here it seems that we are missing an opportunity. On the Victorian side, I understand there a very massive drainage program in hand. I ?m not convinced that that drainage program IS connected to adequate telemetric measuring devices so that we can get constant feedback on what is happening in order to take action now instead of having to wait 10 years to see what is actually happening. I think that is probably an oversight. For a small additional cost, we could have instant feedback on effects on that area. I have not had a chance to check this out this morning, but I did have some - onflicting evidence to say that in fact measuring devices are there. If that is so are certainly not, by and large conn'ected telemetrically, so we do not get the instant feedback that we normally would have. I have been interested in some of the comments of the people here. There has been a lot of talk about blue-green algae. There is no doubt that it has been a problem in the Murray in recent years and there is no doubt that fe-ding the algae with the high phosphate and nitrates that have been going into the river has helped that. But it has also bloomed because of the very slow flow rate of the Murray. Because we have had drought in the area, there has not been much of a flow rate and that has allowed the blue-green algae to flourish. We should not get the problem out of context or enlarge it beyond necessary. However, it is something that does have to be attacked and I believe that we should be moving very quickly to ensure that there is simply no effluent water flowing into the Murray. The effluent water, in· my view, is too valuable to allow that to happen and we should be insisting that every town on the Murray treat its sewage to generate growth of some sort along the Murray. That is going to require financial assistance from the government. The taxpayers of the whole of Australia should be prepared to deal with this problem because this is a problem that affects so much of Australia. A-ter all, the taxpayers of my electorate are being asked to fund solutions to the lead problems of Sydney which, of course, are due very largely to those trendies who are renovating houses in the old areas of Sydney. It appears that nothing is wrong with asking is people in my electorate to fund the indulgence of the people of Sydney. It is much more important that the people of Australia should fund the estaplishment of sewerage projects along the Darling and the Murray and all their tributaries to make sure that no untre-ted effluent reaches the Murray at all. That IS a financial cost which, in my view, - ould be reasonable and could easily be met m a very short space of time. I also believe that using those resources would potentially lessen the demand on some of our other resources. The honourable member for·Edenthey Monaro (Mr Snow) mentioned the suitability of timber grown in this way for pulp. We could, perhaps, develop secondary industries in that area which could create much needed employment. I was rather bemused by the contribution of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chyn?weth), who is a friend and an adversary of mme. I am highly suspicious of his involvement with Greenpeace-one of the organisations which I think could best be described as environmental thugs. Those people involved in Greenpeace certainly have been prepared to sacrifice the environment for their own short-term gains, and they have been quite prepared to lie about it on numerous occasions. I was surprised to find him supportin.g the concept of big irrigation projects m Australia. I think irrigation is fraught with potential dangers. Examples that we have lead us to believe that irrigation has to be managed very carefully. It is all right for Dr Bradfield, an eminent engineer involved in the Sydney Harbour Bridge-a very successful bridge-to pursue his dream of ma-g the deserts bloom, but I suggest that he did not have any environmental training' h- did n-t realise what he was actually tampenng With. There are plenty of areas in Australia in which irrigation is readily available for tropical agriculture. I think that the flood plains of the Fitzroy Valley would be much more suitable than those arid inland areas of Australia simply because the drainage is much more assured. The Ord River scheme caused a massive flow of water, and those problems would be far less likely to occur in areas like the Fitzroy Valley. People are inclined to talk about the Snowy Mountains scheme as a great success. I would say that environmentally it has been less than a great success because there is no doubt that that controlling of the flow of the Murray has had consequences. While it has stopped the havoc of floods, it has certainly produced the problem of blue-green algae because it allowed irrigation to take place and that led to rising ground water. I admit, and I agree, that the Murray-Darling is now such a productive area that we have to look after it and we have to engineer out those problems. Suffice it to say, if we were going to look at developing the Snowy Mountains scheme today, as much power would be generated by covering half of one of the big holding dams with solar cells as would be generated from the present system-without the attending environmental risks. We have to be very careful about the . effects of irrigation. While I am certainly anti-irrigation, I think we have to look at it closely and subject every irrigation project the greatest scrutiny. I want to touch on a couple of other things that are important. There has been some very wide-ranging debate here and I commend the tolerance of the chair in allowing it-and I expect that tolerance to continue. People might say that making reference to Mabo is drawing a very long bow. I think not. If it were to pass that Aboriginals on the Murray were to win substantial Mabo claims, and because what grows on the land belongs to the person who owns the title to the land I would say that management would becom- a greater problem. There is no doubt, and a lot of people in industry know it-particularly the rapacious elements of industry-that they could get concessions from those native title groups which they could never get from government. They could fell ti-ber at rates which governments would never agree to, and danger lies there. I think this comes a lot from the myth that we have spread in Australia, the politically correct view, on Aboriginal use of the land. We ·are told of and regaled with constant stories about how Aboriginals loved and cared for the land. The reality is actually somewhat different. The truth is that Australia is a vast country, and it had a very small population. That meant relatively little damage was done to the land. They did not have the technological capacity to do much damage. But, if one looks back far enough in history, one sees a complete change in Australia since Aboriginal habitation. For example inland areas used to be covered very largely with trees. One particular tree, which used to be widely spread, is now confined to Tanami Downs-a station on the corner of the Western Australian and Northern Territory border which, incidentally, used to be called Mongrel Downs until they wanted to sell it; I thought that was an innovative piece of marketing. It is very tolerant to salt, which has always occurred in the hinterland of Australia, and very tolerant to drought, but it cOlild not stand constant recurring fire. As the Aboriginals not changed the nature of the land with their fire burning practices, they established a hinterto land very largely of open grass plains. That was an enormous change in the whole plant life of Australia-a change never equalled by anything that the white settlers have done. I think people ought to·think about that matter. That has been coupled with the myth that the Aboriginal people were a peaceful race. When one actually starts to delve into it, one finds that tribal fighting amongst Aboriginals was intense. They often suffered casualties of 20 to 25 per cent. These were casualty rates which European armies would never face, and never did face. While it is true that the total losses in Europe were greater because the armies were so much bigger, in terms of percentage casualties the Aboriginal conflicts amongst themselves were far more intense. I think that adds to the lie of what is peddled these days about the peaceful nature of Aboriginal society, because peaceful it certainly was not. That was a very wide divergence from this debate. I thank you very much for your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do want to return to economic viability. If we do not have economic viability, nothing will happen in the long run. It must be economically viable for people to be out in those areas producing the goods that we need. We still· have ongoing problems with the wool industry, and I think the Garnaut document properly addresses them. It is my view that Mr Garnaut's Australian and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy was one of the most damaging reports ever written. When I read. it I thought it was fairly trivial and I put it It has been used as a bible by many people. The basis of the report is that Australia's future is tied to the coat-tails of north-east Asia. I totally rvject that philosophy. I think it is a very damaging philosophy and one which will do untold damage to Austra-is in so many ways if it is not countered. It must be said over and over again that Australia is not part of Asia, and our destiny lies as an honest trader with the world. It probably lies, more importantly, in our much higher level of self-sufficiency which will require import replacement manufacturing to be established in Australia. That has to be said over and over again until it gets into the heads of leaders of this nation. I tum to horticulture. The Australian National Line has inherited technology from the CSIRO which it has further developed in the form of smart packaging. It has developed various plastic films that keep certain gases the atmosphere to inhibit the ripening of fruit. I have heard evidence on a committee that horticulturists are able to ship cut flowers to Japan and still put them on the market after 30 days. I would have thought that that was absolutely unheard of. It proves how effective this packaging material is. This means that Europe is now open to us by ship. We can send goods to Europe by ship, and take advantage of the relatively lower freight rates and the greater reliability and quantity of supply. We can attack that rich European market.

6,Mrs GALLUS,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) (11.10 a.m.)The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) goes along his own individual path as he always does, but I do not think I can commence talking about the Murray-Darling Basin today without first objecting to the honourable member's reference to Greenpeace as 'environmental thugs'. I find the whole description rather distasteful. If the honourable member's comments on Aborigines are his idea of reconciliation with the Aboriginal people perhaps we should both get together and have a look at the definition of 're conciliation' . The Murray-Darling Basin Bill 1993 is an important bill in that it further extends the aside. recognition that states which share in a common resource must share in the cooperative management of that resource. In that it includes a salinity and a drainage strategy and provides for a new system of water allocation, the bill is a recognition that the Murray-Darling has serious environmental problems. The Murray-Darling has been referred to as Australia's greatest environmental tragedy. With competition from other environmental problems-for instance, the destruction of Australia's plants and wildlife by exotic animals and plants-lam not sure that this is quite correct. However, what is certain is that the economic cost in the Murray-Darling region has been horrendous. Water is a key resource, and Australia is one of the few lucky countries in the world that do not have to share its major rivers with other countries. This gives us an extraordinary .in advantage. For example, we could compare our situation with that of the people in the Middle East and North Africa, 50 per cent of whom depend on water that originates in another sovereign state. As the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) so rightly said in this debate yesterday, water is a key political issue. In recent years, allocation of water from the Euphrates between Syria and Iraq has threatened to trigger a war and, because of the action of upstream countries, Jordan now gets only 20 per cent of its water needs from the Yarmuk River.",23
7,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,Are you talking about the Israelis?,23
8,Mrs GALLUS,Unknown,"Perhaps if the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would like to get into a little debate about the Middle East we could do it at a later time and not in the middle of a speech on the Murray-Darling. As a consequence, Jordan is consuming ground water 1112 times faster than it can be replenished. Worldwide, the sharing of water is a key economic, political and environmental issue. In Australia the problems of the Murray-Darling river system stem not from the diversion and pollution of our rivers by another country, but from the way we have used that river system and its adjoining land without regard to its environmental health and from the failure of our states to work together for the benefit of the country as a whole. The fourth longest river system in the world, including 20 major rivers, taking up one-seventh of Australia and supplying three-quarters of the water used in Australia, the Murray-Darling river system is the lifeblood of eastern Australia. The basin itself, the most important agricultural region in Australia, is responsible for a large proportion of our wool, wheat, sheep, cattle, dairy products, wine, fruit and vegetables, as the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has previously pointed out to this House. The total value of production in the basin is estimated at $10 billion to $12 billion annually. The Murray-Darling Basin, which covers 1112 million hectares, is not only an agricultuwith ral and urban area. There are 140 reserves in the basin: its significant natural heritage include the Coorong, the Murray Gorge, the Grampians, the Mallee, Barmah, Millewa Forest, Willandra Lakes, the Australian Alps, the Warrumbungles, the Pilga, the Macquarie Marshes and the Bunya Mountains. In an effort to share the resources of the Murray-Darling, the first River Murray agreement came into being in 1914 and since then successive agreements have sought to allocate the resources of this river. Although improved resource management occurred with each revision of the agreement, successive revisions were unable to solve the growing problems of the Murray River; frequently because of self-interest of the states. The Murray-Darling Basin agreement came into force on 1 January 1988, broadening the concerns about the Murray-Darling Basin and the resources within that basin. A major flaw in this agreement was that, upstream from many of the problems, Queensland-which has 20 per cent of the basin-had declined to be a party to the new agreement. Since then there has been a change in attitude and this bill allows Queensland to become a signatory to the agreement. Eastern Australia is dependent on the Murray-Darling Basin, and previous speakers have commented on its contribution to the economy of Australia. But economics cannot be separated from the environment, as the deterioration of the health of the basin through violation of environmental principles has indicated. Environmental concerns at one point in time too often become the economic concerns of a subsequent time. A history of environmental neglect, poor farming practice, a lack of knowledge and a disregard for river ecology have created the economic and environmental problems we are facing today. The wholesale clearing of forests and their replacement by shallowrooted crops and pastures has, together with large scale irrigation, caused ground water to rise dramatically-200 millimetres per year in some areas. By bringing salt to the surface, the rising ground water has left sections of the basin salt infested soil. In some areas, the problem is so acute that the land is no longer areas able to support crops or pastures. Overall, salinity has reduced agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin by an estimated $40 million a year. As the aquifers have filled up, ground water has flowed into the rivers, with some creeks becoming little more than salt drains. The problem has been exacerbated by the damming of the rivers' water flow. Damming of rivers, although bringing benefits and providing water where there was none, affects the ecology of the river system and, unless there is an effort to mitigate some of the negative effects of this, other problems will inevitably follow. The four major dams in the Murray-Darling river system and the numerous smaller ones have diverted so much water that it is estimated that two-thirds of what would have originally flowed to the sea is now used upstream. Damming of a river reduces water flow which leads to a· whole host of other problemsmost notably in the case of the Murray-Darling, blue-green algae. As the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has already said, there has always been blue-green algae in the river system. In earlier times, the flow of the river and its inherent health kept the algae under check. The reduced flow has meant that there has been less water to dilute the nutrients the algae feed on. This has been a contributing factor to the massive outbreaks of the algae that we have seen recently. Dams on the Murray-Darling have also reduced flooding, which is one of the natural repair mechanisms of a river. Floods lJ10ve sediments and nutrients into long-term stores, disperse the next generation of animals and plants, and provide nutrients for billabongs and wetlands. The reduction of floods has led to the death of thousands of red gums which are dependent on the flooding of the river. I might add that in other areas red gums are dying from too much water which has been diverted to the irrigation areas. Reduced flooding affects the reproduction and growth of fish and the bird life that feed on the flood plains. Without flooding, billabongs dry out before fish have a chance to restock the rivers. The structure of dams themselves can also cause problems. Weirs back up water for long distances, changing shallow pools to large lakes with differing ecological processes. The structures block the passage of native fish, and fish ladders have proved inadequate. The 1980s were a key time for the Murray-Darling. It was at the beginning of the decade that the Murray River failed to flow through to the sea for the first time. During the decade, the problem of salinity became critical and at the end of the decade blue-green algae threatened the health of aquatic and terrestrial animals, including humans. Outbreaks of blue-green algae are result of the eutrophication of the river system. The river becomes over-rich with the nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, which enter the river system through human sewage and overfertilisation. Some of the effluent comes from Canberra. Historically, in Australia the sea and the waterways as conduits have been regarded as a dumping ground for human sewage. As a result, we have degraded parts of our coast, most notoriously Bondi Beach, and we have caused even greater harm to our rivers: While serving on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environthat ment, Recreation and the Arts, I remember a visit to a coastal town where the council said that it had no problems putting sewage into the local river because the river itself was so polluted when it reached its town that the sewage it added was going to make absolutely no difference at all. Another sewage problem has been brought to my attention by irate South Australians which arises when houseboats are taken on the river. They find that within South Australia they have to empty the effluent from their boats into special discharge stations. However, once they pass the South Australian border there are very few such stations and houseboats further up the river discharge their sewage waste straight from the boats into the river. One can understand why South Australians get upset about this matter, as they are downstream from all of this activity. This dumping of sewage by houseboats and the lack of these types of emptying stations further up the river is an issue that I hope will be addressed by the commission in its efforts to develop a river boat strategy. The bill that is before us today recognises the inter-relationship between land and wat-r. Indeed, the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin have not been caused. solely by a disregard for water ecology. Water and wind erosion have damaged crop and pastoral land, while overstocking and cultivation of unsuitable soils have added to the problems of the area. a In saying this I do not want to cast any aspersions on the farmers in the area because, as the honourable member for Gwydir has pointed out, it is farmers who are the best land care managers. Although mistakes have been made in the past, more often than not they have been made on the advice of so called agricultural experts sent by the government. Introduced species of plants and animals have caused further degradation. Rabbits, foxes and feral cats,not to mention feral pigs and goats, are a major environmental problem in Australia and their eradication must be addressed as a matter of urgency. The degradation of the Murray-Darling has led not only to massive agricultural problems, with their obvious economic consequences, but also to a significant loss of biodiversity in both fauna and flora. Ten plant species native to the basin are now extinct; 37 species are endangered. 1\venty species of small mammals are extinct, as are 16 species of bird and six species of reptiles. That is an absolute disgrace. We really must lower our heads in shame when we hear figures like that with regard to what we have done to our natural biodiversity. The land in the Murray-Darling Basin has suffered environmentally and, as a consequence, economically. Bad environmental decisions have turned out to be bad economic decisions. The two, as always, are inextricably linked. Decisions which harm the environment have a habit of coming back to haunt us with high economic costs. Unlike many catchment areas in the rest of the world, the Murray-Darling Basin is not irreparably damaged. The basin is confined to one country. We are aware of the problems and we are rich enough-well, almost rich enough; if this government left office a little more quickly we might be a little richer-to solve them. Unfortunately, in Australia, we have a history of short-term solutions and the present solution to the salinity problem of constructing channels and sub-surface drains to intercept ground water before it reaches the surface only buys time. Worse, it is treating the symptom rather than the cause. More hopeful is the move to reforest aquifer recharge areas and change irrigation practices. The replacing of overhead irrigation by drip irrigation will cut down the salinity caused by evaporation, and stopping flood irrigation of ground water recharge areas and ground prone to waterlogging will help reduce further problems. At this point I must raise concerns that have been expressed over the allocation of water credits. Both the ACF and the Murray Darling Association have expressed concerns to me that, as a consequence of this system, the credits saved from a good wet season would be used to the detriment of the health of the river in subsequent dry seasons. As a consequence of this, I approached the commission, which has assured me that this will not occur because the water credits apply only to the water that is held in the weirs. Both New South Wales and Victoria may save their water allocation for another year but because of the minimum level required to be left in the weirs this would not cause problems in dry seasons. However, this does not entirely remove my concerns. What would happen, for instance, if in a good year both New South Wales and Victoria save some of their allocations, then in subsequent dry years they use this credit allocation to take their weir levels down to a minimum? This would not matter if a good season immediately followed, but if there were a series of low rainfall years, the dropping of the weir to the minimum. of the first year could create enormous problems for subsequent years. Perhaps the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) could reassure us that there is no danger of this occurring, because that certainly did come out of the second reading speech. If it did occur, of course, South Australia would be the loser., A positive initiative for the health of the river was included in the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the environment last year, followed by a media release by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). The press release indicated that $30 million would be allocated to address major point sources of pollution and nutrients in town sewage works along the Murray-Darling. Such an injection of funds is desperately needed, as 10 townS and cities have been identified as being responsible for 90 per cent of the phosphate in the Darling River. A reduction in sewage should decrease the problem of blue-green algae in the river. I will be looking at the budget papers with interest to detennine whether these funds have been allocated for this purpose. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the important principle that this bill illustrates, which is that the economic health of the Murray-Darling Basin is dependent on the environmental health of the Murray-Darling Basin. In this, the Murray-Darling Basin is not unique. If we ignore the environmental consequences of economic decisions, the inevitable result will be a loss of income as the degraded environment imposes costs at a future time and returns reduced economic benefits.",23
9,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"Melbourne) (11.26 a.m.)The Murray-Darling Basin Bill 1993 is intended to implement the revised Murray-Darling Basin Agreement between the Commonwealth and the states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to provide for improved management of the land and water resources associated with the Murray-Darling Basin. It is a region that has been previously described by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) as Australia's agricultural heartland. If we look at the statistics we will see why that is so. Roughly half the nation's sheep, a quarter of cattle fanns and half the agricultural land in this nation are within the Murray-Darling Basin, which covers most of New South Wales, the northern half of Victoria, approximately, and significant parts of South Australgives is and Queensland. In 1985, four governments-three state governments and the federal government; all Labor governments at that stage-agreed to a new cooperative approach. IIi 1987 a new agreement was legislated which established a ministerial council, upgraded the River Murray Commission into the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and established a community advisory committee. Since then we have seen important initiatives added to this process, which of course dates back as far as 1914, such as the salinity and drainage strategy and the natural resources management strategy. These newer strategies have fonned the foundations of the government's approach to working with the community to tackle issues such as salinisation, conservation of native species and water quality management. In recent times, as has been referred to by previous speakers, the urgency of dealing with many of these issues has been accelerated because of problems such as the proliferation of toxic algal blooms, particularly last summer, and these have presented a new challenge to the government's and the community'S ability to manage this vital river system. This bill provides for various improvements to the framework that, as I indicated, has been in place for some time to allow for cooperative management of the river system. These include the incorporation of the salinity and drainage strategy into the agreement; a new continuous accounting system for water allocation, which should, in theory at least, provide for optimal use amongst the many users of the water system; provision for access by the Queensland government to the agreement; and the ability for the commission to carry over funds from one year to the next for certain specified purposes. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech stated: This will allow the commission to apply its financial resources more flexibly in responding to changing circumstances and needs. I would like to make several broad observations on the bill and the issues to which it rise. I believe it is a very positive measure that the bill provides for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to carry over funds allocated for specific purposes from one financial year to the next. This is provided for in clause 75(1) of the agreement. One of the great weaknesses of our government, our bureaucracy and our year to year financial accounting approach is that for many years we have had the problem of the June spending flurry in order to ensure that any given section of the public sector spends its allocation for that financial year to enable a proper bid .to be made for its next financial year allocation. Clearly, the very worthwhile change that the government is initiating of moving the budget process forward to June is one important step towards tackling this weakness, but I believe it is critical that we build greater flexibility into the ability of public sector agencies to handle public money and to be able to do things under certain restrictions-such as carrying over funds from one year to the next-and to be allowed to manage their finances in a more flexible way. This problem of government bodies-it goes right into all sorts of areas such as semi-government, academia and various other areas-rushing to spend money in order to preserve bureaucratic empires is long overdue to be tackled. It is worth observing that this problem is in fact being tackled at many levels of government in the United States, of all places. I recommend to honourable members a recent book entitled Reinventing Government by Ted Gaebler and David Osborne. Although the book is a bit flaky at times, it has many good examples of initiatives being taken by governments, including at the local level in the United States, to get around some of the bureaucratic structural problems that generate inefficiencies in the public sector and ultimately lead to a poorer return for the tax dollar of the ordinary taxpayer. Although it probably could be seen as a small initiative and maybe not worthy of too much comment, it is pleasing that this degree of flexibility is being inserted into the commission's ability to handle its own finances. My second observation relates to some of the references of previous speakers, particularly those of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I found his reference to Greenpeace unfortunate and, indeed, offensive .. I find myself in the position of endorsing the response of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) to the comments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I also find his comments about the lead in petrol problem being caused by the inner suburban trendies of Sydney a fairly remarkable statement. I would be interested to hear the justification for that. I come from an electorate where the problem of high lead levels in children, particularly working-class children living close to freeways, was identified very early. It was one of the first areas this nation where the problem was really taken up by local community health centres. Some of the results of statistical analyses were quite alarming. I certainly applaud the initiative by the government to tackle the problem of lead in petrol. More could be done to ensure that low income earners are not unjustifiably burdened with the cost of paying for this initiative but, nonetheless, it is a very important initiative and I applaud the fact that the government has taken it. I find the comments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie a little strange. I point out to him and other members of the House that, in certain .circumstances and situations, parts of our community effectively subsidise other parts. But it is a two-way street. People in rural Australia have many services subsidised by constituents in electorates like mine-such as electricity, gas, phones and the postal service. That is as it should be. Part of us being effectively a single nation is that people have access to basic rights and basic services in a reasonably uniform way. Although we can take an issue, analyse it and say, 'This group of people is effectively paying for that group of people' in isolation, if we look across the board at a whole variety of services, we will find that there is a flow in many directions from many groups in the community. We can argue about the details of flows, but to suggest in isolation that one particular initiative which is very important for the health of very large numbers of children in this community will be paid for by another group in the community is not the correct way to look at it. It tends to reflect an attitude that is widespread in politics in this country; that is, for people who represent particular constituencies to be fond of claiming that their constituency carries the country. Whether it is farmers, workers, small business, big business or whatever, in this country people are fond of stating that their group-of course, I come to this chamber from the trade union movement and representing workers-is the backbone of the country, that it carries the country and everybody else is bludging off it. I submit that in all instances that approach is wrong in because the country is carried collectively by all of us in varying ways and with varying approaches-cooperatively, in competition and the like. I disagree with the approach of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie on this issue. We need to acknowledge that in various ways all members of our community make a contribution to the ,wealth and general standard of living in this country. To try to promote any particular group as the real core of the country and say that everybody else is battening on them is an unproductive and unfortunate way to look at these things. My third observation-an issue that I have raised before-relates to our absurd three-tier system of government. This legislation, as are an increasing number of acts at the two major levels of government in this country, is essentially about getting around that absurd structure. For a number of years we have had a very convoluted process such as complementary legislation, extensive ministerial council negotiations and the like in order to achieve an objective that could logically be achieved through a single level of government. I have commented before in this place on the absurdity of having our nation's No.1 river as the boundary between two political entities that are charged with, amongst other things, the obligation to protect that river system. This problem is gradually being conquered through processes such as the Murray-Darling Basin legislation, which we are debating today. But when we are looking at things such as uniform national criminal law, struggling to get uniform national road freight regulation and the like, there must come a stage when people in this country say, 'If it is so important to have uniform regulation of all these things, why do we have the political power to make these regulations vested in half a dozen different segmented political structures in this country? Why don't we have the power 'where it should be, in a national framework of regulation?'. Time zone lunacy, rail gauges and school curricula dramas notwithstanding, the logic of that situation will eventually tell. It may take some, time, but it will eventually tell. I applaud this for at least gradually, maybe slightly, maybe slowly, advancing that particular agenda. It is worth noting that the legislation has limitations because of that structure of government. Unanimous agreement of all the four parties is still required for any serious decision. I refer honourable members to subclause 12(3) of the schedule, which is in effect the agreement. Clause 42 of the schedule requires that for the commission to fulfil its obligations with respect to water quality monitoring and testing it has to get the permission of whichever state happens to control the relevant piece of territory that that testing is taking place on in order to pursue it. The agreement still has to be enforced in the state courts-that is provided in clause 13 of the bill-which potentially raises the prospect of a different result on an identical issue in different courts, depending on which jurisdiction the issue is litigated in. The fourth observation I make-it is a brief one-is that this bill, relatively limited as it may appear, is an important step in the overall process of developing the clean green food strategy for Australia's exports. This is a very important component of the export strategy of this government. I applaud its tremendous potential to provide greater employment in the food processing area. It is of critical importance that we ensure that the water resource provided by our No.1 river system, which is obviously fundamental to the provision of clean and green food, will actually be a clean water resource. An important connection to draw is that this apparently straightforward regulatory approach has a critical nexus with the overall well-being of our community into the future with new export initiatives. The final comment I wish to make in this debate is that this approach-I am pleased to see that it is supported by the opposition-is a further implicit recognition that market forces cannot and do not provide a satisfactory protection for our environment and our natural resources or a means of resolving problems of human econor ,':: activity. Most environmental consequences of human economic activity are deemed to be externalities bill in the neoclassical economic market model. Essentially there are three different types of these externalities. The first is what might be tenned common resources such as ocean fisheries which, in effect,are publicly available to private actors and essentially not amenaple to being controlled. The second type of externality relates to what may be tenned public goods which are not capable of being divided or controlled. The most obvious example of that is our atmosphere; the air we breathe. The third example is the issues that affect the interests of future generations, where those most affected by environmental impacts, damage to the environment, are those who are not yet born. Straightforward examples of this problem include loss of species, which I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh refer to in her speech; loss <,>f habitat, wNch is critically connected with loss of species; reduction in the ozone layer; and so on. It is true to say that people who are in control of existing environmental resources or of activities that have some impact on those resources most often take some account of the future and the need to protect and preserve those resources. Outright vandalism is not all that common. Unfortunately, the need to ensure future amenity and income almost invariably will take second place to the need to ensure current amenity and income. It is simply the natural human way of things. Although there are examples, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh mentioned, where people such as those in the farming community devote considerable resources to soil conservation, inevitably and necessarily, the emphasis must be on current needs over future needs. Of course there is the problem that many environmental resources regenerate only over extended periods of time-we are not talking five or 10 years, but generations. Such resources include tropical rainforests, population levels of whales and so on. These are resources which do not have value only to a limited group of people-owners, users or whatever. These issues are very well canvassed in a recent book by Michael Jacobs entitled The Green Economy: Environment, Sustainable Development and the Politics of the Future. I commend that to honourable members who would like to read a very balanced and well written examination of the problems of economic growth and how to pursue growth in an environmentally sound way. It is worth noting that that book and, indeed, many in the environment movement have moved on from what previously was a no growth or antigrowth position to a quality groWth position. That is the position that I support. We can have sustained economic growth. It is a desirable goal. It is the composition of growth that is the key issue. Certain types of economic growth can reduce the damage that we do to, and the burdens that we place on, our environment. Some of the prejudices that we hear directed towards the environment movement by people in this place and elsewhere may reflect outdated positions or positions that were held only by a minority in the environment movement in the first place. In conclusion"" the Murray-Darling Basin Bill is the latest, and indeed the ,most comprehensive, legislative acknowledgment of the importance of ensuring that our premier river system which sustains a huge proportion of our national e/::onomy and our livelihood will continue to do so ,in the future. It does require proper public regulation. The only way of ensuring that this resource can be enjoyed responsibly, intelligently and productively by not only current generations but also future generations of' Australians is by substantial sensitive government intervention, regulation of the market and an approach which will enable those who follow us to enjoy all the amenities that that river system provides in the same way as we have been able to enjoy them.",27
10,Mr CHYNOWETH,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",30
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Truss)Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,30
12,Mr CHYNOWETH,Unknown,Yes.,30
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may proceed.,30
14,Mr CHYNOWETH,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) stated that I worked for Greenpeace, that its members were environmental thugs and therefore I was an environmental thug. This is not correct. I was pleased to act as a lobbyist for Greenpeace for a few months. We need groups such as Greenpeace to keep industry and govehunent honest. I do not agree with everything Greenpeace says or does;'but I will certainly stand up for it in its fight to make our planet a better place.",30
15,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"I will make a few brief comments on matters that have been raised during the debate on the Murray-Darling Basin Bill. Firstly, as f\ir as the comments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in relation to Greenpeace are concerned, I would like to join with the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) in condemning his point of view. Greenpeace is an organisation in this country with a membership vastly in excess of the combined membership of all our political parties. So it is a very substantial organisation and certainly not thuggish in its behaviour in any shape or form. Those sorts of views should be rejected. Concerning his comments that Aborigines were environmental vandals, whilst it is true that they did use fire in hunting, most ecologists will agree that the changes to the flora and fauna that occurred were more the result of lightning strikes and so on than of Aboriginal hunting habits. Putting that aside, the opposition raised some serious matters that need a comment or two. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) raised the issue of community concern about flooding below the Hume Dam in high rainfall periods. In the last 15 years the Murray-Darling Basin Commission's operation of reservoirs has been able to contain 38 floods which would have broken the normal river banks. Also, it has significantly reduced in size the remaining 12 that passed below the Hume and Dartmouth dams. As the volume of water in the Hume Dam has been at a record level for some months, water has had to be released from the Hume and Dartmouth storages so as to increase the capacity available to handle the expected high level of inflows in late winter and early spring 1993. Discussions have been held with community groups about reservoir flood operations and a series of community workshops have been held involving the River Murray Action Group to progress a shared understanding of the issues and develop alternative flood operation policies. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and, I think, the honourable member for Hindmarsh sought assurances from the government that South Australia's entitlement to water would be secure under the new legislation. The new agreement specifies South Australia's monthly water entitlements which must be allocated before the entitlements of New South Wales and Victoria are considered. Thus South Australia, in fact, has greater security of water entitlements than either New South Wales or Victoria. Finally, the honourable member for Wakefield and also the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) raised the issue of future funding for the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre, the MDFRC. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, which is a council made up of the, Commonwealth, Victoria and New South Wales, made a decision in 1991 not to continue to provide core funding for the MDFRC through the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation beyond 1993-94. In that year Commonwealth funding support of $1.233 million for the MDFRC will be so provided: the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation, some $365,000; the Murray-Darling Basin initiative, $130,000; the CSIRO, $348,000; and the Albury-Wodonga Development CorPoration, $390,000. Hence, even if the development corporation contributions are withdrawn at the end of 1993-94, the Commonwealth will continue to provide significant funding support. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe) has agreed to seek a reconsideration of the Albury-Wodonga ministerial council decision at the next meeting of the council which is scheduled for 27 August 1993. So it is really the Commonwealth, not Victoria and New South Wales, that is seeking that review. The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) also proposed that the government should look seriously at a mini laboratory the Mildura-Loxton area, which would require funding of $1 million. Recently, my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and gy (Mr Crean) responded to representations on this issue from the honourable member Wakefield, pointing out that the Commonwealth is reluctant to increase its already significant funding support for the MDFRC and that, since the MDFRC is a partner in the proposed cooperative research centre for freshwater ecology, any expansion of the MDFRC to include a mini laboratory would need to be considered in the context of the structure of the proposed CRC. The honourable member for Indi was incorrect in encouraging the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to provide these funds. The industry. honourable member should be exhorting his colleagues in Victoria and New South Wales to support funding through the Albury-Wopork donga ministerial council. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recomother mending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Walker) read a third time. NA NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Mr Gear: That the bill be now read a second time.",31
16,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,Unknown,"The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill has been around for some time. This bill will establish the Australian Pig Industry Council to replace the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council which was established in 1987. The government believes that the new version will be more efficient than the previous .council. It also amends the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation in Act and the Meat Research Corporation Act to allow for a simple majority to pass resolutions at annual meetings of these bodies on a Enertwo-thirds majority for no-confidence motions. It was introduced last year but not for debated and has now been reintroduced. The government has established advisory councils for most primary industries to review and report on the strategic direction of the industry and to undertake inquiries and report to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on matters affecting their particular industry. The government and industry have generally believed that these councils, consisting of the producers, processors and other interested parties, have been able to develop better policies and strategies for the broader The current Pig Industry Policy.Council has been ineffective and has been financed by producers. Therefore, the pork industry recognised that it needed a coordinated approach and had the foresight to put together a council wholly and solely financed by the pork producers. As the new body will include sectors of the industry and will report to the minister, it will be financed by the government. The pork industry is another great Australian rural industry which directly employs over 4,300 workers and indirectly creates 7,200 jobs. It is an extremely important consumer of grain grown on the domestic market; in fact, 1.5 million tonnes of grain are consumed by the Australian pork industry. The value at the 1993 farm gate is in excess of $700 million annually. So, on those figures alone, the pork industry is a truly great Australian rural industry and yet another good example of how the rural sector is a great job provider for all Australians and creates wealth which all The voting arrangement for the annual general meeting of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation has been criticised because it required a 75 per cent vote against a levy motion put by a corporation for it to be overturned. This means that, in reality, none of the levy motions put before the AGM could be overturned. The· Department of Primary Industries and Energy undertook a review of the council in 1991 and found that there should be an adjustment to membership to reflect the sectors with direct investment in the industry. It also found that insufficient work was being done to develop an export orientation and that technology needed to be increased together with a rationalisation in the processing sector. It reported that, if the council was brought under the Primary Industry Councils Act, it would be better able to look at these matters. The chairperson will be appointed by the government. Membership will include three' persons nominated by the Pork Council of Australia, which represents producers, one person nominated from each of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation and the National Processors Association, and the chairpersons of each of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation. The proposed composition will truly represent all of those with either a or indirect interest in the industry. The legislation also amends the Pig Industry Act 1986 to recognise the Pork Council of Australia as the eligible representative producer body. I welcome that amendment because the Pork Council of Australia has done a truly good job of representing the pork producers of this nation. The Pork Council superseded the Australian Pork Producers Federation in March this year. The amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act and the Meat Research Corporation Act will allow a simple majority to pass resolutions at annual meetings of these bodies or a two-thirds majority for no confidence motions, but will require at least 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register. There is also a minor amendment to the Grain Industry Council to ensure that its member from the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Ltd is from its recently constituted food committee. The coalition will not oppose the amendments. However, we place on public record that, whilst the review has been necessary, we want to know that the arrangements that are in place are the most efficient for the industry.",32
17,Mr DODD,Unknown,"The purpose of the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill is to introduce amendments to the Pig Industry Act 1986, the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985. I am particularly interested in speaking on the aspects of the bill that concern the beef industry, as Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf savanna country of my electorate support a substantial number of cattle. It is with immense pleasure that I speak on this bill today, and I am sure primary industry groups in my electorate share my enjoyment because, if the people of Leichhardt had not elected me as their representative on 13 March, they would have been burdened with an ineffective member of the opposition. They could have elected a Liberal and they would direct have got the GST and free tariffs. Even worse, they could have elected a National Party member and then they would have been in real strife. Luckily, the National Party vote in Leichhardt dropped six per cent from 20 per cent of the primary vote in 1990 to 14 per cent of the primary vote in 1993. That shows what primary producers think of the National Party in my part of the world. I note that the opposition supports this legislation. Of course, the National Party is obviously happy to support rural industry at a micro level, but at the same time it genuflects to and echoes the unrestricted free market policies of the Liberal Party in a global sense. The National Party's support of Fightback's slash and bum approach and zero tariffs was a total rejection of the traditional grassrootS supporters of the party and the family farm. Despite the ridiculous claims of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) since the 13 March election, the National Party is clearly a dying party, unable to effectively represent rural Australia. In Queensland, despite ridiculous claims by the Leader of the National Party, its vote on 13 March was 14.9 per cent, down from the 16.7 per cent it scored in 1990. Its popularity runs at about 14 per cent to 15 per cent, whereas the ALP runs at about 50 per cent to 52 per cent. The people of Australia clearly voted for the party that believes in providing appropriate assistance to primary industry at all levels, including that embodied in this legislation-a party that does not blindly believe in the level playing field and letting industries sink or swim. On this side of the House we believe that there is a role for government in the regulation and promotion of our primary, manufacturing and service industries. We believe that government should provide the necessary framework to allow our industries to thrive. It is interesting to watch the political posturings of those on the other side of the House in relation to the tragic drought that has affected much of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Fortunately, in my electorate in Far North Queensland we have not been affected by drought; in fact, we have had a pretty good wet season in the last six months. Nevertheless, I support the recent changes to the government's rural adjustment scheme which have enabled drought affected farmers to access social security, financial advice and, in many cases, financial assistance in the form of interest free loans. That support has been continued in the budget that was introduced last night. There will always be those who say that the government should do more; that the government should be more actively involved in propping up failing operations and bailing out bankrupt enterprises. The National Party is neither cohesive nor consistent on these issues. It is not surprising that it is the bers on the other side of this House who are calling formore intervention to aid the rural industry. These are the same people who are committed in coalition to 'less government', and talk about Canberra 'socialists' who intervene in the free market economy. The inconsistency of those opposite is appalling. The Australian Labor Party does believe that government has an important. role to play in the economy, whether it is providing financial assistance to primary producers through tough times, or through incentive schemes for small business like the best practice program. To get back to the subject at hand, the government has an important role to play in legislating to improve the effectiveness of industry peak bodies. The bill before the House today is proof of that. This bill will create an Australian Pig Industry Council that is responsive to the policy needs of the pig industry, and is effective in coordinating policy input from all industry sectors to deliver an overall strategic policy direction for the benefit of the whole industry. As we have heard from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), the pig industry amendments are designed to improve the effectiveness of the pig industry's statutory policy body in providing advice to the government and industry on issues affecting all sectors of the industry. In the case of the meat and livestock industry, the amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 will improve the efficiency of the corporations created under those acts, and ultimately the efficiency and competitiveness of our beef industry. I am pleased to say that the future outlook for the beef industry in my electorate in Far North Queensland is very good. The industry has gone through tough times, mainly because of climatic conditions, and simply because of the isolation of the Gulf and Cape York Peninsula area. Historically, in the 1970s cattle in Queensland were raised mainly for export in the form of beef, while in the southern states the beef cattle industry was oriented towards supplying both domestic and overseas markets. The decade to the midmem1970s was a period of major expansion in the Australian beef industry as a whole. Cattle numbers rose by 15.5 million to 33.4 million in March 1976, an expansion rate of seven per cent per annum. Since then the industry has contracted, with herd numbers in 1993-94 estimated at about 23.3 million. The fall in beef numbers in the latter years of the 1970s and in the early 1980s was most pronounced in South Australia, with New South Wales, Victoria and the other southern states accounting for more than six million of the 8.5 million decline in herd numbers. This . reversed the trend of the 1960s when herd build-up was greatest in the wheat-sheep zone and the high rainfall zone. Queensland is now consistently the largest producer and exporter of beef, with cattle numbers estimated around 10 million-a solid 42 per cent of the Australian herd. The term outlook for beef is closely linked to seasonal conditions in the major beef producing regions, particularly Queensland. According to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the current climatic conditions indicate slaughterings will rise by about two per cent to $8.6 million in 1992-93, increasing beef and veal production by about three per cent to $1. 81 million. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Research Economics has forecast sale yard prices to increase by around three per cent by 1992-93 to an average of 209c per kilogram dressed weight. While domestic consumption is falling marginally, the volume of beef and veal exports is forecast to increase in 1992-93 to 795,000 tonnes, valued at $2.8 billion. The Japanese market is largely responsible for this increase, with sales to the USA and Korea expected to drop. Stocking rates in my electorate are generally much lower than averages down south due to the climatic extremes. In the wet tropical regions of coastal Queensland, which I represent, pastures sown with new species such as Townsville stylo are becoming more common, but research has not yet succeeded in developing improved species for the arid and semiarid zones. This sort of research is crucial the viability of the Australian beef industry, which is why the amendments in this bill which improve the efficiency and accountability of the Meat Research Corporation are essential. This bill will give the Meat Research Corporation the necessary basis on which to develop its evolving commercialisation role and for improved efficiency ,rin carrying out its day-today operations and activities. As previous speakers have outlined, both the Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation present their annual reports to industry shareholders at annual general meetings. The amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 will change the requirements for passing motions at annual general meetings. As has been previously explained, levy short- motions will now be passed on a simple majority on each of the appropriate registers. Currently, it requires a 75 per cent vote against a levy motion put by a corporation for it to be overturned. No-confidence motions will be passed by two-thirds of the total votes cast. Additionally, at least 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register must be in favour of the motion. The amendments will give effect to the government's decision that levy motions at AGMs should be passed on a simple majority. This also has the support of the meat and livestock industry organisations. The new arrangements will ensure that any successful no-confidence motion-which, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in his second reading speech, represents a very serious step for the industry to take-is based on strong industry support. The bill also amends the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 to give the corporation a clear commercialisation function. This will enable the corporation to carry out routine operations and activities with the same level of confidence and efficiency as is available to other research and development corporations. The additional functions of disseminating, to adopting and commercialising meat and livestock industry research and development results will now be included in the Meat Research Corporation Act as a consequence of the passing of this bill. These functions have been provided for by the Meat Research Corporation regulations as an interim measure. A clear statement of these functions in the act will enable the corporation to confidently develop and pursue initiatives in the increasingly important area of technology transfer, particularly commercialisation activities. An initiative in the bill that will be particufor larly welcomed by the industry is the removal of the provision in the act requiring the minister to approve agreements and contracts made by the corporation where these a set limiting amount. Once again, this will bring the Meat Research Corporation into line with other primary industry research and development corporations. The corporation will be able to operate more efficiently by removing the demand on corporate and ministerial time created by those processes. The amendments will particularly benefit industry representatives from remote areas my electorate. For example, the amendment allowing the board to conduct meetings and pass resolutions without it being necessary members to meet physically is a timely recognition of the advances in telecommunications since the Meat Research Corporation was set up. In future, it will be possible to conduct meetings by telephone or other means of communication. This will also provide a more cost-effective method of meeting, as members of the board are frequently widely dispersed geographically at times when board meetings are scheduled. At present the authority of the executive director is dependent on delegations by the corporation. The bill will give the executive director the direct authority to conduct the affairs of the corporation and the power to delegate that authority to his or her staff. will have the effect of greatly conduct of the corporation's operations. The opportunity will also be taken in this bill to remove the 65 years age limit from board membership of the Meat Research Corporaunrelated tionAct. The amendments in this bill will streamline the operations of the peak bodies in the and cattle industries. They demonstrate the preparedness of this government to work with industry groups and to respond to changing technological and market needs. I commend the bill to the House.",33
18,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"I right, welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, but I cannot say that talking about the Australian Pig Industry Council gives me the immense pleasure that the honourable member Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) indicated it gave him. In fact, I have to say that it takes a bit more than a Pig Industry Council bill to move me to the kind of ecstasy that one reads into exceed the term 'immense pleasure'. I was also somewhat bemused to discover that most of the preliminary remarks of the honourable member for Leichhardt focused on the Queensland ALP. I would have thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you would have felt that that was not relevant to a bill on the Australian Pig Industry Council. Since, Mr Deputy Speaker, you chose not to rule those in remarks out of order, I can only presume that there is some relevancy between the ALP and the Australian Pig Industry Council. But, from for my charitable point of view, I must say that the relevancy escapes me entirely. I was, however, less than amused by the honourable member's comments about what he saw as the stance of the coalition running into the last election and the very uncharitable remarks he made about my colleagues in the National Party. Frankly, the honourable member for Leichhardt went into all the usual misrepresentation of what the coalition stood for prior to the last election. There was never a zero tariff policy. Frankly, it would have been much more accurate for the coalition to have described its tariff policy as parallel to that of the ALP. Yet it was misrepresented by honourable members opposite, and principally This by the honourable member for Leichhardt in simplifying the this debate. I happen to be one who knows something about what tariffs do to industries. It is to this bill-I will hasten back to the bill but, having been diverted by the honourable member for Leichhardt, I cannot let the opportunity slip to remind him of my pig background-but my background is in the citrus industry. That industry is very much affected by the impact of Brazilian juice and the level of tariff walls. The government's attitude, which parallels the attitude of the coalition to primary industry tariff rules,is and I stand up in my electorate and say so at the cost of some personal popularity. I therefore find it just a bit irritating to discover that it suits the honourable member for Leichhardt to misrepresent what my party stood for when we defended the responsible tariff policy of the ALP. Mr Dodd-What was the result?",36
19,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"Before the honourable new member runs away with too many interjecis tions, I remind him that my result was worse than his in terms of a swing at the election. The honourable member might care export focus. to consider for a moment how much easier it would have been for those of us on this side of the chamber to engage in the same exercise of misrepresentation-to have said that we believed in enormous tariff walls-in order win short-term popularity and to embarrass the government. We chose not to do that. chose the much more difficult course of backing the government on its responsible tariff policy. The only semblance of gratitude has c0!lle from the Minister for Primary Industnes and Energy (Mr Crean), while the remarks of the honourable member for Leichthat hardt grossly misrepresent both the spirit and the thrust of the opposition's stance on tariffs in the last election. For those who do not know, let me spell it the wine industry. out: because the nation has no choice there is no real difference between the attitud- that the ALP and the coalition take to the difficult and vexed question of protecting Australian industry. It is time the government recognised the level of support it has had from opposition, which it would have been much easier for the opposition not to deliver. I want to participate in this debate on the whole question of the establishment of a new Australian Pig Industry· Council and echo the remarks made by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). The legislation before the House, which allows the new Pig Industry Council to be established, is simply the r-ult o- a revie- of the Pig Industry Counctl, whlch counctl was established in 1987. That review determined that it would wise to establish a new Pig Industry Council with. greater flexibility and that the new council should comprise three people from Pork Council of Australia-which, as the honourable member for Maranoa wisely pointed out, is now recognised as the key producer body-one member from the Meat and Allied Trades Federation, one from National Processors Association, the Chairman of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Chairman of the Pig Research and Development Corporation. This will make up the Pig Industry Council, a council which it hoped by both the government and the no opposition will have, as the honourable last member for Leichhardt said, an even acuter I thought that there was a touch of irony in that remark, given that last night in his budget statement the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) called to for changes to the economic framework in Australia, saying, 'This budget will also We provide new support for our emerging exporters'. We all agree with new support for emerging exporters. I represent a burgeoning export industry--,-the wine industry-and I hardly think an increase in tax of 50 per cent in that industry represents new support. I hope the government, in its dealings with the pig industry in Australia, will be more sincere in its conviction of new support to exports than we saw last night in its attitude to other primary industries-principally, in this case ' The honourable member for Leichhardt quite rightly referred to the importance of the beef industry and to the part of the bill before the House which amends the AMLC act to the allow motions at AMLC meetings to be passed with a simple majority unless they are motions of no confidence, in which case a two-thirds majority will be needed. He went on to speak of the importance of the beef industry in his electorate-which I understand. What he did not go on to saythis is not a criticism of his speech-is that there. is a direct relationship right now b(ftween success in the beef industry and some of the difficulties being experienced by the pig producers who are so directly affected by be the legislation before the House. That crisis is most clearly highlighted in Canada, a country with which we have a great deal of the trade. As the honourable member for Leichhardt would know, a third of the total of Australia's beef exports goes to Canada. Australia's success as a beef exporter to Canada has been quite marked. In response to the that success, the Canadians hit our beef producers with a 25 per cent tariff. The irony is that the pig producers in Australia were also facing real competition from Canadian ham which was flooding into Australia 12 months ago. The impact on Australian pig producers of that competition was to effectively take 1,000 of the 6,000 Australian pig producers out of the industry. Mr Bruce Scott-The government did nothing about it under GATT.",37
20,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"As the honourable member for Maranoa, anticipating my remarks as ever, appropriately interjects, the government did nothing about it. The honourable member for Leichhardt had the barefaced audacity in this chamber to accuse the oppositionpowerless and numberless-of failing to represent pig and beef producers. The simple reality is that the government has done nothing to protect Australian pig producers from the impact of Canadian ham. In addition, the government proclaimed fairer trading arrangements, which we have endeavoured to endorse, but it chose conveniently to ignore w,hat those trading arrangements have done to some of our producers, and in particular the pork producers. It is a real irony that our pork producers, not unreameet the same requirement. sonably, took - ction against the Canadians, but their dumping case failed because the Canadians were seen not to have been dumping. Equally, the Canadians took action against our beef producers. They succeeded because the criteria which they used were not the same as those which we felt we were obliged to use under GATT. So let us not be too full of self-proclaimed wisdom about our trading arrangements or too anxious to criticise those of us who recognise the difficult constraints we are under as a small trading nation trying to meet our GATT obligations and that it is only if we have clean hands in GATT that we have any chance of improving negotiations with the Canadians or any other major primary producers which export to Australia. The inconsistency in the way the law affects pig producers in Australia does not only apply to the international scene; it does not only apply to the way that the Canadians have dealt with Australian pig producers. In my electorate, in a small country town, there is a small but very effective up-to-date modem manufacturing business which is producing-successfully, to its credit-slurry containers which are necessary to dispose of pig effluent and waste. The containers have been in demand around Australia. The slurry is disposed of via a vacuum process. The manufacturer is obliged, not unreasonably, to meet Australian standard 1210, which is supervised by each of the state governments. The manufacturer, AgriWaste Consultants, has discovered that the obligation on him as an Australian manufacturer to meet Australian standard 1210 has not been applied to those who import the same sort of machinery into Australia. As the government proclaims so loudly that it protects Australian industry and that it has an interest only in the success of Australia, it might pause and take a look at the way in which Australian standard 1210 is currently being implemented by state governments across Australia. Here we have a situation where an Australian manufacturer is meeting a requirement--:-whether it is necessary or not does not matter-laid down by the legislators, but importers are not obliged to . Before we came into this House-I direct these remarks charitably to the honourable member for Leichhardt-the government wsuggesting that the opposition has been guilty of inconsistencies. These are inconsistencies which I think I have illustrated we need hardly apologise for because they do not exist. The government might also look at its own track record and its hands. I join with the honourable member for Maranoa and indicate the opposition's support for these changes to the Pig Industry Council, to the AMLC and to the sections of the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 which directly affect the grain industry.",38
21,Mr HARRY WOODS,Unknown,"I support the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, which I think can go a long way towards adding efficiencies and an export focus to the Australian pig industry. I am quite amazed at the implicit indications of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), that the problems we had when exporting beef to Canada could have been replied to in some tit for tat way, connecting it to the pig industry in Australia. That is quite an amazing way to run a trade policy. For our primary industry as a whole, it would get us into enormous problems. It shows the same sort of thought and ability to think .that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) exhibited when he connected our trading policy with our foreign policy with Middle East nations. It really does show an ability not to be able to see the big picture and how primary industry in Australia can expand and do well in the future, especially in the export trade. Briefly, the purpose of the bill is to introdecisions duce amendments to the Pig Industry Act 1986, the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985. The bill proposes to replace the Australian Pork Producers Federthe ation with the Pork Council of Australia the Pig Industry Act 1986 as the industry body eligible to consult with the Australian Pork Corporation and for nomination of members to the Australian Pork Corporation Selection Committee. It seeks to repeal part III of the Pig Industry Act 1986 to terminate the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council. then seeks to create the Australian Pig IndusCorporation. try Council under the Primary Industry Counfinancial cils Act 1991 with enhanced functions Commonwealth funding. The bill provides for transitional arrangeone ments for this to occur and allows for the Australian Pig Industry Council to begin operations without encumbrance. The Australtry, Ian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 would be amended to allow for a more demoagricultural cratic process in line with other' statutory marketing authorities. Under the existing arrangements a no confidence motion can be passed only if it gains 75 per cent of the vote from people on the two producers registers and 75 per cent of the vote from people the processors register. The amendments mean a no confidence motion would require twotook thirds of the total votes cast and at least per cent of the vote from the two producers registers and the same percentage from the processors register. For levy motions, the amendments will reduce the vote from the current 75 per cent from the producers register and processors register to 50 per cent. These are positive developments and will have a beneficial impact on the organisation's ability to change and take advantage of new opportunities. These opportunities should be better identified through the amendments to the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985. It also allows for the board of the corporation to hold meetings by telephone or by other means of communication rather than the current requirement for a physical meeting where can be made only through a majority of the participating members of the board ' meeting and indicating agreement with the resolution. This amendment is important to an industry where board members may be, and are, spread across the length and breadth of country and cannot make a decision, even in on urgent issues, without getting together. Finally, the amendments allow for the operating cost to the Australian Pig Industry Council to be met by the government. That will be approximately $205,000 a year. Previously, the operations of the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council were funded It through levies paid to, the Australian Pork Government funding will lift the burden from the corporation to allow and it to focus on other activities. I Currently,' the industry exports only about per cent of its annual production of 336,000 tonnes. It has the capacity to produce and export significantly more. The pig indusas is true with many of our other primary industries, has strong foundations. We are recognised worldwide as a clean producer of materials and I think we can build on that in the pig industry. We have demonstrated in other primary industries that we can be the most efficient in the world. Pig meat is already one of the mos,t consumed meats in the world and we have one of the fastest on growing markets on our doorstep in Asia. The Pork Council of Australia, which really over the operations of the Australian Pig 50 Industry Policy Council in March last year, has already conducted a workshop on developing export potential, and results are about to be distributed among the industry. But this focus on exports must pervade all aspects of the industry from production to processing, distribution and marketing. I do not believe that that has been done to this date, but the new structure, as provided for in these amendments, will help focus in that direction. A review of the industry by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy found there was a need to clarify the Pork Council's role and functions; a need to improve communication of the council's work and achievements; a need for financial independence; a need for the council to be staffed full-time and located in Canberra, as are the other peak industry policy councils; a need for slight adjustment to the membership to better represent those with a direct investment in the pig industry; and a need for greater emphasis on planning the strategic direction of the pig industry. It is that last point-a need for greater emphasis on planning and direction-which I consider to be of the most importance and which has been addressed in these amendments. They allow for quicker decision making through better communication and greater flexibility and through changes to the restrictive voting methods and the percentages that are currently in use. As with all industries-primary, secondary or commercial-it is imperative that goals are set, that methods in realising these goals are established and that a timetable is set down for the incremental gains that may .be achieved in meeting those goals. The goal here really is to increase the sales of pig meat. The actual increase in sales needs to be determined by the industry and the strategies then developed to achieve that increase. The industry can set a goal of, say, doubling-or more-its sales of pig meat within a specific time frame. Given the world demand for pig meat and for environmentally clean products, probably the goal can be set realistically high. It then has to determine how it will get there. Most importantly, it has to determine what it is that its consumers want. That is often a pretty inexact science. The beef industry has been fairly successful in this regard and I see no reason why the pig industry cannot do the same. Breeding, feeding, slaughter, presentation and marketing programs would need to be developed in order to capture those identified markets. Moves to identify a market and catch it will be successful only if the product is cost competitive. I think considerably more can be done to improve our cost competitiveness in the pig industry. The domestic industry is often characterised by dramatic fluctuations in production and export supply capability. If we look at fluctuations in exports over the past three years, we find how overseas buyers would have difficulty in reaching long-term supply contracts with the Australian industry. In September 1990, we exported over one million kilograms of pig meat. In February 1991, we exported 289,000 kilograms-a fall of almost 75 per ' cent. Last financial year, there were still wide fluctuations in pig meat export. Part of this fluctuation in the export of pig meat is explained away by seasonal conditions and domestic market demand, but much of it is due to the nature of the industry domestically. When wheat prices are low, we can expect a substantial increase in the production of pig meat. In many cases, the wheat producers find it profitable to use their product for that and can increase the value of their crop. Reliability of supply is one of the major hurdles to overcome if Australia is to become a substantial pig meat exporter. The industry needs to find efficiencies along the entire length of its production chain in order to break into the export market. It needs to determine the most cost-effective food sources, the optimum food regimes and breeding schedules, the best transport systems, the best slaughter techniques and processing techniques, the best marketing avenues and all matters of that· type. Much of the infrastructure is in place for export marketing through the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and Austrade. The industry can take advantage of those. There are problems with processing, but I am advised that, in Denmark, the Danes have developed their own processing system which they intend to use in their operations in Australia. With Australian ingenuity, I am confident we could develop a system that would even go a step further. I have had a number of discussions with the Pork Council of Australia and have been impressed with its commitment to change. It does have concerns about the importation of Canadian pork, but I believe that, with proper efficiencies in place, it should have nothing to fear from any importers; they would simply not be able to compete. I would encourage the industry to determine for itself what the best way of warding off imports is. Is it to take rearguard action through attempts at non-tariff barriers or is it to be aggressive in efficiency and marketing drives and remove any market opportunities a competitor may have? Let us take the Canadian example. Canada ' has a harsher climate and significant costs in housing and heating for pigs in winter months. They are .costs we do not have. We do not have the same environmental constraints in processing, and we have an advantage there. Granted, of course, that the Canadians are subsidised, but the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has found ed: that subsidy is minimal and that we can outcompete the Canadians. I believe the amendments to the primary industry legislation will provide the pig 'and'; industry with the new structure that it needs to tackle the challenges head-on. They give it better communication which is needed to allow it to focus on the things that it needs to do in order to become a more efficient producer. The Danes and the Japanese have recognised the potential of the Australian pig industry, with substantial investments. We have always known of the potential, and hopefully we can move forward and capitalise on it. Martin Teasdale, the Executive Director of the newly formed Pork Council of Australia, said: We recognise the wish of government to bring this industry into line with other industry councils. We look forward to being part of the APIC and to bringing the new APIC into the large number of co-operative projects that the other industry bodies-the Pork Council of Australia, the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation-are currently undertaking. I think those words from the executive director should be my last. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

23,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 12.40 to 2 p.m. NA Budget 1993-94,42
24,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Treasurer. Last night he was very big on the concept of decency. Will he do the decent thing and admit that Peter Walsh is right when he describes the budget's tax rises as regressive and the method of financing the tax cuts as a self-evidently circular exercise in futility? I also ask whether Bishop Challen of the Brotherhood of St Laurence is correct when he says that the budget will give a person on $50,000 a tax cut of $1,000 but a low income tax payer, at most, a rebate of $100; and that the new taxes on petrol and other goods will affect the low income earners most. Is punishing the poor (d)' and doing nothing about unemployment the Treasurer's definition of decency?",42
25,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"The critics of the budget seem to me to fall into three broad categories. As the Leader of the Opposition was apparamendently on the edge of his seat listening to me at the Press Club, I will not weary him by repeating them. There are those who believe we should abandon our election promises. We do not support, of course, that idea. There are others who seem to believe that we can say, 'To hell with the deficit'. I do not after know whether the Leader of the Opposition falls into that category or not, but he was one of the most enthusiastic critics of the deficits the which we ran in order to get the economy 19A going. The economy would not be going if it were not for the strategy of fiscal stimulus that the government has been running for the after ·last couple of years. Just as those deficits were necessary to get the economy growing, getting those deficitS down is vital to keeping the economy growing. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the effect on lower income groups and quoted Michael Challen. The Leader of the Opposition should reflect upon the fact that this budget and the tax changes included in it are not to be seen in isolation. They must be seen in terms of what the government has been doing over the years in terms of improving the equity not only of the tax system but also of the social security system itself.· It is those people who are on lower incomes who have been the chief beneficiaries of the massive expansion of the additional family payment system, which has increased by 75 per cent in real terms during the period of office of this government so far. lo terms of other low income groups, we have seen the pension increased by 14 per cent in real terms at the same time. As far as those who are dependent on unemployment benefits are concerned, if we take as an example a couple with three children under 13 years of age, and who receive rent assistance, payments for them have increased by 33 per cent in real terms since the election of this government. Not only does that demonstrate the keen sense of equity which this government has had over the entire period of its office, it also reflects upon the callous attitude of our predecessors who were prepared to support a system which was so blatantly unfair to those poorer groups. The fact that they, - re now displaying this belated interest in equity will not fool anyone; it will not fool me; it will not fool Walshie; it will not fool Challen. What we were doing was implementing tax rates. I do not know whether Senator Walsh liked them or not, but the point is that the tax rates were announced in February 1992. They were part of the government's program when we went to the election. And we have implemented them, and implemented them eight months early. We are doing so because those tax scales are right. They are right for middle Australia; they are right in the sense that they reduce the tax burden for middle Australians. ' Any of those who believe that those tax cuts should riot have proceeded are simply prescribing a withering tax burden on those people who earn between $20,000 and $50,000, which happens to include the majority of Australian taxpayers. This is a budget and a set of tax scales which deliver tangible benefits to middle Australia, and that is a good thing. Budget 1993-94",42
26,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"Would the Treasurer advise the House of the benefits to, middle Australia from last night's budget?",43
27,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"At the risk of being a little repetitious, let me respond to the rather open-ended question which the honourable member has asked me. The most important part of this budget, not only for middle Australia but for all Australians, was the giving to Australia of a sense of a sustainable future. That was why this budget was cast not just in terms of one financial year but in terms of four financial years. Whilst there are those opposite who may wish to hold out the prospect of some instantaneous solution to high levels of unemployment, they are only deluding themselves and, attempting unsuccessfully to delude the Australian people. Basically, Australians are sick of the games that the Leader of the Opposition has been playing in terms of his threatened antics in the Senate and elsewhere. What they want is a credible future for this country based on a sustainable recovery. This recovery can be and will be sustainable because it is based on the twin pillars of low inflation and low interest rates, something which Liberal predecessor governments sought to attain for most of the 20 years that they were in office before we came to office. It is only this government that has been able to achieve those twin objectives, and it is those twin objectives which make this recovery different and one which is sustainable in terms of providing an opportunity for Australian businesses to invest, expand, export more and therefore employ more Australians. That is what is so vitally important in this approach. The approach of this government is to set down a framework for the next four years which provides and inspires confidence not just for middle Australians but for all Australians. Budget 1993-94",43
28,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I direct my question to the Treasurer also. I refer the Treasurer to the government's decision to increase the price of unleaded fuel by 5c a litre and leaded fuel by tOc a litre. I also refer the Treasurer to the increases announced in all sales taxes. Why did the Treasurer, and the Prime Minister for that matter, not tell Australians before the last general election that they planned to impose these additional costs on Australians?",43
29,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"At the time of the last budget, we set ourselves a targetMr MCGauran interjecting",43
30,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"I will get to the last election if the honourable member for Gippsland can contain himself. At the time of the last election, we had set ourselves a deficit target to be achieved in 1995-96 of around one per cent. By the time of the election, we were aware of the deterioration in the world economy which, even by that stage, had been considerable and we were aware of the fact that the impact of that deterioration would affect our capacity to achieve that target. Dr Hewson interjecting",43
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,44
32,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"It was for that reason that the Prime Minister announced that we would postpone for a year the achievement of that target. He quite clearly said as he launched the election that instead of achieving the per cent deficit target in 1995-96, we would do so in 1996-97. However, the growth in world economy continued to be marked down. At one stage growth in the world economy in fulfilled1993 was scheduled to be three per cent; it is now expected to be one per cent. Those who think that change can occur in the world economy without its impacting on Australia need to go back to school. The point is that once we had an opportuniwho ty to review the prospects for the Australian economy and the influence of the world on the Australian economy, we realised that without some changes it would not be sible to achieve that deficit commitment. could have abandoned that deficit commitcommitments, ment, but we believed that to have done would not have been in the interests Australia or it) the interests of the business community in trying to plan its investment future. It was for that reason that we had before us a range of options to consider how we might achieve that objective. By the time that national fiscal outlook paper was put together and published for Premiers Conference we realised that the gap which had to be filled by 1996-97 was $9 billion. It was at that time that the governcompany ment realised that it would have to embrace measures, both on the outlay side and on the revenue side, in order to achieve that deficit target. It is for those reasons that the governa ment took the decisions it did, both in terms of outlays and in terms of revenue measures, to achieve in the best possible way that deficit target in 1996-97. Election Promises",44
33,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,I direct my question to Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister provide details to the House of what decisions were taken in last night's budget to meet the commitments made during the recent election campaign? Do these decisions prove wrong have done. claims made that the government would not keep faith with the promises made during the election campaign.,44
34,Mr KEATING,Unknown,We have had so many claims and counter claims from the opposition that last night the Treasurer and the Minister one for Finance produced a document entitled Building on strength: government actions on the election commitments. That document lists 131 election commitments as being already Mrs Sullivan-In five years time.,44
35,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"No, they are already fulfilled. It also lists the 24 commitments which involved no additional spending and the 13 commitments on revenues. For those can get across a simple table, these are listed in table 2 of the document. The table on page 11 of the document lists those at nil cost, and table 3 lists the revenue commitposments of the government. The document We shows that the government will fulfil its including stage one-the so personal income tax cuts promised in One of Nation-while keeping the deficit to $16 billion this year and while bringing it down to one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. The biggest commitment we have met is to the unemployed. We have introduced a budget which supports growth and which stimulates investment. We will provide extra funding for the labour market programs and increase the newstart allowance. Let me recite some of the commitments. There is ""the reduction in the tax rate, which we have introduced already, cutting the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. We have introduced a general investment allowance for business, child care cash rebate for working parents, and an indexed non-taxable home child care allowance for spouses at home caring full time for children. We have expanded workrelated child care places. All of these things have been done. We are in the process of reducing clinically excessive waiting times for the elective surgery. We are introducing Commonwealth dental programs for health card holders, palliative care funding, a seniors health card, and we are easing the assets test on pensions. All these things, the budget will I do not want to tire honourable members, but let me just give a few other examples, such as the, provision of a deferred payment facility for students of the open learning initiative, additional funding for group employment and training companies, education, the monitoring program concerning taxation incentivC!s for the arts, the protection and return of significant cultural property to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the establishment of a cultural heritage protecadvice tion program for Aboriginal rock art, the establishment of a grasslands ecology unit, a national strategy for grasslands rescue, the review of nursing staff in hostels, and the restoration and replacement program for the Commonwealth's assets in the national capital, et cetera, et cetera. The list goes on. But, of course, there is nothing left of opposition's commitments. They have all expired. Even though the opposition never cleared up. had a chance to put them into effect as a government in office, they. have expired. March 1992 the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Fightback will not be amended. It stands firm'. In April 1992 he said, 'I'm going to be inflexible. Well, I am. I'm not going to change'. Then, of course, he introportduced Fightback 2. Then in November 1992 he said, 'There is no room for doubt of the coalition's commitment to a GST. I will resign'. He went through this great litany declarations about his commitments. The fact is that Fightback 1 has come and gone, Fightback 2 has come and gone-they are both broken promises-and the Leader of the Opposition is still here. But he said he would go. So we can only conclude that the Leader of the Opposition is a broken promise himself. Wool Tax",44
36,Mr COBB,Unknown,"I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer the minister to Budget Paper No. 1 where there is a one-line item on page 4.17 which reads: From 1 July 1994 the wool tax is to risethere is no equivocationfrom 8.5% to 12%. I ask: is the minister aware that when the federal president of the Wool Council of Australia, Mr Charles Armstrong, rang his office last night to confirm this, his office knew nothing about it? Further, is the minister aware that, in desperation, his office rang me later-at 11 o'clock last night-to ask if it were true that I had informed the president of the Wool Council of this increase? Is the minister also aware that his office asked' my as to where in the budget papers I had read this information because his office could not find it. I ask the minister a simple question: did he or did he not know that the wool tax had been raised from 8.5 per cent to 12 per cent at 7.30 last night?",45
37,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question and suggest to him the' that if Mr Crawford had been prepared to speak to me, all of this would have been Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a In point of order. It is Mr Armstrong.",45
38,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"Mr Armstrong or Mr Crawford; I have had discussions with both of them. I made it clear to them, in meeting, on the basis of the issuing of the Garnaut reMr Tim Fischer-Your staff did not know.",45
39,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I would have thought the of person who was responsible in this House was me. When opposition members want to have a go at someone in my office, they should do it properly. But if what they want to do is find out how this issue is being developed, they should ask me-and the honourable member has done so. Let me answer the question. When I met with Mr Armstrong last weekMr Costello-Let's try this one: what is your name?",45
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting.,45
41,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I told him that the government decision taken in April of this year, when we capped the wool tax at 8 112 per cent, was that it would go to 12 per cent next year. Do they want me to repeat it? I told him last week that we had made a decision as a cabinet to cap it this year, but that it would go up next year. That was known to the industry in April. So forget about discussions last night. If people cannot remember what was said in April or, last week, they are not representing interests very well. What I went to go on and say to Mr Crawford",45
42,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,46
43,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I get them mixed up; they are both from the same organisation. What I went to go on and say to them was that, in light of the Garnaut report, which had recommended that the tax be kept at 4'12 per cent, it carried with it a number of other recommendations which the industry has to come to grips with. I said to them that I was prepared to develop a response to Garnaut and take it to cabinet next month. Clearly, the question of where, the tax goeS hinges crucially on those talks, not on some smart-arsed",46
44,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister will contain himself and withdraw that remark.,46
45,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I am sorry to offend the House-not on some smart rear end comment which might come from people who are claiming to represent their constituency, whom I have taken in good faith as representing their constituency, and I am prepared to deal with them in good faith. Let us get on with the task of sorting out the wool industry from here. We are committed to doing it, and we will do it. . Social Se.:urity Recipients",46
46,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,Can the Minister for Social Security advise the House of budget measures to assist social security recipients and how these measures fit in with the government's long-term social security strategy.,46
47,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"Over the last day or so we have seen a veritable deluge of crocodile tears from opposition spokesmen about the government's alleged failure to attend to the needs of low income earners in this budget and elsewhere. What the opposition seems not to comprehend or deliberately to ignore is the fact that, in providing additional assistance low income earners, one cannot just look at the revenue side; one has to look very carefully at what is being done on the outlays side. A great mant of the measures that the government has implemented in this budget and prior to this budget by way of election commitments focus on the outlays side. I think the point is exemplified by the home child-care allowance, which we are giving effect to. It was a major election commitment which we are overfulfil\ing. We are providing features in the home child-care allowance which benefit low income earners which were not in fact included in our election commitment. This is a major transfer from the revenue to the outlay side, but it means that some 55,000 low income households whose income is not sufficient for them to benefit fully from the operation of the dependent spouse rebate-which the home child-care allowance replaces for those with dependent ,children-will benefit from the $30 per week home child-care allowance. That is a major equity measure that will provide a major benefit to low income earners. The net cost of this measure over the forward estimates period is $1.08 billion, so it is a major measure. That additional cost is due, firstly, because there is an increase in the dependent spouse rebate of $3·which has been cashed out, but we are also' making the payment, as I have said, to those 55,000 low income households who would not have qualified fully for the dependent spouse rebate. We are also providing the payment in a flexible form so that people entering or reentering the work force throughout the yea,r will be able to claim or reclaim the benefit within the year. That, again, is a major measure and a major benefit that will assist people who are coming in and out of the work force. That exemplifies the government's approach. As to other measures that we have taken in this budget by way of pre-election commitments, we of course have the real $6 per fortnight increase in the newstart allowance for long-term unemployed. That is a real increase over and above normal indexation adjustments. We have liberalised the income to test for those on unemployment payments so that there is an additional $30 per fortnight earned income free area, in addition to the basic free area, for single beneficiaries or allowees and an increase in the earned income free area for beneficiary couples. We are rationalising waiting periods. We are introducing an earnings credit that will make it much easier for beneficiaries and allowees to earn additional income. We are introducing a mature age allowance from March 1994 which will extend pension-type payments with pension-type conditions to long-term unemployed people over the age of 60. All in all, it is a pretty impressive package of assistance to the unemployed, delivered in a situation of considerable budgetary difficulty. In terms of the longer term approach to social security that this government has adopted, the effects of the changes that have been made since this government has been in office have been studied fairly rigorously by a number of people, including Deborah Mitchell. The results show that over the course of this government's tenure of office the social security system has become a significantly more effective and efficient instrument for preventing people from falling into poverty. That is clear and confirmed. The major reasons for that are the very substantial real increases in family payments, particularly those directed towards low income families, and the very substantial increases in rental assistance. In the One Nation statement we took those steps even further by raising the benchmark payments for the family allowance supplement, which is now called the additional family payment. How does this affect typical low income families? I will give a couple of examples. A family on less than $21,500 with two teenage children now receives over $108 a week in tax free family payments. If such families are renting privately, they receive up to $37 a week extra on top of that. If we put together the family payment and rent assistance, payments for this family have increased by over 86 per cent in real terms over the decade. And the mob opposite says that we are doing nothing for low income families; it is just rubbish. An unemployed family with three young children has received real increases of more than 33 per cent over the decade, when allowances and family and· rent assistance payments are taken into account. This is major assistance to low income families. I would suggest that, taken together, these measures provide major benefits. This budget is a continuation of a trend and a policy by this government to target assistance to those in need. By contrast, of course, the opposition, in order to make its Fightback package add up, would have to take an axe to outlays. But who suffers from cuts in outlays? It is the low income earners of course. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training pointed out yesterday; the opposition would take an axe to labour market and training programs that are absolutely essential- - and critical if long-term unemployed people are to have any chance of getting work. I think all that confirms this government's commitment to those on low incomes, delivered through a highly targeted and efficient social security system, in contrast with the coalition which would cut outlays to pieces and reduce large numbers of low income people to the direst poverty. Eye Tests: Medicare Benefit",46
48,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can he confirm that the scrapping of the Medicare benefit for eye tests will mean that families will be forced to pay $49.50 for a first test and $25 for any followup test? Given his attachment to the concept of decency, I ask the Treasurer: is this the decent thing to do? Given his backbench concern and the community outrage over this decision, is he absolutely committed to going ahead with this attack on average families?",47
49,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"What a joke! This is the man that was going to demolish Medicare and make it more expensive for all Australian families to get every health service. He now comes in here bleating about this change which is proposed to optometry services. The Leader of the Opposition can read for himself what is proposed in the changes. It is proposed that those families who have health cards will continue to receive the support which they are currently receiving in relation to optometry and ophthalmology services. For others, that service will be removed from the Medicare list. It is being done because we are continuing the process of more tightly targeting benefits which we provide to people. This question comes from the party which believed that it could cut $6 billion from outlays without hurting anyone. The fact is that in our system when outlays are cut that inevitably begins more and more to impact on ordinary people. That is why this change has been made at this time as we introduce the dental care program, which will also benefit card holders. We have taken the opportunity to ensure that the dental health program and the provision of optometry services apply on a comparable basis from here on. Budget 1993-94 Mr LEO MCLEAY...,....My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has he seen suggestions that there should have been harsher cuts to government outlays in the budget last night? Would the Prime Minister explain to the House why the government did not go ahead with harsher cuts in outlays?",47
50,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"We have seen some comments today in the media and, of course, heard from the Leader of the Opposition that the government wimped it on outlays; that because there was not more than $2 billion of commitments to lower outlays over this period, in some way the government had missed the opportunity and declined to meet its responsibilities in this respect. The Leader of the Opposition said: There was a four per cent increase in real terms outlays. That is not actually true; it was 2112 per cent with asset sales.",48
51,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,With asset sales?,48
52,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"That is right. Asset sales have been in every other budget. Then he said: I think health is going up by nine per cent and social security is going up by eight. He would like to hop into all these things and rip them around. He was on the AM program this morning saying, 'This is shocking. Here is health going up by nine per cent and social security going up by eight'. A minute ago he was asking the Treasurer about optometry. What a joke. In the morning he was saying it is not hard enough and at question time he is saying it is too hard. Then he gets on to really weighty stuff about a new carpoI1 at the Lodge built for $200,000 and a barbecue at the Attorney General's Department. Michael Brissenden from AM said: 'They're fairly small bickies though, aren't they?' Dead right, Michael. Dr Hewson said: Well, it adds up. There is a chart here-I will leave it for the purpose of anyone wishing to see it, and table it-which shows budget outlays less unemployment benefits as a proportion of GDP, that is, the structural nature of the outlays with the cycle of unemployment deleted. The chart shows' that by 1996-97 outlays will be the same as they were in 1967-68. Since then, of course, the Commonwealth has taken on massive responsibilities in the areas of health, education, child care, age care, the environment and in many other areas which we are delivering for outlays to GDP back to 196768 levels-with the unemployment benefits of the recession washed out of the numbers. Anybody who says, 'You ought to hop into that number and rip it down' is either an extremist or a fool; one' or the other.",48
53,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,Or both.,48
54,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Probably both-an extremist and a fool. In last night's budget there is a table of outlays and receipts as a proporin tion of GDP going back to 1953-54. With the tax changes and the revenue that the opposition is bleating about, we have 1993-94 budget receipts-that iS,revenue to GDPestimated at 23.5 per cent with the revenue increases in there. The last time it was that low was in 1973-74, when it was 22.4 per cent. That is all revenue to GDP-23.5 per cent-which is the lowest in the industrialised world. With a one per cent budget deficit in 1996-97, that is carrying a commensurately low level of outlays. Anyone who is arguing beyond that, whether it is Max Walsh, with his dreary recital of his views, or any of the other people who argue this stuff incessantly, is saying, 'At the margin we will cut back the public sector by ripping away at health'-as the Leader of the Opposition suggests-' or social security, because a dollar or a million dollars or a billion dollars yielded here is preferable to taking that from the private sector, and we will let the private sector allocate it to whatever it wants'. If somebody wants to go and buy some properties out of the banks' property portfolios in the fire sales, if somebody wants to go and invest in whatever thing, regardless of its efficiency or its profitability, these people are saying, 'Yes, you do that. We say it is more important to let you spend a billion there. We'll take a billion off these key parts of the safety net and the social security system and we'll make that judgment'. Mr Costello interjecting",48
55,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I warn the honourable member for Higgins.,49
56,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"At these levels of outlays and receipts, that is irresponsible, fanatical, extremist and wrong, and we will have no bar of it whatsoever. In the 1980s we took government outlays in this country from 30.5 per cent of GOP to 23.5 per cent-seven per cent of gross domestic product; about $30,000 million a year. We now have the smallest revenue share in the OECO and a set of outlays to go with it. Anybody who is arguing that one can have a sophisticated, industrial economy like this, with all sorts of public services-be it in the areas of health, hospitals, roads, telecommunications, air services or anywhere else-and deliver them by cutting further into outlays is an extremist, or malicious or a fool. That is why we have cut outlays more than any cabinet in the Western world in the last 10 or 11 years. We have more experience with budgets and cutting outlays than any group of people in this country, including everybody in the media and the press gallery; all the junkie writers for the economic newsletters, and all the other people who want us to put on a hairshirt and rip away at the public entrails of this q:mntry. Mr Speaker, whether it is that bloated cane toad Paddy MCGuinness or Max Walsh, or whoever it is, let them go on notice. Let me make it quite clear: we are not cutting outlays any further-have they got the message?because it is irresponsible, it is indecent, it is unfair and it is just not smart. Accrued Leave: Tax Treatment",49
57,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,I direct my question to the Treasurer. I ask: will he confirm that the legislation that the government will be introducing to change the tax treatment of lump sum payments for unused annual leave and long service leave will be retrospective and will affect leave that has currently been accrued by Australian workers? How can the Treasurer justify retrospectively increasing the . tax rate from as low as 2.5 per cent to as high as 48.4 per cent?,49
58,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"The legislation that applies to this matter was introduced into the parliament last night, so the honourable member can read the bill and he can have the matter answered for himself. But this does give me an opportunity to clarify something which I think got a bit mangled in an answer of mine to a journalist at the Press Club when I misunderstood part of what the journalist was asking. The situation is that there are now pre-1978 and post-1978 concessions which apply to the unused annual and long service leave lump sum payments which people receive. Mr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145-the question of relevance. The Treasurer was asked to justify how he could increase that taxation, not to get onto how he mangled answers to other questions.",49
59,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order. The Treasurer is in order.,49
60,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"There are the pre-1978 benefits and the post-1978 concessions which apply. The preand post-I978 concessions will remain for those people who leave employment by virtue of a redundancy scheme or invalidity. But for those who are aged 55 and over as of now, they will retain just the benefits that apply in relation to the pre-1978 concessions. I think it is important to recall the purpose of annual leave and long service leave. The intention was that people in the work force would take them as they fell due. The reason for their introduction was for proper health and other reasons, in order to ensure that workers had an opportunity to take a holiday every year, and every few years take a longer break in the fonn of long service leave. When people take annual leave or long service leave in the nonnal course of their employment, they are taxed as if it were nonnal income. What we are doing here is ensuring that, apart from those concessions that I have mentioned, whenever people take advantage of annual leave or long service leave, whether it be as it falls due or at a later stage if they take it as a lump sum payment, it will be taxed in the same way. We think that is fair. Unemployment Mr GRJFF1N-Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of reports that the opposition intends to frustrate government initiatives in the budget to create training and job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Australians? Can the minister infonn the House of measures taken in last night's budget to provide support, assistance and opportunities for unemployed people, particularly for the long-tenn unemployed?",49
61,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The entire budget, in keeping with the direction of government policy for some considerable time now, is creating a climate in which, virtually uniquely among OECD countries, jobs can grow. Mr Thckey-What about Asia?",50
62,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The honourable member for O'Connor has, to every person who has stood at this dispatch box, been ululating about Asia-every time someone addresses the subject of outlays or taxation measures. Except once, when one of our people was up here answering a question and he said, 'What about HECS?', as opposed to, 'What about Asia?', which was an interesting leap-a leap that reveals the poverty of his thinking. Of course, that is exactly the point. If he were saying, 'What about Asia?' in relation to universities, the answer would be, 'You pay all your fees the· moment you enter the university', which does not happen in this country. The honourable member's heckling on the subject of HECS and the rest of his heckling is revealed in that regard. If someone were standing up in this place and he said, 'What about Asia?', we would be saying, 'There are no pensions, no unemployment programs. There are no unemployment benefits'. If you have no pensions, no unemployment programs, no unemployment benefits, you can have a hell of a low taxation system; do not worry on that score. If the honourable member is going to rock along here with his utterly .moronic interjections, he can expect to get more of the same. Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask the honourable member to withdraw his allegations about my interjections being moronic. If he is not prepared to do that, then I seek the opportunity to say a few things about him in a similar vein.",50
63,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,I cheerfully withdraw the expressions I used against the honourable member for O'Connor,50
64,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,You beat me to the punch because I would have requested you to do so.,50
65,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"because I owe the honourable member for O'Connor my seat. The honourable member for O'Connor managed to turn up at my electorate before a group from the racing industry with a huge blackboard and attempted to explain to this group of fonnerly Liberal voters what a GST would mean for the racing industry. There were about 400 of them there, and as I won by only 300Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 145, one could hardly classify this as relevant to the question.",50
66,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I am sure that the Leader of the House is aware of standing order 145 and is coming back to his answer.,50
67,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"It is actually relevant to the fact that I am giving an answer. t will leave the honourable member for O'Connor alone at this point, and I hope he will reciprocate, both to me and every other person at this dispatch box' wl)en they have an opportunity to answer questions. Contained in this budget is what the Prime Minister was talking about after the last election: that we will do our level best to make sure that people get back into work; but that in the period of time in which that was not possible there would be an arm placed out for members of the Australian public who were out of work, providing them with the opportunities to get back in and supporting them in their extremity. This budget certainly delivers on those undertakings. The problem of unemployment in this country will be a difficult one to resolve. not a unique problem but we are better placed to resolve it than most. If we look at the OECD projections for where job growth is going amongst all its member countries, we see that the EC countries in particular are expecting employment growth in the course of this year of minus 1.7 per cent, and they are expecting employment growth in 1994 of minus 0.2 per cent. In Australia, the growth expected this year is 0.7 per cent, and in 1994' it is 1.4 per cent. That is a very substantial difference between ourselves and the OECDMr Thckey-What about the Asian region?",50
68,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,I think that someone has put him on auto pilot.,51
69,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I suggest that the minister ignore the interjections.,51
70,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I will do my best. The point of those figures is that they show a substantially better performance in this country. I have seen estimates of figures for the whole of Europe in 1994 that suggest that there will be about 30 million people out of work. That will be a major tragedy. Of course, it imposes on the international economic system disciplines which we in this country could well do without. What we are going to live with, and what they are living with, is going to be a very lengthy period of unemployment for some people because they are also noticing in those countries a phenomenon that we are noticing here: job growth can be expected over time and job growth, as it was in this country, might be considerable; nevertheless, the nature of structural change in the work force is such that large numbers of people are going to find themselves out of work. For a long period of time they will require active measures-not passive measures-to get themselves back into the work force, to make themselves competitive with those who are in the work force and changing jobs, or immediately out of the work force and more attractive to employers, or those immediately out of the training system. The programs that we have put in place are utterly significant for those people. We will It is be assisting in the programs that have been put in place some 500,000 unemployed people with various jobsearch wage subsidy and direct job creation programs; 66 per cent of those places-some 331,000-going to the long-term unemployed. In total, there will be 644,000 places available, including for those who commenced this year, over that time. If Fightback had been implemented-we have been talking here about cuts and what ought to be done about cuts in government outlays-labour market programs would have been cut by some $435 million or 300,000 places. So the numbers that we are talking about of 500,000 would have been effectively cut by 60 per cent. There would have been absolutely no chance at all for those who are long-term unemployed to remain competitive in the work force. What were the opposition;s estimates? We have had the Leader of the Opposition and others in this place, both yesterday and today, talking about where they would have taken us, no doubt in their minds, on unemployment had they been in office. This is what their own estimates were in their honesty before Christmas as opposed to those after Christmas and a part of last year. In an interview, the Leader of the Opposition was asked: At what point in your first term do you think you will start to make inroads into the unemployment rate? The answer of the Leader of the Opposition was: I don't know where we will be. I will be happy to give you the predictions when we get there. So, okay, you don't get any noticeable improvement in the first 12 months in the unemployment rate. He was asked: But are you prepared to countenance that you might actually see a rise in the unemployment rate in the first 12 months? The Leader of the Opposition said: Well, I mean I'm happy to tell you that when I know. That is what those opposite understood would have been the situation that would have emerged during the next year or so. Of course, they anticipated no growth whatsoever from their policies in employment, because they anticipated imposing a most savage regime which must have had, at least in the first instance, a substantially deleterious effect on employment in this country. This budget keeps our promises, this budget exceeds our promises, in treating decently the long-term unemployed. It is the opposition which threatens, both by its activities in the Senate and elsewhere, the capacity for us to deliver on them. Exports: Indirect Tax Mr TIM F1SCHER-I direct my question to the Treasurer. In the budget speech the Treasurer claimed that the budget provides a boost for exporters. Could the Treasurer explain how much the indirect tax increases proposed in the budget will add to the cost of export and import competing industries and how this will make them more internationally competitive. Why has he put a new tax on export trade?",51
71,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"The budget works on the observations of the MCKinsey report, which identified that a large number-about 90 per cent-of the 6,000 manufacturing companies in Australia were not yet exporting, although most of whom probably could. I think most of those will take the example of the 700 small to medium size companies which are already demonstrating in such a profound way how Australia can compete in the world, and most particularly in Asia. It is in the Asian economies-probably the most competitive economies of all-where we are seeing the greatest growth in the export of our manufactured goods and services. While those opposite will alw-ys try to talk down Australian business, while they will always try to talk down the opportunities which Australian businesses have in the world, we are not: we are actually getting behind Australian business, particularly the medium sized and the small businesses, and doing what we can in the context of the MCKinsey report to give them both the encouragement and the inspiration to get out there and win new markets with their products and their services. That is the basis on which we are providing $94 million over the next few years specifically targeted to those companies and firms which have the greatest potential to go out there and not only earn profits for themselves but also earn export income for Australia and provide more jobs for Australian people.",52

76,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,I certainly do.,53
77,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Please proceed.,53
78,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"During question time, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) sought to perpetuate a myth that by some actions of mine his recent election prospects were improved. Mr Speaker, naturally you would gather that that was not the case, but the circumstances he refers to relate to a meeting held at the Western Australian Turf Club where both he and I were to debate the effects of the goods and services tax on racing. He made the point that 400 people were present and they were all Liberal voters. They were mostly people who did not reside within his electorate. The second fact in support of my position is that, had he not ducked out immediately the meeting was over, he would have discovered-as I did-that most people were more impressed with my presentation, and they did not help the minister at all. The simple fact was that he also stacked the meeting with paid members of government staff from Ron Edwards's office.",53

I in fact did not depart immediately from that meeting at all. I found staying on extremely enjoyable. The meeting had been organised at 6 o'clock after the last race at Ascot and the bar was left open during the entire two hours, so it was worthwhile staying on.",53
83,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister is now debating the point. He will resume his seat. NA Taxation,53
84,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The increases in taxation in the Budget which will fall most heavily on low income Australians and do nothing to create jobs. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",53
85,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"This budget will go down as one of the most dishonest budgets since Federation. It is probably the first time since Federation that a Treasurer has not been prepared to debate with the opposition' a budget that he has introduced. That is not surprising because the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), throughout this morning, has been holding his head in shame about this budget, and the people sitting behind him have daggers drawn in anger over the regressive nature of the budget. As someone put it yesterday, 'This is the budget which brings home the porkies'. This is the budget which included simply enormous increases in the burden of taxation. Over the next four years there will be a $32.2 billion increase in the total burden of taxation on Australians, compared with an increase of just $5 billion over the last four years. Thirty-two billion dollars is the equivaGDP lent of around $5,000 for every household in this country, or $4,200 for every working Australian. This massive increase in the tax burden is in total contrast to the promises made by the Labor Party in the lead-up to the last election. On 19 November last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, 'What I'm promising is not to put up tax'. Yet here we have a $32 billion overall increase in the tax burden. On 16 September the Treasurer said, 'I emphasise that the income tax cuts will be achieved without resort to any new taxes'. We have a $32 billion increase over ,four years in the burden of taxes. In the same speech the Treasurer went on to say, 'We will not increase the overall burden of tax'. They do increase the overall burden of tax, by $32 billion over four years. And so the Labor Party's campaign went on. During the election campaign itself, the Prime Minister said in his policy speech on 24 February, 'There will be no big, new taxes'. Thirty-two billion dollars worth of additional taxes on Australians is in stark contrast to the promise that was made by the Prime Minister and the promises that were made by other members of the Labor Party, including the Treasurer, in the lead-up to .the election. Rest assured, it will never be forgotten that the Labor Party went into the last election making promises that it never had any intention at all of keeping. Just as George Bush was eventually swept away for misleading the American people on taxes, despite the fact that he had successfully fought a war during his four-year term, so too will the Keating government be swept away because no-one will ever forget the dishonesty of its election campaign. One occasionally hears the defence pathetically put forward, 'What we were really talking about was not increasing taxes; we did not really mean that. We meant we won't increase taxes as a proportion of GDP'. Labor MPs have been going around the country this morning trying to argue that point. The fact is that that is not true either. In 1992-93 tax revenue as a proportion of GDP totalled 22.2 per cent. In 1996-97, at the end of this fouryear program, tax revenues as a proportion of will be 23.5 per cent. So even by that measure, or by any of the measures that the Labor Party set itself before the last election, taxes will be increasing substantially between now and 1996-97. No-one will ever forget the speech by the Prime Minister on 9 February this year to the National Press Club when he said about the income tax cuts, 'They are not a promise; they are law-I-a-w, law'. No-one will ever forget that. The Labor Party thinks now that it is clever to go around and say that it is changing the law so the changes will still be law. That is the mentality of the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear). What level of integrity does the honourable member for Canning have in going around pushing arguments such as that at the Australian people? He will never get away from it, and he is not getting away with it in his home town of Perth today. The Prime Minister will not get away with the utter dishonesty of those promises which have been shot at the Australian people. Not only is this budget a grossly dishonest budget and, therefore, a dishonourable budget; it is a budget which is regressive; it is a budget which launches a vicious attack on low income Australians, on the people who have borne the burden of the recession. that the Labor Party imposed on them in the first place. !Ii 10 years of Labor government, the 10 per cent poorest Australians have seen their real incomes decline by 10 per cent. That has occurred under a Labor government. Even in Britain during Mrs Thatcher's years in office the 10 per cent poorest people saw an 11 per cent real increase in their living standards. But in this country, under Labor, their living standards were pushed down by 10 per cent. Then to add insult to injury-moral injury and moral insult-the government has imposed a whole range of totally regressive taxes on those people. The party that claims to be an advocate of social justice shows no understanding of social justice and no understanding of compassion. The likes of Curtin, Chifley and, dare I mention, Jack Lang wbuld turn in their graves if they could see a Labor government introducing a budget which had such a dire impact on low income Australians; on those Australians who are least able to look after themselves. It is contrary to the fundamental values of fairness and equity in this country that any government should impose such a regressive burden on the weaker members of our society. When we look at the budget in detail we can see what that burden is. The sales and fuel taxes alone will amount to something like $9 billion in additional taxes on Australians over the next three years. It is not surprising that even the President of the ACTU, who is no enemy of the Australian Labor Party-he has gone out of his way to help the Labor Party wherever he can-had to resort to saying on television last night that to defend this budget was to 'defend the indefensible'. That is a view well and truly held by many other members of the labour movement around this country. !Ii relation to the increase in the fuel in particular the tax on leaded fuel-the Labor Treasurer of Queensland said today that this was the ultimate regressive tax. He went on to say, 'It impacts heaviest on those who can least afford it in a whole range of ways'. Many Labor members in this House-the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) and the spokesperson for the caucus, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford)-have made similar remarks this morning, as has the Premier of Queensland and the Premier of South Australia. Labor premiers, Labor backbenchers in this place and Labor members all over Australia are damning this dishonourable and dishonest budget. People might think the fringe benefits tax is a clever measure. The· impact of the increases in that tax is again passed on to ordinary Australians in terms of higher prices. When we add on top of that the impact of the sales tax increases and look at the impact on living standards, we find one interesting fact which might be worthy of the government's contemplation. As Professor Neil Warren from the University of New South Wales has worked out today, the impact of all the increases in indirect taxes in this budget will be to increase food prices by about 0.7 per cent. That is a significant impact on food prices; even though food is not directly subjected to the sales tax. The tax affects electricity prices and gas and water prices. When it comes to things like stamps and telephone calls, the hollow logging of government business enterpriseswhich was a great favourite of the Cain and Wran governments-that the government· is getting into will only increase those charges and therefore impose an additional burden on low income people. But what compensation is there in this budget? For people earning less than about $23,000 there is supposed to be some compensation in the very generous form of two measly dollars a week. That is it-$2 a week in compensation for low income Australians taxin order to offset an increase of about $5 in the price of filling up a car with leaded fuel. On top of that, there are increases in sales tax and increases in a whole range of other costs brought about by the downstream effect of those increases in taxes. What the Prime Minister is giving is $2 a week in guilt money to low income Australians. It is a shameful thing for any government, let alone a Labor government, to doto introduce a budget which is so viciously regressive as this budget is. At the end of the day one would hope, for all the pain, for all the broken promises, for all the viciousness of this budget in regard to low income earners, that there would be some national benefit. At the end of 1996-97 we will have accumulated from 1991-92 an additional $70 billion worth of debt. That is on top of a public sector debt which is already $130 billion. If one looks at the public sector - nterest bill on that debt, one sees that, accordmg to the budget papers, from today until 1996-97 it will increase by a massive 90 per cent to $9.9 billion a year. This budget is supposed to be about jobs. How many jobs is the budget going to create? We are told by the Treasurer and the fraudulent Prime Minister that the primary objective of the budget is jobs. The fact is that the government's own figures show that after the agony of this budget the average unemployment rate for 1993-94 will be 10.75 per cent, whereas the unemployment rate in July was 10.7 per cent. So on average, the unemployment rate will be ever so slightly higher for a year in which enormous pain is being imposed on Australians in a budget which is supposed to have the primary objective of creating jobs. What about business investment? It is conceded that the budget has lost the plot in terms of business investment. There is a 0.25 per cent increase in business investment, which is at its lowest level since records have been kept. A quarter of a per cent increase in business investment: what a tribute to failure that is! When one looks at this famous claim that the government is going to. reduce outlays, this phoney figure .that it is reducing the budget deficit by $2 billion, one finds that it is utterly false. The budget deficit increases from $14.5 billion to $16 billion and that, in itself, is an example of cooking the books. There is $2.5 billion worth of asset sales which the government conveniently rolls in as though it is some sort of revenue. There are extraordinary Reserve Bank profits. It has increased dividends through hollow logging by something like $800 million, and it has decided to put a $500 million contingency reserve into the figures as well. So a $16 billion deficit in real terms is more like a $22 billion deficit, and over the four years we will see spending increase by something like 6 per cent in real terms. There is no gain in this budget. There is no gain in terms of competitiveness, no gain in terms of net savings, no gain in terms of investment, no gain in terms of jobs, just agony and pain, and the people who bear the brunt of that pain are low income Australians.

86,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"One thing we do know, if anybody believed anything the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), said, is that it could have been worse. Can honourable members imagine what would have happened if he had been sitting on this side of the House as Treasurer today? He went to the last election talking about a goods and services tax. He was talking about putting up the cost of water rates, electricity biIls, bus fares, hair cuts and all those. sorts of things that are not taxed now. He was going to put 15 per cent on the lot of them, on every service. Who is it who consumes the services? Mr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is the convention of this place that on this occasion, that is, the day after the budget is handed down, when the MPI is called on, the Treasurer responds. It has always been the convention since Federation.",56
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Jenkins)Order! There is no point of order. Mr Downer-I just want to complete my point of order. It has been the convention since Federation. Conventions are an important part of the way in which this place works. To put forward a backbencher or a junior parliamentary secretary to respond is entirely inappropriate.,56
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,57
89,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"The simple fact is that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) would not even waste his time on the honourable member for Mayo. At the last election opposition members were going around the countryside talking about putting on a 15 per cent goods and services tax, and the honourable member for Mayo comes in here and talks about the so-called regressive nature of the proposals in the budget last night. The simple fact is that if he got his way there would be $27 billion more in tax every year. On the opposition's figuring, that would add to inflation four to five per cent, with no wages policy to make sure that it was swept out of the inflationary figures. Honourable members could imagine what that would do to business confidence. The introduction of the GST would not have created one job, unless we take the Australian Taxation Office into account. The GST was so complicated that even its author did not understand it. The honourable member for Mayo would have slashed government 'spending by $10 billion. Last night we cut outlays by $2 billion. For every $1 cut last night, the opposition would have cut $5, yet honourable members opposite are asking questions about budget cuts. The simple fact is that our budget cuts are very moderate indeed compared with anything the opposition would have done. Let us have a look at one of the claims of the shadow Treasurer about the $32 billion tax cut. The simple fact is that he is using figures very selectively. The budget measures raise $3.6 billion in 1996-97. We also have a saving of $3.6 billion by deferring the tax cuts. The ,most important thing is to understand that there is nothing taxed today that was not taxed yesterday; there are no new taxes in this budget. The remainder of the growth in tax revenues that is projected by 1996-97 stems from economic growth and earnings growth. Of course, the honourable member for Mayo wraps all of that up and says that it will be $32 billion. Anyone who knows anything about statistics knows just how false that is. The matter of public importance before us today talks about the impact of the taxation on low income families. Let us have a look at the way in which low income families have fared under this government. It is understandably and undeniably the case that in the last 10 years this government has given most of its assistance to low income earners. That is why all our previous tax cuts were directed in the main to low income earners. When we attained government in 1983, the lower tax rate was 30 per cent. That has fallen now to 20 per cent. We also introduced the family allowance supplement for low income families, which we have increased since that time in real terms by 75 per cent. Also, under this government the real value of the pension has increased by nearly 14 per cent-that is over and above inflation. All of these real increases will be preserved under this government because, unlike previous governments, they are fully indexed to rise with the CPI. So any increase in prices as a result of tax changes announced last night will feed automatically into higher benefits for people and families on low incomes; they are fully protected. Moreover, we are introducing a $100 tax rebate for low income earners. But the bulk of the personal tax cuts announced last night are quite deliberately targeted at middle Australia, which has in the main not-!>enefited as much from previous tax cuts. Mr Costello-There were no tax cuts announced last night, George.",57
90,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"Where was the honourable his member for Higgins when I announced them? Tax rates of 38 per cent and 46 per cent for middle income earners are simply too high. It is worth remembering that since March 1983 the government has lowered that marginal tax rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. The tax rate on incomes above or around $20,000 has been lowered from 46 per cent to 38 per cent and from 1 November down to 34 per cent. If the government had not lowered the tax rates, taxpayers on $25,000, currently about 75 per cent of average weekly earnings, would now be paying $2,000 more in tax than they are under the current tax scale. Taxpayers under similar circumstances on $33,000 would be paying $2,500 more. I think it is worth remembering when we look at the budgetary context that it is not enough to look at one budget. We have to look at what the government has done in its term of office, spread across the 11 budgets we have brought down. The general thrust has been that in the early years we looked after people on low incomes and now we believe that this year people on average weekly earnings, or about average weekly earnings, should also be looked after. Of course, one thing that is forgotten all often is the fact that people on low incomes do not pay the Medicare levy. Under a bill I introduced in the parliament last night, a couple with two children and a family income of up to $25,500 will pay no Medicare levy whatsoever. To round off what we have done for people on low incomes, by 1995, even after the indirect tax measures are implemented, pensioners will still be better off in real terms than when this government came to power. By June 1995 a pensioner couple will be 18 per cent better off in real terms. A single pensioner will be 21 per cent better off as a result of the changes we have made in the last 10 years of our government. A jobsearch allowance recipient with two children under 13 receiving rent assistance will be nearly 30 per cent better off. So when looking at what the government has done for people on low incomes we have protected them. The budget presented last night looks at providing a short-term stimulus and at getting the conditions right for sustainable growth. It is about creating lasting jobs. Clearly the most important problem facing the government is unemployment. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) pointed out today, Australia is not alone in experiencing high unemployment.  own paper.",57
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will resume his seat and cease interjecting.,58
92,Mr GEAR,Unknown,You have to use the West Australian as .an authority. ,58
93,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will resume his seat.,58
94,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"The simple fact is that the budget deficit for 1993-94 will be increased from last year. There will be a $16 billion stimulus-a further one-half of one per cent of GDP. To add to the stimulus this year, we will be bringing forward the tax cuts to operate from 1 November. The honourable member for Mayo talked too about the fact that there would not be any job growth this year. Clearly that is wrong. An extra 100,000 people will find jobs. We know it is not enough, but we know we have to make the necessary changes now to budgetary policy to make sure that sustainable growth into the future is maintained. One of the waywe are going to do that is to make sure that in 1996-97 we bring the budget deficit back to around one per cent of GDP. That was also foreshadowed in last night's budget. In this budget the funding for labour market programs has been increased to $1.3 billion to provide over half a million job subsidy work experience and training places for the unemployed in 1993-94. By contrast-l made a note when he was speaking earlier-the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced to the House that under Fightback 300,000 places would have gone, a chop of $435 million. When we look at the way this government addresses the unemployment problem compared with the way the opposition does, in terms of support for people who are out of work, the contrast could not be more marked. The simple fact is that labour market programs play a very important role in ensuring that the people who are out of work receive skills and the confidence to make sure that when there is an upturn in the job market they are better positioned to take advantage of the jobs that become available. Furthermore, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has established an expert committee on employment opportunities. The committee will examine current policies on unemployment and possible alternatives and will prepare a discussion paper by December this year. That will form the basis for broad community debate, leading to a government white paper on this issue. While Australia has now reported economic growth for seven consecutive quarters and presently has a growth rate that is one of the highest in the DECO, we clearly need stronger growth. One Nation, the 1992-93 budget, and Investing in the Nation have all provided a stimulus to activity. Eleven years of reform have transformed the economy. There have been spin-off advantages for business, some of which I would like to mention now: the lowest inflation in 30 years; the lowest interest rates in 20 years; the restoration of profit share; the reduction in the number of industrial disputes to record lows; a flexible. wages policycurrently there are approximately 1,000 federally registered enterprise agreements. Other advantages include the cut in the corporate tax rate from 46 per cent in 1983 to the present rate of 33 per cent, which ensures that our companies are better placed to cOlnpete in this region; the abolition of the double taxation of equity income through the introduction of dividend imputation makes it more attractive now for investors to put their money into productive rather than speculative investment; the introduction of the general investment allowance, the development allowance and measures to facilitate government approval of investment projects; accelerated depreciation; and a 30 per cent improvement in our international competitiveness since the early 1980s. We believe that businesses are now poised to take advantage of these reforms-just last week, Coles Myer made an announcement. I am Sijre that is a sign of things to come. Before the election the development allowance had flushed out about $100 billion worth of projects. They may not all go ahead but at least people are thinking about investing in those projects. Business investment which stabilised in 1992-.93 is forecast to accelerate in the course of 1993-94. Plant and equipment investment will be sharply up. There will be a mild pickup in non-residential construction, particularly in shops, factories and engineering construction, which will generate jobs. In the second half of 1993-94 economic growth will exceed three per cent on an annualised basis. The budget is also addressing the need.in the medium term to consolidate Australia's fiscal position. This was the clear message coming out of the National Fiscal Outlook and the Fitzgerald report. Australia is not alone in its efforts to improve its medium-term fiscal position. For instance, Germany and the United States are both consolidating their budgetary positions. Compared to some other countries we are better placed to achieve our objectives. Much of the hard work on outlays was already done in the 1980s. The budget deficit will fall from 3.8 per cent of GOP to the announced target of around one per cent by 1996-97. Given the weakness in the tax revenue and particularly in indirect taxes, the cuts in outlays already achieved, the government considered that it would be inappropriate and unsympathetic to attempt to achieve all the public savings required on the outlay side. The simple fact is that Australia is a low taxing country. Next month, as the Treasurer pointed out, Australia will be announced as the lowest taxing country in the DECO. The budget measures will keep Australia in the low tax league. The opposition is galled by the simple fact that the budget does not introduce any new taxes. Not one thing is taxed today that· was not taxed yesterday. I would like to hear from the next speaker about something that is taxed today that was not taxed yesterday. Mr Costello-You'll hear from me, George.",58
95,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"Good. Let us have that in the honourable member's address. We are broadening the income tax base by removing unjustified concessions. We are addressing the erosion in the indirect tax base and restoring the indirect tax mix which had become lopsided. Of the indirect taxes, petrol tax was an obvious area-obviously because, by international standards, our petrol prices are the third lowest in the industrialised world, and also because Australia's tax as a proportion of the price is low and will remain amongst the lowest. The budget last night was the right budget for the times. It has provided the stimulus right now when it is needed and it will draw on that stimulus to get the budget deficit back to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, when we believe an upturn in world growth will lead to higher business investment in Australia. (TIme expired)",59
96,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Higgins) (3.28 p.m.)The first point to make about this matter of public importance today is that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) refuses to front. The budget for the Commonwealth of Australia was handed down last night. This is the first opportunity that this parliament has to debate it and the Treasurer refuses to come into the chamber. He refuses to stand up to try to defend his own budget because he knows, as Martin Ferguson said on television last night, that you cannot defend the indefensible. The fact that the Treasurer is not in the chamber today just illustrates again that this Treasurer has walked away from his own budget. Just as he walked out of the House of Representatives chamber, he walked away from his own budget. When someone is taken into a court he is asked whether he pleads guilty or not guilty. The answer for the Treasurer would be, 'No appearance from the accused, Your Honour'. He cannot be found. He is not even here to plead not guilty and to tell us why he has not failed the Australian people. He cannot even come into this chamber. Who does the government send into the chamber? It sends into the chamber someone who reminded us today that he in fact is a minister. He is sent in today to defend the budget. It would be like Ted Dexter sending in Phil Tufnell to open the batting for England. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is sent into this chamber to defend this year's budget. The Treasurer cannot come into the chamber. The Treasurer cannot give a speech at the National Press Club. The Treasurer cannot plead. The Treasurer cannot even justify himself. The government sends in the Assistant Treasurer to defend this year's budget. The government might as well walk away from it. The Assistant Treasurer's silence and the Treasurer's absence speak volumes about the government's approach to this budget. The Treasurer is probably down at a caucus meeting making sure that he does not get rolled over the optometry rebate-or is he down at a caucus meeting now defending his lOc leaded petrol rise? Every one of the caucus members has been on the radio today saying what he or she felt about the budget. The Treasurer cannot come into this chamber to defend his budget. Why? Because he is not defending it from this side of the House; he is defending it from that side of the House. Honourable members opposite are legitimately concerned. They know they let Australia down. After this budget the Treasurer will never be called 'Honest John'. The Treasurer can be absolutely sure that we will never see that on his tombstone. Coming to the budget itself, the centrepiece is to reduce the deficit. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has pointed out that the deficit increases this year. The government has this idea to head the deficit south and it has started off by going north. We have gone from $14.6 billion to $16 billion. If we take back the asset sales, the GBE dividends and the asset contingency, we have a $20 billion deficit, or a $40 billion cumulative deficit with about another $28 billion to come. I think this government might have a secret plan, a secret agenda, in all of these deficits. I think the government's secret agenda might be to try to make the Whitlam government look responsible. Over a three-year period the Whitlam government only managed to get to about $6 billion. This is a government with $40 billion of deficits in the last three years that has wiped out the surpluses we hear so much about more than two times over. The most frightening thing is that the government plans to go on with cumulative deficits for another three years. We get to the government's supposed target for 1996-97 only by fiddling the growth rates. One has only to pull the growth rates out of this year's budget and compare them with the One Nation growth rates. They are almost the same. The government loves these figures that have three-quarters in them. In One Nation the government was projecting 4.75 per cent; it got 2.5 per cent. We see the same numbers coming back in this year's budget. When the government sits down to do GDP growth forecasts it picks a figure, doubles it, subtracts three, adds six and then sends it up to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to get the· real number. The Prime Minister pencils in the real number. Then it is done out on growth forecasts of four per cent plus, which the government knows ate false, over the next four years-and 10 and behold, whacky-do, we finally reach the target. Everybody in Australia knows that that is false. Everybody knows that the government is tinkering again. It has done it before and it is doing it again. The government did it with the One Nation forecasts and it is doing it with this budget. Those budget targets will not be met. That is a complete fabrication. We look at the fiscal account on this budget, and we look at the year the government reaIIy does know about-1993-94-and the proof is in the pudding. The budget deficit is heading north, not south. The second thing that stands out about this budget is that it is a massive tax slug. Before the election, this government had the people of Australia drinking a very interesting cocktail. It was a cocktail that had a mixture of all sorts of spirits. One of the elements of the cocktail was no new indirect taxes. Another element of the cocktail was huge income tax l-a-w cuts. Another element of the cocktail was no reductions in public spending. The going government managed to get enough Austral- . 'We ians to drink that cocktail to get itself into government. So what happened this morning? The Australian public experienced a very big hangover because they began to see what price of drinking that cocktail came out in a IOc hike in petrol prices, a 10 per cent hike in the wine tax, and a two per Igoing cent increase in wholesale sales tax. Taking the lowest rate of wholesale sales tax, which was 10 per cent, that has been put up to per cent-a 20 per cent increase. The government has taken a 15 per cent tax to 17 per cent, a 20 per cent tax to 22 per cent, and so on. This is a budget that is making tax into an art form. As we were saying last night, the Commissioner of Taxation is going to go gang busters when collecting tax as a result of this budget. At the end of the day, after collecting all of those taxes-after, making the Australian public pay the price-what will be the result in terms of jobs? The answer is a high unemployment rate-an unemployment rate that is actuaIIy as high at the end of the year as it was at the beginning. This government has created a lot of industries. It has an industry around the training guarantee levy. It has an industry around the super guarantee charge. It now has an industry around labour market programs. There are 500,000 Australians involved in labour market programs. What happens to them when they come off those programs? Where do they go then because the unemployment rate is in fact higher at the end of the year than it was at the beginning? It must give great comfort to all . the unemployed to go into labour market programs which simply rearrange the queues . for jobs that do not presently exist and, on this government's own figuring, will not exist at the end of the year. When we come to petrol tax, we must go back to what the Prime Minister said himself. Does anyone. know what the present Prime Minister told this parliament on 3 November 1983 when he was attacking Malcolm Fraser over petroleum excise? He said: I do not remember any of the phoneys opposite to the people at the 1977 election and saying, will tax petrol and we will lift receipts ... ' back But of course they did. Honourable members opposite have no integrity whatsoever. Mrs Sullivan-Who said that?",60
97,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"The Prime Minister said the that on 3 November 1983. I will read it was. The price verbatim. He said: do not remember any of the phoneys opposite to the people at the 1977. el-tion - d saying: 'We will tax petrol and we WIll lIft receIpts ... But of course they did. Honourable members 12 opposite have no integrity whatsoever. What is the most damning plea? It is when someone convicts themselves out of their own mouth. A quote like that is a conviction out of the mouth of the Prime Minister and government. The government did not go into the last election talking about increases in wholesale sales tax. It did not talk about petroleum excise. It did not talk about wine taxes. It not talk about any of the things that it has introduced. The government went to the last election deceiving the Australian public about what it was going to do. Now the chickens last are coming home to roost. The porkies are coming home. The hangover is here. There ries, are no jobs at the end of it and the governlevels ment stands condemned as guilty.",61
98,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,"In rising to speak on this matter of public portance, it is worthwhile at the outset to highlight some of the contradictions in what has been said by speakers opposite in the debate today. There has been a focus so far on issues relating to the deficit and how there should be massive cuts in public expenditure. That has been part of the opposition's cry. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today in' question time, part of the rhetoric coming from the opposition over the last hours has been that there were not enough cutbacks in the budget. At the same time, we have been getting that phoney questions about the impact of one measure or another, or the impact of some the indirect taxes on different elements within the community. What is clear from the oppowe sition is that its approach now is no different from its approach before the last election. fundamental approach is to slash and burn public expenditure items in the areas of programs health, social security, education and Does the opposition realise that the people who will be hurt by that approach are the very people about which it claims and purports in this matter of public importance to be concerned? The fact is that we are now in a situation where the economy is growing, but growing slowly. The recovery is proceeding but not quickly enough. . What we need to do from a national peropportunity spective is still maintain some stimulus in the economy because without that it is clear from the last quarterly accounts figures that growth will not proceed. Australia has a growth rate his that is more acceptable than that of most OECD countries. Part of the reason for that growth is the responsible stimulus that has been applied over the last 18 months. This budget delivered last night maintains did that responsible stimulus approach. That is why it is reasonable, in my opinion, to take the view that this year's deficit can be marginally higher as a percentage of GOP than year's deficit. It is still only 3.8 per cent. If we look around most of the OECD countit is interesting to see what their deficit are as a percentage of GOP. They are six per cent and seven per cent. Yet the opposition says that to have 3.8 per cent this imyear is somehow financially and economically irresponsible. That is dead wrong. It is providing an appropriate stimulus to try to ensure that until we get sufficient private sector investment some of the public outlays and the fiscal stimulus will keep the economy moving and employment growing, hopefully more catchquiCkly, through the year. It is important to note that the level of unemployment is too high. It is a matter of 24 major concern to the government. All of the items in the budget papers focus very preciselyon that issue. But it is also worth noting the job participation rate is at an historically high level as well. It is reasonable in of those circumstances to say, 'Yes, we want to keep more jobs going, but at the same time want to ensure that all people in the community get the benefits of jobs as they Its come through. But in the meantime, for the people that cannot get work, we will provide to ensure they get training and skills so on. to get back into the work force'. The opposition spent time today lambasting the various labour market initiatives, when all the figures show that the people who go through those programs have dramatically improved prospects of going back into the work force by having those opportunities. The opposition wants to cut all those things out. It does not believe in giving people the that might be required, as a result of restructured processes and so forth, to get a further start. That is exactly what this budget is doing: it is building on those initiatives. In looking at the question of taxation, it is important to compare estimates of revenue and expenditure this year as a percentage of GDP with past years. Revenue is estimated to be 23.5 per cent of GDP in 1993-94-slightly lower than in 1992-93. This is the lowest proportion of GDP since 1973-74 and well below the levels of the 1980s. That gives some of the real impact of what is actually occurring. So when claims are,made about taxation levels within this country and about the tax impost on the community at large, it is reasonable to point to the facts rather than the fiction we get from the opposition. When we come to the question of delivery on promises and tax cuts, the government made commitments in the One Nation statethe ment about taxation. It has now recognised that growth has not proceeded at a fast ough rate since the time of projections in February 1992 to achieve economic objecAgain, tives. As a result, the stimulus that is provided through the tax cuts that come in from 1 November this year will go to exactly the people who in the continuing restructuring the tax system need to be re,-ognised more than they have up to now-that is, those in the tax brackets from $20,700 to around $45,000 to $50,000. Middle-income Australia is rightly getting recognition. Previous adjustdirected ments in the tax system have taken other scales down already. As a result of these measures being brought in, people who have earnings of about $30,000· per annum will have a marginal tax rate of 34c in the That change is a positive step when we recognise that we have also put in an initial rebate arrangement for people with incomes up to $23,000 per annum. As well as that, have ensured that those people get proper assistance through proper family income supplement arrangements that give real support to families in the lower income brackets. That is fundamentally what the measures built into this package are all no doubt that what is needed to repair the fiscal position of the nation is stronger nomic growth; there is no· argument about that. The question is: what sorts of ingredients should we move towards to get that? When it is said that the government has not taken steps to try to promote investment and growth, I think we should point to the record. By pointing to the record, we can easily debunk the sorts of points members of the opposition have made. Do members of the opposition seriously suggest that having the lowest inflation rate in 20 years and the lowest inflationary expectations in living memory are not going to be a stimulus to economic recovery? Well, they cannot. Do they seriously suggest that the lowest interest rates in 30 years are not also a positive step towards getting investment and economic growth going? Of course they cannot. Do they really believe that economic growth can be achieved without pointing to sorts of programs we have coming out of the MCKinsey study as relating to emerging enexporters and so on? They are part of the additional help for exporters in this budget. those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say there should be slash and burn to all programs and then expect the exports to just occur somehow instantaneously of without that sort of process. The one-stop shopping for exporters, the access enhancement programs and marketing arrangements for exporters are all very much at achieving for small businesses the tax very things they know are the key to their economic future, that is, access to markets in Asia, which people talk about but not enough is done about. The measures in this budget go dollar. a long way towards those ends. The opposition also says that there should be cutbacks in expenditure in all other sorts of government programs such as those for the we development of Australian tourism, which is one of our growth and employment industries. There is more money in the budget for tourism because we know it is one of the areas where some investment by the public sector, coupled with major investment by the private sector, multiplies into more tourists and more about. There is jobs for Australians. They are the sorts of initiatives that properecoly targeted programs involving both government outlays and partnership with the private sector, can and will achieve. This budget is very much about building on those strengths. We now have development allowances, investment allowances and accelerated depreciation arrangements. There is a variety of measures to promote private sector investment. The ingredients are there; it is up to the private sector to play its part in getting those investments going and getting major projects off the ground, thus helping to get employment for all Australians. There is no more important thing than getting jobs for all Australians. As far as this budget is' concerned, the continuing recognition of labour market programs is particularly important. The concentration on providing opportunities to the long-term unemployed is a commendable initiative; one that should be taken and one that should not be decried by the opposition. The increased measures being taken in the budget to provide help to older Australians, through the area of health and so on, are all about looking after those families most in need. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has already provided details about the additional guarantees for pensioners in regard to their income support. All of these measures are about giving stimulus for growth in the economy and hope to all Australians. They are a recognition of the government's fundamental commitment to its social justice objectives for all Australians, no matter what their station in life. With those thoughts in mind, all honourable members should welcome the budget. (TIme expired)",62
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion is concluded. STANDING ORDER 399 Suspension Motion (by Mr Beddall) agreed to: That notice No.1, government business, postponed until the next sitting. AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVESTOCK (QUOTAS) AMENDMENT BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read first time. Second Reading",64
100,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to extend the 0 operation of the Australian Meat and Livestock (Quotas) Act 1990 for a further three years until 28 December 1996. The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 provides the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation with the powers to establish quota schemes for the export oof meat and live sheep from Australia in particular circumstances. In the case of meat, the act empowers the corporation to operate quota schemes where restrictions are imposed,or likely to be . imposed, on Australian exports by importing countries or by the Australian government. Honourable members will be aware that the corporation currently operates quota schemes for beef, mutton and goat m-at to the United States and for beef, sheepmeat and buffalo meat to the European Community in response to restrictions imposed by those markets. Quota on meat must be allocated free of charge. In each of the last three years, Australia has reluctantly agreed to restrain exports of meat to the United States to avoid imposition of quotas under the US meat import law, otherwise known as the MIL. The imposition of so-called voluntary restraint agreements not only disrupts our trade to the US-which is a major market for beef, worth in excess of $1.1 billion-but also creates uncertainty and impacts on the stability of Australia's domestic and other export markets. The MIL continues to be a trade irritant between Australia and the United States, and be the Australian government is seeking to achieve the elimination of it as part of a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round. Similarly, the EC imposes quotas on the import of beef and sheepmeat. Although the access level of Australian meat into the EC is relatively small-some 17,500 torines of a sheepmeat, 6,032 tonnes of beef and 2,250 tonnes of buffalo meat-the community represents an important market for high valued product, worth almost $146 million in 1991-92. The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 empowers the corporation to operate quota systems as well on live sheep and lambs where the corporation considers it in the best interests of the industry to do so. Quota on live sheep and lambs may be allocated free of charge or by auction, sale by tender or private sale. The corporation has not used the powers conferred on it in relation to live sheep but, once the live sheep trade is resumed to Saudi Arabia, these powers will give the corporation the option, if necessary, to control the supply of live sheep for export to the Saudi Arabian market as part of a mutually satisfactory arrangement under which the trade could operate. Australia voluntarily suspended the live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia in 1991 following a series of rejections supposedly for quarantine reasons. The trade was suspended with the full support of the industry to prevent further damage to the international standing of the Australian live sheep industry as a supplier of quality livestock in the Middle East and to ensure that the government's animal welfare obligations were met. To ensure all quota arrangements are equitable, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 requires the details of proposed quota allocation and management schemes to be set out in the AMLC's corporate plan, which must have ministerial approval. These details must also be available to exporters. There is also a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in respect of AMLC decisions regarding the period of validity of quotas and variations to quotas granted. The AMLC is also required to publish details of all quotas allocated in its annual report. Passage of this bill will not affect governregulatory ment expenditure and will have no staffing implications for the Commonwealth. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum.  journed. NA NA 1993 Consideration resumed. Second Reading",64
101,Mr BEDDALL,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to make a number of amendments to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. These amendments are intended to: enhance the accountability arrangements for the ABC; improve administrative arrangements under the act; and reflect changes. to complaints handling procedures to align with processes introduced by the broadcasting services legislation. There are, in addition, a number of minor technical amendments to the ABC act. I now turn to the details of the bill. Although the ABC is primarily budget funded and the parliament can scrutinise the ABC's activities through the details of its appropriations, the ABC is also involved in commercial activities in relation to which there is a need for additional accountability arrangements. These commercial activities, which include the production, licensing and sales of program all related products, are authorised by the ABC act or implicit within the ABC's charter, Although the ABC is subject to the Trade Practices Act and to most state regulatory controls, it enjoys some competitive advantages over private businesses, including exemptions from state and Commonwealth taxes, except sales tax and customs duty on goods for resale; exemptions from many corporate requirements; access to publicly funded infrastructure; and free radio and television promotions. The potential problems with ABC involvement in competitive business activities are: that under the protection of public ownerfirst ship and subsidy, the ABC may deter sibility private businesses from entering a particular market, or may unfairly disadvantage any business which is in that market; and that those budget funded activities-which have traditionally been considered the prime functions of the ABC, such as its free television and radio services-may suffer from the ABC's involvement in nonroutine traditional commercial and semi-commercial activities. To minimise the risk to taxpayers' funds and detriment to the quality of free to air gramming, and to address concerns about the ABC's competitive advantage, this bill will apply more rigorous financial accountability requirements. The amendments will apply new corporate planning and annual reporting requirements for the ABC, embracing all of its functions, and are consistent with provimodify sions already approved by parliament as of the Special Broadcasting Services Act 1991. Under the proposed arrangements, the ABC will be required to include in its corporate plan its objectives and overall strategies for fulfilling its functions. The plan will also to include forecasts of revenue and expendicontracts ture-including capital expenditure and borrowings-as well as performance indicahedging contracts. tors, for all authorised businesses in which the ABC participates. In addition to the corporate planning quirements, the ABC board will be required to include in its annual report an assessment of the extent to which its operations have achieved the corporate plan objectives and disclose the particulars of business activities carried out during the year, including those conducted through subsidiary companies joint ventures. The government will monitor the effects of these amendments. If it conwith siders that they do not resolve the problem unfair competition or that commercial activiABC. ties are imposing undue risk to funds approto priated for charter purposes, the government will consider the need for further legislation. The bill contains a number of minor amendments ments which are intended to enhance the administrative efficiency of the ABC. The of these deals with the transfer of responfor some routine administrative decisions from the ABC board to the corporation. These include decisions about the publishing of journals and the making of sound recordings et cetera, and setting charges for these items. I believe that it is entirely appropriate to air that the board should not be required by legislation to be involved in what are clearly administrative matters for which officers of the ABC are responsible on a daily basis. The board will retain ultimate responsibility profor determining what constitutes an advertisement for the purposes of the act and for the annual report of the ABC, but the bill amends the act to make it clear that the board does not have to be involved in the day-today administration. of these activities. The bill also contains an amendment to the existing provisions allowing the part ABC to enter into hedging contracts. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that the ABC can enter into hedging contracts or other arrangements in relation to borrowings approved by the Treasurer in the absence of ministerial guidelines. The ABC act currently have empowers the ABC to enter"" into hedging and enables the minister to issue guidelines governing ABC involvement in To date there has been no need to develop guidelines but there has been some uncertainrety about whether the ABC can enter into hedging arrangements in the absence of guidelines. The amendment provides clarification that the ABC can enter into hedging to contracts or arrangements in the absence of guidelines but retains the power of the minister to determine guidelines, if the or minister considers it necessary. The final administrative amendment deals the determination of recreation leave of entitlements for the Managing Director of the This is consequential to an amendment the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 which empowered the Remuneration Tribunal to determine standard recreation leave entitlefor all full-time public office holders. The objective was to ensure the same formal recreation leave entitlements for these office holders as their equivalents in the Australian Public Service. The amendment to the ABC Act provides that the Remuneration Tribunal will detennine the recreation leave entitleproposed ments for the Managing Director of the ABC. Section 82 of the ABC Act requires appointment of community affairs officers within the ABC to investigate complaints the ABC about. errors of fact in ABC prothrough grams and invasions of privacy by the in the preparation or broadcast of programs. The provision was included in the ABC at a time when there was no independent avenue of appeal for complaints about ABC programming. The provisions are no longer considered necessary because of the introduction complaints handling procedures set out in the broadcasting services legislation. The Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 amendThey ed the ABC Act to require the ABC to duce codes of practice in relation to its programming, and the Broadca-ting Services Act 1992 empowered the Australian Broadcommend casting Authority to investigate complaints relation to the perfonnance of the ABC against its codes of practice. The ABC board has given an undertaking that it will immediately amend its codes of practice to address the issues of errors of fact and invasion of privacy following repeal of the section 82 review mechanism. Consequential amendments in the bill delete references in the ABC Act to the community affairs officers appointed under section 82 of the act. Under the new arrangements, complaints will still be referred to the ABC in the first instance. If the complaint is not answered within 60 days or the complainant is not satisfied with the ABC's response, the complaint can be referred to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for independent review. Finally, the bill contains some minor cal amendments to the ABC Act. The first these is intended to correct an anomaly in ABC Act which has occurred in the drafting of provisions in the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential . Amendments) Act 1992. These provisions, unintentionally, preclude the ABC charging for subscription services which have been declared to be national services under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The amendment corrects the anomaly and thereby provides scope for the Minister the for Communications (Mr Beddall) to allow the ABC to operate services, the costs of to which are met in full or part by the audience subscriptions. It is envisaged that this ABC provision would only be used in special circumstances and that most subscription Act services that may be offered by the ABC would be subject to the same regulatory regime as other commercial services under the Broadcasting Services Act. The bill also .amends the ABC Act to make its provisions non-gender specific in line with current of new drafting policy. The amendments in the bill will not alter the costs or revenues of the Commonwealth. do not require the application of addiprotional resources by the ABC to meet its obligations or to comply with its establishment and management responsibilities. I the bill to the House and present in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock» adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Tickner, and read a first time. Second Reading",65
102,Mr TICKNER,Unknown,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (4.04 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait techniIslander Commission Amendment Bill (No.2) of follows on from the changes to the Aboriginal the and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 which were passed by the parliament in the Autumn sittings. Its primary focus is not on the commission itself - commonly referred to as ATSIC-but on the regional councils. from The bill provides, in essence, for: reforms to enhance the roles, effectiveness and accountability of regional councils including strengthening of the provisions relating to the declaration of pecuniary interests; the election processes to be followed for the regional council elections; the introduction of a ward system for those regions where this is considered desirable; proposals for further boundary changes to the 36 regions established under the act; and a number of other desirable administrative measures including provisions relating to the minister's power to remove council chairpersons and deputy chairpersons and to establish unambiguously what constitutes misbehaviour. This second package of amendments, like those introduced earlier this year, flow from recommendations contained in the commission's report to me on the operation of the act. They will further enhance the representative nature of the organisation and strengthen the role of the regional councils as the linchpins of empowerment for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Honourable members will recall that, when I introduced the first package of reforms, I foreshadowed that further changes would be required. As I pointed out at that time, the responsibilities of regional councils have been progressively increased. They are making more of the decisions about how the funds appropriated to ATSIC are distributed, and are becoming progressively more involved in the whole range of activities and policies that affect the lives of their people. It is highly pleasing that other Commonwealth agencies, and state, territory and local governments, are increasingly recognising the important coordinating role of regional councils in planning and in prioritising programs and activities to meet the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The first bill included provisions dealing with two of the recommendations of ATSIC commissioners relating to regional councils. The regional council structure was strengthened by reducing the numbers of councils, as from the next round of elections due later this year, from 60 to 36; and by providing for full-time appointments for regional council chairpersons. This bill builds on those reforms. It does not, however, cover all the further changes to the act that are necessary to implement the totality of the reform package flowing from the commission's review of the operation of the act. In particular, it does not deal with: major changes that are envisaged to arrangements for the Torres Strait, including the establishment of a Torres Strait Regional Authority; streamlining of the financial provisions of the act-one of the effects of which will be to facilitate the further devolution of authority to regional councils; and strengthening of the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include powers to evaluate and audit regional councils, Aboriginal hostels, the CDC, land councils and ATSIC funded organisations. These are important and complex matters. It has not been possible to complete drafting in time for their inclusion in this bill, which needs to be passed quickly in order that its provisions apply to the forthcoming regional council elections. The act requires that these elections be held before the end of this year, and it is essential that those who wish to stand for election are aware of the new rules that will govern the elections, and the operations of regional councils. It is my intention to introduce a further bill encompassing these further reforms later in these sittings. I tum now to· the major provisions of the present bill. Parts 1 and 2 are formal provisions. Part 3 relates to changes to regional council advisory committees. Currently, members of such committees are not entitled to receive any remuneration and allowances for their time and contribution. Clause 4 provides for such remuneration and allowances: Clause 5 adds a requirement for members of regional council advisory committees to declare any direct or indirect pecuniary interests in matters being considered by that committee. This has been included to bring the requirements for members of advisory committees into line with those of regional councils and is considered important as a consequence of provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The clause also provides for terms and conditions, including resignation procedures, for members of advisory committees. Part 4 of the bill provides for the introduction of a ward system for regional council elections. Clause 8 includes a new section 100A to provide for regional council election rules to· make provision for the division of a region into such wards as are specified in the rules and the setting of boundaries for such wards. There will be a maximum number of five wards for each region. Honourable members may recall that 1 foreshadowed, when introducing the first package of amendments to the act, that a series of workshops would be held to discuss the proposed changes, and that one of the key matters to be discussed would be the option of introducing a ward system. There was widespread support for this idea as such a system could provide an assured level of representation for each significant area of a region. These changes are included as a direct consequence of the outcome of those discussions. Clause 10 amends subsection 102(1) to provide that a person is not qualified to stand for a regional council ward election if the person does not live in that ward. This is consistent with the existing requirement that a candidate for election live in the region concerned. Clauses 11 to 19 also relate to the election processes for wards and operations of regional councils and are consequential to the decision to move to a ward system. Clause 20 relates to the timing of the application of the changes and provides that the amendments-other than those included in clause 17 - apply to the elections due in 1993 and subsequently. Part 5 of the bill relates to the operations regional councils. Clauses 20 to 26 strengthen the eligibility requirements and obligations of regional councillors. These provisions result directly from the commission's report to me and is a clear indication of the strength of the commission's commitment to the highest standards of management and public accountability. Clause 22 amends section 102 of the. act by addillg a provision that a person is not qualified to stand for election as a member of a regional council if he or she is bankrupt or in similar circumstances. Clause 23 amends section 119 of the act by replacing the existing disclosure of interests provisions for regional councillors with strengthened requirements, similar to those provisions applicable to commissioners. The clause will also provide the minister with the power to issue determinations in relation to pecuniary interests. Currently, the definition of what constitutes a pecuniary interest is a matter for legal interpretation. The new provisions allow for the minister to provide a comprehensive list of criteria to guide regional councillors in understanding their obligations. The minister will also be empowered to determine when a regional councillor may continue to participate in the discussions on a particular matter notwithstanding any declaration of interest. This flexibility is considered important because of the difficulties which may be associated from time to time with maintaining a quorum for the meeting. Clause 25 widens the circumstances whereby a person ceases to be a regional councillor, which includes continued failure to attend meetings. Clause 26 makes provision for suspension and removal from office for physical or mental incapacity. Clauses 27 to 30 relate to the positions of chairperson and deputy chairperson of regional councils. Currently, the act provides for the election of an executive committee. Given that chairpersons will become full-time, as a consequence of the amendments already passed by the parliament, it will be important to ensure that there is always some person of able to undertake the role of chairperson in his or her absence. The replacement of the executive committee by a deputy chairperson, and provision for election for an alternate to the deputy chairperson, fulfils this requirement. Provisions for the suspension or removal from office of the deputy chairperson similar to those for the chairperson have also been included in this part. Part 6 of the bill relates to the Torres Strait Regional Council and provides for the deferral of the election of members for the Torres Strait Regional Council from 1993 to 1994 to bring it into line with elections due pursuant to the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984 of Queensland. As I have mentioned, major changes to arrangements for the Torres Strait are expected to be included in a further bill, and this part provides a fall-back in case of delays in passage of these changes. Part 7 of the bill relates to the remuneration and allowances payable to certain officeholders under the ATSIC Act. These amendments ensure that the commission can set a global limit on the remuneration and allowances payable to members of advisory committees established under sections 13 or 96, the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board and regional councils. This provision is not meant to restrict the independence of these bodies nor to impose restrictions on the number of meetings. It is intended to provide parameters in relation to the commitment of funds and ensure that the budgets approved under division 8 of part 2 of the act are effectively managed. In this regard I should emphasise that thimpact of the amendments on total Commonwealth appropriations will be neutral. It is ATSIC's intention to introduce these significant changes from within its global allocation, offsetting costs from efficiency gains. Under part 8 of the bill the minister will be empowered to make determinations about what constitutes misbehaviour, thereby ensuring that councillors are aware of their full obligations and responsibilities. Part 9 of the bill replaces schedule 1 of the ATSIC Act, bringing the 36 regions into line with those recommended during the round of consultations held in June this year. Part 10 of the Bill provides for transitional provisions relating to the replacement of 59 original regional councils by the 35 new ones and are essential for the transfer of estimates, draft budgets and other necessary matters to ensure the proper transition from the old councils to the new ones. This part does not . apply to the Torres Strait Regional Council, hence the reference to 35, not 36, regional councils. Let me return briefly to the proposal to introduce a ward system. Given the level of support for the idea I believe it essential to introduce provisions allowing for the subdivision of regions into wards in time for this year's regional council elections. The boundaries of the wards that I will set in place are to be regarded as interim. In establishing the boundaries I shall take into account advice from the commission follow- . ing consultations that it has held with regional council chairpersons in each state and territory. I will also have regard for the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons living in each ward and communities of interest within council boundaries. Providing that this bill is supported I will make rules establishing the first ward boundaries prior to fixing the date of the 1993 elections. In amendment bill No. 3 that I will bring forward in a few weeks I will set out details for the establishment of an electoral review panel and a process of appeals. This panel will provide an independent report on electoral processes and boundaries. The panel will have as one of its key responsibilities examining any further changes that need to take place to regional council and ward boundaries. Overall, the effect of this package of amendments represents a careful balance between implementing the principles of self determination and self-management and the accountability requirements of parliament. ATSIC, and particularly the regional councils, are further empowered to make their own decisions while ensuring that the processes they follow are open to public scrutiny. This is something which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have themselves demanded, and reinforces ATSIC's established commitment to high standards of accountability. It is important that I pay tribute to the ATSIC officers who have been involved in the preparation of this legislation and to thank them for their tolerance and patience, not the least of which is their patience with their minister, and to thank them for their very high level of dedicated, professional service to the Commonwealth. I present the explanatory memorandum for the information of honourable members, and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Nugent) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, and read a first time. Second Reading",67
103,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993 will give effect to the government's decisions announced in the Investing in the nation statement to reduce the Commonwealth's shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank, to provide a capital injection and a continuing subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank, and to amend the Commonwealth Development Bank's charter to expand its lending activity. The main purpose of this bill is to amend the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to facilitate a reduction in the Commonwealth's equity in the Commonwealth Bank from around 70 per cent to a minimum of 50.1 per cent. This will not affect the government's guarantee of the bank's liabilities. Originally it was announced that the sale would proceed in the 1994-95 financial year. However, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) announced on 2 July 1993, the proposed sale has been brought forward to the 1993-94 financial year. This decision enables the government to mitigate the impact that the postponement of the Qantas float would otherwise have had on this year's budget. At current share prices, the sale of this portion the government's equity in the Commonwealth Bank is expected to raise around $1;500 million. I shall now outline briefly the measures contained in this bill. The amendments contained in· part 2 of the bill provide for the Commonwealth to reduce its shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank and stipulate that the Commonwealth cannot reduce its shareholding to below 50.1 per cent. This ensures that the Commonwealth will continue to retain majority ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. The sale of shares in the Commonwealth Bank could leave the purchasers of equity liable for certain state and territory taxes and charges, in particular stamp duty. In the absence of any action, this would depress the expected returns to the Commonwealth-and hence to all taxpayers-from the sale of these assets and would benefit only the taxpayers in the particular state or territory where the taxes are paid. It would also complicate the sale process. To avoid these issues, the bill provides that the sale of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank and related transactions to the sale are to be exempted from state and territory taxes and charges. Further, the bill facilitates the government's decision to expand the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank by providing a one-off capital injection of $30 million in 1993-94 to allow the Commonwealth Development Bank to expand its lending and to provide a continuing subsidy of $20 million per annum, to begin in 199394. The capital injection will be in .the form of an issue of Commonwealth Development Bank shares to the Commonwealth. The value of the shares will be determined by agreement between the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Commonwealth Bank Board. As a result, the Commonwealth, as beneficial owner of these shares, will be able to receive dividends from the Commonwealth Development Bank. The bill also amends the Commonwealth Banks Act so that the Commonwealth Development Bank is empowered to accept the subsidy of from the Commonwealth. The capital injection and the continuing subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank will aid lending to the small business sector. The bill also amends the Commonwealth determined Banks Act to extend the Commonwealth Development Bank's charter to enable it to meet the full credit requirements, refinancing, of small and medium size ness customers. In the past, the charter restricted the bank to providing only part of to these credit requirements in most instances. This change will ensure that the bank is no The longer largely restricted to providing mentary finance. The amendments contained in this bill benefit a wide cross-section of the Australian population. Taxpayers will benefit proceeds of the sale, while the wider tralian public has a further opportunity to shares in one of Australia's premier financial Scheme. institutions. The general economic recovery will be assisted by the provision of additional The funding opportunities for small and businesses.

105,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill, and I will do so briefly. The bill contains a number of provisions that effect fairly minor policy changes. Included in the legislation there are some other minor and technical amendments to the Social Security Act 1991. As the explanatory memorandum says, so far as financial implications are concerned the consequence of these measures is negligible. The amendments deal with matters relating to enhanced arrangements for debt recovery, some changes to penalties which enable certain offences to be heard summarily rather than having to be dealt with in a more expensive process, and provide a better-some might say a more equitable-arrangement for people with partners in gaol. They will be able to receive the single rate pension rather than a lower married rate while their partners are incarcerated or in a psychiatric institution. The amendments also deal with the issue of child disability allowances and remove certain provisions which relate to an ability to backdate these benefits quite considerably to an earlier application. That is a matter I will come to. They deal with payments from the New South Wales Medically-Acquired HIV Trust and extend the benefits in relation to an exemption from income to that particular body. There are some other adjustments to the way in which jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowances are dealt with. There are amendments to the impairment table, investment income, family payments, the landcare and environment action program, the ACT Government jobskills program, qualification for mobility allowance, as well as the new enterprise incentive scheme and Aboriginal employment incentive scheme. So far as comments by me are concerned, it is in relation to the matter of the child disability allowance that I want to comment because, having circulated this bill very widely for comment during the recess-a very worthwhile activity, I might say-the one matter that was raised with me was the question of limiting for 12 months the backdating of the child disability allowance, which effectively prevents people being able to make a backdating to another claim. The argument is that, if a claim could be made for five to 10 years to an earlier application, it would provide the department with some difficulty in collecting information about a child's disability or care requirements over such a long time. I might agree with that as a general observation, but one of the more difficult questions for me as a member of parliament has been the frequency with which I am approached by people who, through absolutely no fault of their own-particularly where disability issues are involved where people could be in an institution; could be confined because of the severity of a disability from which they suffer which could have resulted from an accidenthave not made applications. We invariably find that the technical point is held that one is limited to a backdating for 12 months and fobbed off with the comment, 'If it. is a sufficiently important case, you can go off and see the Minister for Finance. He might be able to find something in his budget to be able to compensate you'. To my way of thinking, this matter highlights the need for some discretion in being able to look at difficult cases. The only reason I am not moving an amendment on this aspect is that I think the broader question needs to be dealt with by the government, not the narrow question, particularly in relation to children's payments. I regard this as an opportunity to discuss a wider range of issues that are of far more importance to the poor and destitute, the most vulnerable in our community. For that reason, I move the following second reading amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its gross breach of faith with the Australian electorate in the following ways: (1) in failing to honour its promises to: (a) exempt all pensioners from the tax system by 1995; (b) establish a new Commonwealth dental health program for emergency and basic dental care for pensioners and health card holders this year; and (c) implement by April 1994 a Seniors Health Card to low income retirees; (2) its failure to repeal the provisions of the Social Security Act treating unrealised capital gains as income for the purposes of the income test for pension and benefit eligibility; and (3) its betrayal of the poor, the disadvantaged and the needy by increasing taxes and excises with little or no compensation"". In speaking to these matters, I want to make a number of points. The first is the way in which this government has treated promises. Recently the government went to quite a lot of expense to produce a document entitled Social justice strategy 1993-94, telling us that it has gone to extraordinary efforts to honour its promises to the electorate in this budget. It has produced that document at great expense to the taxpayer. I want to say something about that document because the most fundamental promise that was made by this government was to exempt all pensione- from the tax system by 1995. That is what really mattered, and it is the one that mattered to the government too. Why did it matter to the government? BecauSe it was a very expensive promise and the government knew that it was a very expensive promise. It is like the rich uncle promising his nephew that he will give him a Rolls Royceand an ice-cream and a few lollies as well. The government has given the most vulnerable Australians the ice-cream and a few lollies but it has certainly deprived them of the one worthwhile benefit they thought was theirs. This promise was made in 1989. It was a commitment to remove all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995. It was a promise made by the then Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe) as part of the government's retirement incomes policy. That is the same man who wants to put his photograph in the front of this publication telling us about the government's social justice strategy. The Deputy Prime Minister made the promise. Despite repeated questions-quite frankly we did not believe him when he made this promise-from the opposition on the costing and implementation of this promise we were told that it was not possible to provide any details of the measure until closer to its implementation. I found some coniments by . the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), then the social security minister, who said that the government stood by that commitment and would work out the details during the next three years. He said; 'There is an end goal there. It is a commitment on the. table and there are 31f2 years yet to work out how that can be achieved'. . . . Then there was the election policy for older Australians. After the government had been questioned during the October 1992 Senate estimates committees Treasury officials made it clear that the potential cost would be as high as $1 billion or more. They said: No account of the revenue lost had been included in the One Nation expenditure or revenue and expenditure projections. Notwithstanding the government's knowledge that this was the potential cost, it reaffirmed unequivocally in this statement this commitment to older Australians. It was quite unambiguous and clear. It said: Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut-out point. It was expressed in such terms that i- was absolutely clear what the government was promising. It said: Labor is working on details of implementing this proposal and believes that the next step should involve consultation with and input from the community, pensioner and retiree organisations through a discussion paper to be released this year. When the election was over the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), in his doorstop interview on Thursday 18 March, said, 'We have not given any definite undertaking about that.· Basically, I think it was an undertaking given at a much earlier stage. It is certainly not an undertaking we have renewed'. The audacity of the man! He continued, 'I certainly don't feel under any obligation to follow through with it'. When I asked the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) a question on this matter yesterday he wanted to obfuscate by saying, 'The government has a commitment to review the situation of the interaction of tax and social security systems'. The Treasurer, immediately after the election, said, 'We will be looking at that'. It sounds as though he did not even know what the minister had said. The goveinment's very clear breach of promise in this area, in which ministers as individuals reaffirmed the commitment on behalf of the government, is something that I will remind them of every day between now and an election, whenever it is called. I believe that we cannot obfuscate on these matters. Unambiguous language which people rely upon and vote on needs to be honoured by those in office. The failure to honour it means that there are consequences. The consequences are that people can take it into account on the next occasion. I certainly do not intend to allow the government to forget about that matter. Even when it comes to the ice-creams and sweets those opposite wanted to fiddle. On the seniors health card, one of the emblems being held out· as· a tribute to the implementation of promises, the government said: Labor will introduce a new Senior's Health Card from April 1994 for all ... people of age pension qualifying age whose taxable incomes are below rate as well the pension cut-out point. Yet in the budget it said: The new senior's health card will be provided, from 1 July next year, to low income retirees not currently receiving the pension. That effectively gets it out of the budget this year. It puts it off, with no expenditure. I tum n()w to the dental health care program, which we have mentioned before. Thegovemment will implement a Commonwealth dental health program to improve access to emergency and basic dental care for low income earners at a cost of $278 million in its first four years and $100 million in a full year. It sets out the cost for this financial year-199394-at $18 million. At the policy launch the Prime Minister followed that up. He said: ... Commonwealth dental health program will be established for emergency and basic dental care for health card holders. Senator Richardson admitted that the government could not meet its pledge to provide it by 1 July 1993. He said that the program had been delayed until January 1994. Then we come to the second issue that I wish to discuss: the failure of the government to repeal the provisions of the Social Security Act for treating unrealised capital gains as income for the purposes of the income test for pension and benefit eligibility. It needs to be understood that the budget last night was not used as an opportunity to repeal this iniquitous legislation. It was not the last opportunity-I guess the government could come in next week and make an announcement-but it is getting perilously close.. I urge the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris)-he is the only one I can actually urge at the moment-to think about this matter on behalf of his colleagues who have obviously been talking to the press. They obviously have doubts about it. They - re .wOI;ied b-cause it is a major travesty of JustIce mvolvmg the most vulnerable in our community. 1 will ensure, quite frankly, that on every occasion-because 1 intend, as 1 promised before, to hound the Government on this issue and 1 will continue to do so-in every electorate where government members vote against amendments to repeal these provisions pensioners are made aware of how their members vote. There cannot be any misrepresentation of a government member's position in relation to this. Honourable members cannot say, when they are replying to correspondence or are talking to pensioners, 'I don't support th-s'. Government members cannot getaway wIth that sort of nonsense. The fact is that government members will be on the recordthey will be required to vote-and the 100,000 or more pensioners and part pensioners who are affected by this will know of the government's stubborn intention to retain this unfair legislation. It is clearly unjust, unfair and inequitable. During the recess the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has been hearing evidence on this matter. It has met with many hundreds of pensioners and veterans around Australia in public hearings in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. 1 went to the committee hearings in Sydney. I heard a great deal of the evidence. Some of my colleagues-a number from Western Australia: the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), the honourable member for Sterling (Mr Cameron) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans)-called a public meeting and many hundreds of people turned up. 1 know there were large numbers of people disappointed in Queensland also who were not able to get to the Senate committee meetings. The evidence before that committee was overwhelming. I looked at statements from organisations such as the Australian Retired Persons Association Inc. Its representative, Mr Dowe, said: Within 12 months of this legislation being implemented pensioners will have - to invest in any AustralIan overseas shares, any lIsted and unlisted property trusts, any equity trusts, overseas cash trusts, insurance bonds, friendly society: managed funds, mortgage trusts, fixed interest trusts and certain rollover and superannuation funds. He was concerned about the continued limita. tion of opportunities for the older people, the more vulnerable people, to obtain some element of security in their retirementpeople who are concerned that when an emergency comes along they have some money that they can put their hands on to be able to provide for that special need and not be forced to go and borrow to meet it. There have been submissions from a number of investment organisations. The Council on the Ageing said: We are disappointed the Government has elected to penalise pensioners who increase their resources through investment in shares. The effect is to discriminate against a relatively small group, the majority of whom are at the lower end of the wealth scale. The council talked about some of the inequities in the way in which these provisions operate, which the government seems to be talking about, particularly for those people who through very large capital increments could lose almost any pension income they may have to live off and who are concerned about the different way in which capital gains and capital losses have been treated where the government gets a greater benefit from a gain but when losses occur they are treated in a different fonn. The committee heard from the National Seniors Association, anumber of investment organisations, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation-the organisation which came closest to supporting the government on this matter but which clearly has grave reservations about it-and constituent bodies such as the Combined Pensioners Association of New South Wales. That is an organisation whose members. I know have never really been in the forefront of those organisations which have lent support to a coalition point of view but who on this issue have deserted the government in droves. I was disappointed when I read reports of the discussion of this matter by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) on Canberra radio. He trusts really seemed to be saying that that little element of security that pensioners feel by having some assets there which they might be able to use in an emergency ought to be frittered away and that it was the government's desire to see them divest themselves of those limited assets. . I want to read a number of quotes from people who have been writing to the coalition on this matter because they are most poignant in terms of the case that is being made out. One couple wrote: The shares we would have to sell were inherited from our parents and grandparents. Those earlier citizens of this country knew what it was to struggle through hard times and were prepared to invest in worthy enterprises. Surely we, at least, should try to do the same. Another couple wrote: Are the ever changing rules for pensioners designed to worry and harass us all into an earlier grave so you do not have to pay us pensions which we earned over a long lifetime where women only received half pay to that of men? Another couple wrote: My wife lost her leg three years ago ... Since then she has had three major operations on her right leg ... I realise that at any time we may be told that there is no more the surgeon can do, but while I have these shares and our house for greater backup, I feel I might by some miracle find someone who can save her leg. Another couple wrote: We will be forced to sell our shares to live on this will wipe out the small nest egg that many of us endeavoured to save for that real emergency or family crisis or to assist our surviving families to pay for our funerals. Another wrote: I am a veterans affairs part pensioner forced out of the workforce because of war related injuries ... How can you budget your living when one quarter of your pension may be up, then down the next or perhaps disappear altogether. The bills for gas, electric lights etc do not vary-they continue to go up. Another wrote: There is no consideration given as to what the .share. originally cost the purchaser, so we see people with relatively small shareholdings through no fault of theirs could be losing part or all of their pension and yet their investment is still showing a loss on their original outlay. Another wrote: Investments made in good faith should not be the subject of legislation which is in effect retrospective. Another couple wrote: My husband is nearly 89 and has an increasing measure of dementia requiring constant care and I have had open heart surgery in recent times ... I am extremely worried as to what I should do to maintain our part-pension, without which we could not live. lcould go on because there are hundreds and hundreds of examples of that sort which have been given. But I w!lnt to make the pointand I find it particularly worrying-that it is apparent that the department is aware of potential avenues for avoiding these provisions. The government submission to the Senate committee refers to investments in private companies and trusts. The government seems to be massaging itself at the moment into the view that there will not be much leakage through the formation of private companies and trusts because people have not talked to their financial advisers about those options at this stage. But the department says, 'We will be carefully monitoring this situation and trends in alternative investment opportunities such as real estate and, should they develop, areas of circumvention will be brought to the attention of the minister'. I gather that people are already looking at family trusts, private companies and investing offshore. The minister will have to go on amending, amending and amending. I warn him that in amendments of that sort the government might well face a very difficult and tortuous path. Before the government puts people in the impossible situation where they are faced with having sold their shares at a considerable loss and having reorganised their affairs, it ought not to be faced with complaints from people later when it has to repeal these provisions because the savings that the government claims are there are not there. The government should make the changes now. The government should get off the hook while it can and save its reputation. I was extraordinarily disappointed at the nature of the decisions that had been taken in the last few days affecting the more vulnerable in our society. I am evenmor,e worried when I look back at what some honourable members opposite said about what they saw as the approach of the opposition. Honourable members opposite went around making suggestions about what would happen under the opposition's policies. When the honourable member for Bonython was Minister for Social Security he said, 'To those who have, more will be given; those who already have little will be expected to make do with less'. He thought that would be the likely outcome of our policies. He asked, 'How can anybody be so dishonest'-looking at us-'so cynical, so exploitative, to look into the eyes of such people, claiming to be their saviour, knowing that he plans to take away from these very people the only financial support that they have?'. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) said: . . . the most disadvantaged members of our society will be battered and bashed by policies completely lacking in compassion. When the opposition talked about making reductions in the areas that might impact upon the elderly, we promised an eight per cent increase in pensions. When we promised changes to the taxation system, particularly indirect tax, we made very large adjustments for those who pay tax. For other beneficiaries we promised a six per cent increase. The compensation was there. In the government's budget we have an increase in indirect taxation-in sales tax, across the board; in every area in which sales tax applies. But where is the compensation? There is no compensation for the pensioners. There is no compensation for the needy. The government is increasing the cost of leaded fuels by lOc a litre over time. I remind the government of what some of those people whom it regards as part of its natural constituency have had to say about this. The Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, on the leaded fuel increase, said: Many older people rely on cars which cannot use unleaded fuel. This decision, although good environment, leaves those least able to pay the price bearing the cost. The Brotherhood of St Laurence said: The government has missed a chance to act decisively on unemployment and people on low incomes will continue to suffer. A person earning $50,000 will receive a $1,000 tax cut; a low income taxpayer at most a $100 pa rebate. And the new taxes on petrol and other goods will affect low income earners far more. The Salvation Army said: Proposed rises in wholesale sales taxes will affect numerous items, even some basic grocery items. Clearly the taking is bigger than the giving. The current government was re-elected largely because of fears that an increased taxation burden would be inequitably shared by those less well-off, yet they now appear to be creating that very situation. Julian Disney said the same. I look forward to a vigorous debate on the matter. Mr Lieberman-I second the amendment.",73
106,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"As the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) said, these amendments deal' with a number of minor matters-the child disability allowance, the prosecution of social security offenders, HIV payments in New South Wales and other minor administrative matters. Of themselves they are not of substantial import and there is no obvious disagreement between the government and the opposition, although one matter which was brought forward will no doubt be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) in the course of the debate. The honourable member for Berowra took the opportunity to launch a very selective and quite misleading tirade on the government. I remind him that in 1982-83, when the opposition was last in government, pensions were 22.6 per cent of average weekly earnings, not 26 per cent as they are now. Atthat time a pensioner could earn about $4 a week before being taxed; today it is $70 per household. At that time assets were ignored and not treated in any form. We saw a massive shift of income into assets. We also recall the loss of pensions. Every three, four or five years the government would lift the threshold. All of for the those matters are now fixed, indexed and predictable. For the honourable member for Berowra to somehow compare the opposition's concern for pensioners and the fairness of pensions with the government's record in its 10 years of office is not only deplorable but dishonest. Pensioners have good memories. They can remember the scare campaigns about the assets test run by the opposition in 1984 and 1985. They remember very well how they were being told that they would all be victims; how it was going to mean the demise and the loss of pensions to so many people. In fact, it affected relatively few. Pensioners now support the assets test. In his later comments the honourable member for Berowra mentioned the Australian Pensioner and Superannuants Federation. He forgot to mention that that organisation supports the legislation on shares. It supports the concept that shares should be treated equally, whether they are held directly in a person's name or held by a managed investment. Mr Ruddock-They want a full inquiry.",78
107,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,I am sure the honourable member for Berowra knew that. He selectively forgot to mention. it. That indicates the dishonesty of his speech. He was quoting the federation on one topic and ignoring it on the more important one. The federation had long suggested that the removal of all pensioners from the tax system was not the best way of helping pensioners. The honourable member for Berowra did not mention that either. Mr Ruddock-Nor did you before the election. Why didn't you raise it before the election?,79
108,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"I know the honourable member for Berowra is playing on my courtesy. I am so polite I did not interrupt him at all. I suggest he is taking advantage of that natural trait. The question of taxation on shares is difficult, and it is one that has brought individual problems to the fore. The honourable member for Berowra gave an indication of where he is coming from and what he is really on about in his later remarks when he said, 'The department said there will not be much leakage'. He said there would be leakage, there would be trusts, there would be offshores and there would be all different ways, which is why the legislation is being amended in the first place. The opposition has admitted that and is supporting it. The opposition is supporting people managing their affairs in order to qualify for the pension. At the same time, it is attacking the government because workers on lower incomes are having to pay their taxes when, as the opposition is saying, pensioners should not. What kind of hypocrisy is involved in that? How dare the opposition tell Australian pensioners, 'Your kids are having to pay tax on $25,000 a year', while its mates with large assets can put them in shares, trusts, or whatever other form that their advisers ferret out, pay no tax and get a full pension-all because they are clever enough to rort the system. The opposition has gone on record today as supporting and encouraging that behaviour. Its credibility amongst the genuine pensioners in Australia is destroyed. The opposition thought it was being clever in warning us that there will be leakage but what the opposition was basically doing was encouraging the advisers to find the loopholes. We are all human beings. The people who draft legislation are human beings. It is possible that there will be loopholes; the advisers might finp more ways to rort. If they do, we will keep trying to close those loopholes, as we have for all tax evaders over the 10 years we have been in government. I doubt that the battle between the integrity of the tax system and thefaimess of the pension system will abate. That battle will go on long after I and the honourable member for Berowra have left this place. This side of the House stands for integrity, fairness and equity. The honourable member for Berowra has gone ,on record as encouraging schemes, loopholes, leakages, trusts, and ways around the system to maximise the pension. His was a very revealing comment. I can assure the honourable member for Berowra that the pensioners of Australia will be much more interested in his comments than in how we vote or what we say about a tax on shares. Mr Ruddock-I clearly did not encourage anybody to do it. I told you what was likely to happen.",79
109,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"What he said has finally sunk in. The tax on shares is a complex and difficult issue. There are many pensioners who have shares that were inherited, held for emotional or private purposes, or held for personal reasons for a very long time. In many of those cases those shares will not be affected at all. In part, what we have seen over· the last few months is a campaign similar to that launched against the assets test, when anybody holding shares is being made to feel terrified. The tragedy of the opposition's morality is that it does not mind using fear on old people. The opposition sees fear as a natural political weapon. The honourable member for Berowra need not shake his head. I have been there; I went through the assets test debate. I watched the dishonesty-the immorality of what the opposition did to old people. In my community there were people who were terrified because of what the opposition was making out of the amendment-dishonestly, unfairly and unreasonably, as it is doing with this shares issue. In the cases it quoted today the opposition did not mention what shares were involved or whether their prices had changed in the last year, because most of them will not be affected. The reality is that we are going to have a fair pensions system which helps those who need help. It must also be seen to be fair. It cannot be the sort of scheme that says, 'You can hold shares in BHP through an investment trust and have that affect your pension, but hold them in your own name and it will not' . Pensioners understand. that; they understand that there is a question of fairness. Mr Ruddock-That is what you have now. You can hold them in a trust and they are not",80
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Berowra might help if he ceases interjecting. If he does not cease interjecting, I will deal with him.",80
111,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"The point is that the Pensioners Federation understands, and has put to me, that shares held directly or indirectly should be treated. equally. We should not discriminate because of the way in which people hold their assets. However, the opposition's comments have been useful because we will now be watching out for leakages. Workers in my electorate on $25,000, $30,000 and $35,000 a year, who are paying more tax than I would like to see them paying, are. not going to like the opposition encouraging the transfer of assets into areas so that people can get full pensions and, if the opposition had its way, also pay no tax. Quite frankly, most pensioners who have kids and grandkids think more about their kids and their grandkids than about themselves. They are not worried about their own income; they are more worried about the capacity of their kids and their grandkids to raise their children, pay for their houses and keep their jobs. Most of them do not want a system of rorts. They do not want to avoid tax or asset visibility in order to claim pensions because they know that their kids are paying the taxes that pay their pensions. The question of taxation of part pensions, as I indicated earlier, is a question about which the Pensioners Federation has said to us, 'If you are going to invest that kind of money'-I mentioned the figure of a billion dollars that was quoted last year-'of $1 billion to help pensioners, there are better ways of doing it'. I should make clear that we are talking about income of $32,000 a year. On $32,000 a year, a worker in the steel industry would be paying tax of somewhere between $5,000 and $7,000. What the amendment is suggesting is that a pensioner on the same income should pay no tax. Now, that steelworker is probably raising a couple of kids and trying to pay off a house, but he is paying tax while the pensioner is not. One of the things that pensioners have been saying to us since 1989 has been, 'If you are going to try and help us, that is not a fair way'. Over the last 10 years the. government has indexed benefits to bring them into line with reasonable standards. It has targeted support for the aged, not simply in the area of pensions but also in nursing home care and home and community care programs. In the current year the Commonwealth and states have s-nt $570 million between them on communIty care. That kind of support was not around in 1981-83 when the opposition was in government and delivering its budgets. This government has given a massive amount of support in those areas. The extension of fringe benefits was not promised in 1989 or 1990 but is in place now. The reduction of the assets test next month to $78 per $1,000 withdrawal is also an important recognition. People can now have assets and income of a substantial value and still get quite significant taxation and pension benefits as well as other forms of benefit. The honourable member for Berowra is saying that these measures are not enough and his amendment talks about the disadvantaged and the needy being hurt by the budget. We are absolutely awash with crocodile tears. I only hope that the plumbing in the building is okay after what has gone on since last night. But the public at large is not fooled it. Question time today was indicative of their feelings towards the opposition. One only had to look at the gallery, as one tends to do from time to time, to see the dispassionate observers and their reactions to what was going on. Quite frankly, they were not impressed. Mr Ruddock-Which gallery?",80
112,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"The public gallery, from which people watch the opposition every week with a professional detachment. They watch, they assess and they weigh up. Quite frankly, after today, if the opposition thinks that people are taking it its concerns for the disadvantaged and needy, forget it, because they are not. They were laughing-a bit. more than your backbench, but not that much more. This amendment is relatively minor. The opposition has proposed a minor change. The substantive amendment that it has proposed about the government's support for pensions is absolutely ludicrous and outrageous. The pensioners know and understand that. No amount of rhetoric on the part of the honourable member for Berowra, no selective quoting of the federation, and no attempt to pretend that this government has somehow betrayed the older people of this country will change that-because they know we have not. We know we have not and they know that we are their best guarantee. In 1983-84 the opposition deliberately set out to frighten pensioners about the assets test. The irony is that in 1990-91 it inadvertently frightened them with its Fightback package. The opposition has this fear thing which seems to happen whether it wants it to or not. There was the deliberate scare campaign on the assets tests; the unconscious scare campaign of Fightback; and now we are back to the conscious scare campaign over tax on shares in this budget. It will not wash. These campaigns are irrelevant to what is happening to pensioners in Australia. But it is unfortunate that those opposite are fuelling the fears and uncertainties of those pensioners with shares who are emotionally attached to them and do not necessarily understand the principle. I trust that during this debate, and in the weeks ahead, those opposite will start to bring by some sense to bear and some fairness and accept that the principle that the government is pushing on shares is the correct principle. Perhaps there are better ways of managing it; perhaps there are better ways of taking it into account, but to go out and decry the principle is a dishonesty which really borders on the opposition's dishonesty on the assets test back in the early 1980s. The amendments put forward by the honourable member for Berowra, in terms of last night's budget, should be rejected by the House without seriously with much debate at all.",81
113,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"We are debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. I remind the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) that it is the principle, particularly in respect of the treatment of unrealised capital gains on pensioners' share portfolios, that we object to most strongly. From what he has said, it is quite clear to me that he is really confused about income tax and capital gains tax. People with shares, whether they are pensioners or otherwise, are subject to income tax on the income from those shares-on the dividends. That is quite correct and proper. When they sell those shares they are subject to capital gains tax; that is, everyone except pensioners. That is a significant difference. It is our fundamental objection to this bill. Everyone else in the country, except pensioners, would only pay capital gains tax or be subject to having tax levied when they sold their shares. Pensioners lose income regardless of whether they sell the shares. Of course, none of us has any problem with the principle behind capital gains tax; it is quite correct. But the capital gains tax is applied when the asset is realised-and not before. Yet here the government has embarked on a process of treating pensioners, of all people, with share portfolios-and there are 90,000 of them with share portfolios of various sizesdifferently from everyone else in Australia. in respect of their share portfolios. We question that principle. The other point that the honourable member for Newcastle made was in relation to the promise-that is what it was, and we refer to it in our amendment-to exempt all pensioners from the tax system by 1995. The honourable member may well argue-and there may be considerable agreement on both sides of this House-whether part-pensioners should or should not pay tax, but that is not the point of our amendment. The point is that the government made a promise· to pensioners that they would not pay tax; that they would be exempted from the tax system by 1995. Whether the promise was right or wrong-and it may well have been rash, because many of the pre-election promises of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) were rash and ill considered, and of course he has been forced to back down on many of them-it stands out because it was so blatant. It was .a promise made to the most vulnerable people in our society. It was a promise that, in my view, was a very significant one: pensioners would be exempt from paying tax by 1995. I remind the honourable member for Newcastle that our argument is not whether the promise was right or wrong-because that is arguable-but the fact that it was made. We want to hold the government accountable for that; hence our amenqment reminds the people of Australia that the government has failed to honour its com-itment to the pensioners oil that particular score. In supporting the opposition's amendment to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill, I want to concentrate particularly on the issue of the unrealised capital gains on pensioners' share portfolios. I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) is not here because I have had numerous arguments with him both inside and outside the parliament on this matter. In my view this particular effort of the government comes close to ranking in the top 10 of its major stuff-ups over the last 12 months. Perhaps it is a· little unkind to describe it that way but that is what it is; it surely is a mistake. Yet every time the parliamentary secretary has spoken here or on Brisbane radio, or anywhere, he keeps digging the hole for himself and the government even deeper. Surely the government has got the message from all over Australia that this legislation, this attempt to treat unrealised capital gains as income for pensioners only, on their share portfolios, is wrong-w-r-o-n-g. It may well have been the law-I-a-w, but it is w-r-o-n-g. That should be obvious to just about everybody but the parliamentary secretary, who is not here. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is here. He may well understand the objection that pensioners rightfully have. This ranks almost with the government's handling of Mabo and pay TV and some of the other fiascos we have seen in recent days. I have spoken on this matter in this parliament on a number of occasionsMr Ruddock-And well done too.",81
114,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"Thank you. The honourable member for Berowra says, 'Well done'. What I want to take credit for here today is that I first spoke in this place on this matter on 5 November 1992-well before the election, and, I think, well before anybody outside the parliament, by and large, realised what this was all about. I want to quote from that November speech 'because I posed a question to the minister or the parliamentary secretary-I do not recall who was here that day-on behalf of my constituents. I asked: How do they live on the lower social security benefit or pension they receive as a result of this fair treatment? When they go to buy their.grocedes at the end of the week and their pension has been reduced by $4, $5, $10 or $15-which is not a lot to us but is a lot to my mother, who is a pensionerdo they take their share scrips,their share cates, to the supermarket and say, 'I am sorry Mr Supermarket Owner, I haven't got enough cash this week, but my shares have gone up in value ... I said, 'Perhaps I can tear off a comer of this share certificate and you will take it in exchange for my groceries'. I did not get an answer to the question that day, but I did speak on the matter on a couple of subsequent occasions. On 26 May when I spoke on this matter, I said to the parliamentary secretary: ... how does the pensioner whO loses his pension as a result of this mechanism live? He interjected: Sell some of their shares. I do not know whether he meant to say that, but for the first time it was an honest reaction. It told us what the government had in mind. He has said it in other ways since. He is saying that pensioners-not other Australians-who have shares which go up in value in· any year will have to sell those shares if they do not want to lose some of their pension. I think that is deplorable. In recent interviews he has said that they should live off their savings. The principle that the government now espouses is that people who have saved for their retirement, built up assets, should now be required to sell those assets and to live off the money. If we take that principle a step further, what does it mean? Ultimately it means that if the assets people have invested in-for an investor it is capital-do not provide an income, those assets will have to be sold. It seems to me that, ultimately, people will not have assets; they will not earn income, and it will end up costing the government more money. I wonder whether the government has really thought that through. Publicly, most commentators have recognised the inequity of this proposal. Barrie Dunstan, in the Australian Financial Review, has been one to consistently write on this issue. On 11 August, he said: THERE is little argument about the wrong principles involved in the means testing of pensioners' shares by calling unrealised· gains income. I think the vast majority of people realise that ceqifiis the case. Not only does the government discriminate against pensioners; it also sets a very dangerous general precedent. If the government is going to treat pensioners this way, then the Assistant Treasurer might tell me at some stage when it will start to get them to revalue their homes or their cars at the end of a period of time. Mr GearVVhen you get a Liberal government. Mr BRADFORDVVe certainly would not get that under a Liberal government because we would not treat pensioners the way the government treats them. VVhen will the government ask them to revalue their homes? The excuse the government has given us for not doing that is, 'VVell, there is not a ready market; there is a market for shares'. Yet the interesting anomaly there is that the government is only talking about shares in public companies. If a pensioner has shares in private companies, then of course there is no concept of applying the same test there because there is, to. quote the minister, 'no market for shares in private companies'. There is another anomaly that seems to go right over the heads of government members. There is a market for homes. I do not want to give the government too many ideas-and this is certainly not something I would want to see done-but, if the government were to be consistent, it might consider homes in the same way. Some pensioners live in nice homes and some of the socialists across there probably look at some of those homes and think, 'VVell golly, pensioners shouldn't have nice homes. They should sell their homes and live off their savings. They should go and live in a caravan park'. That is what those opposite will say...,...that pensioners should sell those nice homes and live in caravan parks. If the government goes down the track of treating unrealised capital gains on share portfolios this way, why will it not do it on homes or cars? I do not know where the government will stop. Some pensioners have nice cars. I suppose the government would say they should not have those-that they should sell them, buy old bombs to drive around in and live off their capital. The government cannot have it both ways. Government members talk about encouraging people to save for their retirement, but what purpose? LqgicaIly, from my point of view, it is so that they can invest the proceeds of those savings to live on. But now those opposite are saying, 'Hang on a second; we don't really mean that at all. What we want you to do is save up, build up some capital and then live off that'. When that is all gone, of course, those people have to get on to the public purse. Is that what the government wants? If those opposite think that through, it means that ultimately the cost to government will be very much greater because, sooner or later, it will have just about everyone on a pension. I do not know whether government members have given much thought to that, but that is obviously the logical conclusion to the way that they have headed. I ought to make the point here that there is also considerable disquiet in the community about the treatment of managed investments. That is another excuse that we have heard from this side. Why does the government treat share portfolios this way? It says that is because it treats managed investments that way. But two wrongs do not make a right. In my view, the treatment of unrealised capital gains on managed investments-that is, property trusts and so on-is equally wrong and is causing exactly the same sorts of problems for pensioners today. I note that there has been a little bit of progress, at least for those of us who have been talking about this, because the Department of Social Security came out the other day, apparently directed by the Minister for Social Security (Mr BaldWin), and decided to capthe capital gains at 50 per cent. That is a 50 per cent rate of return-and I do not know how many investments will exceed that rate; that is very generous. If someone has a 70 per cent rate of return, I would like to know what the money is invested in because that would be handy information. But at least once it exceeds 50 per cent the pension will not be affected. . Mr Ruddock-I don't know how they're going to do it.",82
115,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"I do not know how they are going to do any of it. One would have to be Einstein to work out this formula. These for elderly people, who deserve a little bit of peace and quiet, have come to me with this formula. The honourable member for Berowra read out some letters. I do not know what lengths we have to go to in order to make the point. It is all right for the people in the Department of Social Security to press a button on one of its computers in order to work through this formula, but poor Mr and Mrs Average Pensioner out there cannot understand it and, frankly, neither can I. I give the example-I hope this is not too much for the Assistant Minister to wrap his mind around-of a pensioner who has 1,000 shares in two companies-company A and company B-and the share price in both companies is the same on 23 September 1992. The share price in company A on 23 September 1993 has gone up to $8.50, but in company B it has gone down to $4.60. If we do the calculation, we will find that is a loss of $1.95 on the shares in both companies. Both companies pay the same dividend. I guess those opposite would think that was fair-that there would be no effect on the pensioner's income because the gain on one share would be offset by the loss on the other. But that is not so. If we work through this formula, we find that the gain on company A for this particular pensioner's shareholdings is $3,049.62 but the offsetting loss is only $1,028.55. The pension adjustment ends up being just over $1,000 a year. How does that happen? We would have to scratch our heads and think, 'Hang on. The gain on one of the shares has been offset by the loss on the other'. Those opposite should try to get the answer to·that from the Department of Social Security. I cannot figure it out; most pensioners cannot figure it out. It is not just the principle of this thing tllat is wrong; I can tell the minister that the mechanics are also wrong. He should try to explain that to me and, in the course of doing so, maybe some other people will start to understand it as well. The Perpetual Trustees group, which manages a huge portfolio, makes the statement, which I also totally agree with, that this just shows that the government has a basic misunderstanding of what investing in the share market is all about. I believe that is true. I think the government has got it cOmpletely wrong, and I hope that it will be impressed by the deluge of opposition it has received to this proposal. ' I will refer to a couple of other examples that I brought in. The honourable member for Berowra read from some letters that he had received, and I have received many letters. I have a lot of part-pensioners in my electorate, and many of them have small share portfolios. Some of them might only be described as hobby portfolios, and there is nothing at all wrong with that. They will of course now have to sell their shares. In fact, the advice that I am giving to most pensioners, and that they have been getting from a lot of investment advisers,is that they will have to sell their shares because this is too risky. ,Ultimately, they do not know from one day to the next whether they are going to be able to live or not, so they will have to sell their shares. When we think about this, how much is it worth to upset 90,000 pensioners? Is it worth the projected savings of around $60 million or $70 million? They have been cut back because of the cap that has been put on it, slightly. Ultimately, of course, if the pensioners sell all their shares, the savings will not eventuate at all because no pensioners will have shares or be prepared to buy them at all. What will the government have achieved by that exercise other than to upset a whole lot of people who do not, at this stage of their lives, deserve to be upset? One pensioner has written to me about his small share portfolio. He has shares in Pacific Dunlop, BTR Nylex, Westpac and the ANZ. These are bluecchip shares. If pensioners are going to invest in shares, the leading industrial shares are the only shares they are going to invest in. Let us look at BTR Nylex. These particular pensioners purchased BTR NyJex shares on 25 February 1991 for $2.99. On 23 September 1992, the market value of those shares was $2.61. That is the starting date for the calculation. I do not know what they will be on 23 September 1992, but they are going up. I can tell honourable members that yesterday'S last sale was at $3.10. The pensioners purchased the shares for $2.99, they are worth $3.10 today, so they have actually gained 11c-at least by the government's calculations, and assuming that is the case in September. One would think that that is not too much, but that is not the way the calculation is done. The price at 23 September 1992 was $2.61. The price today is $3.10. The Department of Social Security ,says, 'No, you have actually made 49c profit'. It does not take into account that the shares were purchased for $2.99 and went down-as almost all shares did at that time. If one goes through the same exercise with Westpac shares, one will find the same thingalthough it is much worse for Westpac. These people purchased their shares at $4.15, and they went down to $2.99 on 23 September 1992. (Time expired)",84
116,Ms CRAWFORD,Unknown,"I rise to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Aql-ndment Bill 1993. This bill addresses a number of issues, in particular the child disability allowance. Most honourable members would know that the child disability allowance is paid to people who care for disabled children at home. There are several refonns in this bill' which will make this allowance considerably more effective. One of those refonns enables people who share the care of children to share the disability' allowance. That makes for a m.uch fairer payment all round. It is at times such as this that we must look at this government's program in which we have effectively made possible changes to the lives of many people who are affected by this whole question of disability. We have seen in the budget this week a number of excellent programs in relation to schools and school leavers. A new $4.5 million pilot program called jobnet 'will increase employment and training opportunities for some 1,200 young people with a disability. It will ensure that schoolleavers do not lose their skills and confidence if they cannot find work soon after leaving school. It will also help those who have left sheltered workshops,' for open employment but who have subsequently lost their jobs. This pilot program offers the kind of specific assistance to individuals within our community who need assistance, who want to work, who are capable of working, and who just need that extra bit of help to provide them with what most of us take for granted-the ability to go to an employer and find ourselves a job. One of the other important funding programs i- the transition for students with disabilities. I personally am delighted to see this program in place because we have had a number of meetings in my electorate and in south-east Queensland in which we have raised this whole issue of disabled children leaving school. The amount granted to state governments in 1993-94 is $0.8 million, rising to $2 million in 1994-95. In 1995-96 the program will provide for the employment of some 80 school based liaison officers. These liaison officers will act as a link to schoolteachers, to education institutions, to potential employers, and to employment services. These teachers will look at the skills of school leavers in some of our schools that look after children with special needs, provide that particular focus, and develop an individual program for these children. Our schoolleavers with disabilities will no longer be condemned to either work in sheltered workshops or simply be paid to while away their time at home. The opportunities now exist and, thanks to this government, will continue to exist and expand for people to gain open employment, to undertake supported employment. The same is true for accommodation. As someone who has seen people's lives transformed by their ability to live in ordinary suburban houses in suburban streets, I.can say only that these projects provide the kinds of opportunities that should be available to all people in our community but which are especially important to people with special needs. As I have said here time and time again, why should people who happen to have a special need be denied the right to wake up and get up when they feel like it, to eat what they like when they feel like it, and to watch television programs or to have a normal, healthy social life. It seems that for too long disabled people in our community, school leavers in particular, have been pushed to the corner. Other people have made decisions for them. They have either been very heavily institutionalised, or they have been exploited within sheltered workshop situations. I am delighted to see that those days are no more. The introduction of this transition funding for school leavers with disabilities is a milestone. It acknowledges that there is a need there and that that need has been addressed. We know that these young people will rise to take this opportunity. I have seen that happen in the lives of a whole gamut of people. I know of one operation which used to operate as a sheltered workshop but which has gone into supported and open employment. It has given 60 people the opportunity to become taxpayers, and they love it. It is a very important aspect of what we should be about. If we want to create a fair and just society, we also have to ensure that our school leavers have a chance to use their abilities to participate as fully as they are able to in our society. We, as a society, must welcome them with open arms. I am delighted to see in the budget programs such as jobnet and the transition for students with disabilities. There is a further project which will provide $0.8 million: a year to establish a pilot project employing 15 regional disability liaison officers who are to be based in universities. Many universities now acknowledge that people with all sorts of disabilities and special needs can and do become excellent students arid should be given the right opportunity. These officers will be involved in the provision of equipment, be note takers, and will provide special assessment and examination requirementsthe kinds of things that we take for granted. Access ramps and suitable toilets are all part of this-and so too, more importantly, are communication aids. As we move into an enormously exciting technological and communications revolution, we open up a world to people who traditi6nally were perhaps unable to participate with pen and ink, but have found themselves to be able to communicate much more effectively through the kinds of new technologies that have emerged. So people will be given access to university places-some of them for the very first time. That surely is not just an opportunity for them to participate; the wider community is also enriched by sharing lives with people who have special. needs. When I hear, as we heard earlier, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and others on the opposition side talking about the budget as one that does not care for people, that does not look after those people in need, then I simply say to them, 'Who do you think these programs are geared to?' There is a whole package for people with disabilities because on this side of the house we have taken the implementation of the disability discrimination legislation seriously. The proposed supported wages system, the whole vocational assistance program for people with psychiatric disabilities, and the disability panels are all very much part of this government's thinking and this government's commitment to people with special needs. When we read about the child disability allowance, we know that this is an implementation of policy. This is not merely blind rhetoric; it is policy in, action. I am delighted to see that this program is here as part of this government's budget package today. When people stand up and say that those with special needs are not being catered for, look very closely at these programs because there are millions of dollars being spent on those people who deserve our care and attention. Indeed, for too long we have heard about the plight of people with psychiatric disabilities. As we know, Brian Burdekin, one of our human rights commissioners, has been doing quite a large study on mental health in Australia. He has pointed to the concerns and the needs of those people in the community who have psychiatric illnesses and so on. In addressing this particular issue and in providing a particular service-vocational rehabilitation pilots-for people with these disabilities, it is important that we as a government stand up and say that this is happening. We need to ensure that people do get a fair and just opportunity to playa role in society. We have also heard a great deal of discussion about the research into people with acquired brain damage. Indeed, this government has committed $0.2 million to a twoyear research program which is .looking at the appropriateness and availability of services for people who have acquired brain damage. As a government, we continue to look at particular types of people. We are not pushing them away, not shoving them in large institutions and pretending they do not exist; we are bringing them into the community. The party of inclusion becomes the government of inclusion. When we see people with special needs, we say, 'Here is a group of people deserving of our attention'. Within this budget, and indeed within this legislation, those people's particular needs and concerns are addressed. , The needs of other people are also addressed in this bill-for instance, the needs of sole parents and their employment entry payments. As someone who was particularly active in ensuring that sole parents' needs were addressed in a realistic way through these employment entry payments, I am delighted to see a clarification in relation to this payment. Sole parents will be able to have their own amounts of money taken into account rather than some other family payments when we are considering employment entry payments. The needs of sole parents as a target group in our community are very much addressed through a range of programs, such as JET, and through job clubs and so on. Rather than going around vilifying people and suggesting that whole groups of people are doing all sorts of things in order to acquire a pension, we need to look at the kinds of people who actually are sole parents. Once again, I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to honourable members in this House that the profile of a sole parent is a person who has been married for something like 10 years, is in her mid-thirties and has two children somewhere between the ages of eight and 10. This is very different from the image that we hear about from those who suggest that whole ranges of people should not be paid benefits. Instead of all the vitriol and instead of saying that sole parents should not be paid and should be put away in the comer, we as a government say, 'No, this is a group of people which is most in need of our care and concern, whose children deserve the very best, and people whom we know are some of the very poorest in our community'. We do know and understand that for a sole parent to break the cycle of poverty for herself and her family-because, let us face it, over 96 per cent of our sole parents are female-employment has to become a key issue. Let me tell you, sole parents are grabbing the opportunity with both hands. I cite a skillshare award nominee from one of my very own skillshare programs in my electorate who won our regional contest. Here is a woman who has not been in the paid work force for 20 years, who is in her mid-forties and who has now, through her own efforts and through taking the opportunities offered, found herself in full-time employment for all of this year. We can only congratulate her and hope that she goes on to win our state final. So when I hear people saying that the needs of our sole parent pensioners and the issues facing them are not being addressed, I simply say to them, 'This is not so, We can cite you dozens of examples of people who are very anxious and very keen to get back into the work force because they recognise that the cycle of poverty for themselves and their families can only be broken by full and active participation in the work force and by being able to take up a whole range of opportunities' . The employment entry payment means that many of our sole parents are able to take up employment opportunities and meet the various clothing or transport needs that often come with seeking employment. We all know and recognise that sole parents care, about themselves last; their concern is usually for their children first and themselves second. But this payment, as outlined in this legislation, for them. There are a n,umber of other people whose needs have been taken care of: the spouses and partners of people who find themselves in gaol or in psychiatric confinement. In our compassion, we recognise, that these people are very much on their own; they are not part of a working partnership, but' a partnership that for a time is severed. So the person who remains in our community is deserving of that higher level of income, which is supplied at the rate normally awarded to single people. This is of course just and fair. We see this happen when older married couples are split up by the entry of one partner into a nursing home and so on. This action is a recognition and acknowledgment by this government of what actually happens; an acknowledgment of the reality of the way this community operates. Indeed, the Department of Social Security is very much about client services and focusing on people's needs. Of course, its ability to deliver these services has been considerably enhanced over a period of time through its greater computerisation, training programs and client services. In fact, some of these changes have come about because officers who care and are concerned about their work are able to deliver them. We all know that Australia's Department of Social Security is so highly regarded that we actually sell our expertise overseas. Nowhere else in the world has a welfare system that is not insurance based, as we have in this country. I think it is a great credit to this government and to all Australians that' we continue to maintain this system and that we continue to support those people in need. Whether they be the aged, members of our veteran community who have fought for us in wars, those people who have special needs through disability, people who find themselves left alone to raise their children, people who are ill or who are incarcerated in our gaols, all of these 'people are part of our community. As a government, we have a role to play in ensuring that everybody is part of this community and that their needs are addressed. This social security legislation is which acknowledges the needs of different groups within our community is evidence of the way in which this government is moving. Another special group within our community are those who have 'ffiedically acquired mv. Since the provision by the New South Wales Government of a financial package to some of those people, this government has also acknowledged their income as not being income under the ordinary income test. This is another sign of compassion on the part of the government. It is a sign that this government is able not just to say that we care, but to act upon the needs and the concerns of a whole range of people in our community-not just those who are rich and powerful, who have access to their federal members of parliament and who can stand up and speak for themselves. As a government, we should always be responsible for those who are unable to stand up and speak for themselves, whether they be families of people who are in gaol, families of people with psychiatric disabilities or little children with disabilities, or people with medically acquired HIV. A whole range of people in our community are deserving of our assistance. This government acknowledges that, and so too does the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. I conclude by saying that what we see in this Social Securitf Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is a translation of the care and concern that this government has for various groups in our community. We have seen that further translated, certainly by the additional help for people with disabilities, as outlined in the Keating government's budget last night, and as translated into action through the social security provisions in the budget. We as a government are very much about caring for people who cannot care for themselves and ensuring that those people's voices are heard as loudly and as clearly as those who are the rich and powerful in our community. It gives me great pleasure to support the bill.",85
117,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"The part of the second reading amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) which I want to address this evening is that part that reads: . . . the House condemns the Government for its gross breach of faith with the Australian electorate (2) its failure to repeal the provisions of the Social Security Act treating unrealised capital as income for the purposes of the income test for pension and benefit eligibility ... Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, I was elected as the federal member for Lyne only five months ago. That electorate consists of a large percentage of retired people and a large percentage of pensioners. During that time. I have been swamped by constituency concerns regarding the government proposals to treat unrealised capital gains on· listed shares as income for the purpose of obtaining a pension. These people are not the rich and wealthy. These people are not the high fliers. These people are the people that the government purports to represent and look after. These people are not trying to diddle the public purse. They are just trying to live with a little bit of dignity. I congratulate the Senate standing committee on its recent public hearings, and I congratulate all the people who took the time to make submissions to that committee. There was massive opposition from within the community. I would have thought it was a clear sign to the government that this section of the community may be grey, but they are certainly far from lifeless, because from all accounts they showed a great deal of spirit and intelligence during the public hearings. I call on the government and, in particular, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) to take time to listen to what these people have to say and strongly consider the recommendations that may come from this committee. I also recommend that the Minister for Social Security closely analyse the minority report of the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which also addressed this issue and which quite clearly details the problems that will arise from the introduction of this legislation. I would like to put on record my position relating to this issue. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is clearly wrong. It treats an unrealised capital gain as income rather than treating it under the assets test. It flies in the face of logic. This legislagains tion does not take account of the fact that bills have to be paid, that food has to be put on the table and that income is an ongoing demand. Income· cannot realistically be assessed as being a share portfolio. The government must realise that one cannot barter shares to pay an electricity bill. One cannot barter shares to buy a loaf of bread. A share portfolio is not income is a ridiculous approach by the government to try to assess it as such. As one of the previshares ous speakers said, we cannot tear the comer off a share leaflet and pay one of our counts with it. That is the situation in a lot of our pensioners find themselves. This legislation discriminates against shares as an investment. If the Parliamentary tary to the Minister for Social Sciacca) wants to be equitable, why is he not treating similar investments in the same manner? Other investments, such as antiques, artwork, collectibles and other less liquid investments have not been treated as income. What about the family home? Why not have it revalued every six months? Therefore, will clearly happen is that pensioners genuinely have shares for investment potential will remove them and place them in other investments. We are only going to see a in these savings. This point was strongly argued by the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange. I would like to put on record a media release regarding Mr Cox's outrage. The media release reads: Regulations aimed at assessing unrealised capital gains as part of the pensions income test would see pensioners abandon the share market, Australian Stock Exchange (AS X) chairman Laurie Cox said today. Mr Cox told ABC Radio's Business Report the legislation effectively double counted shares as part of both the pensions income and assets test. Mr Cox has twice written to Social Security minister Peter Baldwin asking that the provisions be repealed, describing it at an ASX dinner as an outrageous piece of legislation. ""The impact of this legislation will see pensioners sell their shares and put the money in other investments that are not subject or affected by the legislation . . . ""I think sadly that this is a loss for our market and a loss for our savings ... This discriminates against the stock market not only in comparison with any other form of investment, but also in comparison with overseas markets. This is regressive legislation and will only force genuine investors into and it alternative investment arrangements. The obvious alternative for pensioners with is that many, if not all, of the 85,000 pensioners presently holding share portfolios acwill sell their shares, at a time when the which government purports to try to encourage saving in Australia. This is the course of action about which many constituents within Secrethe electorate of Lyne have voiced their Security (Mr concerns to me. I have some letters with me that show the dissatisfaction of the community with regard to this legislation. These letters are from people who just want to live their lives in peace and quiet. They do riot want to be disturbed by anybody. They do not want to what disturb anybody else. They only have small who shareholdings. They do not have large shareholdings. They have them so that they have got some financial security of their own. shift They do not generate a large amount of income each year as far as dividends are concerned. They are quite happy to pay tax on those dividends each year. I will quote from a number of letters. One of them reads as follows: My wife and I hold between us 1846 shares in BHP not a large share holding by any means, as I am sure you will agree. We purchased the bulk of these 1846 shares in 1974 and 1975, ie. 18 and 19 years ago and 11 and 12 years before I reached pensionable age. It can therefore with absolute certainty be stated that these shares were not purchased with a view to ""obtain good returns on the investment, while avoiding the income test. On the contrary, we invested hard earned money that was painstakingly savedwhilst paying taxes at the same time in these shares in order to make ourselves financially as independent as possible by the time that I was due to retire. BHP shares reached a ,(welve month high of $15.12 and a twelve month low of $10.18 ... This is a differential of $4.94 which could very well be applying to the situation on 23 September, 1993. After BHP's recently published record earnings, it could also very well be that the differential will be much larger than $4.94. The dividend paid by BHP during the last twelve months amounted to $0.41 per share. According to the Minister's calculation, the differential and the amount of dividend set a product rate of return of 52.6%. So 50 per cent of that would be taken consideration in accordance with this legislaincome tion. The letter continues: The last sale on 30 June, 1993, was at $14.08 and naturally, the share price could well be higher than that on 23 September, 1993. This therefore means that in our case the annual assessed income would be ... $13,671.62. The joint pension of my wife and myself then be reduced by SOc for every dollar of the assessable income, resulting in a cut in our for the next twelve months of $6,835.81 or $131.46 per week. So much for the minister's statement that this legislation makes ""the income test even fairer so much for his other statement ""that the likely effect of the new measure on pension payments will be negligible for pensioners who hold small share holdings"". Negligible indeed, when the is a reduction in weekly pension of $ 131.46!! How are these people going to survive? I will tor. quote from a letter which was written in response to correspondence that this person received from the minister's office. The writer speaks about taxpayer funded pension and states: I've been a taxpayer all of my working life and am. Being past retirement I still have a part job and have always endeavoured to do the possible with my small amount of capital so to be a burden on the Government or anyone else in my older age. It does seem to me that the Government is encouraging every individual once they reach pensionable age to sell all of their investments, spend up hence become eligible for a full pension. There is certainly NO incentive for that age group to do otherwise. Genuine investors who receive a pension will leave the stock market if the government proceeds with this legislation. The only/ pensioners who will remain in the stock oppose market will be those who have an interest other than an investment interest in maintainthis ing their shares. Amongst the elderly comcampaign', munity there are numerous types of people this situation. These are the only people legislation will target and it is ridiculous the government sees pensioners who are saving for the future of themselves and their families as a potential revenue source. Just last week I spoke to a pensioner who was holding onto her shares so that she had something to pass onto her grandchildren. She into was not worried about the income. The from those shares was lower than the regulated threshold. All she wanted to do was have something to pass onto her grandchildren. She described these shares as her only sense of dignity-this government talks about social justice and dignity and it will take it away from these people-as they were would amongst the only things she actually owned pension and could proudly pass onto her children. The government's so-called welfare safety net of welfare payments is currently more like a spider's web, not a safety net, because when /l , and one becomes a welfare recipient in this country under the current government one is trapped in this regime for good with no way result out. The government's aim is to reduce everybody to the lowest common denominaIt is this type of welfare dependent thinking that worries me so much about this proposal, this current government and, in particular, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security. It seems the parliamentary still secretary believes that elderly Australians time should exhaust their own money, such as best share portfolios, before 'crying home to as not mama' and receiving some form of pension payment. I totally reject this view. The reality is that many pensioners are hoping of a future without relying on government welfare and and are trying to save in any way possible. This issue is not about who is spending whose money; it is about trying to encourage as many Australians as possible to save as much money as possible at a time when national savings are vital to our future as a nation. As a matter of interest to people who this legislation, the Minister for Social Security is describing our attempt to repeal legislation as 'a very extensive scare implying that we are all trying to in scare the elderly community into a confused this and discouraged state. The sooner the that Minister for Social Security stops playing Mr Clever Politician and starts trying to get a grasp of his portfolio, the better off the needy and the elderly community in this country will be. It is this government and that minister who have the elderly people in this country in a confused state over this piece of legislation. The introduction of this unfair legislation will pr->ve to be a logistical nightmare for the Department of Social Security. For example, it has been previously argued that unless Department of Social Security reviews are all carried out on the same day-there has been no suggestion that this will occur-pensioners with identical shareholdings and the same dividend income could have markedly different pension outcomes. On top of this, if this legislation is introduced, there will be a guaranteed increase in administrative costs for the Department of Social Security, as it tries to keep abreast of market fluctuations and of actual share assets, sales and dividends, as is the same with most current. government policies. The only winner out of this legislation will be Sir Humphrey and his army of public servants. The Department of Social Security itself is starting to realise the implications of this legislation by trying to alter the formula. it uses for measuring any capital gain from shares. It has been shown in Department of Social Security documents that the department itself recognises the inequity in this legislation and has tried to solve it somewhat. These documents conclude that the maximum increase at which shares will be deemed to have increased in any 12-month period will be 50 per cent, with the following statement being contained in its departmental minutes: The department recognises that some types of shares, especially speculative mining ventures may produce sudden large rates of return which may also fall rapidly. Because of this, no share will assessed with a rate of return higher than 50%. While I welcome this change by the Department of Social Security, it is very much a bandaid job on the run and, if anything, makes it more important to be dismissed by the government because revenue is now only half that which it was originally whilst just as many people will be legislated against, and for all the same reasons. It is· as though the Department of Social Security has recognised its mistake but due to the current political agenda is unable to stand up and say that it made a mistake. It is therefore hoped that the Minister for Social Security plays a leading role in realising this legislation is faulty and in repealing this unfair legislation altogether. Added to this series of strange decisions coming from the department regarding this legislation is the enlightening knowledge gained from a second reading speech of the Australian Democrats on this issue that shows the formula to be used by the department to be fundamentally flawed. A simple example used in explaining the problems of the department's formula reads: . . . A share portfolio increases in value from $10,000 to $12,000 over the 12 month period prior to the day of assessment and pays a dividend of $500. The return (for social security purposes) is $2,500: the increase in capital value ($2,000) plus the distribution ($500). The return expressed as a percentage of the value of the asset at the start of the review year is 25%. Under the formula, the past rate of return is applied to the current assets value. So the past percentage value is applied to the asset value on the day of assessment-that is, 25% of $12,000, or $3,000. In this situation, the DSS calculated income figure of $3,000 is $500 more than the actual return. Joe Blow is unfairly discriminated against in his pension payments. This clearly shows the formula to be wrong and simply must not be introduced on 23 September this year. It is unfair and inequitable legislation and I call on the Minister for Social Security to take some leadership and repeal this legislation before it is introduced next month. Regarding the overall dealings of the government towards the elderly community, we clearly saw that the budget last night was be not about jobs, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) expressed right at the start of the budget address. The government's own forward estimates show that during the next 12 months unemployment will remain at 10.75 percent. This budget's sole aim was to try to keep the government's fanciful election promises and, by so doing, it is now absolutely destroying this country in which we live. I quickly jolt a few memories and remind the Treasurer that during the election campaign he promised to remove all pensioners from the tax system by 1995. In fact, the Labor Party's official election platform states: Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point. Now just five months after these claims we find that they were sadly what has to be termed as lies. I think it is time this government was held accountable for the absolutely ridiculous promises it makes to people of Australia. For example, in my electorate I still see children living in poverty-and this ,is 1993. These promises must be pulled into line and I think we must put into place some form of self-regulation on this practice because it is currently giving hope to people and then just taking it away, just so the true believers can kid themselves that they are genuinely serious about what they are doing. We need to review this practice of promising the earth at election time only to have it taken away five months later. The election commitments by the current government have obviously played a role in shaping this budget, and I argue that they have played a very negative role in the budget process as it has seen the government concentrating more on protecting its own party interests than on developing genuine long-term and consistent plans for the future of Australia. We need to review this practice before the next election and put into place some form of self-regulation and accountability. It. goes to the heart of the issue we are talking about this evening, that the government purports to represent this section of the community. As I said at the start of my address, pensioners with small shareholdings are not the highfliers or the rich and wealthy. They do not have large portfolios. They are trying to live comfortably without any interference. This legislation has created a nightmare for people in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, and in mine, as we both know. These people are desperate to find out what is going to happen. They are seriously considering getting rid of their shareholdings. We will have a greater drain on the public purse as they move onto full pensions when they discard their assets and sell their shareholdings. I urge the House to support this amendment.",89
118,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"I support the Social Security Legislation well Amendment Bill. I think it needs to be pointed out that Australia has one of the fairest and best regulated social security systems in the world. Much has been said in condemnation of the so-clllled welfare state. Many people on the conservative side of politics consider that welfare of any kind stifles .initiative and makes life too easy and comfortable for those who cannot fend for themselves. The forces of free enterprise often consider that the giving of financial support to individuals by governments encourages laziness and turns potentially energetic human beings into dependent ones. . I am astonished at the ill-informed comments which I hear from otherwise enlightened people concerning the level of welfare spending al\d the status of those who receive benefits. While there is no doubt that any system which has been established to help the needy will always aUract a minority which attempts to exploit the system, the government has been diligent in dosing loopholes. This bill takes that diligence a step further by instituting penalties for those who abuse the system. Such measures will ensure that those who need and deserve social security . benefits will receive them and those who abuse the system. will be identified and discouraged from such activity. Although the following point is not part of debate on the bill, I was encoura:ged by a paragraph in last night's budget papers that promised to deal with an anomaly I raised in this place at the end of the last. session of parliament. It states: New provisions from January 1994 will allow a debt to be recovered from a person convicted of being knowingly concerned in another person's fraud against DSS. The situation to which I referred in my previous speech concerns ,""('men who were required to repay sole pacl;nt benefits for periods when they have cohabited with a man. While I by no means condone the activities of these women, nor object to the requirerpent to repay the debt, I feel.very strongly that the men who benefit from the woman's sole parent benefit should also be held responsible. This issue was brought to my notice by several constituents, one of whom was the victim of a violent partner. She was also the mother of a child born with a rare blood cancer. A refusal by the man to provide for her and the child left her with little choice to apply for the pension, while still a vulnerable teenager herself. It was the dying wish of her son, who died last year prior to his 17th birthday, that his father should contribute to the repayment of the sole parent benefit. The other case was one which I could attribute only to ignorance where a family of five was living off the sole parent benefit for a mother and two children. The family was entitled to a benefit, but unfortunately the mother had applied for the wrong one; now the mother has to repay the benefit and the man will probably get away scot-freealthough perhaps not after next year. I commend the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) for recognising this anomaly and tightening the rules. The provisions of this bill acknowledge the continuing need for welfare services and establish more equitable means by which these services can be delivered. They should therefore go a long way towards eliminating the concerns of those who believe that the government's system of social security is too lax. Of course it will not convince those who believe that all forms of social security should be abolished. Anyone of this mind needs only to talk to people who lived through the Depression of the 1930s when no such benefits existed and families were thrown upon the welfare of their friends and relatives. I believe that a caring society working with a caring government should, and will, provide assistance and support for those less able to care for themselves. This need not result in dependence and should also involve encouragement, self-help and the development of self-esteem. These policies are an integral part of this government's social justice policy, a policy which has seen the development of policies and programs for the benefit of a wide range of Australians whose needs have not previousIy been properly met. The first and most important group in need in the community is the unemployed. Creating jobs will not be achieved by constantly trying to find someone to blame. The government's budget initiatives in this regard are to be applauded. New labour market programs will create but over 500,000 places at a cost of $1.3 billion, more than double the amount spent in 199192. The recognition of community and voluntary work for unemployed people is dear to my heart. I believe that many people wish to give their time to worthwhile local projects while trying to get back into the permanent work force. A budget initiative bf $3 million will assist some 7,000 participants in gaining up-to-date work experience through these community activities. An additional 1,650 places in NElS will be available for unemployed people wishing to start their own business. An area in which I have had considerable involvement in my own electorate is the provision-of employment opportunities for the disabled. Two organisations in my electorate which are funded by the government for this purpose are NOVA Employment and SydWest Employment Services. Recently I opened a new office of Syd-West Employment on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe). It was extremely gratifying on that occasion to meet some of the intellectually disabled people who were clients of SydWest. Some of them had been found work and others were still looking; but the enthusiasm and joy of those people, knowing that they would be accepted into the work force and could become citizens alongside their more able-bodied fellows, was extremely encouraging. Such initiatives enable disabled people to take their rightful place in society rather than being shut away from the community, often in institutions. Training in job skills, self-esteem and living skills is resulting in greater satisfaction and fulfilment on the part of disabled people. It also results in employers finding willing and committed staff who are proving to be stable and long-term employees. For those people who think that spending taxpayers' money on the time consuming task of finding jobs for the disabled, an examination of the economic results will be pleasing. It costs about $7,000 to place one disabled person in work, including monitoring and follow-up work. It costs considerably more to maintain disabled persons on pensions for the rest of their lives, not to mention the human cost. The government's social justice agenda also directs programs for the very young and very old. The cash rebate scheme for child care will be mtroduced next year and legislation to enact this policy will shortly be debated in this House. This move will be accompanied by an increase in child-care places of 29,000. The introduction of the seniors health card in July 1994 will provide access to concessions under Medicare for pharmaceuticals, hearing aids, dental care and optometry. I know that the many retired people in my electorate will appreciate this valuable assistment ance. One of the key social justice areas which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) highlighted during the election campaign was the status of women in our community. At the launch of the national agenda for women the Prime Minister set out the key areas for action. Through focus groups across Australia the government asked women what they wanted. Three main areas of concern were identified: child care, women's health and violence against women. Action is being taken on each of these vital issues. Apart from policies I have already mentioned, the government will also be providing cash assistance for women who stay at home with their children. The home child care allowance of $60 per fortnight will replace the dependent spouse rebate and assist about 840,000 families. Among the many initiatives in the women's health area, one of the most important is the $3.5 million longitudinal study of women's health. This study will guide planning for future health services for women and, hopefully, eliminate some of the hit and miss strategies of the past. In addition to direct assistance for women to escape domestic violence, an inquiry into gender bias in the law is currently being carried out by the Australia Law Reform Commission. This study has attracted a good deal of attention. I was recently privileged to host a meeting in my electorate of women from all walks of life, from different women's organisations, to discuss this topic. It was an extremely lively debate with an enormous number of contributions coming from women of all ages. I was privileged also to have somebody present from the Law Reform Commission who is working on this study. The women want to meet again once they have read the discussion paper which was recently issued by the Law Reform Commission. I have spoken previously in this House about some of the judges and their peculiar decisions, so I will be glad if that shows some fruit. There are many more social justice initiatives which the government is undertaking and will continue to develop. The governbelieves that all Australians are entitled to equality of opportunity and justice. I commend this bill to the House.",93
119,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"I strongly support the amendment moved so ably by the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and add some areas of concern I have about the government's failure to deliver social security services efficiently to Australians, contrary to the claims made in the second reading speech and by some the child care government members. Looking at the amendment, one could not help but be moved by some of the words the shadow minister read into the record from letters written by simple, unsophisticated people who have genuinely worked hard to put aside something towards their future, their retirement, their security or whatever it is. The common thread coming from those people and the ones from whom I have seen and heard in my electorate is that they saved because they thought Australia was a nation that respected people who did and that this was the way to do things. Given the opportunity to save, they saved. As a young boy, I can remember the pride children had when they used to go to school with a Commonwealth Bank passbook given to them by their families. We would make a small deposit on either a Monday or a Tuesday. That was built into our lives and we were very proud of it. When I had the grand sum of £5 credit in that book that was a momentous occasion for me. Strangely, we now have a government in Australia which for some reason seems to envy and resent the right of people to provide for their future. I find it both frightening and fascinating that our government today in Australia has that sort of psyche. I am glad to say that a lot of members in the present government do not subscribe to that view and are very troubled by the way in which the government is mishandling the legislation regarding the pensioner share Increasingly, they are saying to people, on a confidential basis at this stage, that they are disturbed at the trend that is developing or has developed in this government. It is up to those members, because they are responsible for the government, to answer for it. I only hope that they will put more pressure on their colleagues the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) to do something before the fateful trigger day in September when the legislation comes into effect. One of the most graphic ways of illustrating why the government should review the law and heed the call of the shadow minister in his amendment is the vivid example of the family who had retained share ownership getting because they wanted to provide an alternative and a choice on future medical treatment for Medicare. themselves if a family member had a serious illness that resulted in an amputation. That family made the decision that if they could maintain their health insurance by having some supplementary income to their pension they could well find a medical solution problem facing thym. In that sense, they were doing something which surely all Australians were entitled to. Surely, we would feel pretty./ happy for them doing so. They are doing it because they do not feel secure about the public hospital facilities we all used to be so proud of in Australia. Australia used to have by far the best public hospital system in the world-not perfect, but the best. Regretfully, the public hospital system now cannbt cope with the demand. All of us have heard the call from the hospitals in our electorates. We know about the growing queues of people who are seeking pain relieving surgery-elective surgery. We know that the funds are not there to cope with it. No universal health system that I know about-and I have had a look at a few-can possibly fund unlimited medical requirements. It is a dream that we would all· like to achieve, but in reality no country has been able to find a national insurance scheme that will do so. That is why Medicare, which I support strongly and which the coalition has pledged to also support and improve, needs issue. help. Medicare needs help to develop a stronger partnership with the private health system so that the two systems can maximise their available resources and thus stretch the dollar further to provide additional services for people needing help. The government proudly boasts that Medicare was its greatest social reform and still says that it wants to foster and develop. h However, the government is putting furt er pressure on that system because down the line in another portfolio, as a result of some philosophical bent, it wants to stop people paying their own insurance premiums for private health insurance so they have a choice, thus leaving the queues and going into private hospitals or finding other ways of health treatment, thereby relieving the pressure on the private hospitals and Surely the government should have heard the message that by destroying the incentive of pensioners to save something towards their own health insurance it is creating a monster. I hope that the few government members who to the are now in the House will find renewed courage to pick up the message of the shadow minister in the amendment and go back to the government and say, 'Back off and come back with a proper amendment to the legislation that has created this problem in the first that place'. All honourable members on this side of the House and, I suspect, 40 per cent of our friends on the other side of the House would enthusiastically support such a measment ure. Even if the government brings it on midnight, we will all be happy to join it when it bounces that particular ball. The government has panicked and nounced that it does not intend to count fully the increase in value of shares, notwithstandmatter. ing the legislation it has brought in requiring that to occur, and that somehow it will require such disclosure only for share values beyond 50 per cent. Mr Ruddock-I don't know how they are going to do it.",95
120,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"I do not know how the government will do it either. As a lawyer, am wondering whether the government is pressure proposing to act illegally. Will the governthroughout ment also expect the Public Service to that too? I have a high regard for most public servants who work under enormous pressure and strain in Department of Social Security offices in Australia. They have horrendous job. Will the government expect them to start using their discretion and ignore the law? Mr Ruddock-You would want an inservice demnity from the minister.",97
121,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"As the shadow minister says, one would want an indemnity from the minister. Interestingly, this very legislation brought in by the Minister for Social Security is designed to provide legal remedies for anomalies discovered in the working of the social security legislation anyway. So I find that announcement extraordinary.",97
122,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,97
123,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was commenting that I hoped the government would urgehtly and quickly amend its ill-considered legislafrom tion, and thus allow pensioners in Australia return to what they had been led to believe was the case-that they could invest in shares for good reason without having the shares valued artificially for the purposes ·of deterthey mining income. The shadow minister's amendment touched on the government's position. breach of other strong commitments affecting pensioners given prior to the federal election. I want to reinforce my view that the governsome has done itself great harm with people at who very strongly supported it at the last election by failing to honour the exemption from the tax system. The catalogue of events anand statements outlined by the shadow minister adequately set out the history of the I do not know how the government is going to face up to that one, except to suffer the odium and blame that it deserves. I hope that sort of tempo will increase as the days go by. The government has involved itself in a blow-out of the use of social security services in Australia because of the economic probI lems of this nation. I touched briefly on the on the staff in social security offices Australia as a result of that blowcop out. If members on the other side of the of the House think that the system is working efficiently and well, I invite them to go and spend time talking with the staff in the social a security offices, and with the people who stand in the queues. I met one person recently who takes a thermos flask with him so that he' is at least refreshed regularly because of the hours that he seems to spend waiting for in respect of a particular aspect of social security. ' I am also alarmed to see the way in which people of ethnic origin-many of whom do need services from social security, particularly the elderly-are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to get assistance and guidance. I understand the rules of anticipation, but, in passing, I refer to question No. 244 that I put on the Notice Paper wherein I asked for details regarding the operation of the telephone number system 132468. After meeting a number of elderly people Italy who have lived in north-east to Victoria for many years, and hearing their descriptions of their experiences with that system, I decided to use it myself-and I did. I recommend to all honourable members that set aside an hour of their time and make a phone call. I did not misrepresent the I said I wanted to make enquiries for an elderly friend of Italian origin who had a problem dealing with pensions. I asked for help. I did not bring my notes with me, but I was referred to three or four different numbers from the first number. On each occasion all the officers at the other end were very courteous-I emphasise that. I think I went from Hobart to Melbourne. On one occasion I was given a number and it turned out to be a hotel by the bay. I rang back and I was told I had been given the wrong number, but that is another story. It was disheartening, to say the least, try to imagine how an elderly person with a language difficulty-in this case an elderly ethnic Italian person-could cope. He had gone to the counter of a regional office first, I might add, had asked for help, had been given a card, and told, 'Go away and ring'. Having gone with the card, and struggled with that, he had to try to cope with the system. I have had a bit of experience with the bureaucracy over the years, and I had difficulty myself. I could not resolve the problem in the time. I spent dealing with it-in fact, I .was far away from a resolution of it. I want to alert the minister to the fact that he has grave problems. The system is blown out. The pressure' is so great that apparently the staff cannot cope. We now have this impersonal telephone system that is supposed to solve the problem, but I can infonn the House now that, instead, it is making problems. Furthermore, it is sending the wrong signals to the staff that they can delegate' and relegate away from themselves the responsibility to handle an inquiry, when in fact the best staff-and the ones I know and admire so much in the social security areas and human relations areas-are the ones that will deal with the problem eyeball to eyeball and do their best, and not hand someone on to an impersonal telephone system. That is not satisfactory in any shape or fonn. Finally, I ask the minister whether he would be kind enough during the debate to clarify couple of points about the legislation. The legislation appears to enshrine the right of person whose spouse or partner is in prison a higher payment for social securityparliament equivalent almost to a widow's pension. I not sure whether I am right or wrc:mg, but am led to believe that this category of person can receive this benefit regardless of age, assuming that that person has not got any dependent children-in other words, a single person looking after himself. A person who loses his spouse or partner through death, and becomes a widow or widower, cannot get a benefit unless he is over the age of 50. I understand that person has to register for work and seek unemployment benefits while seeking work. I ask the to minister to clarify that and to enlighten the House as to whether that is the position and whether this legislation intends to continue that approach. If it does, then I believe there is an urgent need for review and refonn because I do not believe that categories of people whose spouse is unable to support them for some reason-either they have died or they have unfortunately gone to prison-should be treated differently. That is something· that needs to be looked at. The other matter I would like clarified is that there is a provision that allows people with medical illnesses due to AIDS-from operations, blood transfusions and the like-to receive an invalid pension regardless of the income that they might receive from trusts that pay supporting funds to these people. I support those trusts and I think that they are great. Yet I know people with serious disabilities, such as quadriplegics, who have income coming from some trusts that communities might have set up for them, and that income is counted in calculating their entitlements to an invalid pension. I would like the minister to explain to me the rationale between those people with genuine serious disabilities applying for an invalid pension and having .their pension reduced because they have got some assistance from some benevolent fund or other, and a those who are unfortunately inflicted with an AIDS-induced virus through no fault of their a own. I believe they are all deserving of help, to/ but for the life of me I cannot see why this should continue to support a am system of treating people unequally in that I area. Again I emphasise that there may well be good explanations for it that could overcome my difficulty and problem. I hope the minister can provide the House with a briefing in respect of those matters.",97
124,Mrs EASSON,Unknown,"The Social Security Legislatioq Amendment Bill seeks to make a number of useful changes to the general social framework in Australia, and I would like to comment on several of them. In division 3 of the bill, the government is offering an improvement in the conditions for the partner of a person who is in gaol or in a condition of psychiatric care. Until recently, a lower rate of social security payment was given to the partner who found himself or herself in this unfortunate circumstance. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and his department are to be praised for this alteration to the payments system. Now the payment will be made at the level of a single person. This is a higher level, and I thank the government for this small but, for some, valuable improvement in what must be a very harsh existence. We are all aware of our nation's straitened circumstances. However, we members of parliament must never lose sight of the fact that outside these walls there are not only workers, taxpayers and clients, there are also 18 million people-people with real lives and real problems. I know that government cannot and should not be a nanny to the population. The best form of social security is work in the context of a stable environment of a loving family and friends. No government can provide all of this. However, those bits and pieces that we can provide we should make every effort to target as accurately as possible. I urge the minister to look further at the social security of children who have one or even both .parents in gaol or in psychiatric care. One only has to witness the tragic deaths of children in' the last two weeks to realise the deep need to providesupport, care and intervention. We must not neglect the children. That is so easily done because they have no voice, no union, no executive director, no political party. Our function requires a view of the future, and Australia's children come into that view. Division 7 concerns the review of decisions. Until now, a social service recipient could be denied payment of arrears after a favourable review decision because of bureaucratic rigidity concerning dates. The legislation removes this arbitrary situation, and that removal is also to be welcomed. I am sure that even honourable members opposite would agree that social security payments should be based on a combination of need, justice, equity and the capacity of Australia to pay. I would especially emphasise the latter point. To deny someone a payment because today is the 18th and not the 17th, or some such arbitrary rule, is an unnecessarily stressful act. People dealing with social security are generally in need of an extra helping of care. Social security and the government generally cannot solve people's problems. People solve ,their own problems or learn to live with them. What we can do is show a degree of human compassion and help where we can. The division 7 amendment does that, and I urge the House to approve it. Division 10 deals with investment income. During the recent parliamentary recess I, like every member of this house, was visited by many pensioners who were very worried about the impact upon their pensions of recent changes to the assessment of shares and their value. I confess to some serious disquietover this matter. 1 was informed of the situation of elderly persons in their eighties living in nursing homes. The income from their shares paid their nursing home costs while their regular pension met their modest daily needs. The equation for these people is very delicate. Do we really intend to disturb these people and their families-some even without familiesby a possible seven alterations per year? Surely this is an unintended consequence of this measure. Can the department exempt from any social security calculation any money from any source used to pay for nursi,ng home or hospitalisation costs of our retired citizens? I seriously urge the minister to look at this matter and a possible exemption. A second 'situation that I noticed during the recess was that many of my constituents who were to have their pensions affected had most modest investments. It is an interesting experience to sit before two people in their sixties who show you an Advance Bank property investment certificate containing their life savings of $18,000. These people obviously missed the great financial reforms of the 1980s. Yet they said, and it is true, had they not saved but spent everything they would not now be facing seven reviews a year into their social security situation. I ask the minister to consult widely on the matter of small amounts of shares-say $35,000-as an amount to be overlooked, as well as on the question of shares income paying for nursing home or hospitalisation fees with a view to an exemption for both of these situations from the unintended consequences of this act. Division 12 concerns changes involving the landcare and environment action program. This excellent scheme has only one drawback: it is not widespread enough. I believe it should be further promoted. I cannot understand how young people with no immediate parental responsibilities would choose unemployment benefits when this very good scheme is available. Landcare is the most vital environmental matter concerning our country. The benefits of tree planting on a vast scale have been attested to scientifically. Last weekend, I personally helped plant 1,000 trees in the Concord district in my electorate. This is not 'make work' stuff. The potential benefit to Australia of a major expansion of this program is greater in the long term than anything else that I can think of. In the 1930s, President Roosevelt of the United States established the Civilian Conservation Corps. Its work was beyond measure in both redeeming a badly eroded countryside and in helping unemployed youth keep in contact with work as a way of life. I am sure that honourable members opposite would also be supporters of any scheme to improve our land and environment. The scientific evidence of the need for land care is irrefutable. What is needed is an act of will by both the government and the opposition on this vital matter. The small, useful step taken by the Department of Social Security in making an easier situation for those coming out of this scheme is to be commended. The scheme itself is excellent. Years in government and opposition can sometimes slow us down. I urge the House not to be stuck in old thinking but to look at the needs that and develop the will to tackle the problems. I commend the amendments contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill to this House.",99
125,Mr CAMERON,Unknown,"In speaking to the second part of the amendment to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill, moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), might I start my comments by commending the honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson) for her obviously studied and thoughtful ideas on this particular issue and the particular part of the amendment to which I speak this evening. On 30 July of this year, along with the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I hosted a public meeting in Western Australia with pensioners and retirees concerning the government's intention to treat unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purpose of calculating one's pension. We held this meeting in light of the fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs would not be taking evidence in Western Australia. The overwhelming-in fact, the unanimous-response from this meeting was that this legislation stinks. It is unfair, it is immoral, it is unjust and it defies logic. The main supporters of this legislation-the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), who originally introduced it, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), a very confused man on this issue-have a very dead, very smelly cat hanging around their collective neck. They have tried to defend this legislation throughout and that is attempting to defend the indefensible. As one pensioner asked-I have spoken to many hundreds of pensioners in the last month or so-how can an unrealised gain be classed as income when not a cent is received? It is a notional gain only, and notional gains do not buy groceries, they do not buy bus fares, and they do not pay for cataract operations, which these days pensioners are being forced to pay for because the government has also wrecked our health system. This legislation will take effect on 23 September, which is D-day for those pensioners affected. As of that day, a large number of pensioners throughout Australia will have their pension cut but they will not have any income to supplement their diminished pension other than the occasional dividend payment, if they are lucky. It is suggested that 88,000 pensioners will be affected-or three per cent if we can believe the figures we have been given. However, if the calls I get to my office-and obviously many other members get them, including the honourable member for Loweare representative of the pensioner population that is going to be affected, then I can tell honourable members that a large number of pensioners are being affected in a very sad way, and many have already sold their shares and are keeping the pension. One example from the public meeting I hosted with the honourable member for Cowan and the honourable member for Moore shows that the. government's figuring is questionable. One gentleman who came to the meeting owned shares and his wife was receiving a pension. However, because he owned shares, he was advised by the Department of Social Security that his. wife's pension would be cut. Now he is selling his shares and joining his wife completely oil the pension. Instead of saving money in this case, the DSS is paying out extra. I believe that is just the tip of the iceberg. It seems to me that among the most tragic victims of this immoral legislation are ,the widows who very often were not greatly involved in financial matters through their younger years. I am talking now of women who are into their late 60s, 70s and 80s, This is just a fact of life and the way that society was at the time, Very often the lady of the house did not have a lot to do with the financial affairs. Some qf these women were left small parcels of shares by their husbands, and in. many cases that I have heard of they would like to hold on to them, if not for any other reason than for sentimental reasons. They are confused and they are terrified. Just this week I have had an 86-year old woman break down in my office-and that is pretty difficult to deal with because this is a woman who could be my own grandmotherand tell me how terrified she was because she did not know what to do. She is terrified of the Department of Social Security. This is a fine reward, I say, to a fine Australian whose only crime was to see that she would not be a burden on society in her twilight years; this is what has been handed back to her. It is a disgrace. Quite frankly, I think the big fellow, Jack Lang, would be spinning in his grave over this one. There is also the issue of more staff. I have been informed by the DSS in Perth that two new staff have had to be put on in the financial information services office just to answer the queries on this legislation. I will put questions to the Minister for Social Security to confirm this, but the facts are that new staff are being put on and the legislation is already costing the government money instead of saving money, as this legislation was supposedly intended to do. With the confusion coming from the minister's office it is obvious that new staff have been required. Take, for example, the recent change to the ruling on the assessment of shares which caps all shares with a rate of return no higher than 50 per cent. This decision, of course, is in view of the volatility of the share market which sees many shares increasing by much more than 50 per cent. However, this decision was not communicated effectively. It is causing further concern amongst many pensioners who have misunderstood this ruling, further enhancing their concern. Their misunderstanding, I should add, was matched by journalists, politicians, and even DSS staff, according to people with whom I have spoken. If the minister's office cannot even inform the staff of a new decision, there are serious problems here. I would also like to address comments made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security on the Channel 9 Money show recently. I bet he enjoyed that experience. I can see why the minister gets his 2IC to speak for him. If I were him, I would not want to be seen defending this 'unreasonable, difficult to manage and meanspirited legislation'. That is how it was described by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in his letter to the Minister for Social Security. The honourable member was conspicuous by his absence when it came to the vote on the amendments to the legislation. However, he should be commended for at least opposing the legislation, if only behind closed doors.· The parliamentary secretary, on the other hand, would probably make his colleagues cringe if they heard him. When asked what pensioners affected by this legislation should do, the parliamentary secretary said: I'm sure there are rollovers, that there are annuities. I'm not a financial planner. I don't understand the whole, all the ambits and all the investment products ... He sounded very confused, and it was obvious that this was not the only thing he did not understand. He also does hot understand that a notional increase in the price of people's shares does not mean they have extra income. He does not understand the heartache· this legislation is causing; he does not understand that this legislation will only force people to sell their shares and to go on to the pension. Actually, he may understand the last point. He even suggested that this is what pensioners should do. He actually said: If they sell their shares there are plenty of other investments ... They can put it into fixed deposits, they can put it into a bank, they can buy debentures or whatever they want to do. What if they want to buy shares instead? Should they be forced to forgo part or all of their pension? The parliamentary secretary thinks so. He thinks pensioners should sell all they have before they go on a pension. I ask the parliamentary secretary: where is the incentive for young people today to save their money and provide for themselves in retirement? Pensioners have saved, they have invested, they have provided for their retirement. The parliamentary secretary is going the wrong way about treating them for being responsible. He went on to say: . . . the fact is, there are safer investments than investing in the stockmarket. The reply from the host of the Money show should be a lesson for the parliamentary secretary. He said of him: He's not an investment adviser. His suggestion to sell quality shares such as BHP and put the money into term deposits is pretty ordinary advice. If pensioners take the advice of the parliamentary secretary and sell their shares-following which they can do any number of things with their money-then they would be able to stay on the pension and the government's anticipated savings from this legislation would not be realised. The point is that even government members, the parliamentary secretary in particular, are convinced that pensioners will sell their shares and stay on the pension. It calls into question the government's expected savings. When the parliamentary secretary says pensioners will just sell out and go on the pension, that proves this legislation is unworkable. Not only is it immoral and unjust; it will force pensioners to sell their shares and stay on the pension. In the words of the honourable member for Fraser, the legislation is unworkable. Of greater concern is the indication by this government to younger Australians that they should not provide for their future. Why on earth would any young people want to save money to invest in Australian companies when they see their grandparents slugged at every opportunity? Indeed, the message of this government is: spend your money now, do not save, do not invest, do not provide for your future for, if you do, the government will slug you; it will kick you in the guts as it is doing time and time again to our pensioners. It is doing it to pensioners and, with rules like this, that is what will happen to our generation and younger generations. This legislation is living proof of the g->ve-en-'s uncaring attitude to older AustralIans. I mVlte any members opposite to come to the electorate of Stirling in Western Australia. I will Wednesday, 18 August 1993 organise a public meeting of pensioners and they can try telling them that this legislation is fair. They will not get out of there intact, I am afraid. I have heard it from pensioners that, if any government member gets near them, they will be very sorry indeed. In fact, I was asked to deliver a message to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that, if he ever crosses the path of a particular constituent of he will not be walking afterwards; or, if he is, he will not be walking comfortably. I say again: this is unfair legislation; unmanageable; it is unfair; it is mean-spirited; it will not achieve the savings the government has anticipated; it discourages national savings, and it should be repealed. If there is any ounce of honesty or compassion on the other side of the House, this legislation should be repealed. I urge honourable members opposite to rethink their stance, to find a heart and to repeal this most pernicious legislation.",100
126,Mr FERGUSON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) spoke of the government kicking pensioners in the guts time and time again. I think that is a fairly ridiculous comment We are talking about a very small minority of people who are currently recipients of the pension. Despite the fact that many people wduld like to ignore it, this legislation has to be seen in the context of expanded efforts by this government to give people greater access to fringe benefits and a variety of state concessions. It has to be seen in the context of what the government is doing in the area of hostel care. The reality is that the government is actually doing something about giving far more significant numbers of people a greater range of options in regard to housing, the expansion of money on hostels. Mr Ruddock-Child-care options.",103
127,Mr FERGUSON,Unknown,"I do not think child care really has much to do with the age pensioner population. There has been a widening of government efforts in all these fields. Obviously, in the very bad economic times that the opposition talks about constantly, it is increassaying ingly difficult for those PAYE taxpayers to carry this burden. Surely the Australian population wants to look at some targeting of these benefits. '> We really have to ask why people who are in receipt of this income, or have the availability of that income, should be treated differently' from those people who, since 1988, have had similar provisions applied to them in regard to equity trusts and property trusts. What we are essentially saying is that there is a group of people out there at the momentmine, and I know they are the minority-who, in some cases, have portfolios worth $100,000 and who are currently getting the age pension. it is Why should that position persist? At the last election the opposition said to the Australian population, 'We are going to strip social security. We are going to rip $1 billion out of it'. They are very good at generalities. They say,' 'There are too many freeloaders out there. We hate this welfare syndrome. We hate people being dependent on benefits'. We hear all this rhetoric about a group of people who, by any questionable standard, should be the last to be receiving the age pension. The opposition is running a very pernicious, opportunistic scare campaign in regard to assets and income tests in the electorate. They' are talking about targeting benefits, about decreasing dependence and actually reducing the extreme-as they see it-amount of money devoted to this sector. We really have to ask why now, when there is a chance for some equity in a time of very deep economic problems, we should not say that some of these people are able to look after themselves. If they make those choices, why should the wider population provide for them? The reality is that the cost of providing the age pension has increased from $8 billion in the mid-1980s to $10 1/2 billion today. As we all appreciate, if supetannuation does not succeed in closing the margin-which can increase-it will place a very big burden on decreasing numbers of people in the work force. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) said earlier that we are taxing people twice, and this kind of thing. We are that these people are able to provide for themselves if they choose. They have made investment judgments in the past that were motivated by financial advisers who said to them that they could continue to get these benefits regardless of how much money they acquired through shares. They have been given this advice and for some years it was advantageous to them. They have had a year to look at that situation and· they will now make decisions in respect of their shareholdings based on a proper judgment of· the value of the shares and whether it is worthwhile investing in companies or disposing of their shares and going on the pension. Clause 14 of the bill deals with people whose partners are in gaols or psychiatric institutions. It will entitle the party who is not in one of those institutions' to receive the single person pension or benefit, and that is a step in the right direction. I think that those opposite would be very aware of the realities of the economic problems in this country and the impact they must have on the crime·rate. Many people are in dire circumstances; that is the reality. Whether we like it or not, a significant number of people have been forced into desperate situations. Their spouses experience difficulties in being separated from their partners and being ostracised by society. In some cases, because of distance and placement in prisons, they are unable to be with their partners. The government is saying that special consideration should be given to these people. The Australian Institute of Criminology, in a document titled 'Trends and issues in crime and criminal justice: No. 40 economic adversity and crime' dated August 1992, deals with the crucial connection between imprisonment and the number of offenders. The article states: As far as the effects of economic· factors on participation are concerned, the existing evidence, ambiguous thoughit may be, provides fairly strong support for the proposition that delinquent children are much more likely to appear in areas which are economically disadvantaged. The article continues: . . . the existing research evidence allows us to assume that any significant increase in relative economic deprivation will, over the longer tenn, bring about increases in the supply of offenders in the community. Unless offset by developments which suppress individual offending rates (for example a significant increase in the risk of arrest), this will obviously exacerbate crime rates. It goes on to say: Such theories includ- the s-ggestion that delinquent subcultures tend to emerge out of any significant disjunction between learned aspirations and supply of legitimate opportunities for achieving them ... that relative deprivation tends to retard and/or disrupt the development of communal bonds . . . The reality at the moment is that a different category of people is adding to the number of people incarcerated in, this country. This government has clearly faced that situation; it has made special provision for partners who are separated and, as I say, leading a very unfortunate existence. One thing that affects my electorate-which has a high ethnic population', including significant numbers of newly arrived residentsis the waiting period for jobsearch. At the moment, newly arrived residents would not only have to suffer the nonnal 26 weeks waiting period, but also have to wait one week more than the rest of the Australian population. In other words, they are subjected to waiting another week before applying for those benefits, thus making the waiting period 27 weeks. One week might not sound like very long but, given the settlement problems of newly arrived residents-in many cases they come out here from a very deprived situation overseas and lack family support in this country-being able to claim those benefits one week earlier would be an advantage. As well as extending a number of be:nefits, the government has also ensured that the degree of double dipping be countered. For instance, those people on age pensions or widows B pensions, or those people who are in receipt of benefits from the new enterprise incentive scheme or Aboriginal, incentive schemes from the Department of Employment, Education and Training, are to be deprived of the ability to double-dip, DEET wm not allow people who currently receive mobility benefits to continue receiving those benefits if they have concurrently received, until now, a training component from DEET. Mobility benefits are aimed at helping people with their mobility problems,. but there will also be restrictions on double dipping. We also see similar provisions with regard to the landcare environment action program. On the one hand, the government is saying that the system, through anomalies and legalisms, has deprived certain groups of people. However, at the same time, the government has moved against situations where other beneficiaries are basically getting double payments. I want to refer briefly to employment entry payments. Once again, there is a liberalisation of measures relating to sole parents. It is interesting to look at the system in the United States. I do not think it is a social security system that Australia would like to emulate. It is very restrictive and widely condemned in this country. The kind of mentality that we see from the opposition was personified today in an article in the Economist about America, which refers to a welfare system which allows claimants, particularly mothers, to languish on the rolls for years untrained and unmotivated. My point is that, no matter how strict the system is in some countries, people are still whingeing. Our government has made a very decisive attempt to ensure, through the Child Support Agency, that people undertake their responsibilities. This government has attempted to encourage people who are in the welfare system into the work force. The opposition, through subliminal messages, attempts to stigmatise single parents and accuses them of being factories for kids so that they can claim more benefits. In contrast, this government seeks to ensure that people will not be adversely affected with regard to their employment entry payments.",103
128,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"Wide Bay) (8.40 p.m.}-Late last week a delegation of providers of emergency relief in my electorate came to see me. These people are at the front line of the problems confronting our nation at the present time, providing emergency relief services when there is no other help available on the Fraser coast to those who need it. These providers of emergency relief came to see me because,· only six weeks into the financial year, they have already exhausted their allocation of federal funding for emergency relief. The emergency relief program provides grants to non-government community welfare agencies for distribution as shortterm emergency assistance to. people in financial crisis. Grants are made to around 1,000 agencies Australia wide. When I made inquiries of the relevant department as to why the cheque provided was so small, I found to my amazement and despair that the federal government has decided to cut funding to emergency relief organisations by one-third this year. In spite of the increase in the number of disadvantaged people in our community-such as the unemployed, those without homes and the children who have no opportunity for a better future-this government has decided to cut expenditure for emergency relief by one-third. I would have thought that at any time there would be an urgent need to recognise the fact that, no matter how extensive our welfare system may be, there are some people who fall through the net. Quite a lot of those people live in areas such as Hervey Bay. Many people have moved to Queensland from the rust-bucket states, hopeful of finding a new career and a new lifestyle in the sunshine. They often arrive in an old car with little more than the clothing they are wearing, virtually no possessions, in the hope that there will be an instant job for them when they arrive. Of course, that is not the case. Sadly, Hervey Bay has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent. It is common for these people to end up at some of the welfare agencies as almost their first port of call. Welfare agencies will now have to say to the hundreds of people who call at their doors, 'Sorry, there's no money. We're not going to get another cheque until next Christmas'. I will trace through the impacts on one particular welfare agency-namely, the social Hervey Bay Neighbourhood Centre. It is perhaps the major provider of emergency assistance in the city of Hervey Bay. In 199192, it received $14,550 under the Commonwealth's emergency relief program. In 199293, the grant was $20,859. Its grant in July 1993 was only $4,341. Hopefully it will receive another cheque a· little later in the year, but that amount of $4,341 falls well short of the $10,520 that it received from this program at the same time last year. The other emergency relief providers-the Seventh Day Adventist Church, St Joseph's and others-all have similar stories to tell. I make an urgent appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, to look again closely at the amount of funds that are to be provided for emergency welfare assistance. I scanned the budget closely last night and found no commitment at all for additional funding. I have only the word of the local departmental officers, who told me that this year Queensland has received only 67 per cent of the grants it received from the Commonwealth last year. Therefore, it is inevitable that these reductions in funding are being passed on to agencies around the country. The need for welfare has not evaporated since last year. Obviously, the need is much greater. The funds must be restored to previous levels, and the need for these funds has to be recognised. I know that the Department of Social Security has emergency programs available as well, but many people are unable to provide identification or meet the requirements to qualify for those particular. grants. In some cases, they may have actually received their entitlement and still be in some kind of crisis situation where they need additional emergency funds. This is a catch-up program, and obviously the small amounts of money that are provided cannot help a lot of people. Most of this money is handed out as $10 for food, $5 for something else and $100 for a rental bond or the like, but it does provide emergency assistance at a vital time. What will these people do if they have no food and they are turned away from St Vincent de Paul or the Hervey Bay Neighbourhood centre? Do they go without food or are they perhaps tempted into crime in order to obtain what they need to survive until the next social security cheque arrives or until there is some other opportunity for them? It is a crisis and I appeal to the government to look closely at this matter. The clear facts are that welfare in Australia has grown enormously over recent years. More than half the Australian population now receives some sort of federal government welfare payment. Recent social security department figures show that 9,051,726 Australians benefited from the welfare system in December last year. At .the same time, the number of people engaged .in full-time or part-time work in Australia totalled only 7,750,000. Almost 2.4 million Australians received pensions, including over 1'/2 million on the age pension, and at least 5.6 million people received supplementary funding to help with living expenses. Almost two million families received family allowances, benefiting some 3.7 million children. Last night's budget includes an allocation of $41 billion for social security payments-that is 85 per cent of the total personal income tax receipts and half of the government's total budgeted income for the year. Clearly, that kind of program is unsustainable in the long term. The growth has been extraordinary. Some comparisons between 1970 and 1993 show that the number of people receiving unemployment benefits has increased from 13,000 in 1970 to over 900,000 in 1993. The number of people receiving invalid pensions or sickness benefits has increased from 140,000 to 560,000. The number on the age pension has increased from 780,000 to 1.5 million. The number of supporting parents has increased from 26,000 to almost 300,000. That growth is certainly extensive. But some other recent Bureau of Statistics figures show that the number of' Australians who are aged 65 years and over has risen by 84 per cent in that same period. The average age of Australians as at 30 June 1992 was 32.7 years, an increase of 1.6 years since 1986. The number of people aged 80 years and over has increased by 114 per cent since 1971, but the number of children' under the age of 15 has increased by only two per cent. Recently, I was in China where the government has introduced aiule that families can have only one child. One of the impacts of that decision will be a - risis in aged care in China in the years ahead. There will,be feweJ; children to care for a large ageing population. But that is also the case in Australia. families get smaller, our population ages, so there will be increasing demands on the social security system. That is why it important that our system should encourage people to put aside for their own retirement and why it should encourage Australians to save so that they are able to take care own needs whenever a problem arises in the short term. Sadly, our system rewards the spenders and penalises the people. who are frugal. The reward for a careful lifestyle, in doing in order to care for our families and put aside a little, is ineligibility for the pension. do without through life to fund our own retirement there will be no taxpayer funded pensions, no health benefits, no pensioner discounts, no rates subsidies and no free travel-plus we will pay more tax than treatment. pensioners on the same income. Self-funded retirees are indeed a disadvantaged group. As the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) said,. people are encouraged to be dependent upon the welfare system. We should be rewarding those who save for own retirement. The government pays lipcould service to wanting everybody to have superget annuation, but it has so taxed superannuation that it has ceased to be a good investment many Australians. They are better off putting their money somewhere other than into superget annuation. As is typical of a Labor government,as soon as this government sees something ised. collecting a bit of money and doing job, it taxes that harshly. In almost every budget it has moved to make those who put aside for their own retirement less rewarded for their effort. That is why the government's proposals to include unrealised capital gain shares in the income test are day it turns around and tells all the pensioners that it is going to deem their investments so that they can maximise the amount of income that they earn to reduce their dependency on the social security system. Mr Sciacca-And it worked.",105
129,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"As the Parliamentary Secredegree tary to the Minister for Social Security said, in many cases it has resulted in boosted As our incomes for pensioners. If that is the and government's objective, why does it then tum around and penalise pensioners who try to get is so the maximum return on their investments through shares? That is one of the ways in which pensioners can maximise the return on their investment and reduce their dependency of their on the social security system .. We keep hearing this nonsense about how it is necessary to so unfairly treat shares on the basis of justice and equity. Where is the justice and equity in treating shares in this without manner? Shares are counted twice-in the assets test and the income test. Other investIf we ments and other assets are not treated that way. The capital gain on a boat, artworks, racehorses, a stamp collection or French clocks is not included in the income test.· Only shares are picked out for this iniquitous What about those who own property? The increase in the value of the asset is included in the assets test, as it should be, but it is not included in the income test. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Reid (Mr their Ferguson) making comments that people have $100,000 worth of shares and still the pension. I do not know whether there are any of those-I have grave doubts about for it-but a person could have a $2 million house .on the North Shore of Sydney and still the pension. It seems that $2 million houses do not matter but a person who owns $10,000 worth of shares is gomg to be penalI think that is a grossly unfair way to a good treat pensioners' assets. As the honourable member for Stirling so rightly said, people cannot live on unrealised income. Unrealised income does not exist. It is not there when it comes to paying the rent, on buying the food and meeting the other necesso unfair. One sities of life. Recently I heard the parliamentary secretary on Brisbane radio desperately trying to sell this concept to the listeners-not with great success. I do not think he convinced too many people that he was on a winner. I have to say that, like the member for Stirling, I feel··a of sympathy for the parliainentary has secretary. He has been deserted by his minister on this issue and now, increasingly, he is being deserted by members of his own backbench, who are obviously starting to feel the inhumanity of this issue. He wrote me a very well-worded letter. The parliamentary secretary does write excellent letters to constituents in response to issues that we raise. In this case, though, the letter was so full of holes, inaccurate statements and misconceptions that I forced myself to reply to him, line by line, rebutting every argument that he had put forward. I am still waiting for a response to it. I presume that in the months that have gone by he has actually surrendered and has acknowledged the error and futility of the argument that he is putting forward. There are countless examples of people who have been grievously hurt by these arrangements. I would like to tell a story of a lady I know well in my own electorate who is over 80 years of age. She has inherited a parcvl of Coles Myer shares. These shares are of great sentimental value to the family. Her grandfather owned a small business which was purchased by a larger company that was eventually swallowed up in the Coles Myer empire. These shares have been passed down through the generations and are now held by this lady as a family heirloom. It has been her objective to pass those shares on to her children and grandchildren so that they can remain in the family as a recognition of the contribution that her grandfather had made to the business community of the city. That lady will no longer have that option. Either she has to live without a pension or she has to sell the shares. It is sonable to be asking 80-year-old ladies to make those sorts of decisions. Another 70-year-old lady came to see me about her 97-year-old mother, who lives in a nursing home and is also confronting this decision because she needs the regular income from her shares to pay the nursing home fees and to meet her commitments. She is also being forced into a position of having to make a decision. Fortunately, this 70-year-old lady has a power of attorney for her 97-yearold mother. In many cases, those things do not exist and so there is no-one around who is able to make the decisions. There are these sorts of examples right across the board. There are other people who, instead of spending their life earnings on trips around the world, $2 million houses on the North Shore or other investments that are exempt from these arrangements being introduced in by the social security department, have decided to invest in Australia, to back their country, to put some money into projects that they thought were worthwhile to help make this country a better place in which to live. Their reward for all that trouble is to· have their pension cut because there may be some capital gain on their shares. Let us look at the way in which this has been administered. It is grotesquely unfair. The government has set a predetermined date on which all these shares would be valued. It is very convenient that on that particular day the share market was at an historic low. So the government was on a certain winner. Even shares that were purchased at much higher prices in years gone by and are still not worth as much as the purchase price will be assessed as having earned a capital gain, through a highly distorted formula, that ensures the actual penalty on the pension is much greater than the earnings and the capital gain increase on the shares. Again, this is devised by bureaucrats to benefit the government and to ensure that the bureaucracy continues to grow. I was interested to note that the cost of running the Public Service in the current federal budget is up by 16 per cent. I understand that it has grown by about six per cent unreaper annum in the life of the Labor government. Despite the alleged cuts that we hear so much about in government expenditure, it seems that we still need more bureaucrats to run these reduced programs. We still have to build bigger buildings with more grandiose office space and pay hundreds of millions of dollars in rent to run the programs as the government allegedly cuts its expenditure. In reality, many more pe<;>ple will have to be involved in a most meticulous exercise to calculate all of these share gains and losses on a regular basis. Another important point to mention is that, when the share values go down, the government's liability for pensions will increase. Share values will almost certainly go down at a time when government revenue from taxes and other measures will also be at its lowest point. What an extraordinary risk management venture we have here. The government increases its pension liability at times when its own income is low. Surely it would be more sensible to encourage people to' invest their income in a wise and prudent way so that they are able to carry themselves through tough times and not become dependent on the government and the taxpayers at times when the 'national income is reduced. The measures in this bill are largelyuncontroversial and will not be opposed. The coalition's amendment offers an opportunity to make real progress in the area of social security legislation. It offers an opportunity to right many of the wrongs, to correct the broken promises that are so much a part of the Labor platform at present and to get Australia's social security system back to what the government promised, but in a way that treats ordinary Australians fairly, rewards those who put aside for their own retirement and gives all Australians a fair go now and for the future.",107
130,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"I suppose the kindest thing one can say to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) is, 'Clarrie Millar, come back.' All is forgiven'. It is a trite observation perhaps to say that those who fail to learn from the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. If the honourable gentleman looks at the history of the social security system in this country he might discover that under a previous government run by a fellow called,' I think, Sir Robert Menzies, there was in fact a surcharge, a social security tax, levied upon the Australian population. I think it was 1.7 per cent. There was a sinking fund into which those funds were placed and invested so that future Australians would have the benefit of pensions and benefits from the moneys raised by the social 'security levy. But the Liberal Party in its infinite wisdom, as it is prone to demonstrate in this place from time to time, some time ago decided that it did not want to do this so it pulled £94 million from this sinking fund and put it into consolidated revenue. The honourable member for Wide Bay bleats today about the system. The system we have is a direct result of his party's incompetence, its total incompetence in removing a social security levy and putting the moneys of the sinking fund back into consolidated revenue- From that day onwards this country has had to pay for all benefits from current year income. Does the honourable member really understand what that means? It means that no-one can guarantee on a daily basis the income available from pensions and benefits because no-one pays a particular allocation of funding to the sinking fund. That is the legacy of the Liberal and National parties of this country. They never learn from history. Let me say to this House quite clearly that I have concerns about bringing into income a capitalised amount on shares. I have very grave concerns about that. My concerns though are broader than jqst that single issue. This House is running away from the major issue. We on both sides of this House are not tackling the major problem this country faces. We all know, those of us who are literate and who read-I know there are many on the other side' who may be literate but never read'---that this country has a demographic problem of quite major proportions. All of us in this parliament know that in the next 20 to 25 years the number of aged will double. We all know that. We all know that, based on current year income, we will not be able to provide the aged in the future with the same benefits people are now enjoying. We all know that. The honourable member fc,>r Berowra (Mr Ruddock) knows that. We sit here and have this mickey mouse debate-and it is a mickey mouse debatebecause we are, not asking ourselves the real question: how is this parliament going to handle, long term, the problems we will face as 'a country in making benefits payable to people when there will be half the number of people paying income tax on a current year basis and twice the number of people wanting benefits? 'That is the question this House is not debating. The honourable member for Berowra sent out through fax to the members of the coalition a missive which stated that they should, in answer to questions about this particular issue they are so concerned about tonight, tell constituents who wrote to members of the Liberal and National parties: 'If we win government, we will review it. We will not change it'. That is what the honourable member for Berowra sent to all the members of the National Party and the Liberal Party. was faxed out to them. Mr Ruddock-When, did I send that out?",109
131,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,I have a copy on Fran Bailey's machine. The marvellous thing about facsimile machines is that wonderful memories can be pulled out of them. I have it. honourable member should not worry about that. I will give him a copy. Mr Ruddock-I would like you to look at the date on it.,110
132,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"The honourable member's advice was: 'Tell the constituents who complained, ""We will review it in government. We will not abandon it. We will not abolish it'''. In this mickey mouse debate tonight there is a .sudden crass concern, for political purposes, when the debate is about bigger issues. How would the opposition handle the long-term problem? How would the honourable member for Wide Bay handle the problem in 20 years time? Would taxes be doubled? We should be quite serious about this matter. We should ask ourselves: are we going to tell the aged that any assets they have must come back into a pool? Is that the question? My concern is that I do not believe the way the government has gone with this legislation is the right way. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, my view that this is the wrong way to go about it. We need to do a better job of handling the whole issue of ownership of the capital assets of the retired and the way we deal with those capital assets as they go into the system. Government assistance will be required. I am a bit more fortunate than most members of this House because I sat on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal for a couple of years between 1990 and 1993. I have had to try to interpret this thing which we call the Social Security Act 1991. It was passed by this parliament. Honourable·members should look at the size of it. When I first sat on the tribunal the act in force was the Social Security Act 1947. It was quite thick. All of us who love plain English legislation should look at this act as it now stands and determine never to enact such legislation again. It is a nightIt mare. Those people in the Department of Social Security who drafted it should hang their heads in shame, run away and never be seen again. No one understands it, even those on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal-and I was a legal member. We have to do something about it. Even worse is the fact that we The have continually cut expenditure to the department. Let me be quite serious. As a member of parliament I know that the advice I get when I write to the Department of Social Security is wrong-and I can prove it is wrong because I· understand the act. Since being re-elected I have written to the department on behalf of constituents and received advice which is contrary to the act. It is a total nonsense, wdtten by people in the department who, perhaps through no fault of their own, cannot interpret this horrible thing called an act of parliament. They are trained to interpret it but they are told· by the department to follow department policy which comes up on a computer screen. Department policy is more effective than law because the people who work for the department apply not the act of the Australian parliament, but department policy. The fact that department policy has no relevance to what this parliament has passed as law seems to escape the Department of Social Security. I have a very big problem with that. I can give an example of a constituent who was being paid a disability support pension. He first got his pension under section 27 of the 1947 act. He got his disability sl,lpport pension and then was paid a lump sum settlement on a common law claim. Under the 1991 act, quite properly, the department applied the preclusion period. It said that 50 per cent of the lump sum was brought to account for the purposes of income and for a particular period he was not to be paid his disability support pension. That is okay. The law says that quite clearly. It is a proper application of section 1134-from memory that is the section. But 10 and behold, after the preclusion period was applied, the department wrote to him and said, 'Department policy says that when you have had a lump sum payment, you then have to reapply for a disability support pension'. He came to see me and .said, 'They have taken my disability support pension away'. My constituent appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal said, 'No, you can't do that', reinstated his disability support pension and, under special circumstances, changed the preclusion period. So he got back his disability support pension. The department then wrote back and said, 'No, you still can't have your disability support pension'. It is worthwhile reading the letter. This really worries me. This parliament will have to tackle this matter. We will have to start educating people ill the department, who are being paid to work for people, not to take benefits from people, and who write to members of parliament and do not tell them the truth. That is what really worries me--':'that they wrote to me and told me a whole lot of crap.",110
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Jenkins)Order!,111
134,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"I withdraw that, although it does not apply to a member of parliament. The department wrote back and said that department policy is such that when a person receives a compensation payment he or she must reapply for a disability support pension. As a member of parliament, I wrote back to someone in the department - I did not tell them that I sat on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or that I knew anything about the act-and said, 'I am a bit concerned about this. Is this really the case?'. The person wrote me a most atrocious letter. If I had not been a lawyer or a former member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, as a member of parliament I would have accepted it. I would have believed that the department had told me, a member of parliament, the truth and the legal position; but it did not. I wrote back a letter setting out the law and said that, as a former member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the department was wrong. That person went on leave and all kerfuffle broke out. It was quite a disaster for the department. It then phoned me and said, 'We are going to reinstate the disability support pension'. I wonder how many members of parliament in this House write to the Department of Social Security and get the same sort of rubbish sent back to them. That is what worries me about our system. In a sense, I do not blame the department, because the people who are being asked to handle these problems are not trained. We are not putting them through courses to understand this monster, this nightmare, of legislation which was supposed to make things simple for people. Frankly, we should start again and draft a decent piece of legislation and go back to old legal language which we would at least all understand. We have all these poor middle clerks in the department who are told, 'Plug in your computer and your computer will give you the answer to this problem'. I can tell the House that I do not want it. The way people are being treated through the system is wrong. I hope the advisers sitting here go back knowing that one member of parliament will not take the rubbish he is being told by the department. I will write back every time and give it a six-page legal opinion on why it is wrong, if that is what it will take, so that my constituents get proper service from the department. As I said when I started my speech, I am astonished and ashamed at the rubbish that those opposite are going on with. If they want to get serious about the problems of social security, let us all sit down together and understand that in 20 years time this country will have a major problem in social security. Instead of knocking systems which I believe are piecemeal-that is why I am angry and disagree with it; I do not think the piecemeal approach we are taking as a· government will work-we should sit back and have a better look at what we are talking about in capital assets owned by the aged, how we will treat capital assets as they come into the nursing homes and how we will take those assets to help provide assistance as they go through the ageing process. 1. do not think their kids should get it. It makes me pretty angry to think that it is costing us an absolute fortune to run nursing homes when all the old folk I know want to tuck it away in a fund somewhere so their kids get it. My kids are pretty clear on this: I have told them that they are not allowed to spend it. Mr Bradford-You want to take it off them.",111
135,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"Those assets should be spent for their own benefit. The rest of the Australian public should not fund those who can fund their own retirement. That is what it is all about. That is where I stand, and I am not ashamed .of it. If honourable members opposite want ordinary working class people to pay increased taxes to fund the retired who hold assets to give to their children, that is their problem, not mine; I will not wear that. And I think you people will have to get your act together. Your other problem is Fightback. How dare any of you come into this place and talk about social security. Have any of you read your documents and what you said in Fightback!? How can any of you come in here and criticise us? Mr Ruddock-Easily.",112
136,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"Really-$6 billion in cuts and $2 billion out of social security. country would not have a social security system if you were sitting on the treasury bench. Those who live in Victoria are familiar with Liberal Party policy! Whoopee! We have blokes called Jeff Kennett and Stockdale down there. Come to Victoria and see burnt earth. Come down and talk to the ordinary people in Victoria about Liberal Party philosophies. I tell you what, it is a ripper. Come and talk to ordinary families-in my electorate about 20 schools are going to be closed. Preschools are doubling their fees. Country hospitals will probably close. Come and talk to us about Fightback as it is being implemented by Jeffrey Kennett. Do not come into this place and talk rubbish. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Come and sit and talk with people like me who are serious about a long-term approach to the problem of the aged because one day you might happen to make a mistake and win government. It is on the cards; one day it might happen-you might actually make a mistake and say nothing and win an election. If that happens, you will have to not talk rubbish but make a decision on what you are going to do with the aged. You might happen to be in government at the time when we face this awful problem of having double the number of aged and half the number of workers to pay for them out of the current yearly income. Have you ever thought you, might be· ingovemment during that period? Have you ever really thought how you will handle it if you are in. government at that time? Will you then say to the aged, 'You can own assets and pass them on to your children while other people try to care for you.'? If I can send any message to my own party and to the opposition, it is this: is it not time that we all had a really good think about where we are going? It really is time that this parliament took the bit between its teeth and asked the difficult question-and it is an awfully difficult one-where are we going with the aged? Stop this superfluous nonsense we have gone on with tonight because that will not solve the problem. That is just playing politics for the sake of crassness. We should really come together with a policy we This can both run with because we know the problem exists. If I learned one thing when lwas out there for three years among the ordinary people of this country-the ordinary wage earners; the people who vote for us-it is that they want those answers. They really want this parliament to answer those questions. They do not want the government to go piecemeal and say, 'On this particular occasion we are going to deem shares to be income through some strange capital approach'. I think that is nonsense. People want to see the broader issue raised. They want the big question asked, because they are getting 'older. They will get old like me and they will want nursing homes; they will want aged care. They know, I think better than we do, that this government cannot afford to pay. So why do you not come across so we can all talk about it and come up with a· reasonable solution? While we are doing that, can we all try to get the Department of Social Security to educate its staff on what the act parliament says, not what the department would like it to say? We could also tell members of parliament-so they know when they write letters-what the act of parliament says, not what they would like it to say. Our review officers should be educated; they should not be second-base clerks. They should be paid a decent salary so that we get decent people working for the department. Then we might get a system which works better, we will not get told rubbish, and, more importantly, our constituents will get what they are entitled to under the law. I thank the House.",112
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Before I call the next speaker, I remind the honourable member for MCEwen that the fonns of the House require that he address his remarks through the chair. He should be careful when referring to honourable members and should not use the word ·you'.",113
138,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (9.20 p.m.)-Firstly, I thank honourable members on both sides of the House for their contributions. I am sure that all those who have spoken tonight-certainly those on this side of the House-believe to some degree that there could well be some problems with respect to the share legislation. Whilst this debate has turned on that point-I will talk about it later-I simply say that the government obviously does not accept the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). The honourable member for Berowra mentioned the child disability allowance being able to be backdated for only 12 months. I take his point. There is not a lot of room for discretion in the Social Security Act. It depends a lot on individual circumstances. The problem is that it is such a large act and so much money is administered. The question of discretion is something which has to be very seriously considered before one writes that sort of thing into the act. I know that there will always be the odd case that is an anomaly and which falls through the net. Certainly it is something that we will continue of to look at. I thank the honourable member for Berowra for that observation. The honourable member also talked about a number of government promises. He has been on about it in his nonnal theatrical way. I have read all his press releases. He has talked about the promises that we have not kept. One promise concerns income tax not being paid by pensioners or partpensioners by 1995. The Minister for Social security (Mr Baldwin) answered that concern here yesterday, so I will not say anything with respect to that. Other matters that the honourable member for Berowra raises in his amendment are the seniors health card, the dental health program and the delays in the implementation of those programs. All I can say is that they are being implemented and that we have start-up dates. Frankly, it is a lot more than this country would have got had those opposite won the election in March this year. The honourable member for Berowra says that he will hound the government on the issue of shares. I direct my remarks in this debate mainly to the share issue because members of the opposition in particular have made it the focus of this debate. Frankly, I am concerned that, in their quest to try to make some political capital out of this issue, they have created a lot of scar.emongering in the community. They have allowed our elderly people to think that certain things will happen to them that in many cases may ""not. What really concerns me is that in December 1992, when this legislation was passed in this House, it was fully supported by the opposition. Since the election, opposition members have turned around and said, 'We only said that we would accept it because it was part of other measures'. They say, 'We were going to review it had we won government'. As one honourable member on this side of the House said, they did not say that they would abandon it; they said they would review it. I cannot understand for the life of me-this has also been said by one of our members who has spoken in this debatehow the opposition could possibly have cut one billion dollars of welfare spending pff the social security budget and not done exactly the sort of thing that we are doing with this shares issue, and that is trying to target the dollar the best way that we can. The honourable member for Berowra said that, according to evidence that has gone before. the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, pensioners will stop investing in shares and managed investments. He talke<i,about how much that would hurt the total stock market. I say this to the ourable member for Berowra: there has been a deemed ride of interest on managed investments since 1988. They were changed in March 1993. They will now be treated in the same way as shares will be treated from 23 September. It has not stopped 128,000 pensioners, since 1988, from going into managed investments. This measure with respect to the treatment of shares was announced last year. It was flagged and passed at the time of the budget last, year-a time when obviously no-one would have known how the stock market would go. We all know what the stock market is like; it goes up and down. No-one can ever positively say that they know how the stock market is going to go. We. explained that this was what we were going to do. Since then, since all this publicity which has been generated by the opposition for purely hypocritical, political reasons, people, including pensioners, have still been flocking into the stock exchange in their hordes. I simply say this: pensioners can continue to invest in the share market if they want to. The government is saying to pensioners, 'If you have shares, buy them and keep them by all means. But keep them on the basis of their intrinsic value as an investmen-, not because some friendly financial planner tells you to get into shares to hide the income as a capital gain; it will not be income if they go up and you will be able to access more of the pension'. If pensioners invest in the share market, they should do so on the intrinsic value of shares as an investment. If the investment is good, it is a win-win situation. It is a win-win situation for pensioners because whether or not they lose any pension as a result of it-or any part of it-it could well be that they will still be better off. In that case pensioners are better off. It is a win for pensioners, and the taxpayer of Australia is better off. So it is' a win-win situation. This is exactly the sort of measure that we thought of and brought in some time ago with the deeming proposals. I was the parliamentary secretary during the time that the deeming proposals were introduced and, if I rehon- member correctly, even the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and a number of others went berserk about it-it was going to do all sorts of things. Mr Truss-I was not here.",113
139,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"I am sorry. If it was not you, there were certainly plenty of members of the opposition who said that it was a bad move. The ones who lost out of that were the banks. The pensioner won. The Australian taxpayer won. And this is one of those measures. It is a measure where we are targeting the welfare dollar in such a way that we make sure that it goes to those in need. As the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) said in one of the better parts of his contribution, we have a dwindling tax base and an ageing population. Whether we like it or not, we have to target the scarce resources that we have available to ensure that that dollar goes to those who need it. No government likes to have the political flak that it gets when it takes some sort of entitlement from a person, whether it be a pensioner or a non-pensioner. The fact is that we have a responsibility to ensure that we do the best we can with the money that we have available. A lot has been said about the fact that we are treating unrealised capital gain as income. If the government turned around and treated unrealised capital gain as income for the purposes of the taxation system, then I can understand that there would be a lot of objections-and rightly so. The fact is that we are talking about the social security system. I will talk about the generous income and assets test in a moment, but we are saying to people, 'If you are able to access your own resources without having to come to the government, then do so', because at the end of the day the government-particularly this government-has, over a period of some years, given enormous incentives to people to save for their retirement. In the 1990-91 financial year, the government gave some $3.6 billion by way of tax concessions to superannuation funds and the like. What is the point of encouraging people to invest for their retirement if, when they do retire, they do not access the money that the taxpayer of Australia, in the case of superannuation, has enabled them to save for that retirement? There are no magic wands. As a country that has a dwindling tax base and an ageing population, we cannot allow people to amass, in some cases, fairly significant amounts of money and still, after the Australian taxpayer has in effect assisted them in many cases, expect them or want them to come back to the well again, because the well will eventually dry if that is the case. The honourable member for Berowra talked about an ABC program dealing with people having to divest their assets. It is a pity that the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) is not here because I told him I would repeat this. The honourable member for Berowra .said that I was encouraging people to divest themselves of their assets-in other words, get rid' of that little nest egg that they have. I am not talking about getting rid of nest eggs. The income· tests and the assets tests in this country are very generous. We have asocial security system which is one of the best systems in the world and which compares very favourably with the rest of the world. This country is one of the few countries in the world that have a non-contributory scheme. In. some European countries people pay tax and pay a contribution towards their retirement.. ·That money is put aside. We have a number of social security reciprocal agreements, as the,honourable member for Berowra would know, from which we in this country get a lot of advantage. In Australia we pay our pensions from consolidated revenue. That means that we must look at our consolidated revenue and determine what we can payout, how we can pay it out and who should get it. Shares which are readily realisable on the market can be sold on a day-today basis and are the same as cash. In fact, one can virtually get the money for th- sale of a share in about the same time that one can clear a cheque. Mr Truss-No, you cannot.",114
140,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"Yes, you can. It takes roughly seven days. Sometimes it takes five or six days to clear a cheque. We are saying that if people have substantial assets over and above the amount they are entitled to have and still draw the pension it is only reasonable that the Australian taxpaying public should expect those assets be looked at first before they come to the well. The assets test limits are very generous. I want to read these figures into the record because it is very important to make sure that people realise that they are very generous. A full pensioner as a single home owner can have $112,750 worth of assets on top of the home. A single non-home owner can have $193,250 worth of assets. As from 20 September, a single home owner can still have assets amounting to $220,000 on top of the home and still receive some part of the pension. As a non-home owner, a person can have assets up to $300,500 as from 20 September and still receive some part of the pension. Married home owners can still reCeive the full pension if they have their own home plus $160,500 worth of assets. A non-home owner can have assets totalling $241,000 and still receive the full pension. On 20 September, married home owners can have their home plus assets up to $338,500 and still receive some part of the pension, and a non-home owner can have up to $419,000 in assets and still receive some part of the pension. On income limits, a single person can be receiving $19,000 in income before he or she loses entitlement to the total pension. Married home owners or non-home owners can be earning an income of $31,647.20 before they lose any part of the pension. That means that, because of what this government has done as from 1 April 1993, if a person receives even $1 worth of pension, that person is entitled to full fringe benefits. It has cost this government approximately $80 million to extend Commonwealth fringe benefits and some $120 million to make arrangements with the states. People do not have to get into their nest eggs. With those income limits, a married pensioner couple can be receiving up to $608.60 per week before they lose their entitlement to a pension. But before they lose entitlement to any pension they can be receiving almost $4,000 a year, which is the equivalent of having $100,000 in cash in a bank account giving a deemed rate of interest of four per cent. I am not saying for one moment that they have to lose that. A lot of the newspapers around the place have sucked up to the opposition and their emotive types of arguments and have reported me as saying, 'Get rid of your nest egg'. I am not saying that at all. I am saying, 'If you are a full pensioner with $100,000 in the bank and your own home, and if you want to have assets over and above that and still receive the full pension, then no, I do not think that the Australian taxpayer really expects any government to allow that to happen'. The honourable member for Berowra(Mr Ruddock), during his contribution to this debate, said that people will divest themselves of their shares and set up property trusts and private companies to get around the legislation. That is the very reason why we are bringing in this measure. Unfortunately, there are many pensioners with substantial shareholdings-they will be the ones severely affected in the sense that they will lose some part of their pension-who are investing in the stock market in order to circumvent the income test. Mr Ruddock-Your department says that you can expect to pay income tax on share values of $2,000.",115
141,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"Even if the honourable member for Berowra is correct, and people turn around and sell their shares-I do not believe that they will because they are notMr Ruddock-No, that is what is in your document. That is what it says.",116
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The parliamentary secretary should direct his remarks through the chair.,116
143,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"The honourable member for Berowra gets very excited about these things and he gets very theatrical about everything he says. I am making the point that if they do that and get around the provisions by having private trusts and all the rest of it, then we will look at the matter again because that is exactly what we are trying to prevent. In a way, the honourable member for Berowra hanged himself with his .own words because he said that those who are rorting the system now by investing in shares are going to do it anyway. That is what he was saying. I am telling the honourable member for Berowra that that will not happen. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) carried on as he nonnally does with respect to this issue. I want to point out to him the generous nature of the income test. I am sure he has constituents with homes, and they deserve them. I am not saying for one moment that they do not deserve them. They are entitled to have a home. They are entitled to have substantial assets and still draw some part of a pension. However, there are many people in the community earning less than $31,000-probably more than 50 per cent of the population-and they do not receive any fringe benefits. They do not get any assistance from the government, yet they are bringing up children and looking after the payment of mortgages. I believe we have a responsibility to those people, as much as we have to our older citizens, to ensure that we spend only the' moneys that are needed and properly targeted to ensure that the tax dollar is proper. ly distributed. Time might beat me but there are a number of other matters to which I wish to respond. There were questions asked by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Liebennan). I have the answers available for him but I will give them to him after this speech. The point of the whole exercise is this: we are continually told that we are trying to stop pensioners from investing in this country and investing in shares. As I said, the reality is that when this measure was first brought in there were still people investing in shares and since then even more people have done so. The total shareholding by way of capital value held by pensioners in this countrY amounts to'something like 0.3 of one per cent of the total market capitalisation. That means that even if the catastrophic results that the honourable member for Berowra and the opposition. have predicted do happen and all these pensioners went out and sold their shares, it would not cause' one blimp on the stock market. I am advising pensioners to look at their shareholdings. If they want them as investments for the purpose of having an investment, they should keep them. If they are doing it because they simply want to get some more pension, then on 23 September they will be caught by these provisions. I think the provisions are fair and reasonable. I only wish that members of the opposition would stop their scaremongering-I know it is good political stuff-and accept them.

Investments to which Subdivision applies In Committee 3E. Section 1074A of the Principal Act is amended by omitting subsection (2)."". The purpose of these amendments is to repeal those sections of the Social Security Act that treat the capital gains that occur or arise in relation to shares owned by pensioners as income for the purposes of the income test. These amendments have been moved to give honourable members the opportunity to vote on this matter in a timely fashion. The provisions will commence on 20 September 1993, which is only a month or so away. If we are to relieve the anxiety of those people who are affected by these provisions, we really need to amend the legislation now. This matter has exercised the minds of numbers of honourable members opposite. In the preceding debate, it was quite interesting to hear the comments of honourable members, because it has confirmed what we have read in the press about some of the discussions that were obviously taking place in the government's caucus. It is clear that numbers of honourable members opposite now realise that these provisions are grossly unfair in their application and will wreak a great deal of hardship on a large number of the most substituting vulnerable people in our society. It was interesting tonight to hear the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) say that he saw the deeming of the capital gain on shares as a nonsense. It was particularly interesting to hear the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). I imagine that she would be an example to many of her colleagues because of the way in which it is alleged that she has campaigned and become aware of the concerns of those people whom she represents. In the second reading debate, for those honourable members who did not have the opportunity to headt, the honourable member for Lowe made some very telling points about some people in nursing, homes getting a pension that enables the fees that they have to meet to be covered. They have small parcels of shares providing an additional income which enables them to supplement those fees and to cover some of the other costs that people in nursing homes often face. She put the plea very properly that the governmentMr Bevis-And more effectively too.",118
145,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"She may well have done it more effectively than me. I would be the first to be a gentleman and agree on that. She put the plea that the government might look at exempting shares at an asset value up to $30,000. I point out that in a submission from the Department of Social Security to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs there is a table which might help the honourable member for Lowe and the government when considering this matter. The table shows that shares valued up to $2,000 owned by 16,240 people' are affected by this proposal; with shar- valued up to $5,000, another 13,582 penSIOners are affected; up to $10,000 there are 11,957 people affected; up to $20,000 there are another 13,027 people affected; and up to $50,000 there are another 14,387 people affected. The $30,000 share value fits somewhere in between. If we look at the total savings that are made up to $50,000, We see that $35 million is involved in the government's statement as to what it thinks would be the full year savings. If we were to accept what the honourable member for Lowe put as a compromise, the impact would be to wipe out half the expected savings. When we put that together with the costs which the government admits are involved in actually implementing these arrangements, we have to ask ourselves wh-ther, even on the government's figures, whlch I 110 not accept, there is any purpose at all in making this particular change. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), because he wanted to make It political point, said that we were concerned about protecting pensioners who have shares of an asset value of $100,000 and more. Therefore, we were protecting people who were intrinsically wealthy. That was our purpose. Yet this table tells us that only 1,497 pensioners with shares valued at over $100,000 are affected. If one knocks out those with shares valued at $100,000 or more, the full year savings are $5 million. One can see from the government's own tables that the sorts of people we are told would be knocked out by this proposal are not to be found. I found it rather extraordinary tonight to be lectured about equity in relation to these matters by people who have just supported proposals to bring in new initiatives in the child-care area which have no income or assets testing provisions attached to them at all. In other words, what we are being asked to do is to make a judgment which extends the basis upon which the income test applies to include notional capital gains that could be lost in. time-:-notional capital gains that may be capltal gams upon assets that have already lost a substantial value. We are dealing with that, which has a very marginal saving for the government in budgetary terms. At the same time this government is about to bring in legislation as part of a budget to provide access to benefits in the form of subsidies for child care where there is no income testing and no assets testing. If I were to use the word 'hypocrite' in relation to that matter and to suggest that it to be applied to any honourable member opposite, I would be called to order. So I will not do that. Arrangements of that sort are frowned upon in other places, because they say something about the people who implement such proposals. I want to make it very clear that I have not been scaremongering in relation to this issue. This bundle of papers is here not because I am used to carrying files around the place but because I have been inundated with letters from people who are concerned. If I had not raised .this matter, as the shadow minister for social security, I would have been the one pilloried. I have been to meetings with people, I have talked to them, and they are concerned because of the impact that these proposals will have upon them. Mrs Easson interjecting",119
146,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"It would make a great splash in the parliament if the honourable member for Lowe were to cross the floor on her first substantive vote. I urge her to consider her position in relation to that matter. The Labor Party would not have the guts to expel or discipline her. I can remember some people from the Left who once refused to vote, and the party did not discipline them. The code of behaviour in the Labor Party is changing. It is picking up a lot of philosophies from this side. I think it wants to adopt a newer and freer approach to votes on important questions such as this. I encourage a few of the honourable members on the other side of the House to consider their position on this matter, because this is a unique opportunity to support this amendment. (TIme expired)",119
147,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," I noted that the honourable member's proposed amendments make it clear that no entitlements to increased benefits arising from his amendments shall be payable or be deemed to be payable unless the parliament has passed a law to appropriate revenue specifically for that purpose. As I see it, the proposed amendments technically do not infringe the financial initiative of the Crown, although the approach used to achieve this is somewhat artificial and frankly one about which I have some reservations. However, in the present circumstances I am prepared to allow the amendments.",120
148,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (10.02 p.m.)-When one looks aroundto see what has happened over the last couple of days in this House and notices how unbelievably poor the opposition has been, it is obvious that it will play some politics with social security bills. The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has made it clear that every time we bring in a social security bill, the opposition will simply tum around and frustrate it. The opposition is doing this today. It does not have any thoughts whatsoever for those people whom, it says, will be affected by this measure. Something like five per cent of people who hold shares are pensioners. Of those the honourable member for Berowra has made it very clear-and I take it that he is looking at the same table that I am-that a great majority do not have substantial shareholdings. If he looks at the table he will see that it covers those who will be affected in any meaningful way by a loss of pension-remember, if they are keeping the shares for the intrinsic merit of the shares as an investment they may well be better off anyway. If pensioners own between $10,000 and $20,000 worth of shares they would lose an average of $14.70 a week. The actual loss in the penslon if they hold shares worth between $20,000 and $50,000 would be approximately $34.40 per week on average; if they hold shares .worth from $50,000 to $100,000, of which there are approximately such 5,881 pe-ioners, the loss would be $68.50 per. week on average; and for those 1,479 pensioners who have shareholdings of over $100,000Mr Lee-How much?",120
149,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"Over $100,000, and some of those pensioners are receiving the full pension. They would lose approximately $77.60. I make the same point that I made during the debate and that is that we are in government. We have a responsibility to target the social security dollar in the best way that we can. I know that the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) is sincere in what she thinks. But I tell her to go back to her constituents and say to them what all my colleagues should be saying: this measure will come into effect on 23 September 1993. If those opposite· had any decency they would be saying the same thing. This means that that relatively small number of 2.1 million pensioners, plus some 400,000 or 500,000 DVA pensioners, still have time to look at their portfolio of investments. At the most, only 100,000 of those pensioners will be affected in any way, some either obliquely or in no way at all. They can go to the financial again information service of the social security department or to· their friendly financial adviser and say, 'Look, is there some way that I can sell some of these or put them into something else?'. The final point I want to make is: why should the Department of Social Security treat a person who has $100,000 worth of cash money in a bank, where under the income test one can see what the amount of income is, any differently from someone who has $100,000 worth of shares of a blue chip type, where as it goes up it gets hidden? It is a question of equity; we have to treat everybody the same. Mr Deputy Chairman, it is about time the opposition stopped playing politics with this issue, stopped scaring and confusing the elderly people in the community-the vast majority of whom will not be affected-and let these measures go through. The government does not accept the, amendments and believes they are highly wrong.",120
150,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"I think we will keep trying because the message might get through to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security sooner or later:""""-and we are prepared to accept later, because it certainly has not been sooner. We are not here to frighten pensioners and our elderly' constituents; we are here because we honestly believe that on this occasion the government has got it absolutely wrong. Earlier tonight, the parliamentary secretary told us that he had not had many letters about this issue. I can rectify that situation: I send him some of the ones I have received. Indeed, earlier in the debate some of us read letters from our constituents about this matter. There is a concern. What have those opposite got against pensioners having shares? That is the question to which they have never given me a satisfactory answer-and I have asked them on many occasions. Our amendment gives those opposite an opportunity to fix the problem that they have created. They are the ones who have caused the angst and concern amongst pensioners; they are the ones who have created the problems, which they compounded in their budget last night with all sorts of additional impositions 'on pensioners. What do they have against these people? Just a moment ago the parliamentary secretary tried to make a point, and it showed how clearly he misunderstands the difference between having $100,000 in the bank and $100,000 in blue chip investments. Let me clarify that point for him because perhaps if he gets that message he will accept our point. There is no problem if people have $100,000 in the bank; they are earning interest on it, and that interest is of course being treated as income-and, by any definition of the word, it is income. By the same token, the dividend from $100,000 invested in blue chip securities is treated as income-and quite correctly so. But there can be no argument whereby the $100,000 in blue chip investment increasing in capital terms can be regarded as income. No definition of income-by accounting standards, economic standards or any other standards I can think of-in any way suggests that something that is on, paper is money. The definition of 'money' is that it is a means of exchange. Again I ask the parliamentary secretary to tell me so that I can tell my constituents what to do. When my constituents get this reduction in income as a result of an increase in the value of their share portfolios, what do they do at the end of the week to pay for the groceries or the electricity bill? The parliamentary secretary's answer to me before was that they could sell some of their shares. Is he prepared to restate that tonight? Why should will pensioners in this country not be allowed to own shares? Why are they the only people in this country who are apparently not allowed to own shares? Why is the government discriminating in this way? Mr Deputy Chairman, we on this side have no argument about the targeting of welfare. In fact, it is fundamental to our policy on social security that welfare is properly targeted. We have no argument about the effect of deeming. The only reservations we have about deeming concern the way that it was implemented. We could go back over that argument again and indicate that in that situation people are alarmed unnecessarily. But we did not have any problem with that, and I do agree that it has worked well. We have no argument about the need for a fair assets test and a fair income test, but share portfolios come within the assets test. This is our objection. We have no problem with share portfolios being treated as part of the assets test, and we have no problem with income from share portfolios being taken into account in detennining whether a pensioner passes the income test. But what· we cannot condone, and what nobody in his or her right mind would condone, is the principle of unrealised-and that is the key word-capital gain being treated as income. Pensioners' shares should not receive that treatment; nothing should. But why only pensioners' shares? Is this a principle that the government espouses? Is it going to change the law as far are concerned so that all capital gains are treated as income? If it were to do that then at least we would have somewhere to go. We could say, - Well. at least you are treating capital gains that way consistently for everybody'. But the government is only going to do that for pensioners. Why is it only going to treat pensioners in that way? Why are pensioners apparently the only group of people in Australia who are not allowed to own shares? The government has not demonstrated that they will not now be forced to go out and sell· their shares. They will not be able to risk hanging onto their shares in these circumstances. Why does the parliamentary secretary not answer the question? What objections does he have to pensioners owning shares? Taking another scenario-I am asking him to change his mind, even at this eleventh hour-why does he not go beyond the treatment of pensioners' share portfolios and take their homes, for instat;tce? He could argue in exactly the same way. Mr Sciacca-Is that what you want to do?",121
151,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"That is certainly not what we want to do, but I am asking the parliamentary secretary whether he is going to do that next. He talked about some of my pensioner constituents who are fortunate enough to have nice homes. Surely his philosophical approach would lead him to say to them, 'Well, you should sell those homes; go and live in a caravan park and live off the proceeds of that sale'. What about their cars? There is a market for cars. Does he object to my pensioner constituents driving nice cars? Does he want them to sell those cars and buy old bombs and invest the proceeds, because in telling them to sell their sharesMr Ruddock-Use leaded petrol-that is what they want.",122
152,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"And pensioners mostly use leaded petrol, so he is hitting them from every direction. Having not been satisfied that this principle is right, let me deal for a moment with the mechanics and see whether the parliamentary secretary can wrap his mind around that. Not only are we concerned about the principle but we are also concerned about as capital gains the mechanics. Earlier today, I referred to some of the investment portfolios that my constituents have. Most of them have blue-chip shares. Most of them have investments on the leading industrial board, mainly because they need to have secure investments. One of my constituents has shares in Pacific Dunlop. He purchased these on 1 October 1991 for $5.12 and on 23 September 1992, which was the operativedate, the market value was $4.71. We can see quite clearly that he has actually lost money on that particular transaction. If we take the value of the shares as at today, they are worth $4.95. Assuming they are worth $4.95 in a couple of weeks time or a month's time, whenever the operative date is, he will still have had a 17c loss per share on his share transaction. Yet by the government's calculation he will have had a 24c gain. How can that be fair? I have another constituent with BTR Nylex shares. He purchased them for $2.99 in February 1991. The market value at the operative starting date was $2.61, so at that particular stage he had lost money. However, the present value ofthose shares is $3.10; that is, as at the last sale yesterday. By the DSS calculation he will have actually gained 49c whereas his real gain is only llc. I could go on. Let us take Westpac shares, because they are a very good example. Exactly the same situation has applied. Plenty of people bought Westpac shares at in excess of $4. The shares went down and at the operative date, 23 September, they were $2.99. Today they were selling for just over $4 again; So people who bought them in 1991 have actually lost money and yet the Department of Social Security will tell them that they have made over $1 on those shares, and that is the calculation by which they will lose their income. Not only is the principle wrong but the mechanics are also wrong. I could go through the formula. I wish the parliamentary secretary would tell us how the formula works because nobody understands it and there is an awful lot of confusion. I challenge the parliamentary secretary to change his mind. (TIme expired)",122
153,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"Wide Bay) (10.17 p.m.)Tonight this parliament has an opportunity to right a wrong, to correct something that happened last year through the might of numbers in this House. We have a chance to put out of the legislative program something that has caused a great deal of stress in the community, something that has the potential to hurt many people and is a completely pointless bureaucratic exercise of no substantial financial benefit to the people of Australia or to the government. The facts are that last year the government introduced this piece of legislation, along with a whole range of other social security amendments, which included a rise for four million pensioners. The coalition parties at the time indicated their opposition to these proposals. We indicated that both by way of amendment and through our expressions of views at the time. But when it came to the bottom line the government said to us, 'Are you going to throw out rises to four million pensioners or are you going to accept this obnoxious piece of legislation?'. So we were put in a position where it was impossible for us to vote against the legislation, particularly in the Senate where we would have had the numbers to achieve that result. So now we have, in a dishonest misrepresentation of the coalition's position, certain people in the government claiming that we actually supported this legislation when it was introduced. That. is a totally false interpretation of what our. position was then and is now. We have always opposed these measures and. we have tried to have them changed on various occasions since their introduction. Now we have another opportunity. . It has been pleasing to note that at least over recent months the message is even getting through to some government members. Some, such as the honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson), have even been brave enough to express those opinions here tonight. But it is no good just having her words float around the chamber and then be lost for all time. It is no good for the honourable member for Lowe to stand up here for one or two minutes and cry some crocodile tears about her government's measure. If she really is sincere about what she is proposingMr Bevis-You voted for it last year.",123
154,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"I never voted for it, and the honourable member for Brisbane knows that that is the case. He can check through the Hansard record and he will find that that statement is false. The honourable member for Lowe has expressed some views, but it is easy to say words. It is easy to go back to the electorate and say, 'I stood up for you, but all of my mates went in the opposite direction'. Now she has a chance to prove to the people of Lowe-where she has such a tiny little majority-that she really is a person of substance and that she believes in what she said. The honourable member for Lowe can vote for this legislation without actually bringing down the government. Of course, she may have some colleagues who are brave enough to support her. Just a few moments ago you, Mr Deputy Chairman, pointed out that further legislation will be required to actually bring this measure about. All this amendment does is express a view. It changes the legislation, but it will require a further piece of legislation to actually appropriate the money. So the honourable member for Lowe and her colleagues who are equally concerned about this piece of legislation can vote with the opposition on this occasion without doing fundamental damage to their government's budget. They have an opportunity to exercise their view and to display to the people of their electorates, to the pensioners who are about to lose pieces of their pension, that they are not just froth and bubble, they are not just spouting empty words, they are not just standing on a soapbox saying something that they do not really believe in; they are actually prepared to stand up for their constituents, as the people on this side of the chamber are prepared to stand up for their constituents. I was very interested in your comments, Mr Deputy Chairman, on the merits of this legislation and its financial implications. I recall the speaker at the time making similar comments when this legislation was going from the House of Representatives to the Senate. He made the observation that the financial implications of this legislation were impossible to determine one way or the other and that they were probably minimal. That is absolutely the truth. The alleged savings that the government is talking about achieving through this particular measure are very doubtful. While there may be some initial alleged savings in the first year because of cuts in pensions to people who otherwise would have had an entitlement, those savings will be offset by the extra administrative costs involved, including the employment of scores of extra people around the countryside-the extra people who have been called upon to give financial advice and those who are needed to administer the new scheme. The biggest offset in the long term will be the fact that most pensioners will go out and sell their shares and invest in areas which return less value for their capital investment. That will increase their rights to the pension entitlement. So more people will qualify for pensions as a result of this measure. The cost to revenue will offset many of the benefits. Of course, the share market does not always go up. In September last year, the date the government picked to implement this measure, the share values were down. In fact, many shares were lower in value than their purchase price. So the increases in share values that have occurred in recent times are somewhat artificial. People will be penalised for increases in share values when in actual fact they are worth less than the purchase price. The next time that share values decline, a whole range of people who still own sharesif there are any-will become eligible for pensions, whereas they were not eligible in the past. In future years, as share values decline, the government will lose whatever amounts it may happen to pick up this year through savings. The actual effect on the budget of these proposed measures will in the long term be can negligible. The number of people who will be affected by this measure seems to be a moving feast. Every time the parliamentary secretary gives us the number of people affected, it seems to change. Way back in September, when the government was trying to introduce this measure, it spoke about 60,000 people being affected. Later on it became 80,000. Then it was 100,000. Who knows what the number will be in the future. The fact is that the number moves around all over the place because the government does not know what it is talking about with this measure. If the government does not know how many pensioners are affected, how can it cost the savings? The reality is that the savings are an illusion. This whole measure has been thought up by bureaucrats more interested in finding more paperwork to do than in actually improving the lot of pensioners. The most important thing, though, is the effect that this has on the individuals who are affected-many aged who have held their share portfolios for long periods. Many of these people have made contributions to our country over decades. They are proud of their country, and even though they have retired they want to do something to help make our country a better place in which to live. They want to put their few dollars into a company that they believe is making a contribution towards Australia. Surely it is better for people to put their money into a company that is prepared to invest in building houses or opening up a new mining development, to be involved in the projects that the government considers to be important-putting their few dollars into the Woolworths float or something of that nature-than . be spending the money on an overseas trip and then being eligible for the pension. Any capital gain on investments in an art collection, in French clocks, in boats or even in a house will not be counted in this income test. I have no. problem with including capital gain in an assets test-that is where it should be-but to include it in an income test is double counting. It is cheating, it is counting those investments twice, and it is treating shares in a way that all other capital investments are not tr-ated. Therefore, this measure is iniquitous and the amendments proposed by the coalition should be supported.",123
155,Mr REID,Unknown,"I was quite intrigued by some earlier comments made in this debate by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). The Newcastle J{erald of Friday, 13 August 1993 had a particularly good editorial in I think it summed up this situation extremely well. I wonder what the honourable member for Newcastle might think of this editorial right in his home electorate. The editorial summed up the situation very accurately. One of the editorial's major comments was that the main concern of the vast majority of pensioner investors was to make their retirement a little more secure. If ever we needed people in Australia to invest in their own retirement it is right now. It is very important that they do such a thing. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for, Social .Security (Mr Sciacca) should acknowledge that fact. The federal government in this country has stated to the community that it wants people to save and invest in Australian companies. What better opportunity has the government than this to ensure that pensioners who have some money to put aside, to look after their retirement and invest for the future, get a small return and then make that gesture. to invest in an Australian company and to provide that capital for the well-being of an Australian company which can embark on expansion plans and provide Australia with an adequate savings base? The parliamentary secretary really has his wires crossed on this issue. He needs to go back and think very seriously about this issue. I have had a tremendous number of representations on this issue. I have alerted my esteemed colleague at the table, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), to these problems and I have written to the minister as well. I have raised the issue with the minister, and the minister as yet has not responded to it. Mr Sciacca-We'll get to it.",125
156,Mr REID,Unknown,"The government might gyt,to it, but the parliamentary secretary should read that correspondence that I have sent to the minister because it points out how important an issue this is to pensioners in this country. They see this as quite unfair and unjust. I think they have every reason to believe that that is the case. They are being prevented from investing in Australian companies for the betterment of this country. I am quite sure that the government does not realise the its paper. serious ramifications of this.

159,Mr DOBIE,Unknown,"I rise tonight to inform the House that two months ago it was my experience to have a corneal transplant, and to pay tribute to all those people who donate their organs for eventual use. I suppose I would be one of the few people in this chamber to in fact have had a transplant-a minor one compared to others, but nonetheless a transplant. I want to pay tremendous tribute to the Sydney Eye Hospital and the dedicated staff there .. I shall not fall into the temptation of discussing the budget in this speech, but I do give warning that during the debate on the budget, because of my recent. experience, I shall be talking very strongly about· what is happening to optometrists and ophthalmologists. What was proven to mr by having this operation was not just the excellence of the service that is operated by Australia and in which Australia leads the world but also how significant eye care is to a vast number of the population, and it is not being considered in other matters before the House at the present time. In the brief time at my disposal-I will not take the whole five minutes-I merely want to say that not enough is discussed in this place about organ transplants. I commend people, particularly the people from New South Wales, to follow through with the arrangement that the state government has made in relation to putting a sticker on licences to show that the licence holder would in fact be an organ donor. It is something we have seen a great deal about. It is a very serius ous matter and I just want to say to the House that, having talked to people who have had transplants, the satisfaction shown by relatives of donors has really shown that this is a great thing and that more people should be donating. I had to wait two years for this corneal transplant through the Sydney Eye Hospital, and it is a great shame that one has to wait quite so long. It means that some young people and some old people are missing out and some people are going blind in the waiting period. So I say thank you to all donors, as one of those who has received a donor transplant, and beg' people in this House to be more involved and more concerned with the whole matter of organ transplants. It is not the business of some cranky or kinky specialists. It is something that is providing a service right across the whole community of Australia and I am very grateful that I was part of it. I pay tribute to all donors. Hiroshima Day",125
160,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"I would like to draw to the attention of the House this evening some particulars about Hiroshima Day, which was on 6 August this year. All honourable members would have received a letter from the mayor of Hiroshima city and, with that letter, a copy of the City of Hiroshima peace declaration which was delivered in Hiroshima on 6 August. A number of people have 'spoken in this parliament over the years about the terrible problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War we have all thought that the threat of nuclear war could be put behind us. But unfortunately since the break-up of elements of the old Soviet Union a number of worrying things have occurred. The current disagreement between the state of Russia and the Ukraine about the dismantling of nuclear weapons-part of the old Soviet missile program-and the number of nuclear weapons which are held by other former Russian republics is very worrying for us all. Hiroshima Day was an important time for all to pause and think about the effect that nuclear war and nuclear accidents could have on the world and the effect that the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima had on the people of that city. Any honourable members who have been to that part of Japan would have seen the very poignant peace memorial, the old observatory, one of the few buildings left in that city after the atom bomb was dropped. Hundreds of thousands of people were injured or killed. It was a very dramatic end to the Second World War. Many would think that that end could have been achieved in ways other than by dropping the atom bomb. As part of the Hiroshima celebrations, that city has built up relations with a number of municipalities around the world. I am proud that the city of Canterbury in my electorate has been involved in the Hiroshima Day celebrations on three occasions in the last 12 years; 1985, 1989 and 1993. The Canterbury Council sent a small delegation to represent its members' and all Australians in those memorial services. Aldermen, on coming back from those services, have told me over the years-and after this recent visit-that a need was brought home to them at those ceremonies to remember not .only the dreadful effect the Hiroshima bomb had but the real worry in the world about the effect of nuclear disadvantages among some of the remaining states of the old Soviet Union. Canterbury Council got involved in that program because it was the first council in Australia to be a nuclear free zone. Many people w6uld say that nuclear free zones were tokenism and did not achieve anything. But they do the same sort of thing that the Hiroshima Day celebrations do. They bring to our minds the terrible effects of nuclear war and the effect that even small things that we do in a country such as Australia can have in being part of that nuclear process. I hope all honourable members have read the peace declaration sent to them by the mayor of Hiroshima, Takashi Hiraoka, that they will consider the matters raised in that and place it in the forefront of their minds when they look at things we do in this parliament.",126
161,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,If the government. had any mandate emanating from the 13 March election it was not to increase taxes.,127
162,Mr FILING,Unknown,"Hear, hear! Dead right.",127
163,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"The honourable member has it right. It is unfortunate that this governleaded ment which in the past has claimed to have had a mortgage on compassion and on understanding the underprivileged in· our society has brought in taxes which have slugged low income earners throughout the Commonwealth. Nowhere are people hurt more than in the electorate of Fisher. Last night the Treasurer closed his budget speech by saying that this budget was one which provides a prudent path to the futurea path leading crucially to more jobs for our people. When we looked at what the commentators in the media said this morning, it was clear that there were absolutely no jobs of any real nature created in this budget for the people of Australia. The government's budget is not one for the unemployed. We in this country now have more than one million people out of work. On the other hand, Martin Ferguson commented on national television, not knowing that he was being recorded, that this is a budget that cannot be defended. I think his words were, 'How can one defend the indefensible?'. Martin Ferguson knows, as we do on this side of the House, that the budget slugs low income earners. The electorate of Fisher and the Sunshine Coast generally have some of the lowest per capita incomes in the country. The picture which Labor created yesterday in the budget means a very bleak future for Sunshine Coast families. We have a large retirement population on the Sunshine Coast, we have a large population of young married people and we have a large number of unemployed. Those people were looking for hope in yesterday'S budget. Let us look at one or two cases of how the Labor Party has treated the low income earners on the Sunshine Coast, in Caboolture and on Bribie Island and in other parts of Australia yesterday. It decided that it would bring in a new tax on leaded petrol. I know that colleagues opposite are not happy with this tax either. The situation is that the price of leaded fuel will go up by IOc a litre in the foreseeable future. Who uses leaded fuel? The people who have not been able, because of Labor's recession, to buy vehicles which consume unleaded fuel. The people who use fuel are the less privileged people-the less prosperous people-in our society. Through no fault of their own they will be penalised because of the position in which they find themselves. The value of vehicles using leaded fuel will continue to depreciate. The result of that is that the underprivileged find themselves in an even more difficult situation. On the Sunshine Coast, as in other parts of Queensland, tourism is a vital industry. Some 80 per cent of people coming to the Sunshine Coast as tourists are day trippers. Those people use their vehicles to come to the Sunshine Coast. Some of them use leaded fuel and others use unleaded fuel. But the fact is that. the tourism industry on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. will be hit hard and there could be disastrous consequences for the coast tourism industry and jobs will be lost in this area. We only have to look at the figures brought out last week to find that the jobless rate in Kawana Waters rose under Labor by a staggering 16.7 per cent in July. In the area of Caloundra it went up by 3.7 per cent. The people of the Sunshine Coast were looking for answers yesterday. We in this country have a government of deceit and we find that the disaster of the last decade continues. I think it is a tragedy that the election result enabled this government to crawl into office on the basis of deceit and dishonesty. I hope that in the next couple of years there is a realisation that governments cannot show the very low level of ethics we saw prior to the 13 March election. The people of Australia deserve better and I hope that they get better. Cole, Dr Geoffrey",127
164,Mr KNOTT,Unknown,"It is with some trepidation that I do what I am about to do now, but I find that I am in a position where'I have no other option. Mr Speaker, I want to draw to your attention and to the attention of the House, a letter by Dr Geoffrey D. Cole of 33 Berry Street, PO Box 498, Nowra, 2541. His telephone number is 044-230615 and his fax number is' 044230635. I want to - ring to the attention of the.House an account that was rendered by Dr Cole to a person who, I will admit, is a personal friend. I was horrified when I read this account. The first paragraph states: . . . it has been noted by Dr Cole an amount ... outstanding on your account. It is the third paragraph to which I pay particular attention: It should be noted that all four Anaesthetists rendering services in the Shoalhaven area have a computer linked system. All non payments are obvious and noted by all doctors concerned. Therefore, in order not to jeopardise receiving future treatment PLEASE PAY YOUR ACCOUNT PROMPTLY!! Such a letter brings a number of things to attention. I find it disgraceful, and I hope other members also find it disgraceful. I want to know, otherwise I will progressively name the other three doctors, whether they are threatening this friend of mine with not receiving medical attention in an emergency. Are they suggesting that his life is worth $150? This doctor has never asked why this man has never paid. This letter also says that all four anaesthetists have a computer linked system. Concern was expressed about an Australia card, Big Brother and all of that in our society. Here we have doctors who say they a.re computer linked. There is the final straw. They say to my friend and, conceivably, his family that they will not give him medical attention. ' I would like the Federal Police to look at whether or not these people are gUilty of threatening my friend's life. Is this doctor the sort of person who should even be practising medicine? Should this sort of person riot be facing some sort of criminal charge for his actions? If my friend is not given medieal attention, I will be asking for retribution against this person. I hope that Dr Geoffrey D. Cole is seen in the Shoalhaven community in the light that he should be. I do not think he is a person who should be practising medicine. Let those other anaesthetists go on the public record and say that this man is a liar and that they are not in collusion on a computer linked system. Let them clear their own names because I intend to ask them and, once I have ,that information, I intend to name them in this House because the people of Australia should know the sorts of people that we have that there is still in our community. Lamb, Mr Colin",128
165,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,Unknown," Yesterday we started the proceedings for the. budget session with condolences to two former parliamentarians and what we might call a great Australian warrior. The thfee of them had served this parliament and the nation of Australia very credibly. Tonight I want to pay another condolence tribute, to a member of the staff of this parliament who died during the recess and who had served our Hansard section so faithfully and well and, might I say, this parliament and all its members. Mr Speaker, you know the gentleman, Colin Lamb. He was an Australian by choice, having come from Great Britain where he had served the Westminster system in Hansard at the House of Commons and, prior to that, the RAF in the reporting section on courts martial. As a volunte-r Australian he brought to this country a lot of expertise. I want to pay a tribute to the man himself, because one might call him a staff member who was a quiet achiever. He did his work thoroughly and well and, I might say, turned some very poor speeches delivered by parliamentarians into first-class English prose. He was very particular in that regard. He could express himself and he only ever sought to maintain the traditions of the English language in their purest form. I knew Colin rather well because his wife was employed by me when I was a shadow minister, for four years. In that time, I recognised the wealth of experience and knowledge that that man had and which he made available to the Hansard staff and to this parliament. He was able to go back to any piece of Shakespearian literature and apply a phrase from many years and centuries past to a current day event to give a person some relief in the distress he or she might have been suffering at that time. I know he was a valuable contributor to me in that way. I speak of Colin Lamb specifically, but I also speak in another sense. Parliamentarians come to this place on the whim of their electorate. They come and they go. They may feel in their own way that they are the masters of their own destinies within this parliament and this House. But we could never run a parliament unless we had people like Colin Lamb, who believe passionately in democracy and the Westminster system as it has been given to us. We could never function without the hundreds of people who subscribe to the same theory but who work in different capacities in this House. Probably the most touching part of Colin's funeral service was a memorial ceremony held within the gardens of Parliament House that was arranged by the Presiding Officers and members of Hansard. I believe it was a sincere tribute by the Hansard staff which Colin would have appreciated, because he lived so much for the institution. He lived not for Parliament House and not so much for the individuals in it, but for the institution. To have been able to attend that memorial service in the gardens outside the House of Representatives and to then see the tribute that was made to Colin by his fellow staff members made me feel a great sense of pride not only in the man but also in the people who serve this parliament. I thank the Hansard staff very much, not only for the work they do here on a continuing basis but also for the manner in which they are able to get the spirit of the parliamentary system into their work and the manner in which they paid their collective respects to Colin as they did at that time. My condolences go to Colin's wife, Carol, and his son, Rupert, who is still in England. I also pay tribute to the members of the fine staff-not only the Hansard staff but also the clerks, attendants and so many other people who make the running of this House possible-who are often overlooked, but who are the silent achievers. I use this moment to pay my respects to a great service for which this parliament should be always appreciative. Lead Pollution",128
166,Mr STAPLES,Unknown,"It has been quite a long time since I have had the opportunity to test my reflexes against my colleagues during this very important part of the business of the House known as the adjournment debate. Tonight I want to raise a couple of issues that concern Commonwealth-state relations and the need to see in this country a better working of the very complex relationships between the Commonwealth, the states, local governments and often the community. The first issue-which is being discussed in the community at the moment, particularly since last night-concerns pollution, the environment and lead in petrol. Problems have arisen in Waterdale Road in West Heidelberg in my electorate because changes and developments in some roads have resulted in a shift in traffic through the area. This has created other effects which I do not think were either recognised or taken into account and dealt with at the time they developed. The problem in Waterdale Road is that there is now a huge volume of traffic. More trucks, as well as cars, are pouring through the area. This is leading to what we assumewe have not been able to get results from the appropriate authorities on lead level readings that we have taken around that area-are increased lead levels in the air. Noise has increased dramatically and earth vibration due to the heavy transport is causing cracks in people's houses. Of course, there is also the issue of traffic safety and being able to park. The Waterdale Action Group is a group of citizens who have had to get together to protect themselves against various authorities, groups, governments and so forth who are not prepared at this stage to deal. with their problem. The main people involved in that group are Mr Bob Cody, Mr Ron Perks, Mr  to ensure that their families are protected against lead and noise pollution, that their properties are not destroyed by trafficparticularly heavy vehicles-and that the whole issue is dealt with as quickly as possible. A magnificent new TAFE college is being built next door, and traffic going to that area is going to cause them concern. Basically, it boils down to people wanting to be listened to. The real issues here revolve around the problems that we have in this country of dealing with Commonwealth and state relationships: how the planning is done, who puts in what money and the distribution of that money. This problem occurs in so many areas. If we are to deal seriously with environmental problems such as lead, atmospheric pollution and noise pollution, we have to come to some agreement very quickly-not only in terms of policy, but also resource agreements about the money that is going to be put in. We cannot attempt to solve an issue like reducing the levels of lead pollution across Australia, or at any particular place, if we do not bear in mind that we are not just dealing with lead pollution and lead in fuel. We must also bear in mind that state governments are cutting back on public transport services, increasing the price of public transport and cutting back on road funding. So the pressure is going onto local government as well. In the federal budget we have seen ups and downs in road funding. If these things are not taken together, and if there is not a national approach and national resource agreements, along with national policy agreements, then all the best will in the world will not lead to the best changes and the most desirable outcomes. It is that, I think, that makes people feel powerless. People should not have to get together in individual groups to deal with local issues like this. This parliament and this government, together with state, territory and local governments, have to come up with genuine national resource agreements arid genuine national policy agreements to deal with these issues concerning transportation and pollution in Australia. Ambon: Massacre",129
167,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"Melbourne) (10.58 p.m.)On 17 November 1986 my predecessor, Mr Gerry Hand, made a speech on the adjournment. The inspiration for this speech-which referred to the massacre of over 300 Australian prisoners of war on the island of Ambon by Japanese soldiers in February 1942-was Mr Hand's then constituent, and now my constituent, Mr Brian Noonan, whose brother died on the island. In his speech Mr Hand referred to the conspiracy of silence of the Australian authorities since that massacre, and the failure by those authorities to advise the relatives of those who died in that tragedy as to how the men had died on the island of Ambon. Mr Noonan's research has uncovered more information, and I wish to place it before the parliament today. In his speech on 17 Novemin relation to ber 1986 Mr Hand said: A number of Japanese officers were brought before the war crimes trials in 1947 for the massacre, and one was executed for his part. In fact, the true details have since been uncovered by Mr Noonan, and they are as follows. The one Japanese officer executed for his role in the massacre was Tsuaki Takahiko, who was sentenced to death on Manus Island on 19 March 1951, and executed on 10 June 1951. On 14 July 1947 and 17 July 1947 respectively, Kunito Hatakeyama and Kenichi Nakagawa were sentenced at Rabaul to 20 years jail. On 7 August 1950, at Manus Island, Kyusuke Yamashita was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. On the same day, Shigei Kamioka and Seichi Murayama were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, and Sadao Hayashi was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. Records also show that K. Sasaki was sentenced to life imprisonment and a person named Shimohama was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on Manus Island, with the date not specified. The records show that on 19 March 1951 at Manus Island, K. Kanamoto was sentenced to life imprisonment.",130

(2) Will alternative access be provided to those cannot attend the offices at other times. (3) Are the offices closed on Tuesday afternoons claims to be processed and the backlog of work to be dealt with; if so, will another be chosen which does not affect clients to Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Regional Offices in Queensland, Northern and Western Australia ,close their public areas on Tuesday afternoons. Offices In Australia, NSW, Tasmania and Victoria close public contact areas on Wednesday afternoons. (2) Alternative access is provided by way of the Centres. These Centres enable clients as much of their business as possible over the often obviating any requirement for them a Department of Social Security office. Office closures do not affect TeleService The National TeleService number is 132468 and the number for age pensioners is 132360. Clients in emergency circumstances, after first contacting the Department through the TeleService Centres, will always be able to talk directly with the appropriate officer in their Regional Office and, if necessary, arrange an appointment to visit the office and have their business dealt with in person. Furthermore, I would stress that community based agencies representing the needs of clients are provided with direct 'indial' telephone numbers to relevant Regional Offices to ensure that they are able to raise any client concerns, even when the office is closed on Tuesday or Wednesday afternoons.

The rights and liberties of Australian citizens would not be affected by abolition of the monarchy in Australia. (3) See the answer to question (2). (4) No. (5) The Prime Minister has established a Republic Advisory Committee to prepare an options paper which describes the minimal constitutional changes necessary to achieve the viable federal republic of Australia.

(6) How often are the tests conducted. (7) How many AQIS inspectors are engaged in the work referred to in part (5). Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has not licensed any overseas food processing companies. (2) See part (1). (3) On the 25 May 1'993, there were 3,500 food processing companies in Australia which had an export licence.

180,Mr CAMERON,Unknown,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 26 May 1993: (1) Are there limits to the amount of work experience unemployed persons may undertake; if so, what are the limits. (2) Is a person seeking paid employment permitted to undertake work experience involving more than 20 hours per week. (3) .Do Social Security offices have child minding facilities; if not, has his Department considered providing unemployed persons work experience by setting up such facilities and allowing them to work in the facilities. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Work experience for Job Search Allowance (JSA) and Newstart Allowance (NSA) clients may be undertaken by way of paid part-time or casual work or through voluntary work. Part-time or casual work for pay can be undertaken by a JSA or NSA client, providing activity test requirements continue to be met. If the client's gross income, from wages and other sources, precludes payment of JSA or NSA for more than four consecutive working weeks, the client is not considered to be unemployed and can no longer be paid JSA or NSA. The client can reclaim when the work ceases or income drops below the cut-off limits. There is no limit to the amount of part-time voluntary work a JSA client can undertake, so long as the client continues to be actively seeking and willing to undertake paid work. Voluntary work is usually considered to be full-time when it is undertaken for 20 hours per week or more. JSA clients under 50 years of age can engage in up to 30 days full-time voluntary work per calendar year. Those aged 50 or more can engage in up to 65 days. Full-time voluntary work must be with an organisation approved by the CES. In addition, a the client must have been a qualified allowee for at least three months, if under the age of 18, or for at least six months, if over 18, immediately before starting work for the organisation. For NSA clients (of any age), there are no limits to the amount of voluntary work they can undertake as part of their Activity Agreements. However, as is the case for JSA clients, any full-time voluntary work must be approved by the CES. (2) Part-time or casual work experience of more than 20 hours per week is permitted, providing the client can continue to meet the activity test requirements and payment is not precluded under the income test. More than 20 hours per week voluntary work experience is considered to be full-time and therefore the restrictions previously outlined for JSA clients apply. (3) In Canberra, there are long day child care places available for the children of DSS staff. DSS Area offices are considering setting up equivalent facilities and the Department has drafted a national policy in relation to this. DSS is not considering setting up equivalent facilities for clients. If facilities were established, they would need to be staffed by suitably qualified child care providers. Military Bands (Question No. 132) Mr Andrew asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 26 May 1993: (1) Is the Regular Anny Band in Adelaide to be disbanded; if so, (a) why and (b) how many full time jobs will be lost as a result. (2) Are other State or Territory military bands to be discontinued; if so, (a) where, (b) why and (c) how many full-time jobs will be lost as a result.",141
181,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Australian Anny Band·Adelaide is to be converted from a Regular Anny Band to a General Reserve Band.

Pensioner Health Benefit Cards (Question No. 134) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 26 May 1993: What would be the cost of making pensioner health benefit cards available to all retirees, including self-funded retirees, over the age of 65. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The estimated direct program costs to the Commonwealth of providing pensioner health benefit cards to all Australian residents aged over 65 would be some $76Om per annum, including the cost of existing concession arrangements for pensioners. Approximately $160m of this estimate would· be the cost in respect of people not in receipt of a Social Security or Veterans' Affairs pension who do not have an existing entitlement to a card. These estimates do not include any capital costs in respect of Commonwealth facilities, nor do they include any impacts on Commonwealth-State financial arrangements arising from any requirement to compensate States for the cost of extending State concessions attached to the pensioner health benefit card.

182,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) I am not aware of any listening device having been used in Australia by Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence Service. I am aware of media reports on 30 and 31 May 1993 in which it is stated that the honourable member has alleged that such a listening device had been detected recently in Sydney. If that is so, I would encourage the honourable member to produce evidence of it in order that it can be investigated by the competent authority. (b) The use of listening devices in Australia is regulated by legislation in each State and Territory and, in the case of the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority and ASIa, by Commonwealth legislation. The relevant law in each jurisdiction would apply to foreign intelligence agencies. (c) In accordance with the practice of successive Commonwealth Governments, I do not propose to comment on matters concerning specific action in relation to national security.

183,Mr EVANS,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 26 May 1993: (1) Will the Government exempt sufferers of war-caused wounds or illnesses from the pharmaceutical benefits charge. (2) Are there any existing exemptions from the pharmaceutical· benefits charge; if so, who is eligible for exemption.",142

Travel by Prime Minister (Question No. 160)",144
190,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 27 May 1993: Does (a) he or (b) his family exclusively use RAAF VIP transport for air travel within Australia; if not, in what circumstances are commercial air services used; if so, (i) when did Australian Prime Ministers and their families cease using commercial air services, (ii) what advice is relied on for not using commercial air services for travel within Australia, (iii) when was this advice supplied and (iv) who supplied it.",144
191,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Air travel within Australia for the person holding the office of Prime Minister is by Special Purpose Aircraft or, occasionally, by charter aircraft. The occupant of the position does not travel by scheduled commercial air services. Members of the Prime Minister's family, when travelling unaccompanied, do not travel by Special Purpose Aircraft. Reasons of their own security and the travelling public's dictate that Prime Ministers should not use scheduled commercial air services. This practice is of long standing and has been> accepted under successive governments. To trace its origins would involve extensive labour and expense, which I do not consider would be warranted and am not prepared to authorise.

194,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 27 May 1993: (1) What is the (a) number and (b) cost of pensions and part pensions which Australia pays to each country under various reciprocal social security arrangements. Agreement country (a) Number of pensions Austria Canada Cyprus Ireland Italy Malta Netherlands New Zealand Spain UK Total (2) These pensions can vary as a result of exchange rate fluctuations in two ways: (a) Payments are made in sterling or US dollars. The Department of Social Security buys the foreign currency for each payday from the Reserve Bank. The Australian dollar value of each pension is converted using the exchange rate. obtained by the Department. The purchase of currency and processing occurs a fortnight before the payday in order to allow sufficient time for the cheques to be mailed and received by the pensioners on or before the payday. Even though the Australian dollar value of a pension remains the same, there may be a variation in the sterling or US dollar value of the payment due to the exchange rate. (b) The Australian dollar value of pensions can vary because many of these pensioners have foreign income which affects the rate of pension through the income test. The exchange rate used to express foreign income in Australian dollars is changed from time to time. Due to the large number of (2) Do such pensions vary as a result of exchange rate fluctuations; if so, how. (3) Does his Department use an exchange rate which is nine cents lower than that which previously applied for calculating payments of British pension to veterans; if so, why; if the same rate is not applied to other British pensions or benefits, why not. (4) Are pensions or benefits from other countries Pensions to be similarly discounted; if not, why not. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia currently pays the following pensions to other countries under social security . agreements: (b) $A per annum 11 21,603 227 587,681 16 50,653 19 73,445 8,627 19,608,589 726 2,345,247 1,574 3,104,143 136 1,011,085 378 1,014,232 374 1,172,771 12,088 28,989,449 a pensioners with sterling income, set exchange rate is used for sterling. This rate is updated regularly by automatic processing. (3) As explained in 2(b) above, all sterling income is assessed at the same exchange rate. The exchange rate used by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) is generally the same. However, when the exchange rate is being updated, there is a week between the Social Security and DVA paydays, where the exchange rates differ. For example, the exchange rate used by Social Security was changed from $1 '= £0.4707 (£1 = 2. 1245)' to $1 = £0.4910 (£1 = 2.0367) on Social Security payday 8 April 93. The exchange rate used by DVA changed on DVA payday 15 April 93. The difference between the old and the new exchange rates was $0.0878. (4) There is no discount applied. The exchange rate used to assess other foreign income is changed regularly as circumstances warrant. Senators and Members: Computers (Question No. 163)",145

199,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 May 1993: (1) How many staff are employed in the Office of Regulation Review within the Industry Commission. (2) What is the total budget for the Office of Regulation Review. (3) How many reports (a) did the Business Regulation Review Unit publish and (b) has the Office of Regulation Review published since 1990. (4) What is the title of each of the reports referred to in part (3). (5) How many regulations did the Business Regulation Review Unit examine during the life of the 36th Parliament. (6) How many regulations has the Office of Regulation Review (a) examined and (b) recommended be (i) approved, (ii) changed or (iii) not or proceeded with during the life of the 36th Parliament. (7) What are the titles of the regulations in each case referred to in part (6). Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Office of Regulation Review (ORR) currently employs seven staff. (2) The current running cost allocation to the ORR is $330,000 for 1992-93. (3) During the period of its existence from May 1985 to October 1989, the Business Regulation Review Unit (BRRU) published 15 information papers, and various other submissions. Since becoming the ORR and part of the Industry Commission, most of its reporting has been incorporated into Commission publications. The ORR has made major contributions to all Commission Annual Reports since 1989, two Commission inquiry reports, and a major Commission discussion paper. It has also contributed to several other Commission reports and papers. In addition, the ORR has independently published one discussion paper and made submissions to other agencies and reviews, such as on the development of mutual recognition of Commonwealth, State and Territory regulations and on product liability. (4) BRRU Information Papers: 1 Review of Business Regulations (January 1986). 2 Costs and Benefits of Regulation (May 1986). 3 Social Regulation-Issues Concerning Industrial Chemicals (October 1986). 4 Food Packaging and Labelling (December 1986). 5 Major Changes in Business Regulation During 1986 (April 1987). 6 Indigenous Crude Oil Marketing Arrangements (April 1987). 7 Transport of Dangerous Goods (July 1987). 8 Safe Manual Handling (August 1987). 9 Australian Food Standards Regulation (September 1987). 10 Review of Road Vehicle Weights and Taxation (February 1988). 11 Australian Fishing Industry (March 1988). 12 Major Changes in Business Regulation During 1987 (August 1988). 13 Therapeutic Goods Regulation (March 1989). 14 Container Deposit Legislation and the Control of Litter and Waste (June 1989). 15 Major Changes in Business Regulation During 1988 (June 1989). ORR major contributions to Industry Commission Annual Reports: 1989/90, Appendix 6, Developments in Regulation Review. 1990/91, Appendix 7, Developments in Regulation Review. 1991/92, Appendix G, Developments in Regulation and its Review. ORR major contributions to Industry Commission Inquiry Reports: Statutory Marketing Arrangements for Primary Products (March 1991), Appendix D, Statutory Marketing Arrangements and the Trade Practices Act. Availability of Capital (December 1991), Appendix, G, Companies and Securities Law. ORR major contribution to Industry Commission Discussion Papers: Proc6mpetitive Regulation in Australia (November 1992). ORR Discussion Papers: Pay TV: Why Regulate? (April 1991). (5) Neither the BRRU nor the ORR has operated a formal regulation 'sunrise' procedure: that is, a process by which new regulations are submitted for clearance. The regulation vetting functions of the ORR, as with the BRRU before it, consist of formal and informal consultation with initiating agencies on new regulatory proposals, requiring on occasions that regulatory proposals include a 'regulation impact statement' on the likely costs and benefits entailed, and providing policy advice on regulatory proposals direct to the Structural Adjustment and Trade Committee of Cabinet (previously the Structural Adjustment Committee of Cabinet). The ORR also participates in inter-departmental committees considering new regulatory proposals, and makes submissions to outside reviews of regulation. Much of the ORR's influence on the content of regulatory proposals is achieved in these formal and informal preliminary stages. Many proposals do not proceed or are modified as a result of ORR views. It is therefore difficult to identify all regulatory proposals that have been the subject of comment, examination or recommendation by the BRRU or the ORR. (6) See (5) above. (7) See (5) above. But examples include ORR involvement in: the development and implementation of the concept of mutual recognition of goods and professional and occupational qualifications; amendments to product liability laws; incorporation of Commonwealth regulation into State and Territory one-stop business licence centres; the development of a national approach to environmental regulation; recent changes to the regulation of broadcasting and telecommunications; amendments to corporations laws; the Administrative Review Council's work on rule making by the Commonwealth; the regulation of therapeutic goods; development of food standards policy; and proposals on country of origin labelling.",154
