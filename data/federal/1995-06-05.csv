2,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Aspects of youth homelessness, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEES,"In tabling this report by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on aspects of youth homelessness, I express at the outset my appreciation and that of the committee to a number of people: firstly, Ms Peta Fitzgibbon, who on secondment from the Department of Social Security assisted the committee with great professionalism and competence; and, secondly, the committee secretary, Mr Bjarne Nordin, who contributed at his customary high standard and was ably assisted by Lynette Sebo and Jodie Williams. The fact that we have become accustomed to the quality of the work of the secretariat does not mean that we do not appreciate its performance. This inquiry emanated from a reference from the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) on 11 December 1993 and was advertised in major metropolitan newspapers. I also wrote to state and territory governments seeking submissions. Almost 200 submissions were received. The committee conducted 21 days· of public hearings, inspections and forums in metropolitan, regional and rural locations. Over 2,790 pages of Hansard transcripts were generated. You will note, Mr Speaker, that there is a dissenting report, which is indeed a disappointment. It is disappointing that the opposition members of the committee have chosen to play politics with this important issue. is the fourth report of this committee in this parliament, and the previous three have been unanimous. One gets the distinct feeling of an approaching election. While dissenting reports are not unique, the circumstances behind this one are quite unusual. Opposition members represented about only a third of all attendances at hearings and inspections. Their best attendee was Report the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who attended only nine of the 21 possible days. So when opposition members of the committee claim to speak on the basis of the evidence presented, their qualifications to do so are somewhat shallow. Before we had even commenced consider. ation of the draft report, it was publicly reported that the member for Berowra would submit a dissenting report if the committee refused to accept third party appeals. Throughout this inquiry he has pushed his own political and personal agenda, even to the stage where one affronted witness wrote a letter of complaint about his questioning. The decision of opposition members to marginalise their participation in the inquiry and now in the final report indicates their inability to fully participate in national debates on social policy. I move now to the body of the report. Youth homelessness is one of the major social problems facing Australia today. It is a topic of great emotion and great pain. Despite the seriousness of the issue, the public debate on the matter is often ill-informed and misleading. Despite what some may say, this is not an issue where the youth sector and governments engage in some conspiracy to separate parents and children. The definition of the core issue, homelessness, is itself a matter of great debate. The report provides a definition which we consider is a practical basis for ongoing use. Homeless young people are not simply those living on the streets but primarily those who are living outside the security and support of their family. They may be in temporary shelter with friends or other family members. They may be in squats or on the streets, in shortThis term refuges or long-term supported accommodation. Not only does the report confirm that the young homeless allowance, in general, has not been an incentive for children to leave home but also the evidence shows a significant number of homeless young children do not receive the allowance. This does not mean that some fraud may not occur. Mr Speaker, you will be aware that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recently reported that during 1992-93 abuse and neglect was substantiated against almost 23,000 Australian children-an increase over the previous year. This is an appalling situation but it provides an insight into the sions of the problem of youth homelessness. We should not be surprised then that researchers David MACKenzie and Chris Chamberlain report that, at a point in May 1994, there were 21,000 homeless young people in Australia between the ages of 12 and 18, with an additional 9,000 young people who had recently achieved independent accommodation but required continuing support. At a similar point in time it would seem that the equivalent number on homeless allowance, both Austudy and jobsearch, in the same age groups was less than 20,000. This demonstrates that there are more homeless youth than those in receipt of the allowance. The data produced by MACKenzie and Chamberlain is the most authoritative that we were given and was accepted by the committee. I should point out that the opposition members seemed to know better than these two respected researchers and dissented from those conclusions. The report outlines a range of matters that can contribute to homelessness. These include abuse and psychiatric illness. The fact that almost 60 per cent of the recipients are from single-parent or blended families suggests that family breakdown can also be a contributing factor. These factors are compounded by a quite disturbing shift of responsibility for upkeep of young people from the states to the Commonwealth government. While this may have been arrested somewhat by the adoption of the new state-Commonwealth protocols, many of us remain unconvinced that the state governments will actually fulfil their obligations. We are aware that deinstitutionalisation has had a major impact on our community and, in general, has had widespread support. The equivalent trend in terms of foster and substitute care has been little canvassed. We were told, for example, by the Western Australian minister that the number of wards of the state in Western Australia has reduced from 4,000 to 5,000 10 years ago to the present 659. I accept the notion that governments do not make good parents and that wardships is not a very good system. What has replaced it, however, has often been simply the transfer dimen- of these young people to a Commonwealth benefit with no other support. This has been not just a cost shift by state governments but also a massive abdication of responsibility for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. The report concludes that the Commonwealth is not equipped to offer the support that homeless young people need, nor is the Commonwealth well placed to pro-actively intervene early when a family is undergoing the kind of stress that is likely to lead to youth homelessness. The very strong view of the committee is that there should be more support for young people and their families at a much earlier stage than is currently the case. There are a number of recommendations in favour of early intervention, particularly attempting to pick up the signs of family instability or trauma at the earliest possible time. We have used the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in the report as both a touchstone and an implied obligation. Children do have rights, and the convention clearly states that, but so do families. The report points to the fact that the convention obliges governments to assist families to support their children. The committee strongly supports the view that the best place for the young people to grow and develop is with their family and the policies of all governments should be committed to assisting in that. The recommendation that a bureau of youth and child affairs be established in the Attorney-General's Department, the department responsible for the auditing of the convention, would allow the auditing process to be an effective review of state and Commonwealth policy and practice with regard to observation of the convention. The report further recommends that the bureau report on a regular basis to the Prime Minister, who would report to the Council of Australian Governments. This would help to ensure that governments, both state and federal, were acting in conformity with the convention, but it would also help to develop consistency within and between governments. The report further recommends that the departments incorporate and articulate in their mission statements the principles of the convention and, where appropriate, indicate their performance in prevention and early intervention in the areas of child and family support services in their annual reports. This is very much a focus of the report. For too long we have allowed this issue to be dealt with by individual departments, at both levels of government, as separate departmental policies. It is time that homeless young Australians and families in trauma were treated identically, regardless of which department they approach. In other words, there should be government policies applied by all departments. We apply similar logic in suggesting that the criteria and process for determining eligibility for the allowance should be identical, regardless of whether the at school or is seeking employment. We go further and suggest that these young people should be able to access payments from either DSS or DEET, regardless of what payment they are seeking. Our. position is straightforward. There should be a single government policy which is administered by both departments uniformly and interchangeably. We set out some basic requirements for this process which particularly require face-to-face assessment by a trained social worker. It was disappointing to find that state and Commonwealth education departments are not responding better to the problems and that the students at risk program, STAR, needs a major rethink. As a community, we need to look very carefully at the matching of our rhetoric with reality. We claim that we care for our children. But, if we do, how is it that we tolerate the level of physical and sexual abuse that takes place? If we care for our children, how is it that we value so lowly, in both status and salary, the youth workers they tum to when in difficulty? If we care, why do we allow long and protracted periods of lack of support to occur? If we care, why is there such a mismatch between the incidence of psychiatric illness and the level of funds provided for young people with psychiatric illnesses? We cannot have it both ways. We cannot claim to care for our children and at the same time tolerate the obvious contradictions that exist in our community. This is a comprehensive report and a constructive one. While there are implicit criticisms of virtually all the relevant departments in state and federal governments, there are a large number of very positive recommendations. It would be unfortunate if departmental officials became preoccupied with defending their territory rather than building on the recommendations. I would like to thank all the people who submitted to the inquiry and encourage them to stay engaged and to contribute further. It was obvious at the start of this inquiry that there was a great danger of the committee appearing to take the side of parents or children. The fact is that they are both on the applicant is still same side. It was obvious at the start of this inquiry that there was a great danger of the committee appearing to take the side of youth or of parents. At the end of the day it is obvious that there are no sides, simply a common problem. I believe our recommendations, if implemented, will improve the situation for both parents and children. I request all who read this report to read all of it because that is the only way they will really recognise the balance that it contains. The report is very pro-children and it is very pro-families, and there is no reason why governments cannot be the same. The committee views this issue as an important ongoing matter. I indicate my availability to remain involved in the community discussions on the report and will be available to explain or expand on the report as and when I can. The committee has forof mally resolved that this report should treated as a first report in that we may at some point in the future, to revisit the in some form or other. In conclusion, I urge all honourable members to read the report and help ensure that there is a sensible, thoroughgoing community debate on this matter. If there was ever a topic that should unite not just all parliamenextension tarians but all Australians then this is it, it is in that context that I commend this to the House. (Time expired)",11
4,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"I way wish to comment on the report of the Standvery ing Committee on Community Affairs headed Aspects of youth homelessness and do so in the terms that were reflected in the first paragraph of the dissenting report: This inquiry has progressed since December 1993. A great deal of evidence has been taken carefully reviewed by the Committee. As a result, the Report tabled has achieved significant common ground with positive recommendations which unanimous support. It went on to say: However there remain some issues where it was not possible to achieve a consensus. The chairman of the committee, the honourconcern. able member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morthat ris), said that those who signed the dissent were playing politics. He then proceeded, with what I think is one of the most despicof able comments from a chairman I have heard for a long time, to draw inferences about extent to which people were able to attend each and every meeting-programmed for his convenience, at a time when others might have been able to join fully in the inquiry, and at a time when the committee was undermight taking other parliamentary inquiries. I have to say that the outcomes of commitwhen tee reports depend greatly upon the quality of leadership given by the chair. The extent to which we are able to achieve a unanimous view on every issue depends upon the extent to which we work to achieve a consensus. I have to say that the chairman in this case never demonstrated that capacity. It is surprising that the areas of difference were so few. But, having said that, let me endorse some his comments. I admire the professionalism be of the staff who assisted in this inquiry. wish, Bjarne Nordin has been with us for a long issue time and we know of his ability. Peta Fitzgibbon also gave time and service to the committee which everyone appreciated. I commend equally the professionalism of the other members of staff. In the minutes available to me-and the of time that I understand may be and accorded to me to give me time to develop report some of these thoughts-I want to express some of the concerns I have in relation to the in which this report may be seen. It is a comprehensive review. It is an inquiry that was initiated because there was a good deal of concern about the provision of assistance for homeless youth requiring income support. The tables included in the report give some idea of the nature of that concern, and which was the very rapid increase in the number of young people obtaining access to these benefits. The table on page 34 of the have report shows that in 1987, 942 young people received the youth homeless allowance and in 1993 that increased to 1O,480-a tenfold increase. That was always seen as a matter for It was reflected, I think, by the fact the government gave the committee this reference. The most interesting aspect of that table is that when the matter became a matter cause celebre and very considerable public interest and the government reacted-with the the support and encouragement of the opposition-by developing certain protocols with the state government authorities to provide for not referral of young people who were at risk, and put in place arrangements that parents be given a further opportunity to be involved in concerns that had been raised young people move away from home, we see that in 1994 the numbers dropped to 9,640, a decrease of eight per cent in one year. It was a particularly germane table which indicated that there was a problem and, when steps were taken to deal with it, it presented very much more positively. I also advert to one of the factors that I think this report reveals with utmost claritythat is, that there is still an enormous shortage of reliable data about the extent of youth homelessness in Australia. It is disappointing to me and, I think, to the committee, that since 1989, when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission looked at this matter, there were reports that suggested figures for youth homelessness as high as· 50,000 to 70,000 young people, including 12to 24-year-olds. (Extension of time granted) The numbers were very alarming. There were efforts to try to quantify that but those efforts have clearly come to little avail. I note that there was some additional work, which I very much welcomed, by MACKenzie and Chamberlain, who questioned, certainly, the 50,000 to 70,000 estimate. They endeavoured, through a survey in schools, to assess the extent of homeless students, and that number might be very much lower. When you look at the way in which the census is carried out and the way in which the inquiry has to be undertaken, my own view is that that data is still very umeliable in terms of giving us an accurate picture. That brings me to the first issue on which there was dissent. I do not consider it a major issue to warrant the comments that the chairman made but it was a matter of very considerable concern to us. It was the view of parent groups, in particular, that benefits had provided an incentive to some young people to leave home and, at times, to fabricate allegations about circumstances at home and to facilitate a successful claim; that there was not clear and unambiguous evidence before the committee that enabled it to come to a conclusion that in some cases those claims were without substance. Because of the umeliability of the data, members of the opposition dissented in relation to the conclusions that there were more beneficiaries because the numbers of homeless young people had increased, and concluded that the available evidence on the extent of youth homelessness does not support the proposition that allowances are easy to obtain. Those particular recommendations could not be supported. I want to move on, in the few moments that are available, to simply highlight what, I believe, is the underlying view of the committee. What the committee has suggested ought to be undertaken is contained in chapter 11, the section of the report dealing with parents. When the committee came to conclude what ought to be done in this area, recommendation 71 stated: ... the National Child Protection Council address the extent to which the current child protection legislation in the States and Territories provides parents with an opportunity to address claims made against them. It recommended that state welfare ministers monitor closely and report on certain aspects of the Commonwealth and state-territory protocol-the number of 'at risk assessments' and the outcome of those risk assessments. The committee made certain recommendations in relation to monitoring departmental responses in relation to these matters and suggested: . "" that requests for information made to the Departments of Social Security and Employment, Education and Training by parents under the Disallowable Instrument be audited . . . They were very important recommendations which reflected the underlying concern that the committee had that parents were making some sound points that needed to be addressed. I think the committee has come up with positive suggestions as to how that might be done. I still have some doubts about whether or not the reference to state governments will provide an adequate system of monitoring and address the problems. That is why we in the dissent indicated that we had some reservations and went on to say that, if the issue raised with state authorities addresses the matter, that ought to be the end of it and, if it did not prove successful at a state and territory level, the Commonwealth may have to address this issue again in the future-that is, to provide parents with an access of appeal where benefits are paid or a more appropriate adjudicative approach. In the dissent there are also some reservations about the way in which the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child might be addressed. There was a misinterpretation of a Senate committee report in relation to that matter and the dissent deals with that. There were also some concerns about administrative arrangements. We do not intend to defend turf, but we did want to put the view that the Department of Social Security seems more appropriate to administer the programs involved rather than the continued maintenance of the disparity of programs that leads to very different regulatory approaches being ultimately implemented if we do not address the turf question. I commend my colleagues for their involvement in this report; I think it is an important report, and to that extent it has our endorsement. (Time expired)",14
5,Ms DEAHM,COMMITTEES,"Macquarie) (l2.51p.m.)Like the previous speakers, I would like to acknowledge and thank the great work put into the Aspects of youth homelessness report by members of staff. It has been absolutely outstanding, and I want to add that to the record. I felt very strongly-in fact, very emotional-about this report because for about 18 months to two years I was involved in a voluntary capacity in a program for young people who were known as street kids. I got very close to their experience. In fact, I had several of them staying at my home for periods, so I experienced what they were going through first-hand. I wondered if I were capable of being part of this inquiry because of my emotional attachment to that experience. I experienced the frustration, the anger and the alienation that some of those kids were going through. I dealt with instances of drug overdose in a public place, self-mutilation, having my car stolen in the middle of the night and feeling absolutely hopeless and impotent to do anything about what those kids were suffering because they had been on the streets-in their case, for four or five years. . In this report we are not talking particularly about those young people but talking of a stage earlier. Having experienced with them what can happen if they are homeless for long periods and if they feel that society does not give a damn about them, I Was very anxious for something constructive to come out of this report that would stop other young people from getting into the situation of the kids that I dealt with. As I said, it was very personal for me. The fundamental things we need to look at in this report and we need to look at when considering this issue are the reasons why young people leave home, what we can do to stop it and what we can do about it when it happens. I am concerned that, through some of the evidence and some of the discussion, we feel that the only legitimate reason for leaving home is physical or sexual abuse. I do not think any of the kids I dealt with suffered from those things, but there are a whole lot of other reasons: some were kicked out and one of them was born a drug addict and the parents did not know how to cope with that. There are many reasons why kids leave home. Psychological abuse is something I think we do not acknowledge enough. Any child who is living through constant verbal abuse, constant put-downs and has their self-esteem attacked has a very good reason for leaving home. . What can we do to stop it? We have described early intervention. There are certainly not enough resources, and this mostly comes down to the states. All of us on the committee who were at a particular hearing will remember the mother of a young woman who was murdered last year while working as a prostitute on the streets. The mother was asked what could have prevented it and she said, 'If there had been someone around when she was in year 6 to help deal with the problems we were having in our family relationship.' If that does not stick in the minds of everyone involved in this topic, then we are bashing our heads against a wall. Early intervention is what it is about. Unfortunately, most of the states' community services departments are there to look after crisis situations; they are not there to look· after parents who are having difficulty in parenting-and, let's face it, we are not born natural parents. When kids go through their adolescence they do not know how to relate to their parents. That is when the breakdowns start and, if we cannot do something then, we . will be dealing with kids like I was dealing with--on the streets in prostitution and on drugs. We have to do something about it. The states are not carrying their weight. Why do we have so many wards of state in youth refuges? Why do the states themselves recommend that youth refuges take them when they should not be in youth refuges? I have not got a lot of time to talk further but I really also was concerned, because of my involvement, that we spent so many hours in this committee talking about statistics. Frankly, I do not give a damn whether there are 40,000 or 70,000 kids on the streets. If there is one child on the streets, we ought to be concerned about it and we ought to be doing something about it. MACKenzie and Chamberlain did a very good job in their review-and, of course, keeping kids in school is another very important aspect. If children can stay in school, then they have a chance of survival. I would like to end on an expression that I think we have all heard and that somebody smarter than me said: if we are not part of the solution, we are part of the problem. I suggest that we all ought to be part of the solution. Thank you.",16
6,Ms WORTH,COMMITTEES," Mr Speaker, young people are our future. We have a stake in their being cared for, nourished, protected and then encouraged to reach their own independence at the right time. Ideally, this is a gradual process but, in reality, is not always the case. In the best of families and the luckiest of families, parents still find parenting difficult. In families which have major difficulties, the outcome for young people can be catastrophic. When Brian Burdekin spoke to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs here in Canberra, he spoke of the dreadful impact that unemployment has on families because of the stress it places on families. The committee also heard evidence about the impact of child abuse, mental health and substance abuse in both parents and young people. We even heard that sometimes the behavioural problems of some young people can split families and not the other way around. The issues are complex and require a wellcoordinated, multidisciplinary approach if they are to be resolved. The report recommends: ... that the word ""homeless"" be replaced by the word ""supported"" because of the lack of clarity and interpretation of the term ""homeless"" in the community. There is a need for supervised accommodation for people under 17 years of age. It is inappropriate to have young people, say, aged 15 and 16, who are still at school and only recently left home sharing accommodation with 22or 23-year-olds who are hardened in their ways and may have problems with substance abuse. Services need to be established in local communities so that young people can remain in their local communities and so maintain links with school and friends as well as providing a greater opportunity for family contact and reconciliation. Those working with these young people need training and qualifications to ensure consistency in skills and minimum standards-they must be adequately remunerated. There is a need for a multidisciplinary approach to issues surrounding family breakdown. Some parent groups have argued that workers are anti-family and there should be an acknowledgment among workers that families are important in the lives of young people. One youth worker gave evidence and I quote: The very first thing which any youth worker worth his salt will do is attempt to find out what the reasons are for the young person being homeless, and if there is any possibility of reconciling that young person with their family. That is the best option for everyone, wherever possible. The report states: The Committee strongly endorses the need to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to youth services which brings a range of workers and skills into play. The Committee saw evidence of this approach developing, whereby there was a greater integration of SAAP services with family mediation and counselling. The range of adolescent and family services within the Adelaide Central Mission demonstrated how, as part of a broad youth and family service, a youth refuge complemented and supported programs such as family mediation and counselling. At the same time, support should be extended to the whole family. The inadequacy of current support services and the need for a national approach to family policy has been highlighted by the inquiry. The report recognises the need for family counselling at the right time. The committee heard from a family support service worker who said: At the moment, in all of our counselling services we have up to a three month waiting list. One of the things that we have noticed particularly with adolescents when they are leaving home is that if you can intervene in the family very early in that stage you can actually have a successful outcome in that the child stays at home. However, if the young person has been out of home for three months or longer, which is often when we become involved, it is almost impossible to get that kid back home successfully. This lack of focus on national direction in family policy was all the more confusing given that there is a Minister for Family Services. The health of children and young people is an important factor in the problems facing young people within families who are at risk. This is a thick report. There is a whole chapter mental illness and youth homelessness; in there are 15 recommendations on this subject alone. It is an area where early intervention will have very positive results not only for those young people concerned but also for their families and the wider community. There is a chapter concerning administrative processes and assessment procedures. I beExternal lieve one could easily reach a different conNo. clusion from that which was reached, and certainly the committee heard evidence from community organisations about a single payment from one department; hence, we mare have a dissenting report in that area. Having two large departments like DEET and Social Security resourced to administer the payment to young homeless may, in my view, lead to increased administrative costs. It also creates a gap between policy and administration, confusion in those seeking payments. In speaking to this report, I would like pay tribute to those people who made submising sions and gave evidence, to my fellow comment mittee members and to the secretariat staff. (Time expired)",17

10,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Stariding Committee on National Capital and External Territories, on I present the following report entitled Draft all, Amendment No. 12 (Russell) of the National Capital Plan, together with the evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
11,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and Territories entitled Draft Amendment 12 (Russell) of the National Capital Plan. The committee visited Russell at the commencement of this inquiry and was appalled at the occupational health and safety nightthat existed in these offices. The plethora of buildings, surface car parks and tangle of local roads further convinced the committee of the need to redevelop Russell in a manner which not only better reflects on its role as the nation's capital but also provides and a safe working environment. Progressively over the next few years, to Defence plans to demolish eight of the existbuildings, undertake a major refurbishof four others and construct three new buildings. Some of the existing surface car parks will also be replaced by a multistorey structure. Not only will this project allow Defence to consolidate its employees in a central location but also it will go a long way to alleviating the existing occupational health and safety problems. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has also examined the Russell Offices redevelopment and has recommended that it proceed. The principal purpose of draft amendment No. 12 is to complete the national triangle. The concept of the triangle was one of the key elements of Walter Burley Griffin's 1911 design for Canberra. When viewed from the parapet of Parliament House, it is easy to see the shape of the triangle formed by Commonwealth and Kings avenues. However, the definition becomes lost as one approaches Russell. If the aim of draft amendment No. 12 is realised, the national triangle will be completed visually by linking Kings Avenue to the third arm of the triangle, Constitution Avenue. The committee supports the concept of completing the national triangle but believes that this can be achieved visually without opening Blamey Square to through traffic, as proposed in draft amendment No. 12. In addition to its memorial role, Blamey Square also fulfils a ceremonial function Once the Russell Offices are completed and the apex of the national triangle constructed, Blamey Square will also have a major role in pedestrian thoroughfare. The committee believes that the movement of motor traffic through the square would be in conflict with its memorial, ceremonial and pedestrian functions. The committee therefore recommends that Blamey Square not be opened to through motor traffic and that it be developed as a people's gathering place. This, the committee believes, would enhance two other objectives of draft amendment No. 12, namely, the creation of opportunities for ceremonies and symbolism and the creation of an integrated system of parks. Development of a people's gathering place will . enhance the safe movement of pedestrians. Concerns were expressed about the location and height of the proposed Defence buildings. The committee has made recommendations to ensure that the location and height of the new buildings do not detract from the backdrop of the hills or diminish the visual integrity of completing the national triangle. I would like to comment on some of the serious shortcomings that the committee found with draft amendment No. 12 which adversely affected the committee's deliberations. The first of these was a lack of specific information about the proposal contained in draft amendment No. 12, a problem which the committee has encountered with other draft amendments. The NCPA argued that detailed designs of specific elements is more appropriately dealt with at the works approval stage. Nevertheless, the committee has difficulty in being asked to agree to an indicative plan which is less than precise in detail and subject to considerable changes in the later design and planning stages. The committee is aware that, at some future date, Northcott Drive may be linked to the proposed Majura Parkway, thereby creating a new northern gateway to Canberra and the national triangle. The committee has recommended that detailed design, planning and construction for the proposed redevelopment of Russell not preclude a wide range of development options should a new northern gateway to Canberra be for Defence. considered at a future time. Let me conclude by saying that the proposed changes for Russell are significant and long ranging. If the objectives of draft amendment No. 12 are achieved in the years to come, the people of Canberra and visitors to the parliamentary zone will be able to visit an area which reflects its important role in the fabric of the nation's capital. On behalf of thy committee, I would like to thank the individuals, community and professional groups and government agencies that have contributed to the committee's deliberations. My thanks go to all members of the committee and the secretariat, with special thanks in particular to Cheryl Samuels, who was the inquiry secretary. In evidence and looking through research, I found that the names of the parliamentary triangle were changed in 1928 by a certain Prime Minister. I suggest that, if we are doing Walter Burley Griffin's plan, we should go back to the original names, that is, Commonwealth Avenue, Federal Avenue and Capital Terrace. These names were quite good at the time when Burley Griffin made the plan. I think it would be a good thing in this year when we are looking at his plans to go back to those original names. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",18
12,Mr SMYTH,COMMITTEES,"Canberra) (1.08 p.m.)Incidentally, I have just received an invitation for Monday, 19 June to the opening of an exhibition at the National Library of Australia entitled 'An Ideal City-The 1912 competition to design Canberra' . It is obvious that winner of that competition was Walter Burley Griffin. The heart of Burley Griffin's plan for Canberra was the parliamentary triangle. The national triangle was to represent the 'symbol of democracy connecting the seat of national government and the executive with the national administrative centre and the local municipal centre'. Draft amendment No. 12 of the national capital plan approves the completion of the national triangle with the extension of Kings Avenue to finally connect with Constitution Avenue. Not only does it complete the national triangle visually; it also allows the government the opportunity to upgrade facilities for the Defence workers, both military and civil, who currently work in the Russell Offices. The committee was appalled at the occupational health and safety nightmare that currently exists in the Russell Offices, where plumbing, electrical wiring and other hazards combine to make areas of the Russell Offices an unsafe workplace. It will also allow better amenities, including retail, catering, childcare, banking and recreational facilities for Russell's many workers who are currently denied many of these services or who have to travel during their lunch breaks to carry out personal business. The report stresses the need for redevelopment not to dominate the surrounding landscape and to provide a better landscape in which to work. It also stresses the need to improve road, public transport, cycle and pedestrian access. The committee also recommends that pedestrian cycle routes linking Russell Offices with the Lake Burley Griffin foreshore be carried out. Surface parking will progressively be reduced by the construction of parking structures. Even though the national triangle will be completed visually, the committee wants to retain Sir Thomas Blamey Square as a ceremonial open space and as a people's gathering place. Sir Thomas Blamey Square was named in honour of Australia's only field marshal. It is also home to the AustralianAmerican Memorial and the Netherlands the Indies and Dutch Navy War Memorial, and is closely associated with Battle of the Coral Sea observances. As such, Blamey Square will be closed to motorised transport. Given that a new northern gateway for the national capital may enter through the apex, adequate planning of traffic flows will have to be undertaken. As the member for Canberra I welcome this development to the national capital as it will provide a much needed boost for the local building industry and offer employment opportunities for the people of my electorate. It will also give the people of Australia the national triangle that will finally complete Burley Griffin's plan. The committee has clearly recognised that, where roadworks are required on national land, the responsibility for cost lies with the Commonwealth government. In respect of other associated costs the Commonwealth government should be required to negotiate with the ACT government to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. I thank all those who contributed to the report, in particular the secretariat staff. This was the first report that I had to help out with. I commend the report to the House.",20
13,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"I begin by congratulating the chair, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), for his chairing of the committee and the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Smyth). This is his second speech-it may be more than his second but it is the first one I have heard-so I welcome him to the House. I would like to also thank the secretariat for their work on this report, which as usual was of a high quality. I support the chair in his comment about the renaming of Constitution Avenue and Kings Avenue to the names suggested by Walter Burley Griffin, Capital Terrace and Federal Avenue. They would seem to be very appropriate names for two of the three roads which outline the parliamentary triangle, the third of which is already Commonwealth Avenue. That is, of course, a suitable name. I would like to draw attention to three aspects of the report that were of some concern. One was that this proposal was being considered in the absence of detailed proposals for other major roads in the area and, in particular, for the gateway road which has been suggested from Majura Avenue through to the present Kings Avenue. It was very difficult for the committee to consider these proposals without taking account of what might happen in the future. Whilst one understands the difficulty the NCPA had in coming to us with road changes at a time when it was under pressure to approve new buildings for the defence department-new buildings which were certainly needed-it nevertheless was unsatisfactory to be considering these roads in the absence of the wider road plan. The committee has attempted to produce a report which recognised that uncertainty. But I would urge the NCPA to make plans in the future which take account of the broader issues as well as the very focused and narrow ones and bring them to the committee. Secondly, this plan drew attention to the fact that the location of the Defence Signals Directorate building had been decided without consideration of future road plans and that two other buildings had been identified for refurbishment which may have to be demolished to make way for new roads. That is adding to cost. The committee aims to minimise expenditure on both roads and buildings. That suggests there is a need for more integration of road planning with building planning. That too is an important recommendation the committee makes. The third· point is that there is a need for greater attention to be paid to public transport infrastructure, cycle paths and footpaths when making these plans.",20
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired.,21
15,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the paper. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA,21
16,Mr BRADFORD,FISH STOCKS,"I move: That this House: (1) urges the Government to address the problem of rapidly depleting fish stocks in our waterways and coastal waters; and (2) recognisinng the huge contribution of the commercial fishing sector to our primary industry and the significant contribution of recreational fishing to our tourism industry, calls on the Government urgently to assess the situation and explore ways of replenishing these stocks. Today is World Environment Day, so it is quite timely that this motion should be called on for debate. I am very pleased that it has been. I have had a long love affair with the ocean. I have travelled and surfed around most of Australia's coastline. I also have the honour of being a founding member of the national advisory board of the Surfrider Foundation. Australia has 37,000 kilometres of magnificently beautiful and diverse coastline. Our coastline is one of the symbols of our nation. Nine out of 10 Australians have chosen to live on the coast. In the last 15 years, however, there have been more than 60 reports and inquiries into coastal matters. Certainly in the last 12 years, with the federal Labor government there have been many reports and a commitment to all sorts of programs and initiatives, which in many respects characterise this government. The latest effort is Living on the coast, which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) brought in only last week. It is a beautiful document. It is glossy and has an enormous number of very attractive photographs in it. However, besides the cost of producing this document, its bottom line is that it leads to very little. Living on the coast is the government's response to the 1993 Resource Assessment Commission report on the coastal zOhe inquiry. Unfortunately, as I say, it is completely inadequate, as was the $53 million which the government announced in the budget for measures to improve management of the coastal zone. I suppose one could say that the $53 million is only a drop in the ocean. I believe that the federal government has once again failed to develop a coherent, comprehensive coastal policy. Senator Faulkner, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, admitted this only in December 1994: Australia doesn't have an agreed national strategy in respect of coastal management. I believe that there needs to be a comprehensive national approach. It is too important",21
17,Mr GEAR,FISH STOCKS,"What about states rights? . Mr BRADFORD-Let me come to that. It is too important to Australia to continue with the present fragmentation of management arrangements, the tyranny of small decisions and the bureaucratic buck-passing alluded to in this report, Living on the coast. My motion this afternoon concentrates on one small facet of this big picture of the management of Australia's coastal resources: the depletion of fish stocks. The state of the marine environment report, which was launched in February 1995, was really quite damning. It revealed the extent of the degradation of our oceans, estuaries and bays. For example, in New South Wales, about half-50 per cent-of seagrass beds have disappeared. Fisheries in more than one-fifth of New South Wales estuaries are threatened. The state of the world report by the World Watch Institute, released earlier this year, also revealed that fish stocks are being overfished at an alarming rate. Living on the coast makes the point that 'the cumulative effort of ever increasing activity and economic development has resulted in a growing burden on marine ecosystems and the fishing sector'. It is quite clear that the fishing industry is very important to Australia. It is important to our tourism industry because fishing is a substantial recreational activity, particularly in my electorate. Many people come to my electorate and spend a lot of their time fishing. Many coastal resorts rely to a very large extent on the people who fish to visit them and support their local economies. Fishing is also important to our national economy in a broader sense because it has the potential to earn millions more export dollars than it currently does. It also has the potential to create thousands of jobs. This afternoon I ask: why are we importing more than half of the fish products consumed domestically in this country? Why is it that with all of this coastline around us and more potential fishing grounds than any other country in the world we actually spend about half a billion dollars a year on importing fish? Honourable members may ask: what has this got to do with the price of fish? Let me address that issue. Fish has become more and more expensive over the last 40 years. There is no doubt that that is partly in response to health concerns, but it is also an obvious response to the shortage of fish stocks. My wife, who buys fish regularly, tells me that deep sea perch have for some time been around $14 a kilo; that snapper fillets are around $24 a kilo; that flathead is more than $12 a kilo; and that mullet, which we buy for the cat, is around $7 a kilo, which is more than the price of sausages. This compares with the cost of prime beef, which is only about $9Mr Chynoweth interjecting",22
18,Mr BRADFORD,FISH STOCKS,"We treat our cat very carefully. Prime beef costs only $9 a kilo, whereas fish can cost up to $25 a kilo. Shortages of fish stocks also contribute to international tensions in many parts of the world. This problem is urgent. Degradation of Australia's marine environment has reached a critical stage, and I believe it· must be solved at any cost. Australia should be a major player in the $100 billion per annum fishing industry. Certainly, some progress has been made in this country with aquaculture, but the real potential seems to be with farming fish in the wild. In other words, the waters that surround this country still seem to have enormous potential. I want to say a bit about marine researcher John Fairfax, who happens to be a constituent of mine. To his credit he has spent many hours in my office over the last five years telling me about this problem. He is largely self-taught, but I believe he has a lifetime of experience which gives him some authority with which to speak on these matters. His perhaps controversial suggestions on the need to use sewage as a nutrient source in the ocean have, however, been accepted by a number of scientists both at the CSIRO and elsewhere. Mr Fairfax has attributed recent mass attitude pilchard deaths around the coast as a natural response to the destruction of seabed grass, which I referred earlier. He has also called the construction of artificial reefs in south-east Queensland, particularly in the Gold Coast that fact. Broadwater. The Gold Coast Broadwater is a very popular recreational fishing spot, but rather than being a pastime on the Broadwater fishing is a complete waste of time. Anyone that used to fish there now realises that it hardly worth fishing there at all. Mr Fairfax has also called for the banning of the use of anchors in seagrass areas banning of jet skis in some areas. I certainly support that call. I think jet skis are out control in many parts of Australia, particularly in Broadwater on the Gold Coast, which is my electorate. They need to be banned in areas where they are creating turbidity and obviously affecting the light, which in tum has the effect of further degrading seagrass areas. I have raised a lot of the issues in the short time available to me. Hopefully, this debate can focus attention on these important matters and highlight the importance of comprehenmember sive rather than piecemeal solutions. where I began: I am very disappointed in the government's response to this issue through its latest report, Living on the coast. which is quite inadequate in addressing the real issues, some of which I have touched on today. It looks good-it has lots of very nice pictures-but when you actually read through it, it is inadequate. The minister at the table-the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear)-interjected earlier, 'What about states rights?' This issue is too important for that to be a constraining factor; there needs to be a national response.",22
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISH STOCKS,Mr Rocher)Is the motion seconded?,23
20,Mr SNOW,FISH STOCKS,"I second the motion of the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). Although I would have worded the motion differently-where he says 'urges' I would have said 'congratulates'-I compliment the honourable member on his motion and think it worthy of some support. I admire the honourable member's healthy to the difficult matter of states focusing on the needs of our community, particuto larly the future of our resources. He is rightfor I suspect he is a closet supporter of mineabout some of those issues, and I welcome I ask the honourable member: which federal government has, in the past, focused on these important coastal issues? I do not know of any previous government that has been is prepared to look at state policies and local government development policies and tried to bring them together. This is the first time. I and the have known it to happen. While we may legitimately say that not enough is being of done, we could also legitimately say that for the first time something is being done· and in that it is an extremely important beginning. There are problems. The honourable memare ber mentioned his wife going shopping and having problems getting Australian products. It should be pointed out that while Australia is the third largest fishing zone in the world, we are ranked only 15th in world production because our waters lack nutrient rich currents and have low productivity. That brings me to a very important point that the honourable made: we should be doing a lot more I finish about fish farming. There has been so much damage to habitat along the coast and inland and so much overfishing that urgent action is required to bring about a return to greater productivity at more sustainable levels. The honourable member has come up with a very important answer to that-fish farming. During 1995-96 the government is cooperating with the states and territories to develop a national fish care program to protect fish resources and habitats. It will involve a lot of work. We have had pretty good support from recreational fishers, which has been very welcomed because they will be able to help government to improve community awareness and educate people about how fish habitats are affected by fishing activities, both commercial and recreational, and by commercial, industrial and residential land use practices. That should underpin programs to improve management of our natural resource base. I must compliment the New South Wales Minister for Fisheries, Bob Martin, for taking a pretty healthy attitude to recreational fishsea. ing. Of course, there are commercial fishers who feel· that protection for recreational fishers is hurting their businesses. But just as we talk about plantations in the forest indusRiver try, we can talk about fish farming in fishing industry and eventually come up a solution to overcome the problems faced by that industry. Sometimes we do not think ahead. Sometimes people in the commercial fishing industry are sent broke or into other businesses before we come up with alternathe tives and solutions. There is great work going on in this area in North Queensland and Launceston, Tasmania. There is also very good work being done on fisheries management and fish farming. That is something that needs to be done. When was in Taiwan and China recently a lot of interest expressed about buying live fish from Australia. In Australia we ought to be doing a lot more about fish farming. The fish care program that is· being develwider oped in Australia should generate information and understanding within the community regarding the protection, enhancement and, where necessary, the rehabilitation of water and marine habitats and fisheries. The program should empower the community to make decisions and initiate action to redress some of the problems that have been identiby fied. We need to compliment the many rehabilitation government and industry programs that aim to raise community awareness, reconstruct habitats, provide employment, encourage ensuring participation by the community, undertake research and implement management arrangecesses ments. It can be used to encourage integrated approaches to natural resources management and nature conservation. A broad range of existing natural resource management and nature conservation type programs offer guidance for developing and implementing an effective fish care program. One such program is the national landcare program. It is very interesting that, with the recent drought, quite a number of people who have had businesses for many years farming oysters and abalone have been harmed because of the lack of nutrient coming into the This is due to the effects of the drought. We find that the landcare program is vital not only for the land but also for our oceans. The water watch program, a program of the Management Authority in Victoria, the the total catchment management program in New with South Wales and the ocean rescue 2000 program are all very important to the industry. Also of importance is a research conference that I am convening later this year. This will bring people from around Australia to discuss issues of sewage disposal and water waste management. Those issues are very important to our oceans and our fish. The purpose of the national fish care program is t6 provide the guidance and strategies for national planning, coordinated actions and community participation to assistjn rebuilding I Australia's fisheries to more productive and there was sustainable levels. The key objectives of the fish care program should be mentioned. We need to develop an awareness among all resource users and the community of the important fisheries issues, the contributors to the fisheries problems and the actions that are needed to remedy them. We need to develop empowerfreshment through a sense of ownership and responsibility among all the user groups for the sustainable use of the resource. We need to have community participation, particularly the direct users of fisheries resources in and other fish care activities. We need to have sustainable resource use by fisheries groups and upstream groups by that the impact on fish resources and habitats are considered in their actions, proand plans. We also need to have fishery management strategies and habitat consideration integrated into upstream processes and activities and programs which impact on fish habitats and the recreational resource. I compliment the honourable member for MCPherson for mentioning aquaculture. It has the potential to add significantly to fish supplies and it is an avenue for replenishing some depleted fish stocks, especially freshwater species. The federal and state governments are actively encouraging the development of the aquaculture industry-a sector which is growing strongly and is showing great potential to be a major contributor to the overall value of the fishing industry. In the 1995-96 budget the government has given a high priority to coastal zone management, wetlands conservation and management and the protection of fish resources and habitats. The government has allocated $53 million over the next four years towards cooperative and sustainable management of Australia's coastline. That funding will complement the Commonwealth coastal policy. It will focus on increasing support for community participation and local government participation in coastal management, including community action in fish habitat rehabilitation. It is also designed to increase the ty and knowledge of coastal managers and develop integrated solutions to problems such as pollution. Funding of $5 million has been set aside for the next four years to conserve and manage our wetlands. The government has also agreed to fund up to $500,000 to develop the national fish care program. This program is being undertaken in cooperation with the states and territories to complement the fisheries management arrangements in our commercial and recreational fisheries. It cannot be overemphasised that our waters are lacking in nutrient rich currents and thus have low productivity. As we seek to boost production, we must ensure that we move into other avenues and other possibilities for fishing. (Time expired)",23
21,Mr NEVILLE,FISH STOCKS,"The report entitled The state of the marine environment was released by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, on 13 February this year. The report addressed a number of matters, including changes in catchment uses, increases in sediment and nutrient run-off, coastal strip development and the loss of inshore habitats, dieback of seagrass, threat to the Great Barrier Reef caused by shipping and port discharges, effects on tourism and the overfishing of some stocks. The link between the report and recreational and commercial fishing reality is 1,000 miles apart and has a long way to go. I do not necessarily agree with my colleagues that these measures have to be carried out by the Commonwealth; I think they can be achieved by the Commonwealth putting the appropriate funding into the state bodies and taking an overview at the educational level. Fishing statistics are sparse, but in 1985-86 Griffith University carried out a study, from which I combined the figures from my electorate and that of my colleague at the table, the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), covering the Wide Bay and the Fitzroy regions. Between them these two regions had 458 primary commercial fishing vessels-about 21 per cent of the state fishing fleet of 2,200 vessels-and they provided direct employcapaciment for 2,160 fishermen. They generated $47.2 million in product, with a retail value of $94 million, and stimulated a further $47 million in indirect economic activity in the Queensland economy. They also produced over 50 per cent of the open-sea prawn and scallop fishing along that area of the coastline. The effects on the economy of places such as Bundaberg and Gladstone in my electorate are quite profound. Therefore, anything that is done in an environmental sense must be balanced against the commercial reality. Many of the firms in my area now export to Asia. A typical example of this is Mandarin Trawlers at Burnett Heads. This company began operations in late 1994 at Burnett Heads. I was present at the opening. It is a $2 million facility employing over 75 people. It will play a major role in domestic and export marketing. The general manager of the firm, Tony Mills, expects a huge boost to exports in the coming months. We have to accept that side of the equation and balance it with the environmental side. The state government earlier responded with the Bums inquiry. In July 1993 we had the report of the Recreational Fishing Consultative Committee in response to the Bums report. This report was presented to cabinet. It dealt with such matters as size, bag limits, area quotas, commercial catch quotas, and beam trawler bans. To a certain extent the worse fears of the commercial sector were realised. The report led to a great outcry. The state government responded with a number of measures. The government established a new fisheries policy council. It introduced a new Fisheries Act 1994, which became effective early this year. The government restructured the Queensland Fisheries Management Authority to provide for six expert management advisory committees on various types of fishing. The government also talked about a new form of zonal area committee to advise on fishery management in particular areas. In today's Courier-Mail we see the announcement of the appointment of a committee for my area and the Wide Bay area under the chairmanship of Bill Brennan of Hervey Bay. I am pleased to say that Geoff Campbell, Ivan Rasmussen and Steve Skippen from Bundaberg will be representatives on the committee. In talking to the recreational fishermen, one thing they ask for is a greater emphasis on education at the Commonwealth level. Attitude is all important. When children are taught how to fish, they have to be taught fishing ethics. Similarly, they want to see research into such things as fish ladders, nutrient run-offs, locks and lifts in river systems, and the scouring of rivers which have not had any great volumes of water through them because of the recent drought. If the Commonwealth started to address some of those matters and left the management to the states, the best of both worlds could be achieved. MrADAMS (Lyons) (1.41 p.m.)-Fishing is a great Australian pastime, and one that I partake in occasionally. Whether it is sport or part of one's livelihood, it is seen as one of our traditional activities. The boy with the bent pin and the worm must be seen as a universal recreation in many cultures and can easily be identified with by all of us. It is also a very valuable resource economically. According to the CSIRO estimates, the marine resources are worth around $17 billion per year, the commercial fishing production is worth around $1.3 billion each year and recreational fishers spend $2 billion each year on their own activities. To sustain an industry as varied and important as this, we must have good and careful management that extends over national boundaries, whether by regulation or by education. This government has recognised that there have been problems with the management of our fish resources and has taken the appropriate steps. One of the big problems facing Australia as a nation is a lack of knowledge of many of our fish stocks. It is very expensive to research in the ocean. Although there are cooperative programs with the French and the Russians in some areas, Australia is still left with a lot of water to cover. The Commonwealth already provides around $8.5 million per year to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, which funds fisheries research Australia-wide. The government also provides around $12 million per year to the Division of Fisheries of the CSIRO. This helps to support species the specific research, equipment and fishing techniques. It also plays a role in monitoring our resources, water sampling and fish assessment. On top of this, as part of the 1995-96 budget, the government has been responding to some of the findings of the 1991 report on recreational fishing. Recommendations included management of recreational fisheries as part of the total fishery resource and· a development of a conservation ethic among fishing people to care for their resource. We should educate our young on the ethics of fishing. The government has accorded a high priority to coastal zone management, wetlands conservation and management, and the protection of fish resources and habitats. So important is this aspect· of the industry that $53 million will be spent over the next four years towards a cooperative and sustainable management of Australia's coastline. This will complement the coastal policy already in place. It will also provide support for local government participation in coastal management, including community action in fish habitat rehabilitation. It will also help deal with the problems of pollution. A particularly good wetlands project has just been finished in New Norfolk, a country town north of Hobart in my electorate. They have used a series of conjoined ponds to filter sewage through the wetlands and special species of plants to allow it to flow into the river as a pure form. It is very successful and is also a remarkable tourist spot. The platypus are coming back to the area and the bird life is plentiful. It has a walk around the ponds that is attractive and has been well used by locals and tourists alike. It was a simple solution to a difficult problem,assisted by the Commonwealth wetlands Rroject, which allowed local government to be innovative and exploratory in its problem solving. There is also a national fish care program to protect fish resources and habitat. The government has put $500,000 to develop this program and will complement sound fisheries management arrangements being implemented in commercial and recreational fisheries. It will also be important for addressing issues of a number of current policy documents, including the national policy on recreational fishing and the state of the maritime environment report. There are some excellent government policies and programs in place and, yes, if industry does have a specific problem, the government is open and will listen to their problems to make decisions to assist them.",25
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISH STOCKS,"Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Mon:"" day. NA",27
23,Mr CHYNOWETH,PORT PIDLLIP BAY,"I move: That this House notes the· importance of Port Phillip Bay to Victoria and Australia and therefore urges all levels of government to cooperate in reducing the pollution inflow into Port Phillip Bay. Some time ago, the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) and I decided to raise the issue of Port Phillip Bay, and much has happened in relation to that bay since then. It is very timely that we should be discussing this motion on World Environment Day. I do not know whether the last group of speakers realised that today is World Environment Day. Mr Truss-Yes, they commented on it.",27
24,Mr CHYNOWETH,PORT PIDLLIP BAY,"Did they? The last motion was in relation to fishing, and in some way this is too because of the effect of pollution on our beautiful Port Phillip Bay. I believe about 60 per cent of the world is covered by oceans, so it is appropriate that we discuss not only oceans but the bays that feed into the oceans and the rivers and drains that feed into the bays. Some time ago Mr Glen Agnew,· a CSIRO researcher, invited the member for Isaacs and me to look at the bottom of the bay just down from the Mordialloc Creek. I was surprised when I saw the amount of sludge that covered the bottom of the bay. It was not very healthy at all, I can assure you. This is because of some pollutants that feed into the bay. Quite an amazing variety of pollutants are fed into the bay every year. One pollutant that people are not aware of comes through the atmosphere from cars. Over 1,000 tonnes of nitrogen and 31 tonnes of lead every year are deposited into Port Phillip Bay. That adds to the thousands of tonnes of litter that come from our drains and creeks. The other great polluter that affects the bay is ballast water from ships. Port Phillip Bay is now just about able to cope with all this pollution and these inputs but, with the pressures coming from all directions on the bay, it must be the responsibility of local, state and federal governments to combine to save our bay. One of the reasons Melbourne's waste water from drains and sewers is putting more rubbish into the bay is the heavier rainfall occurring due to storms. The frequency of storms could be increasing because of the greenhouse effect. In the last 18 months, the backyard of my house in Frankston has been flooded twice because drains four or five blocks up from me overflowed. I think this is happening all over Victoria, and I believe it is because of the greenhouse effect. Naturally, this is causing more rubbish to get into the bay. It is also causing the bay to rise, which is quite an interesting fact. Port Phillip Bay has risen about three millimetres a year over the past decade, which is quite a significant amount. Rainfall has increased, and the CSIRO has estimated that Melbourne will have an increase in rainfall of 20 to 30 per cent by the year 2030, caused by summer storms and the like. It is quite a large increase, and it all affects the bay. It is up to all of us to alleviate this problem, but in one area in particular the state government can rectify the amount of rubbish that goes into the bay. I would like the state government to make sumps to catch all the sediment and waste, and to improve Melbourne's sewerage system. A large percentage of Melbourne's sewerage system was built over 100 years ago, and it is now starting to break down. I must also compliment the unions. Back in the 1960s when the Carrum sewerage plant was being built the Liberal government at the time wanted to pump all the sewage down the Paterson River. The unions refused to allow this to happen, and the outlet went to Cape Schanck. I know that water is being wasted and that it should be reused, but imagine what would have happened with 30 years of sewage being pumped into Port Phillip Bay. Councils should also assist by placing litter traps at the input points, in the streets and drains. These litter traps could be pumped out or suction cleaned quite regularly. The federal government could assist these projects with special grants, and it should also support trials of Sirofloc, a product of the CSIRO which could be developed to treat sewage and stormwater. Housing estates should be redesigned so that the water from those estates, from washing machines, baths and showers, can be re-used. The estates could be designed with built in re-charge wells whe,e all the stormwater could go. These wells could be underneath a park or something like that and the water could be pumped out and used again. The responsibility for urban stormwater in Melbourne· is shared between local and state governments, through Melbourne Water. The state Liberal government is about to sell off Melbourne Water and, with the pressure being put on our locally appointed commissioners of local councils, I can foresee that stormwater drains will be neglected. Around 50 per cent of the pollution in our water waste is from urban run-off. Let us look at what is happening as a result of pollution around our bay. There has been a major decline in almost every species of fish. Commercial figures, comparing 1974 with 1990, show that flathead has declined from 70 tonnes to 25 tonnes a year; snapper, from 200 tonnes to 120 tonnes; salmon, from 120 to 25 tonnes; calamari, from 50 to 20 tonnes; anchovies, from 200 tonnes to commercial extinction; and barracuda, from 175 tonnes also to commercial extinction. The Elwood Fishing Club has stated that snapper fishing last year was the worse in 25 yearsonly 40 were caught in the last 10 months. Maybe we should not allow fishing while the snapper are spawning. I have a couple of suggestions to assist in making sure fishing stocks are conserved. There could be a licence fee for all who fish in Port Phillip Bay of around $30 to $50 per annum, with the money going into a Port Phillip Bay trust fund and· to be used for research, breeding and anti-pollution measures and to buyout the scallop boat licences. Anglers, boat owners, et cetera, would be represented on the trust, and the money collected would not go into consolidated revenue. Fish taken by commercial fishermen must be for human consumption only. At the moment tonnes of pilchards, an important link in the food chain, are being used for pet food. A recent EPA report suggested that 150,000 recreational fishermen use the bay each year and spend around $291 million on equipment. I recall walking along the beach at Seaford some years ago when there was a moratorium on scallop fishing. It was just after a period of wild weather, and there were small scallop shells washed up on the beach. It was some time since I had seen that sort of thing, and it showed me that the bay can recover quite well. I also take this opportunity to congratulate one of our TV notables, Rex Hunt. He has taken a great stand on Port Phillip Bay. He is a local Mordialloc person and he has done his utmost to promote and preserve the bay. He deserves congratulations. I would also like to mention the ballast water that comes from ships and has great ramifications for the bay. At the moment there is an infestation of an introduced fan worm spreading from Geelong. This worm occurs in the bay at densities of about 100 per square metre. This number is capable of removing a lot of the food which would have been eaten by the native filter feeders. Consequent changes to the food chain may decrease the bay's ability to absorb excess nitrogen and could lead to ari increase in the frequency and severity of algal blooms in the bay. Guidelines for ballast water must be established. The water should be exchanged at sea or the ballast water heated to kill any organisms in the water. These rules should be enforced by the marine authorities. Local, state and federal governments can play and must play an important part in protecting Port Phillip Bay. I suggest that a trust fund be established. This could also be part of a Port Phillip Bay authority with all stakeholders having a say. Such a body would look after this asset better than we have done so far.",27
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PORT PIDLLIP BAY,Is the motion seconded?,29
26,Mr ATKINSON,PORT PIDLLIP BAY,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I congratulate the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) on this motion and I was delighted to second it. We have abutting electorates and obviously a common interest in the Port Phillip Bay area, which is of great importance. It highlights one of the problems that we not only have in that area but also worldwide. The only reason that in some areas the significance of pollution going into the oceans is not seen is that they are not as confined as Port Phillip Bay; We can see in closer proximity what can occur when things go wrong. In congratulating the honourable member for Dunkley, I would also like to congratulate Glen Agnew, the research diver who has done a lot of work in the Mordialloc area in looking at pollutants and the effects that they have on the base of Port Phillip Bay. I did not actually dive onto the reef, as did the honourable member for Dunkley with some of our state colleagues. But I certainly looked at some of those areas. I looked at the Mordialloc Creek region and some of those important areas for flow of water and pollutants and recognised many of the difficulties that exist there. One of the areas of great concern with the particular area that was dived on was a reef where there was an amount of heavy black sludge or mud. There was no seaweed growing on that area. Dr Robinson from the EPA indicated that it was concerned about the seaweed having been killed off but it was not exactly sure where it came from. That is one of the problems that we are faced with in these waterways. In fact, the flow-off from sealed areas into drains and down into Port Phillip Bay is of major concern and must be of concern to all levels of government. I am encouraged by some of the things that I am seeing. On 17 September 1994 the Victorian Minister for Conservation and Environment, Mr Birrell, actually released the target litter study where some 1,300 tagged items of rubbish were put into 30 locations from Dandenong around to Geelong to see what occurred and what the effect was. They removed 600 of those items from rivers, creeks and the bayside beaches that had actually worked their way through the water systems and into the bay. One of the things that were important to note was that most of that rubbish had got into the drain system in the south-eastern beach suburbs. That is of major concern. I agree with the honourable member for Dunkley when he said that maybe we need to look at systems on the drains to stop, in particular, plastic containers. There are a number of those containers that go through the drains from the beaches. There is no means of getting them through silk traps and sieves simply because they float on the surface of the water. They tend to go right through the drain system and out into the ocean. Of course, many people do not think about those things in the process. In some ways it is a little sad, but I suppose it is important that the need for the initiative of a beach watch service has been acknowledged. That service was launched on 5 December 1993 with a telephone number for people to ring in order to find out whether their beach was safe for swimming. That people need to do that is a reflection of one of the problems we are facing in Port Phillip Bay. It would be nice to be able to avoid doing it, but obviously that is not something we can avoid doing at the moment. There are initiatives that are being handled and this is one that obviously provides people with safety in that area. In the middle of last year the state government looked at some major changes to the flow of water into the Mordialloc Creek that then flows through into Port Phillip Bay. It has eliminated the flow of 33 million litres of effluent into the Mordialloc Creek each dayan incredible amount of liquid to be flowing through from the Dandenong south treatment plant. As I say, that process has been changed and, hopefully, it will assist in the process. Money has been allocated for, and I know the CSIRO has been doing a considerable amount of work on, studies on the ecoculture that exists in the bay. In some of those areas there are indications that with some aspects a rectifying process is occurring. A lot more study needs to be done. I am concerned about the particular areas of the bay and the reefs close in-where there used to be seaweed and currently there is not-that those areas are not being dealt with in the broader context of the ecostructure and how those things are to be sorted out. One ongoing study is looking at collecting· information from 42 different sites around bay. With the way that study is working, it halfway through. I hope that the CSIRO able to maintain that study and that the drains. funding continues. Port Phillip Bay will gain from it and the lessons learnt will be able to be applied to other waterways in other areas. There are a number of things we must do. Looking at areas where the federal government can contribute, obviously the area of financial assistance for research is one that will need to continue. Some 12 months ago I was disturbed to find that a lot of aircraft were being washed on the tarmac of the Moorabbin airport. The Director of the EPA, Dr Robinson, indicated at that stage it had concerns about the run-off from the washing of aircraft flowing into the drainage systems of Mordialloc Creek but was unable to do anything about it. Subsequently, I discussed the matter with David Stack, the airport manager, who sent out a memo to the aircraft operators. But they are not there 24 hours a day to police that run-off. If personnel are washing aircraft on the grass, that is not so bad. But when aircraft are being washed on the tarmac, the run-off flows into the drainage systems and goes straight into the Mordialloc Creek-and it was having an effect. One of the things that I think is worth looking at from a federal point of view is to allow EPA some types of controls over the emissions from federally owned sites. If a site is controlled by the FAC, the state authority has no jurisdiction over it. Frankly, that is an absurdity-there should be jurisdiction over it and compliance with the EPA should be a requirement for operations on federal sites. In short, a number of areas have been mentioned by the member for Dunkley. He referred to the process of collection of foreign matter and the discharge points, and they need to be addressed. I made the point that local government at the moment is busy with its readjustment of boundaries, which will probably take it away from the types of issues we are addressing at the moment. We need to persevere with this problem. It is not just something that should be looked at only on W orId Environment Day-which the today is. We need to persevere and ensure is that local governments in that area look at is means to stop effluent going down their A lot of people use their hoses to wash off their driveways into the drains in front of their houses. I am reminded of an article I read which stated that some 33,000 tonnes dog droppings are estimated to go into the bay each year as a result of people washing off their streets. The nature strip is littered with it. People wash it down the drain and not think of the consequences or of where is going. Also a problem is the number of people who have connected storm water sewerage systems or vice versa, which causes a flow-over effect with heavy rain. All these are issues that need to be addressed. Whilst this is not an issue that takes the high profile in our community that many issues do, it is one we need to continually apply pressure over. I am pleased to see we have been able to do it across party lines because, frankly, it is a bigger issue than individual political parties. It is one we Australians should be addressing. I am pleased to contribute to the debate as an Australian in the context of an overall parliaharbour mentary motion today.",29
27,Mr OCONNOR,PORT PIDLLIP BAY,"I through congratulate the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) on the. motion moved by him, which is currently before the House. He has always displayed a passion for environmental issues and his concern long-term future of Port Phillip Bay is well known in his own electorate, in Victoria in this House. I also pay tribute to the bution of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), who suggested that this is issue that does transcend the political bounbay. daries that often divide us. Corio Bay in my electorate is an important part of the Victorian coastline. Its future and health in an environmental sense is inextriI cably linked to the health of Port Phillip Bay. I am pleased to rise in the House to speak this debate. Corio Bay is to Geelong and its hinterland what Port Phillip Bay is to Melbourne and rest of Victoria. The city and its industrial hinterland are built around Corio Bay. It important recreational resource for a range of water sports-fishing, yachting, canoeing, motor sports and, of course, swimproposals ming. The bay and its land based recreational activities are very important to the citizens of of the City of Greater Geelong and the region. The bay is also a commercial gateway to the rest of the world. The port of Geelong is one of Australia's premier bulk handling do ports. Indeed, Corio Bay and its sweeping it natural beauty sets Geelong in a unique position as Victoria's second largest city. Of into course, the problems alluded to here by previous speakers of environmental pollution of in Port Phillip Bay are issues dear to our hearts in Geelong. The draft report by the EPA on protection of Port Phillip Bay identified some problems which have already been alluded to by previthat ous speakers. The storm water run-off from residential and industrial areas presents a real problem in containing environmental pollution as in Port Phillip Bay. The honourable member for Dunkley mentioned the problems we have with litter and waste, and fuel from port and activities. The report also identified that the introduction of foreign organisms the discharge of ships' ballast water is a significant problem in Port Phillip Bay-a problem we certainly face in Geelong and in Corio Bay. In a sense, Corio Bay is under similar for the environmental pressure from competing commercial and recreational uses. Industry and has grown up on the shores of the bay, contripresenting real environmental management problems. Geelong's petrochemical and an aluminium production is all located on the Of course, there are strict environmental standards applied to the discharge of waste from those industries. We do face a similar problem of water pollution from run-off from the residential areas close in around the bay. mentioned before the problem from the discharge of ballast water from foreign vessels in which visit our ports on a regular basis. There are future environmental potential dangers from developments in the Corio Bay the and Port Phillip Bay areas. I mention here that the Coode Island relocation to Point is an Lillias does pose some really substantial wide environmental challenges in managing Victoria's chemical industry waste. The recent to dredge the port channel have the potential to stir heavy metals on the floor of the bay. We have to exercise some care in the management of the sludge waste from that process. The solutions lie in the important role local government plays in the planning and management of developments on the shores of the bay. I request the Kennett government not to sell the port of Geelong and to leave the Port of Geelong Authority in place. It is a significant manager of land in the bay area. We· need a public awareness campaign in· the Geelong area to increase the knowledge of citizens in the area of this particular problem. Substantial and vigilant monitoring on a continuing basis needs to be undertaken. (Time expired)",31
28,Mr MCARTHUR,PORT PIDLLIP BAY,"The even-handed nature of this debate could have been influenced unduly by a report by Environment Victoria entitled Toxic sewers. I draw to the attention of the House that Environment Victoria, in my view, has a very poor track record in producing scientific evidence in the forestry area. Most of its observations about the 1,300 coupes that the federal government wanted to re-evaluate were disproved. Environment Victoria, whose funding background and status is of a questionable nature, produced some sensational arguments on those coupes. Again, in its headline seeking a report into toxic sewers, Environment Victoria does not relate to the facts of the comparatively good state of Corio Bay. I agree with other speakers that Corio Bay and Port Phillip Bay are in amazingly good shape, given the background of potential pollution from urban areas and ships that move through those bays. To date, the $12 million study, which has been undertaken but not yet fully reported, gives a remarkably clean bill of health to the whole of Port Phillip Bay. The Port Phillip Bay environmental study was conducted by the CSIRO, a federal instrumentality. Partners in the study were Melbourne water, a Victorian instrumentality, and the EPA, the policeman of environmental problems of Victoria from the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. So we do see very helpful cooperation between the three governments. The studies coordinator, Dr Brian Newell, said the major objective of the project was to determine how the bay responds to the inputs of nutrients and toxins and how these inputs can be monitored and controlled. I am very pleased that at least there is some intelligent evaluation of this seemingly public problem of how we might keep the bay clean for individual Australians and Victorians to use and for industrial purposes. The stormwater collection-plastic run-off coming from the urban areas after storms, which other speakers have alluded to-that moves down the drains and into the bay is a problem that these authorities are looking at very carefully. The EPA, as I say, reports to date that the bay, for all its problems of heavy metals and sewage outfall that we know about, is in pretty good condition. One of the difficulties we have identified is the problem of foreign ships bringing ballast water into the bay, unloading that ballast water and bringing in some foreign organisms. I understand that feather worms are now evident in Port Phillip Bay. They eat the plankton, which upsets the balance of the marine environment. The marine laboratories at Queenscliff have done some good work in trying to evaluate this difficulty. The sewage outflows, which the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) has referred to, that move out to Cape Schanck obviously work quite well. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and I are on the Werribee side of Port Phillip Bay. The Werribee sewage farm operates very effectively, having been established in 1894, with an irrigation program and lagooning of the sewage waste from Melbourne. That rather older process is still very effective-19,000 acres in a 21-inch rainfall provides the scope and the capacity to deal with that sewage outfall. Yet the material that moves into Corio Bay and Port Phillip Bay generally is of a very high quality, so much so that I understand it would cost half a billion dollars to replace that particular older instrumentality that works very well. I commend the federal government, through the CSIRO, for continuing its $12 million study to bring about a more sensible solution that will encourage the public, the politicians and the instrumentalities to maintain a cleaner Port Phillip Bay for the people to use, and for industries to understand that we cannot allow heavy metals and other material to pollute a bay that supports three million people in the city of Melbourne and surrounding areas.",32

30,Mr FILING,THE SUNKEN HMAS SYDNEY,"I move: That this House calls on the Government to: (1) consider supporting any move to locate the sunken vessel HMAS Sydney; (2) accept that, regardless of the outcome, surviving family members of those who lost their lives on HMAS Sydney are owed consideration of a full-scale public search for the vessel; (3) support public efforts to raise money to assist in locating the wreck; (4) fund and coordinate a suitable commemorative service for those who lost their lives on HMAS Sydney should the vessel be located; (5) erect a suitable memorial in Canberra to commemorate the loss of HMAS Sydney in accordance with the wishes of surviving family members; (6) ensure the exact coordinates of the sunken HMAS Sydney are not disclosed to the general public; (7) establish an Act of Parliament which protects the wreck from being dived upon other than for purposes of official identification and provide substantial penalties for transgressions of the Act; and (8) once the Act is established, embark on an extensive advertising campaign to make the public aware that diving on HMAS Sydney is a criminal offence and the penalties applicable. I have moved this motion because I believe that the sailors who lost their lives in the tragic sinking of the HMAS Sydney during World War II, and their families, are owed a concerted search to find the final resting place of this vessel. In proposing this motion, which calls for a commitment by the government, I am conscious that there are several opposing schools of thought about both what happened to cause the HMAS Sydney to sink in 1941 and how the government conducted subsequent investigations into the circumstances of the sinking. There have been suggestions by some people that there has been a concerted conspiracy to cover up the true circumstances of the sinking. Others feel the whereabouts of the vessel should remain a secret forever. With this in mind, the motion before us aims to give Commonwealth support to community efforts to find the sunken HMAS Sydney and also to conduct appropriate commemorations to ensure that the tragedy of the sinking is never lost from the memory of the Australian people. In recent years there have been increased calls for a search for the HMAS Sydney. Some groups, such as the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust, which has been set up by a constituent of mine, Mr Wayne Born of Merriwa, have put in enormous amounts of time and effort searching for the possible whereabouts of the shipwreck of the HMAS Sydney. Mr Born has held a number of meetings and has contacted members of parliament from both sides of the House and the Senate, and of state parliaments, in an effort to call for a commitment for a thorough search for the remains of the HMAS Sydney. Today's motion is a follow-up on the efforts of Mr Born, his committee and others. I must say at the outset that the assistance of the HMAS Sydney Association will be very helpful to any further undertakings to find the whereabouts of the ship. In explanation, in the short time available I would like to background the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the Sydney as we know them now. This year is the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.. But, four years before the war ended, the light cruiser HMAS Sydney was involved in a bitter engagement with the German raider Kormoran. The engagement occurred on 19 November 1941. As I have indicated, there are varying reports about what actually happened on that fateful day. We are told that just before 4 p.m. on that day the Sydney was spotted by the German cruiser Kormoran. The Kormoran tried to outrun the Australian ship, but a broken piston rod made this impossible. The Sydney moved to intercept the German vessel and flashed a signal to the ship for it to show its letters as they approached on a convergent course. The Kormoran, with its guns hidden, masqueraded as an innocent merchant ship for as long as possible. She flashed her call sign as that of a Dutch freighter, the Straat Malakka, as the Sydney closed the gap between the two vessels. Once the ships were parallel and fairly close to other, about 1,500 metres apart, the Sydney flashed the order 'Show your secret sign'. It was then that the Kormoran hoisted the German ensign and opened fire on the Sydney. Two ranging shots pitched short and over respectively, but then a full salvo hit, smashing into the bridge structure and direct tower of the Sydney. The Kormoran then fired two torpedos and her anti-aircraft guns amidships. The Sydney replied with a salvo from her sixinch guns which tore over the Kormoran. More fire from the Kormoran knocked out the forward turrets of the Sydney, hitting the onboard aircraft and bringing aviation fuel over the deck. The firing continued back and forth until both ships were ablaze and wrecked. The Sydney was last seen about 10 miles from the sinking Kormoran just before 10.00 p.m. She was well ablaze and limping into the night. None of the 645 officers and men survived this encounter. Of the crew of the Kormoran, 78 died and the remainder of her 393 crew were eventually captured and imprisoned in Australia and later repatriated. The sinking of the Sydney remains Australia's worse naval tragedy to this day. Relatives of the dead servicemen still wonder where their loved ones are buried at sea. Before the fateful Kormoran battle, the Sydney had been no stranger to combat. In fact, she had taken continued attack from the air as well as having her share of battle successes. On 26 June 1941, for instance, the Sydney engaged the 1,073 tonne Espero in the eastern Mediterranean and sank the ship, scoring a devastating broadside and eventually finishing off the ship and taking on board a large number of Italian survivors. Michael Montgomery, in his book Who sank the Sydney?, wrote: During the next week the Sydney was continuously attacked from the air, enduring no less than twenty-five raids in the space of a single day and exhausting her entire stock of anti-aircraft ammunition. There followed a chequered and busy involvement of the Sydney in the Mediterranean and then later in the Indian Ocean. It is fair to say each that the HMAS Sydney saw a great deal of action. The men aboard her must have run the entire gamut of emotions during this timefrom fear and anger to elation and regret. They were brave Australians who made a magnificent contribution to the war effort. Australians everywhere should be reminded of their efforts. What happened on the day the Sydney met her fate has been the subject of many books and articles. It has been the subject of inquiries and yet, even after all that, much of what has happened is still largely a mystery. There are stories, for example, that the Australian sailors were fired upon in the water by the Germans aboard the Kormoran. If this were true, it would constitute a war crime of the gravest order. Likewise, there have been persistent rumours-outlined in Montgomery's Who sank the Sydney? and largely debunked in other works, including HMAS Sydney: loss and controversy by Tom Frame-that a Japanese midget submarine was involved in the sinking. The point about these views is that, in the absence of the remains of the vessels, they do remain speculative. Many of the events surrounding the sinking have been put together from the memories of surviving German mariners and from conjecture connected with the discovery of some insubstantial flotsam from the HMAS Sydney. In any reasonable examination, it would appear that these resources are simply not sufficient to once and for all detail exactly what happened on that day in November off the Western Australian coast. If the HMAS Sydney were found, many of these nagging questions which have survived the years could be proved or put to rest. If she were found there could be, for the relatives of those who died, some relief in finally knowing what happened and where their loved ones died. If the ship is never found, the relatives deserve the consideration of a full-scale search. At least they are owed a commitment that we did everything in our power. to find the ship. Of course, regardless of the outcome of the search-and remember we are asking for a commitment of support in principle-we believe there should be some permanent memorial to the 645 officers and sailors who died that day. It would be appropriate in this year of Australia Remembers, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second W orId War, to erect a suitable memorial here in Canberra to the crew of the HMAS Sydney. If the vessel remains lost, this would at least be a focal point for the grief of the families of these men. If a publicly funded and government supported search for the Sydney were successful in finding the ship's remains, the question then becomes: what do we do then? This motion proposes two courses of action. Firstly, the government should arrange and coordinate a suitable memorial service for the men who died. This may be held at sea over the spot where the Sydney now lies or it may be held on land at a suitable landfall adjacent to the location. Alternatively, it could be held in Canberra-perhaps at the HMAS Sydney memorial, if constructed by then. Whichever commemoration is chosen, the service should be a fitting tribute to the bravery and courage of those who served aboard the ship. It should, obviously, be attended by the close family of those who died in the service of their nation. Secondly, the government should ensure, without resorting to additional secrecy, that the sunken remains of the HMAS Sydney are protected from vandalism and souvenir hunting in some way. How this can be achieved is, obviously, going to be a matter for the Department of Defence and others. However, the important thing is that, having found the final resting place of the Sydney-in effect its grave site-the remains should be protected from casual diving and the associated deterioration of the site which may result. As I have said previously, regardless of the outcome of any proposed search for the HMAS Sydney, we owe the relatives of the officers and the crew who served aboard her in her last hours the courtesy of a full-scale search. They deserve our best efforts to trace the vessel so that we can at last unravel Australia's biggest maritime mystery once and for all. It is, therefore, the intention of this motion to ensure that the relatives are given the consideration of knowing that the govern. ment will support a concerted search for the vessel. I commend the motion to the House.",33
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE SUNKEN HMAS SYDNEY,Is the motion seconded? Mr Taylor-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,35
32,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,THE SUNKEN HMAS SYDNEY,"I rise to support the motion before the House. I am pleased to join with my Western Australian colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) in supporting the motion. It is important to be appreciative of the precise terms of the motion, which are as follows: That this House calls on the Government to: (1) consider supporting any move to locate the sunken vessel HMAS Sydney; (2) accept that, regardless of the outcome, surviving family members of those who lost their lives on HMAS Sydney are owed consideration of a full-scale public search for the vessel; (3) support public efforts to raise money to assist in locating the wreck; (4) fund and coordinate a suitable commemorative service for those who lost their lives on BMAS Sydney should the vessel be located; (5) erect a suitable memorial in Canberra to commemorate the loss of HMAS Sydney in accordance with the wishes of surviving family members; (6) ensure the exact coordinates of the sunken HMAS Sydney are not disclosed to the general public; (7) establish an Act of Parliament which protects the wreck from being dived upon other than for purposes of official identification and provide substantial penalties for transgressions of the Act; and (8) once the Act is established, embark on an extensive advertising campaign to make the public aware that diving on HMAS Sydney is a criminal offence and the penalties applicable. I confess that I am a late, but nonetheless enthusiastic, convert to the HMAS Sydney cause. As the member for Perth my first contact with this cause was to be invited by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to take part in the November 1994 commemoration of the sinking of the Sydney. That commemoration took place between Fremantle and Rottnest in Western Australia. I was very pleased on that occasion not only to accompany the minister but also to be accompanied by my father and my young son. In the course of that commemoration service my father made it crystal clear to me that as a former merchant mariner he was most concerned to ensure that every effort had been taken to locate the whereabouts of the sunken Sydney. As a consequence, in more recent times, together with the member for Moore and my Western Australian parliamentary colleague the Hon. Graham Edwards, himself a Vietnam veteran, we have been asked in a bipartisan way to take part in the formation in Western Australia of the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust. This is intended to be a community effort to ensure that no stone is left unturned to discover the whereabouts of the HMAS Sydney. I would like to quote a letter which Mr Edwards, my Western Australian parliamentary colleague, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in November 1994: Towards the end of November 1941, 645 messages were sent to Australian families with next of HMAS Sydney. The message read: With deep regret I have to inform you thatand then, of course, the relationship and rank is filled inis missing as a result of enemy action. Minister for Navy and Naval Board desire to express to you their sincere sympathy. These telegrams were followed by a short message from the Prime Minister of Australia on Sunday November 30, 1941: HMAS Sydney has been in action with a heavily armed enemy merchant raider which she sank by gunfire. The intimation was received from survivors .from the enemy vessel who were picked up some time after the action. No subsequent communication has been 'received from HMAS Sydney and the Government regrets that she must be presumed lost. Thus Australia came to learn that the world famous cruiser HMAS Sydney had been sunk and 645 families came to learn that their sons or brothers-in short, their loved ones-were lost at sea. Although Australia was in a matter of days to declare war on Japan following the ""day of infamy"" at Pearl Harbour and thus become preoccupied with our nation's survival, the news on Sydney stunned the nation. Unfortunately the advent of war with Japan intervened and a successful search for the Sydney and her men has never been concluded. Mr Edwards goes on to say: This nation owes those men a debt; indeed we have a responsibility to them, a responsibility we should not resile from. This nation should formally resume the search for the Sydney. He goes on to say that, in the first instance: ... can we be assured that all archival documentation has been identified and researched . . . As a consequence in part of that approach, the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust was established and recently, in April of this year, held its first meeting in Western Australia. As I have said, the thrust of that trust is to seek to gather community support for the finding of· the Sydney. As the member for Moore indicated, there are a range of controversies which surround the sinking of the Sydney. It seems to me that kin on the most appropriate starting point for a search of the Sydney is, as Tom Frame puts it in his latest book on the Sydney, to identify the haystack. Tom Frame quotes from a person who was heavily involved in the finding of the Titanic and the Bismarck. There is a great quote in his book where that person involved in the finding of those two famous ships says that, in most instances where one is trying to find a sunken ship, one is looking for a needle in the haystack. He goes on to say that in the case of the Sydney, one does not know where the haystack is. There is a need in the first instance, as Mr Edwards has pointed out in his letter to the Prime Minister, to assure ourselves that every step has been taken by way of archival search and documentary record to see if we can more precisely narrow down the location of the haystack before embarking upon a search for husbands, fathers, the needle. I would like to quote from further correspondence between Mr Edwards and the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns), who is no longer at the table but who remains in the chamber. In the correspondence, the Special Minister of State advised Mr Edwards as follows: I am advised that you are correct in stating that chances of finding HMAS Sydney may be slim. The lack of information and depth of water in the general area where the ship sank makes searching extremely difficult. HMAS Moresby, the Western Australian based hydrographic ship and the Navy's only ship with a deep ocean search capability, has in the past conducted searches of the waters in which it is thought Sydney most probably lies. These searches were concluded on an opportunity basis .as Moresby passed through the area as part of her normal operational program. None of the searches turned up any evidence of Sydney. I think that gives some indication to the House of the difficulty in this area. In the Special Minister of State's most recent correspondence with Mr Edwards dated 21 March 1995, the Special Minister of State writes: . . . the Government believes that it is noUn the interest of those families to have their expectations raised without real foundation that some trace of the Sydney might be found or without real knowledge that a search of all archival material might change judgements about what happened to the Sydney. The Government has made a concerted effort over many years to find the Sydney, but to no avail, and has reached the conclusion, after very careful consideration, that the current situation does not justify a further search. The Government is happy to assist any further archival investigations initiated by private individualsor organisations in accordance with normal governmental procedures for release of information. This should be seen as a helpful and sympathetic response to requests for information about the tragedy. The Government has no objection whatsoever to either of these enterprises being undertaken by individuals or organisations interested in such projects. Indeed, we wish anyone undertaking such activities every success. That does not seem to me to be too far away from the motion which is before the House today, which calls on the government to consider supporting any move to locate the sunken vessel. It is consistent with what seems to me to be the sensible approach of Mr Edwards and others who have interested themselves in this matter, including me, to satisfy and ensure in the first instance that all efforts have been made by way of archival search and documentary study to more prethe . cisely locate, as Tom Frame puts it in his book, 'the haystack' to see whether consequent upon that there is community, private and public support for a full-scale investigativesearch to locate the Sydney.",35
33,Mr TAYLOR,THE SUNKEN HMAS SYDNEY,"It gives me great pleasure, and indeed it is an honour, to support this motion. I commend the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) for bringing it forward for debate in this place, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who undoubtedly will follow me, for providing a large measure of bipartisan support to this motion. I am pleased to do this not only in the context of the very successful Australia Remembers program, which continues in 1995, but as someone who served for over three decades in the uniform of the senior service of the Royal Australian Navy, and who also over a period of time served with both sons, Pat and Rory, of Captain Joe Burnett, who was the commanding officer of the Sydney, lost in November 1941. So I take it as an honour and a pleasure to support this motion. It would be fair to say that the circumstances surrounding this loss have generated a large degree of controversy, of confusion and, indeed, of extreme frustration. The book by Dr Tom Frame, HMAS Sydney-Loss and Controversy is a good starting point to see why this might have been so. Tom Frame said in part: There are presently very few really controversial events within Australian naval history and just as few controversial interpretations of that history. The loss of Sydney and the loss of the Voyager after a collision during night exercise off Jervis Bay in 1964 are the two best known examples of both controversial events and interpretations. But the sinking of Sydney surpasses the Voyager tragedy in that the controversy over the actual event has been compounded by the controversy generated by historians. Consequently, the historical interest prompted by speculation over the loss of Sydney in the last decade has been productive in some respects and unproductive in others. The positive outcomes are principally archival and historiographical. Historians and researchers have had to examine areas of Australian naval history that had not been touched before, such as signal intelligence, convoy routing and gunnery fire control. The drawback is the preponderance research and writing into one isolated area history. He also comments: There have been three rigorous attempts by historians to explain the loss of Sydney. In addition to Navy's efforts following the action, the official historian of the RAN in WorId War II and two private researchers have undertaken detailed studies into the Sydney ... engagement. The least comprehensive account was that of the official historian George Herman Gill, who was commissioned to produce a comprehensive wartime history of all Australian naval operations. He was naturally constrained by the inherent editorial limits of his task in what he could say about Sydney. The books produced by freelance writers Micheal Montgomery and Barbara Winter took vastly different approaches to the subject. Montgomery, in Who Sank the Sydney?, tended to focus on the actions of the Australian cruiser, while Winter, in HMAS Sydney: Fact, Fantasy and Fraud, concentrated on the German ship. Montgomery's work was deliberately polemical and revisionist. Winter's book was more conservative and restrained. Nonetheless, the two books had much in common because Winter- who published three years after Montgomery, was constrained to examine the issues and evidence on which Montgomery had based his provocative statements. Tom Frame goes on: Since 1985 the controversy over Sydney has continued unabated. Fuelled by the work of Montgomery and Winter, the matters in dispute have multiplied. He continues: It is not helpful for history to be researched, and then presented in the midst of a controversy, particularly when the history has contemporary consequences. The existence of motives that transcend academic interests, such as determination to blame an individual, can make it very difficult for the historian to write an objective history. When the historian is subject to these influences, the history is likely to be polemical or even propagandist. This danger is underrated by both amateur and professional historians. That is the setting in which these issues are raised. (Time expired)",37
34,Mr ADAMS,THE SUNKEN HMAS SYDNEY,"I rise to support the motion before the House. Although I was aware of the loss of the HMAS Sydney during the early part of World War n, . I was not aware of the total mystery of her sinking and the fact that there have been so of many theories as to what happened to her. I of was interested to learn the background when the motion by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) was put forward. It certainly makes fascinating reading. The fact that the sinking occurred without any Australian survivors and therefore witnesses over 50 years ago makes me think that, even if we had a full-scale search and the time and the money, there is little likelihood that she would ever be lo.cated. A number of surveys have searched for the wreck. Some of the surveys have been routine hydrographic surveys, while others have been searches as a result of the location of unusual featuresboth magnetic and acoustic-near the reported location of the HMAS Sydney and the HSK Kormoran engagement. All the searches have been on the continental shelf in depths of less than 200 metres. These surveys have been very thorough, using all the latest sensing equipment and technology, but they have failed to tum up any sign of the Sydney. Looking at the details from the survivors and the direction the Sydney took, I would suspect that it would be extremely difficult to say exactly what time she sank and where she sank. She may have been up to three days away from the original site, bearing in mind wartime radio silence conditions and the possibility that she may have run into someone else, and some people theorise that it may have been a Japanese submarine. She may written have been taking avoiding action or, once out of sight of her assailant, she may have changed course. But there is no evidence of any such things. If the ship were to be located in the future-I think it would be found only by chance, if at all-then it should be declared a historical wreck and paid due respect as the . final resting place of her crew, in the same way as are HMAS Hobart and other ships off that area. This covers points (6), (7) and (8) of the motion by the honourable member for Moore. The ship's crew is commemorated individumore ally on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission naval memorial at Plymouth in the UK. The members of the crew are also listed on the honour roll at the Australian Memorial. The Gascoyne RSL is erecting a wall of remembrance to the HMAS Sydney visionary and that will be found at Quobba Point, miles north of Carnarvon in Western Australnight. is. This point is presumed to be the nearest land point to the area of the action. The Commonwealth government was asked to assist the Gascoyne RSL in 1991, and I understand that the government made contribution. But I am sure that if it required development it would be eligible under the Australian remembers program for the war graves and the monuments. A cairn was erected there some 10 years ago by Australian Navy Association. As for asking the public to fund a full-scale search, one would have to ask: what would they get for their money? A lot of further speculation and little else I would suggest. But, if people wish to put money forward and pursue it, it is up to them individually. raising false hopes should not be our task. As much as I and everyone else here would really like to know the fate of the Sydney and her crew, I think unless by some pure chance of occurrence that she is located it is unlikely now that she will ever be found. I. would suggest that their last resting place will be ians. remembered by land based symbols and that they remain undisturbed.",38

We will not be relying on the ideological chip on the shoulder attitudes of a few a politicians like the Prime Minister to effect such changes. Australians will decide our future under a Howard government only after a constitutional convention of the people and the referendum process announced by the the federal coalition many months ago. The suggestion that the Prime Minister's statement will include arrangements for a president to be elected by a two-thirds majority vote of the parliament is a clear indication both of the Keating political agenda on the issue and his total disregard for the views of But the people. The last thing that this nation needs is another political crony. The Prime Minister should never be allowed to forget his recent derisory comment that 'this is about as good as it gets'.

38,Mr CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to draw to the attention of the House a problem with the Commonwealth Employment Service. One of the CES offices in the eastern states found a labouring job for one of its clients in Carnarvon, Western Australia. I must say I was a little surprised that the CES could not find an unemployed Western Australian to do the job. Instead, it sentJamie Sutton from the eastern states. On Saturday, in the East Perth Magistrates Court, Sutton pleaded guilty to two charges of unlawful damage. His crime was bending two industrial roller doors. He did this cause he was searching for shelter from the cold weather-it is not as cold as we know in Canberra, but it was certainly cold in Perth terms. He arrived in Perth from the eastern states on his way to Carnarvon to take the labouring job that he got through the he is going to get. Commonwealth Employment Service. The matter raises a number of questions: why did the CES not first try to find employment for an unemployed person in or near Australia Carnarvon for the labouring job, and if not from there then from elsewhere in Western Australia; did it identify whether Mr Sutton could get to Carnarvon without problems, and if not, why not; did it assist Mr Sutton transferring to Carnarvon, and if not, why and did it ensure accommodation was able for him on his way to and on arrival in Carnarvon, and if not, why not? Member for O'Connor",40
39,Mr LATHAM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week the hand, member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) issued warning that government members should not raise in debate his record as a shadow ensure minister. This followed the excellent proposition advanced by the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) that if the opposition wants to debate micro reform it should start in its own backyard-it should start with micro reform. of its front bench. I concluded long ago in the case of the wish member for O'Connor that his bark is a lot worse than his old gummy bite. It is no wonder that he wants to hide his record from public scrutiny and it is no wonder he wants to shelter the opposition front bench from micro reform. I refer honourable members to the Parliamentary Handbook which shows for the member for O'Connor 15 years of parliamentary service and his failure in no less than nine shadow ministries-small business three times, administrative services, housing, health, employment and training, veterans affairs imd defence science. If his performance were applied to one of the honourable member's racehorses, I would venture the form guide summary would read: 15 years racing; nine campaigns; still a maiden. Rogue performer; not likely to bethreaten in this class; preferring something easier. Best suited to retirement. Not here. it The member for O'Connor should cop the tip, give it away and understand that he is part of a demoralised, hacking, broken down, lame front bench. He deserves all the scrutiny that . Australian Fruit Fly Circus",40
40,Mr LIEBERMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"IndO-Some weeks ago I raised the concern of many people in about the precarious financial future of the Australian Fruit Fly Circus, the famous children's circus that has been aptly described by some as 'ordinary kids doing extraordinary things'. This circus has performed throughout in the world and is a matter of pride for many not; Australians. The children in the circus are availexcellent performers and artists. Despite my raising it some weeks ago, and despite some attempts by the government to persuade the public that it had the matter in I regret to tell this House that no ara rangements have been made for funding the future of the circus that will be adequate to its future. I believe now that there is ./ strong evidence to indicate that this extraordinary organisation, Australia's treasure, will go into extinction, and that the government in fact wants it to go into extinction and has no intention at all of coming forward with appropriate policies to ensure its future. That is a disgrace. The government should be brought to account. I challenge the government this week to put aside my fears and prove me wrong, to come up with substantial commitments and to respond to the circus with courtesy. The circus is entitled to that. The children have been asking for an answer and they have not got it. It is a disgrace. The government should be ashamed of itself. Shadow Ministry",40
41,Mr SWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) denied the fact that the front bench of the opposition was old and tired, so I have been compelled to do some more research. The average length of service on the government front bench, or ministry, is seven years; the average length of service in the coalition ministry is 11 years. The average number of people in the cabinet aged over 50 years is 29 per cent of the government front bench compared with 42 per cent of the coalition. Over 33 per cent of government members are aged over 50 years compared with 48 per cent of the coalition. If you look at the length of service in the cabinet, you see that 46 per cent of government members have served for more than five years compared with 68 per cent of the coalition. If you look at the length of time in the ministry, you see that 27 per cent of government members have served for more than five years compared with 45 per cent of the coalition. It is clear that the coalition is old and and that it has no new ideas. The only new idea that it puts forward is an old idea, 100 years old-that is, to abolish the safety net for working Australians. It is clear by the behaviour of the front bench, particularly that of the member for O'Connor, that the coalition will be relegated to the category of an old, tired, dead horse. Member for Werriwa",41
42,Mr TUCKEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I look with some interest at the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) who just did me the favour of listing the vast experience I have had on the front bench in this parliament. He apparently thinks . that if you have been in more than one front bench position it is some evidence of failure. When I compare myself with him I see that he is yet to get his first front bench position. To administer a government department needs a little more than the ability to stand up and try to make jokes about racehorses. What is more, if you want to get into that particular area, I am having considerable success at the moment having seen about $50,000 or $60,000 of state money go into Tuckey's coffers just recently. But I would prefer to go and have a battle on the racecourse than make a decision like the one the member for Werriwa did. He tried to keep his job as a mayor so he could pick up his mayoral allowance while he was being paid by the people of Australia for the purpose of being a member of parliament. You know all about that. What was it? You wanted about $30,000 a year extra. You know very well you could not have done both jobs properly. At the moment you are doing neither of them properly, certainly not the one here. You get up and whinge and moan. As I said, you all get patches put on your arms on caucus day so you can trot in here like little mechanical monsters and say, 'You've got no policy.' You sound like an idiot. (Time expired)",41

This gives me an opportunity to remind members of the House of the guidelines for members' statements. I suggest to members on both sidestired particularly the members for Lilley and Werriwa and the member for O'Connor, who responded-to have a look at them for the future. Immigration: Indian Community",41
44,Mrs EASSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On Saturday I was joined by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) at a function for the Indian community in my electorate of Lowe. The occasion was the release of a community profile based on the 1991 census on those who were Indian born. Two pertinent points emerged from this event. Firstly, the census asked people where they were born but did not have room to ask where their land of origin was. People are born in many parts of the world-for example, Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia-but are, in fact, members of other ethnic groups. Indians are a major example of this situation. I request that the census authorities look at making provision for this question, which would give the census results more precision. Secondly, with regard to immigration to Australia, instead of including Indians in the general catch-all group based on the Middle East, I think there should be a separate category for Indians. Indian born Australians tend to be high achievers, highly educated and very well qualified. In the future, our relations with India will strengthen and deepen, and I welcome this development. Let us start by developing an individual category for Indian immigrants and by acquiring the most precise information that we can on the actual situation of those Australians of Indian descent. National Rail Link",41
45,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I draw to the attention of the House yesterday's historic opening of the national rail link at Melbourne by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This brings to fruition decades of attempts by other governments to link Brisbane to Perth by one simple gauge. Seven hundred kilometres were connected through the electorate of Corangamite by hard working men and women in record time, to budget and to a very high standard. Containers can now be moved from the ports of Melbourne and Sydney to other metropolitan areas in efficient, designated trains. This is a new era of rail transport that will improve the infrastructure of Australia's transport system. I pay tribute to the chairman, Ted Butcher, the managing director, Vince Graham, and all those other executives who have achieved this long-time dream of many members of this House and many Australians: we now have a national rail transport system. National Rail Link",42
46,Mr HORNE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is interesting to follow the member for Corangamite(Mr MCArthur), because I had the pleasure last Friday of riding a train on a section of the new national rail line. It is interesting to hear all the tributes that the member for Corangamite paid, but there is no doubt that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who was the minister at the time the national rail policy became law, is the man who deserves the congratulations of the people of Australia. It took 150 years before we had a standard gauge line linking all of the nation's capitals, but it has happened and it has happened under the Keating Labor government. That is certainly something to be proud of. I thank the member for Corangamite for pointing that out. Commonwealth Development Bank",42
47,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"1 want to raise an issue which emanates out of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. It relates to the Commonwealth Development Bank, which is the last resort as a lender for a large number of primary producers and small businesses in rural areas. During the 1993-94 financial year this bank loaned $500 million to primary industry people at a concessional rate. There has been no statement from the government about what the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank will be nor any consideration given to what will happen to the employees of that bank. The Commonwealth Development Bank has a separate banking licence. It also has the facility to support the rural community by way of concessional loans. There has been absolutely no statement. Mr Speaker, having been the chairman of the government's banking inquiry, you would understand how important this bank is to the rural community. There has been no response at all from the government, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or the Treasurer (Mr Willis) about the Commonwealth Development Bank. The Prime Minister raises his eyebrows, but there has been no comment about what will happen to the bank or its staff. It is about time the government clarified the situation, especially with the upcoming sale of the Commonwealth Bank.",42

49,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I wish to make a short statement about the desecration of the grave of Eddie Mabo. I am sure that all honourable members and all Australians will join me in condemning the shameful desecration of the grave of Eddie Mabo and in expressing our deepest sympathy to Mrs Benita Mabo and her family. It was an obnoxious act. Apart from the racially motivated vandalism of it-which should not be left unpunished-the fact is that it came at a time when members of the Aboriginal and Islander community were starting, I think, to feel good about themselves and about the fact that we have made progress in Australia with the passage of native title, which Eddie Mabo was associated with as the person principal amongst others who took it to the High Court. With all these things happening, one could notice a genuine change of sentiment in the community. It seemed that for that reason, apart from the explicit reasons, it was particularly unfortunate. It is a sad fact that, while all around Australia people are making efforts to eliminate racism, there are still people on the fringes who promote hatred, fear and vilification of minorities. I want to take this opportunity to send a message to these people and others like them-people who peddle hatred and who, I believe, will not succeed in turning back the clock on the process of reconciliation which is now well under way in Australia between Aboriginal and Islander Australians and non-Aboriginal and Islander Australians. These people will not succeed in prolonging the denial of the rights and freedoms of our indigenous people. They will not succeed in deterring the great majority of Australians who value a tolerant, inclusive society-including a society for them where they are accepted as equals. And they will not succeed in overcoming the determination of the Aboriginal and Islander community to continue to fight for justice and survival of their culture. Eddie Mabo was a great figure in the indigenous community of this country-a great figure in Australia. He was a great advocate for his people and, along with his fellow litigants, his case became a major watershed in Australian history. His contribution to the fight for recognition of the rights of the country's indigenous people-his people-will never be forgotten. I think his struggle does epitomise the qualities of tenacity, courage and pride that we all like to think are part of our national character, and they are the qualities that take us forward as a cohesive nation and help us to overcome those who would attempt to divide and destroy through hatred and fear. I think we all owe Eddie Mabo and others like him a great debt. The community should, I think, beyond the weight of the case that bears his name, recognise it. One of the things I will be doing is asking the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to advise me on suitable options for achieving appropriate national recognition for Eddie Mabo and the others who struggled to put to rest the shameful and patently absurd myth of terra nullius. The government will then act to ensure that a suitable monument or act of recognition be dedicated to their memory and to ensure that their struggle is not forgotten. The government will fund the repair of the grave and also its relocation, if that is what the family so wish and decide. I conclude my remarks by saying I am grateful to hear of the overwhelming support and kindness the family is receiving from the people of Townsville. This support is a reflection, I think, of the true spirit and decency of the Australian community. I am sure Eddie Mabo's family will not let that view or that memory be lost simply by the acts of a few people. So, once again, I am certain that all members will join me in extending my deepest personal sympathy to Benita Mabo and the family and condemning the outrage that occurred on Saturday night.",43
50,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I would like to completely associate myself with the expressions of disgust and outrage of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding this particular incident. Any desecration of any grave site is a matter of an intense personal pain to the family, the survivors and the next of kin of the person whose monument has been desecrated. Coming as it did at a time of particular moment to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, this particular act carried a special and additionally painful hurt. I can certainly understand the legitimate distress and the legitimate concern of Eddie Mabo's family and all Australians at what occurred. I would like to specifically associate myself with the message the Prime Minister said should be conveyed to people of racist inclination in Australia: there is no place in Australia for racial intolerance, there is no place in this country for people who peddle racist bigotry and there is no place in Australia for people who would seek to treat one Australian as less important or less deserving of a place in the Australian sun than other Australians. I agree with the Prime Minister that we have come a long way in a better understanding of the role and the place of Australians of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. I think most Australians are desirous of seeing the disadvantage they have suffered addressed and repaired. Those who are not willing to see that addressed and repaired are in a very distinct minority. I would hope the best messages all of us can convey to those who peddle racist bigotry is to treat them in the fashion that is most effective and to treat them and brand them as moral outcasts of our society. I think in that way we will mark our commitment as a people to a tolerant, harmonious Australia in which all Australians, irrespective of their backgrounds, are equal and entitled to be treated with equal dignity and respect. I also, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, convey my deep sympathy to Mrs Mabo and the other members of her family for this very distressing incident. NA",44

54,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,44
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me get this set in crystal clarity. There is always a case for protecting data, information and interests of the nation in particular circumstances. That is what the government has been intending with this approach, given that the newspapers in particular these days show no interest in what was called in the past the D-notice system and given the situation where, in fact, the more extravagant the claims the better some newspapers and editors prefer them. This is a far cry from days of old-perhaps not so old. Where these things in the past have been treated on the basis of some understandings between the media, the government and various agencies of the government, it being obvious that such treatment will no longer be afforded, the remedy is legislation. On radio this morning the Leader. of the Opposition was asked whether the shadow foreign minister agreed with this nonsense that he said Gareth Evans was going on about about gaoling journalists. Mr Howard said he wasn't and the coalition wasn't. He said, 'We're going to examine it this morning at our shadow cabinet meeting, but my gut reaction is adverse.' The fact is that Senator Evans did canvass this material with the shadow foreign minister. He said to a journalist in interview: Now we haven't seen the legislation. Obviously, we will give a formal response once we've seen it. These things depend a little on how they are actually drafted and what in detail they mean ... in relation to the Crimes Act, but I've told Senator Evans and I've discussed on two or three occasions the response to the Samuels inquiry and I've said in broad terms that I am happy with the general outline of what the government is proposing, as was presented in Senator Evans's statement to the Senate today. Senator Evans has apparently told the Senate that he understood the opposition reserved its position on the detailed drafting of the legislation, but there was no room for doubt about the opposition's general support. Furthermore, Senator Evans showed the government's ministerial statement to Mr Downer in its final draft form. Mr Downer told Senator Evans that he had no objection to any of the proposed substantive responses to the commissioner's recommendations or the language in which they were expressed. He did say that he would continue to take the opportunity to attack the government over its handling of grievances but did not object in any way to Senator Evans's statement that the responses in the miriisterial statement represent a broad measure of agreement between the government and the opposition. Mr Downer-Subjett to seeing the detailed legislation.",44
56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, come on. Look, if you want to be knocked over by your leader, at least take the admonition. You walked in and said to Senator Evans that you basically supported his approach. You saw the thread of it, so it is not the detail",45
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the Prime Minister specifically what sort of information might lead under these proposals to prison sentences if disclosed to journalists. It was a question seeking information. The Prime Minister has spent three minutes talking about the response of Senator Evans and the exchanges. I do not think he is on the point at all.",45

National Rail Link",45
63,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the launch of the One Nation train yesterday and also today in Adelaide in the electorate of Port Adelaide. Can the Prime Minister inform the House what benefits will flow to the nation as a result of the government's efforts to connect the nation with a standard gauge rail from Brisbane to Perth, via Melbourne and Adelaide?",45
64,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I was delighted to be in the honourable member's electorate this morning as I had the privilege of piloting this double loco train into Adelaide.,46
65,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,46
66,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are far more gentle than you would think, Mr Speaker, and far more responsive than you would think. The fact is that we have for the first time, in the One Nation policy, brought about the establishment of a national rail highway in Australia. So, instead of having four state rail systems, we have one, and we are able to link the cities of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and, of course, Perth, but particularly Melbourne and Sydney via a standard gauge between Adelaide and Melbourne. This will mean that in this country we can now start to develop, through modernisation of the rail system, a decent rail transport system delivering bulk cargoes and large cargoes like containers. You do not have to be a transport economist to know that on these very long journeys across the continent, or from South Australia to Victoria, New South Wales or Queensland, a properly set up rail system should be able to deliver cargoes, particularly containers, competitively with road, which will remove many vehicles from the roads, particularly the double vehicles which will continue to break up roads and threaten the safety of motorists on our roads. This rail system will also reduce the cost of these particular items. In this reform under One Nation $429 million was invested in upgrading the infrastructure. We will be adding a further $400 million in new locomotives to be built in Australia, indeed in NewcastleMr Tuckey interjecting",46
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for O'Connor.,46
68,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"which has now a very important centre of heavy engineering. Already we have seen productivity improve. National rail has halved its losses since the early 1990s and is expected to break even some time next year. The One Nation train that is on its way to Perth slices two hours off the MelbourneAdelaide leg and eight hours off the journey from Melbourne to Perth, and it will lead to a more rapid and reliable system. On the weekend the Minister for Transport unveiled the proposal called Track Australia which is to propose to the states the development of a company that simply owns the permanent way, or track, so that we separate a railway business from the business of running the track in a permanent way, in which case many other operators, be it Australian National or private operators such as Brambles or TNT, can hire locomotives and pull their containers or wagons across the continent on a system that will then be run as a business to upgrade the track. So, if we have a continuing upgrade of the track, we will have an efficient rail corridor and an efficient rail highway. It is a great pity that over the last 30 years or so the rail system has run down so dramati cally. One only had to go through Victoria yesterday on this train to find that in some sections they are still passing the baton; that is, a driver cannot take a train on to a portion of the track without getting the baton for that part of the track. In this day and age, to be stopping a train and having to hand up a baton, so that the authority to drive on a certain part of the track goes only to the baton holder, provides a great commentary on the decadent way in which the rail system was allowed to run down-need I say in the main under 20-odd years of coalition governments. They could not care less about the rail system. They did not care about national efficiency. They talked about ports and wharves but did nothing about them. The mere fact of now having the port of Adelaide being able to compete with the port of Melbourne, the port of Melbourne being able to compete with the port of Sydney, and the port of Brisbane, with a rail link under One Nation into the main southern line, being able to compete with the port of Sydney will mean that we will have competition right down the east coast of Australia around to South Australia. And, by bringing double-stack containers across the continent, the port of Fremantle will be able to compete with the ports of Adelaide and Melbourne-that is, if the ideological Western Australian government will actually let it operate. This is a very great change to national efficiency. Because this is a trading country, we should be able to move containers and heavy bulk materials around the continent competitively in a system that actually works. With the competition we have been able to get into the system already and the attitude and spirit of the people involved with this project, one can see that the railway workers, the people who put the track down, the people laying the new concrete sleepers, the people who changed the gauge and the people who actually operate the system see themselves very much in a competitive business with road and want to get in and make it work. We made it very clear with One Nation that it was about binding the nation together, bringing people together and doing things together. As a consequence, we went out of our way-through the local government capital works programs, through the One Nation railway program-to do things which would be of lasting benefit, such as the National Training Authority. If you look back at One Nation and at the achievements of the National Training Authority and the first national training system, at removing the interface between the domestic and international carriage of air passengers-that is, the folding of Australian Airlines into Qantas and a competitor in Ansett being given international rights-and at the building now of the first rail highway and the consequences of that, you will see that money has been seriously spent and well spent because the whole effect of the policy was to bring the economy back to life, to growth and to strong employment growth with low inflation. We are now seeing the One Nation policy benefits coming home for the country. I do not think we could have seen a more manifest demonstration of that than yesterday when we saw this quite historic moment. All the way along the track from Melbourne to Lara yesterday and down through the Adelaide Hills today, there were people in their backyards, at the crossings and street comers waving with thumbs up wishing the system well-across one nation on the train-and not a few people said to me, 'One Nation delivering the goods.' The former Leader of the Opposition told us that we were trying to buy votes and that we would bankrupt the country. Let us now reflect upon the training market, the air transport market, the rail highway and all these great broad brush changes, which are only ever done by Labor governments. The great nation-building things are always done by Labor governments. This weekend it was just history repeating itself. Foreign Debt",46
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Since you have sought free time on the ABC on Wednesday night to announce your proposals for the republic you want, do you have any plans to get ABC free time to tell the Australian public about how you intend to deal with our foreign debt, which has burgeoned from $23 billion to $167 billion while you have had your hands on the levers?",47

73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This was the great crime of the 1970s-the crime of knowing neglect; the crime of knowing that there was a trend decline in the terms of trade inextricably to depression levels; the crime of knowing that the public sector had bid for resources that the nation could not stand; the crime of knowing that the dislocation of private investment and the smashing of the capital stock left Australia exposed; and the crime of knowing that double digit inflation would wreck savings. But he wandered in and out of Parliament House from 1976 to 1983 as though he were a radio commentator on the economy and not the person operating it. He would wander in every morning and give his cocky little reply to the radio jockeys at the front door as though he were simply one of them. He had his hands on the controls, yet when the alarm bell rang and the current account deficit went to six per cent of GDP in 1981 he should have known then. Mr Costello interjecting",47

Between 1983 and 1986, when the government had barely warmed up the cabinet room, the debt had gone to 31 per cent of GDP. Yet it has only gone from about 31 per cent to 38 per cent in the following years-in other words, the government has stabilised and largely slowed its progress down.",48

85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,48
86,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can understand the sense of indignation on this side of the House when someone who was such a policy lush, who did so little, who threw the pass all the way through his parliamentary years, who ends up as an absolute flop as opposition leader-a flop without policy ideas other than a tax cut bribe-should wander back through the sheer effluxion of time and say; 'Now you've tried to repair the problem, now you've changed and externalised the country, now you've broken the back of inflation, now you've got the budget back to surplus, now we've got wage productivity levds I could only have qreamed about, will you please let me haveit back to try to wreck it all again?' The answer to that is a strong negative. If he wants to get it back, he is going to have to do more than slick advertising lines on radio stations. He is going to actually have to stand for it. Mr Speaker, let me tell you this: the gt;eat internationalisation of this country never came from' an advertising agency. The accord, the shift in productivity, the drop in industrial disputation and the massive levels of employment never came from an ad agency; they came from the ingenuity of the government under its accord and the commitment of the Australian people-a commitment the questioner could never get because he never had the interest. Let the Leader of the Opposition reflect now, as we chart our way out with exports of GDP doubling and with a debt service component dropping from 21 per cent of our exports to 11 per cent today-as we see that change in our national debt statistics--'{)n the fact that he sat there, monkey cunning, and let all the hard ones go by. I have said before and I will say again that when he first went into opposition in 1983 he was like a man who had a tonne weight lifted off his shoulders. Mr Nugent interjecting",48

90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The House will come to order! Both sides, just take a deep breath. Gun Laws",49
91,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. I refer to media reports today concerning legislation to ensure the banning of guns. What is the government's response to those reports?,49
92,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. He, like many other members of this House, understands what a complex issue gun control is. I was pleased yesterday to see on television the Leader of the Opposition comment on gun control and indicate that he would support stronger gun laws. This government has a long record of encouraging strong uniform national gun laws. Last month, at a meeting of the police ministers in Tasmania, a significant step in that direction was made. I referred last week in the House to those advances. It is true that the states have primary carbut riage of and responsibility in this area-a fact that was not at the forefront of the Leader of the Opposition's remarks. But, that aside, Mr Howard's statement was very welcome. However, it seems that the strain of his first foray into policy making was rather too much, because this morning when asked about this matter John Tingle of the Shooters Party said that he had had a conversation with the Leader of the Opposition. John Tingle said, 'I asked him was he in fact advocating tighter gun controls and he said he most certainly was not.' So we have the situation of the Age this morning reporting that Mr Howard yesterday 'strongly supported tougher gun laws' and then this morning Mr Howard assuring Mr Tingle that he was not advocating tougher gun controls. Mr Howard seems to be the Quick Draw MCGraw of Australian policy making, blasting away on Sunday, firing policy blanks and his guns empty on Monday. He is a 24-hour policy hero. In contrast, the federal government has long been concerned about the matter of gun control. We do not just see it as a law and order issue. Seven times as many Australians are dying from suicides and accidents from guns as dying in crimes involving guns. I believe that often the best way to approach issues of this kind is through a bipartisan approach. This is the way in which the Commonwealth government has been working with the states. In that regard, I commend the leadership of the Victorian government whose minister for police and Deputy Premier, Pat MCNamara, sponsored with me initiatives that were raised at the police ministers conference. For that reason, I would invite the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party and the shadow Attorney-General to meet with the Attorney-General and me to discuss this issue and, hopefully, reach a bipartisan approach. It will be important for the National Party leader to attend that meeting if we are to achieve a genuine approach. The government does want a strong, consistent gun law regime-a regime that not only protects the legitimate rights of gun owners also ensures that guns are stored properly, that there is a solid licensing system and that guns and ammunition without legitimate uses are not circulated. We do not want to eliminate guns that are in lawful possession, but we are concerned to achieve a safer Australia. We would invite the opposition to join with us in promoting that approach. Cars: Costs",49
93,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that a survey by the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria shows that the cost of running a Ford Falcon for private owners has risen by $13 a week over the past year, which is five times higher than the underlying rate of inflation, and that the cost for business car operators has risen by $48 a week over the past year as a result of hidden cost increases brought on by his government-such as deceitful increases in petrol taxes and sales taxes since the last election. How can you say to Australians that this is as good as it gets when for the struggling battler it just keeps on getting worse?",49
94,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member will know that, under the industrial archaeology his former government referred to as the Australian motor industry-high prices, low productivity and low quality-the future of Australian motorists was very dim indeed with massive tariffs on imported cars. So they were charged through the nose for cars which were way below world standard, and you were quite happy for that policy to continue. In fact, during the tenure of the Leader of the Opposition, protection in this country rose. Can you believe that? In the mid-1970s to early 1980s protection in this country rose. It fell to this government, as it always does to make all the big changes, as I articulated earlier, to try to do something about it and do something effective with the Australian motor vehicle industry. As a consequence, the government removed quotas. It was a great little scam if you had a quota. In other words, you had infinity protection. Once you got over a certain number, that was it. They were the people who introduced it and kept it going. We removed those quotas and we introduced a motor vehicle plan to reduce the number and proliferation of models and makers. As a consequence we then systematically reduced the level of protection from effective rates of well over 100 per cent down to 25 per cent at the moment, falling to 15 per cent by the year 1997, from memory. That change has meant that somebody buying a standard saloon car today gets it $10,000 cheaper than when the coalition was in office in the days gone. That is what they would be paying for the old tariff-priced cars. But it is only somebody who either does not know that or who wants to lead with his chin who would ask a question such as this. As a consequence of coalition policies, the Australian vehicle park-that is, the fleet-was amongst the oldest in the Western world. It is changing now with new cars. It happened because of buyer resistance to price and it is changing now because cars are better and cheaper. The government has increased fuel excise. It has done so because it believed that this was an appropriate area for revenue in a fuel that was lightly taxed in world terms. If the honourable gentleman wants to direct questions to the government about fuel taxes perhaps he will direct them to the coalition Premiers, who have been straight in there for very heavy fuel tax increases and, not only that, but also for very heavy fees for licences and registrations, which I thought he might have referred to in his question. So against the backdrop of even a modicum of history in the Australian motor vehicle industry and Australian motorists who use this industry, it is very clear that the honourable gentleman does not understand what really affects the Australian motorist. One of the manifestations of why he does not understand is that they have lost five elections and he is still over there. Industrial Relations",50
95,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. It refers to Australian workers and how they fare under our industrial relations system. How does Australia's industrial relations system protect the interests of Australian workers? What would be the impact on Australian workers of alternative proposals for Australia's industrial relations system?,50
96,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"While the Leader of the Opposition will not specify coalition policies, it is very clear in the public arena that there is one area in which we can be certain that the coalition and the government will be different, and that is in the area of industrial relations and what it means for the working conditions of some of the least powerful in the labour market, the people the Leader of the Opposition patronisingly calls 'the battlers' . In February 1995 the then opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the current Leader of the Opposition, reaffirmed that the essence of Jobsback would remain coalition policy. The member for Bennelong has consistently reaffirmed this. Last year when asked if he envisaged any rewrite of the policy, he replied: 'No, I don't because it's right. Individual contracts are the preferred outcome and the coalition is not prepared to pay overtime rates or holiday loadings or even guarantee public holiday pay.' Unlike under the government's legislation, the nodisadvantage test will be dropped. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, on a point of order understanding order 145: the first part of the question to the Prime Minister was asking him to outline current industrial relations policy and the effects on workers. What the Prime Minister is now doing is drawing a comparison, which you said on a previous occasion can be done, but in order to draw that comparison there must be an outline of the thing which is being compared with. And he is not doing that at all.",50
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is being entirely relevant to the question that was asked of him. I warn the member for Menzies about taking points of order in the way that he has.,51
98,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the government's legislation, there is a no-disadvantage test. Under that proposed by the opposition, the no-disadvantage test would be dropped. For instance, typical unskilled labourers who currently work the average amount of overtime of this group-which is 10 hours a week-will have their earnings increased by $199 per week or $10,300 a year. Without penalties, the reduction in overtime pay would be $94 a week or $4,888 per year for those people. That is a decrease of 17 per cent. The government supports overtime rates and holiday loadings and it guarantees public holiday pay. But the abolition of that element of the income of these people-that is, the overtime-would see them lose roughly $5,000 a year or nearly $100 a week. They are the people the Leader of the Opposition patronisingly refers to· as battlers, and that what they would lose under his policy. Let me describe the situation of the part-time worker on low pay. Imagine a nurse who works 16 hours each weekend. Under current arrangements, the pay would be $299 a week, but without penalties it is reduced to $184 a week. This amounts to a loss of $5,970 a year or a 38 per cent reduction. As a consequence of removing these penalty rates and moving to individual contracts, these people whom the Leader of the Opposition cynically and patronisingly describes as battlers would suffer deleteriously and heavily as in the case of that nurse. The Leader of the Opposition will tell you in relation to the government's legislation, 'That's not right. Under the opposition's policy, if people want to remain in an award they'll be able to do so.' But this belies the fact that the labour market turns over 1.6 million a year. There are eight million people in the labour market, and about one-quarter of them change every year, or 130,000 people a month. Once those people change, they have lost the award protections. Over a period of, say, five years the great bulk of the labour market would find themselves out of these conditions which apply only under awards. They will be given the choice of the contract, but they will not be given the choice of maintaining these conditions. The cynicism of asking questions about battlers when you want to carve away from a nurse $6,000 a year and you want to carve away from an unskilled person just on $5,000 a year-and that is what you are about-is unconscionable. One would ask: why would anyone want this to happen? Is it because the current industrial relations system is delivering low levels of labour productivity? No. Over the last year, labour productivity has been running at near record levels of four per cent. Is it because our current labour market is not delivering healthy employment growth? No. In the last 12 months we have had the largest growth in employment on record of around five per cent, which is well over 300,000 jobs. Is it because the transition to our indusis trial relations environment has been associated with unacceptable industrial unrest? No. Strikes have fallen by two-thirds compared with the 1970s. Is it because real unit labour cost increases under Labor have been unacceptable? No. The decrease in labour costs of production since 1983 has been a very healthy 9.5 per cent: a decrease. There seems to be only one conclusion: the coalition cannot stand working people. It wants to belt them. It wants to hop into them. What an objective to say, 'I spent my years in public life. What I really want to do is to hop into the people earning under $30,000, to hop into the ordinary wage and salary earners who earn under $30,000, to hop into the unskilled labourer on 22,000 bucks a year and to hop into the nurse. I want to hop into them and knock off their annual leave loadings and their overtime. I want to take those things away and push them out on the contracts. As you know, with a natural change in the labour market in about three years, the better part of half the labour market will have turned over.' I have said this in the past about these sorts of policies: if the Leader of the Opposition wants to be regarded as a credible and an honest person, the notion of having his party running around saying that he is representing battlers is both incredible and dishonest. These are the same people who want to take away not simply these things in the labour market but all of the other conditions associated with the social wage. The Leader of the Opposition was on radio today saying, 'The social wage, what does that matter?' It matters to the average person by at least a couple of hundred dollars a week by way of health, income support and those great government programs that the Leader of the Opposition is committed to cutting-the $10,000 million in programs that he is committed to cutting. I will conclude on this point: there is a very great difference between the industrial relations policies of the government and those of the opposition. They go to supporting the very people he cynically and patronisingly ca-ls battlers. That is why I am sure that he WIll not get a reaffirmation by people of his honesty and credibility while he says dishonest and incredible things about the working class. Mr Tim Fischer-Would the Prime Minister care to table his historic notes where he discovers the term 'battlers'?",51
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is quoting from private notes. Cars: Cost,52
100,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in February 1992, you said in this place: From tomorrow, the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent ... with cheaper cars, we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment ... Given the 9 May tax hike on cars that run on unleaded fuel, are you prepared to admit on World Environment Day that you have now decided that what is good for the environment is no longer important?",52

108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left! The member for Adelaide is trying to hear.,52
109,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"During your period of office we saw the Chrysler company simply collapse under its own weight in South Australia. We have seen a change in the production of the Mitsubishi vehicle. I remind the House of the government's commitments to extending the investment allowance and doing those things which are important to the production of vehicles in South Australia not only for the Australian market but also for the world market. The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and I met with the Mitsubishi company to establish in its mind the value of investing in the production of the Magna wagon in Australia for distribution to the Mitsubishi dealership of companies worldwide. During my visit to Japan, I met the President of the Mitsubishi Corporation and the President of the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation to urge upon them again that the Mitsubishi sedan could be built in Australia. I reminded them of the extension of the investment allowances and the changed tariff regime which the government has introduced. As a consequence, we are now seeing the development of an Australian industry for the world market which is producing modem vehicles: high quality, lower priced cars with fuel efficient engines. They will replace some of the older leaded fuel engines around the country. What is going to change the nature of the Australian environment for motor vehicles is a change in the stock of cars. This could not change while they were so expensive and so dated. Mr Costello-You put the tax up.",52
110,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As far as the tax is concerned, I gave the answer last week. Maybe the questioner did not hear it. The government moved the tax down as the cycle took production below levels which we thought were significantly important. From that point of view, we have moved it back only to where it was under a coalition government. As a consequence, there was . hardly a murmur from the Australian motor industry because in some cases at the moment you have to wait six months for a vehicle. Let me tell you, there are orders in the Commonwealth' car fleet which will be satisfied in months time. So with crocodile tears from the people who have turned the motor vehicle industry into an industrial museum-,-industrial archaeology at its worse-who had no idea, who could not fathom how to produce productivity in those factories, and who watched the Chrysler plant fall to pieces and had to wait for this government to give Australia an Australian motor vehicle industry, this was not the question to ask. Living Standards",53
111,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. Would the minister' advise the House of how Australian families have fared in recent years? In what ways have government policies contributed to family living standards over the past 20 years?,53
112,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members will recall that over the last few days we have heard a variety of utterances from the denizens of the policy-free zone professing concern about the plight of battlers and people on low incomes. Last week the Leader of the Opposition asked a question spuriously purporting to show that there had been a deterioration in the position of battlers under this government. As I pointed out at the time, that analysis is completely flawed for a variety of reasons. Today, I would like to run through a couple of facts about the situation and the circumstances that affect people who can reasonably be described as battlers. The term 'battler' could reasonably describe somebody on two-thirds of average weekly earnings. When I say two-thirds of average male weekly earnings, I am talking about approximately $25,000 a year. That proportion would embrace the majority of manual workers, a high proportion of sales workers and a significant proportion of people who work in operative jobs in factories and so forth. What has happened to somebody in that circumstance under this government? What has happened to a single income family on two-thirds of male average weekly earnings with two dependent children in the period that six the Leader of the Opposition referred to in his question last week-that is, December 1982 to December 1984? Those families have had an increase in their real after tax income of $49 a week. That is very largely due to the improvements in the social safety net, particularly the improvements in family payments. Additionally, those who are renting privately will also now benefit from receiving up to $39 per week in rent assistance where no such assistance was available in 1982. With around 300,000 working families with 700,000 children benefiting from the additional family payment, the Leader of the Opposition over the last week also disparaged the suggestion that the social wage counts for anything significant to help families in that circumstance. I pointed out last week that the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has estimated that the value of what is provided through the social wage components of housing, health, education and child care to a typical family with two children is around $200 a week. That is the monetary value of what is provided through the social wage. In income distribution terms, which you now claim to be concerned about, the social wage is overwhelmingly progressive in its incidence. It is worth around 110 per cent of disposable income for the bottom quintile, the bottom 20 per cent. The second quintile is worth around 70 per cent of disposable income. For the top quintile, it is only worth about nine per cent. It is obviously highly progressive in its incidence. What has happened to those outlays under our government compared with the period when the now Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer? Under his tenure as Treasurer, the value of those social wage payments per capita declined by 17Y2 per cent. Under the present government, the value per capita of those social wage components in real terms has risen by around 75 per cent. That is the contrast. How can opp'osition members come in here. and seriously say that they are concerned about the interests of low income people? When you factor those elements in, the improvement that this government has delivered-particularly to the so-called battlershas been stark. If you look at those who are right at the bottom in terms of income-that is, those who are dependent exclusively on the social safety net-the position becomes even more stark. If you look at",53

114,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,54
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Hang on! The members of the opposition have not heard what I have to say yet-just relax. I saw the minister walk to the dispatch box with those things in his hand. I have just had a chance to quickly look through House of Representatives Practice. Mr Howard interjecting,54
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. I actually just got it from the clerk. The previous practice of speakers is not to permit those sorts of things. I suggest to the minister that, if he wishes to refer to them, he might table something smaller and possibly incorporate it in Hansard.",54
117,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I table that graph. It shows that the real incomes of those who are dependent on pensions, benefits and allowances-particularly those with children and those in rented accommodation-declined severely under the coalition's tenure in office and rose substantially under this government, both in real terms and against any poverty line that is used. That is the real situation in terms of the performance of this government compared with the coalition in assisting battlers. Unemployment",54
118,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that between 40 and 60 per cent of the participants in the government's labour market programs for unemployed people are still unemployed three months after their participation has concluded? Is it also a fact that long-term unemployed people who are still unemployed after these programs are redefined as short-term unemployed, and that the number of long term unemployed people reclassified in this way during 1994-95 will be approximately 70,000? Given that the entire fall in the numbers of long-term unemployed since the Working Nation programs commenced is only 45,500, why should the public not conclude that the fall in long-term unemployment is largely the result of statistical manipulation, and that you are much less interested in helping the unemployed battlers in this country than in hiding them until after the election?",54
119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you may wonder sometimes why government members of this House hold some members of tl).e opposition in contempt. This question is an indication of the bankruptcy-both the moral and economic bankruptcy-of the opposition members' position. Not only are they immoral when it comes to the interests of the unemployed; on top of that, they are not even interested in the national efficiency which comes from it. Last week I thought it might prick their consciences a little to find that the French premier, Juppe, was introducing the very same policies. Juppe set out a plan for the war on unemployment, particularly the long-term unemployed- 'the gangrene of France's society' as he called them. That commentary came from the US Labour Secretary, Mr Reich. What sort of encouragement does the opposition need when we have no lesser person than the Secretary of Labour in the greatest industrial economy in the world saying that your sorts of policies have not worked? What does the opposition want? Jacques Chirac, the President of France, and his premier have said that the sorts of policies the government is supporting in this country are correct. We made very clear in this House in introducing the Working Nation policies",54

123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor will address me and he will make his point of order. The Prime Minister will wait for a moment.,55
124,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask that he be sat down, according to the standing orders.",55
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You will get to your point of order, or I will deal with you.",55
126,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the standing orders of this place require that he be sat down. Is the Prime Minister going to sit down?",55
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He has.,55
128,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you.,55
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order?,55
130,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, standing order 145 refers to relevance. The relevance of this question, Sir, is that 70,000 people who have been recycled and not got a job-",55
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for O'Connor would have been listening at that end of the room, I hope, to the Prime Minister responding to a question on unemployment. He was starting to talk about the One Nation statement as well. He is being entirely relevant. You will resume your seat.",55
132,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has seen a fall in long-term unemployment of 102,000 over the course of the last year.",55
133,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Manipulated.,55
134,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, let the remark of the Leader of the Opposition be recorded. When a long-term unemployed person gets a job, he says it is manipulation.",55
135,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,55
136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,55
137,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the person who, 10 minutes ago, was up there talking about battlers. If a long-term unemployed person is not a battler by his tawdry definition, what is a battler? Then he says, when that person gets back to work, they have been manipulated, their place in the labour market is manipulated.",55

139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,55
140,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Over there they have nO morality about employment-none; you t;lever have had. Bankrupt and immoral is the coalition about employment. Those 102,000 people are into jobs. Some particular labour market programs have greater levels of excess with retention of employment than others. But there is a menu of programs that go to service those who find themselves in particular situations in the labour market. As a consequence, Mr Speaker, it is the totality of the program and the fact that, as you are able to see in the course of this budget, some of the costs of Working Nation have been diminished by its very success-that is, in getting long-term unemployed people back to work. In the 1980s, in any typical sample of 400,000 people back into employment, we would never have got anything like 100,000 long-term unemployed. We might have got 10,000 or 12,000, without the development of these sophisticated labour market programs. To get to 25 per cent is phenomenal. These people in these other countries can only read the statistics in disbelief at what is happening in Australia.",55
141,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,56
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I remind all members of this place of the provisions of standing order 55. The Prime Minister will be heard in silence.,56
143,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are so low as to disparage their place in the labour market, to write them off as being manipulated and to say that the programs have no value-we know that you think they have no value. That is why you want to cut them out. That is where a large part of the $10,000 million of savings are going to come from. You are going to sliceMr Costello-It's 10,000 million now, is it?",56
144,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is two per cent of GDP-$1O billion.",56
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been warned.,56
146,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what you are saying. You have said it-$1O billion. Mr Speaker, as a consequence, they want to cut the labour market programs down. That is where they have come. The honourable member comes to this parliament with some sort of tradition, some sort of intellectual tradition of the Liberal Party. God help the Liberal Party! God help this immoral and bankrupt organisation who disparage the success of the long-term unemployed in getting back to work, and the humanity and the efficiency of case managing them, of being interested in them, of giving them support both in terms of a job subsidy or structured training or the case management to see them go back into these places, to see that we can get down under those 6Y2 per cent levels of unemployment we reached in the late 1980s, with massive levels of employment growth. We could not get under that 6Y2 per cent because we could not get into these people and help them. Now we can, what do we get from you? Disparagement. You besmirch them by saying that they are simply manipulated. That just shows the complete bankruptcy of you, while you are up asking questions about battlers. The gall of you, the unashamed gall of you is just outstanding. Hospitals",56
147,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. The minister would be aware that considerable attention has been given in the media to the report on hospital care in Australia. Can the minister advise the House of the current direction of Commonwealth government programs for Australian public hospitals?,56
148,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was delighted that at a meeting of health ministers, an informal ministerial forum last Friday, there was a considerable spirit of co-operation to address this problem. We were able to announce out of that the formation of a task force which will be chaired by Professor Bruce Armstrong of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and will have representatives of professional bodies, including medical and nursing colleges, Commonwealth and state governments, consumer organisations and . health service executives. That task force will act quickly to recommend to government various changes to the hospital system. Its objectives will be, firstly, to assess and prioritise the leading causes of preventable adverse events and make sure that there are publicly stated strategies to ensure a reduction in the number of adverse events and, similarly, to ensure that there are measures to improve the standard of quality management, indicators to monitor aggregate quality standards in hospitals and, of course, to propose long-term educational and training responses. That will be supported by an advisory structure drawn from practising clinicians and hospital managers. Ministers were very keen to see early results, so there wlII be an interim report by September of this year followed by a final report in December of this year. It is absolutely essential that we maintain public confidence in the health system. I was pleased that ministers were prepared to set aside some of their own personal agendas to work together. I simply advise the House that, in addition to that, there is already in existence a national hospitals demonstration program. This week I actually approved grants totalling $10 million for phase one of that program. That will consist of seven projects involving 40 public hospitals for each state and territory in Australia. ' Just to give members an example, because it obviously relates to the task force work, in South Australia some $1.3 million has been allocated to Queen Elizabeth II Hospital to integrate and coordinate all the facets of surgical services-outpatients, pre-admission clinics, operating theatres and GP liaison. Funding will also be provided for the purchase of operating equipment and instruments to allow for more efficient theatre utilisation. I hope members will also be aware that in the budget there was some $14 million set aside which will enable us immediately to support the work of the task force with practical outcomes. That will support initiatives such as monitoring those adverse events, as the anaesthetists do; developing and implementing clinical practice guidelines; looking at the effectiveness of various interventions; and making sure we have better quality management of our hospitals. Those additional funds, on top of what is re9uired under the Medicare agreements, I thmk need to be underlined. Ministers agreed that they were not clear about the exact level of resources that would be required here, but all are willing to provide them. I simply draw members' attention to the fact that, while I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is now telling us he understands the view of Medicare held by the Australian people and says he will support Medicare, particularly the bulkbilling components of it and community rating of private health insurance, what he does not apparently understand is that the $1 Y2 billion to $3 billion he proposes to give in the way of various tax rebates for private health insurance will inevitably come from the public hospital system.",56
149,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thought we didn't have any policies.,57
150,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the one thing we know about what you propose. We do now know that you support Medicare-a Labor government program. We do know now that you support bulkbilling-a Labor government program. We do know now that, generally speaking, you support our private health insurance reforms. In time, when you look at this and talk to state ministers of a conservative persuasion, you will know that you have to also support decent hospital funding. You cannot take $3 billion out of the system without catastrophic results. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",57
151,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Minister, you told this House last Thursday that when Premier Dean Brown telephoned you oil the morning of Saturday July 9 last year you had not made a decision to ban the Hindmarsh Island bridge and you were still considering the matter. I know that you have no records or you have lost them, but Optus records show that Premier Dean Brown's telephone call to you fincost ished between 11.07 a.m. and 11.08 a.m., eastern standard time, that morning. Your senior adviser stated in the Federal Court that you had made the decision at 11.15 a.m., eastern standard time, that morning. Did you mislead Premier Brown then, and therefore this House last Thursday, or are you asking us to believe that you made this important decision in the seven minutes after you put down the phone?",57
152,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is absolutely nothing raised in the honourable member's question which in any way contradicts my public statements in this matter, including my statements in the parliament. But I say this to the honourable member for Barker: have you no shame?",57
153,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,57
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,57
155,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After all the honourable member for Barker has done in respect of this matter to irretrievably damage his own reputation and standing, to spread smears against Aboriginal women who have been involved in this matter-the tawdry misappropriation of my mail, the distribution of it across the country, sending it to solicitors in the other party to this court action-for him to ask me this question shows that indeed he has no shame. The honourable member's role in this matter has not stopped. I have now seen a statement by an officer of the Attorney General's Department which shows that on Thursday, 1 June an officer from the member  phone to the Attorney-General's departmental office. The statement says: He said Barker's officehe had a copy of a document which was a letter dated 8 July 1994 from methat is the officer concernedto Mr Roger Dobb in ATSIC, enclosing a draft declaration signed by the Minister. Surprise, surprise-the next day the Adelaide Advertiser rings the same officer with the same document. Surprise, surprise-the Adelaide Advertiser puts it on the front page of Saturday's paper.",57
156,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So what!,58
157,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You say, 'So what!' Mr MCGauran-Put him in gaol!",58
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for joint Gippsland is trying my patience.,58
159,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You great believer in propriety, you great believer in proper cess, you great believer in the independence of the judiciaryMr MCLachlan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was simply about whether or not the minister misled Premier Brown that morning or whether or not he running made the decision in seven minutes. That's we ask.",58
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is order. He is responding to the question that was put to him on this particular issue which is ongoing.,58
161,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition interjects, 'So what!' I will tell him so what because this fresh allegation, that peddled again in the Adelaide Saturday morning, was expressly rejected by Mr Justice O'Loughlin in the Federal Court of Australia. When these issues were raised with me last Monday I just did not issue a denial myself; what I said was that there had already been a judicial inquiry into my conduct. If anyone in this matter ought to hang his head in shame, it is the member for Barker. Queensland: Criminal Investigations",58
162,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. The minister will be aware of the repeated questioning of his representative in the Senate, Senator BolkusMr Downer interjecting Mr Howard interjecting",58
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Reid will wait for a moment. The member for Mayo and the Leader of the Opposition will stop interjecting across the chamber at the minister. He has finished his response.,58
164,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will be aware of the repeated questioning of his representative in the Senate, Senator Bolkus, inferring that this government first sought to prevent, and then pressured and sought to influence, investigations by the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies into allegations arising out of 'Operation Wallah'-a investigation by the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission and the Queensland police. As the minister responsible for proCommonwealth law enforcement agencies, can you inform the House of the current situation in relation to this matter? Has there been any political interference?",58
165,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and for his interest in this long matter. Earlier today I announced that all the Australian Federal Police had concluded its investigation into allegations arising from in the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission's OperationWallah. Members of this House will know that the Australian Federal Police has found that the allegations that former Senator Graham Richardson and the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, was had committed Commonwealth offences were Advertiser on without substance. In my statement this morning I emphatically stated that the investigation was completely free of interference from the government. But the investigation was not completely free of political interference. The opposition disgrace- do. fully and continually interfered in this matter, jeopardising the investigation and intentionally damaging the reputation of accused individuals. As part of its campaign, the opposition obtained information about the investigation which appears to have been leaked from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. The leaking of that material is currently being examined by an inquiry in Queensland. The opposition used that leaked information, which was only unsubstantiated allegations, to launch a vicious, baseless and politically motivated smear campaign under the cover of parliamentary privilege. The opposition's greatest muck-raker in this matter has been Senator Chapman, assisted by several of his colleagues. But the hypocrisy and determination to subvert the police process extended beyond the opposition's low ranking dullards. The failed former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, set up",58
166,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is inappropriate in this place for a minister to accuse a member of another place of subverting the police process. If he wishes to do so, he must do so by way of substantive motion. I suggest that he withdraw the remark and either put forward a motion or defer it altogether.",59
167,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order, Mr Speaker: members of the House of Representatives are abused daily in the Senate. They are abused daily, and without any reference to standing orders. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that what the minister has said is completely in order.",59
168,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The right honourable member for New England rightly draws the attention of the House to comments that all people make in this place from time to time. r suggest the Minister for Justice be a bit careful in his response to this question.,59
169,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The failed former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, set up an opposition committee to further that smear campaign. So day after day Senator Chapman and his cohorts shuffled into cowards' castle and ran a coordinated campaign, with their leader's blessing, of sleaze, smear and innuenMr Downer-That is untrue.",59
170,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Mayo can repudiate any allegations in the appropriate way.,59
171,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The campaign was conducted without regard to the rights of the accused. The presumption of innocence has ceased to matter to the opposition. Members of the opposition have totally disregarded the proper conduct of law enforcement investigations. But such conduct by the opposition should be no surprise to members of this House. Publicising private tax records, endorsing push polling and opening other people's mail are all part of a continuing pattern of offensive behaviour that seems to have accelerated under the current leader. Australian Flag",59
172,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister in relation to one true nation and its important cohesive symbols. When you were in Papua New Guinea in 1992 you said to a young Papuan: You've got an Australian flag, have you? I will get you a new one soon. You have told this House that you do not respect the flag and that you want it changed. When will you detail your plans to change our national flag? Will it be in your parliamentary statement on Wednesday night, or are you planning a change of our foremost national symbol by stealth?",59
173,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suppose Mossad put the boy there-like Mossad took Malcolm Fraser's trousers, eh? Was it a Mossad plot? Maybe it was a Mossad plot, because the Leader of the National Party said that Mossad took Malcolm Fraser's trousers. He did. It comes along with other remarks about the Jewish state and its intelligence organisation as well. On Wednesday night I will be giving a statement to the parliament, advancing the government's commitment at the last election to move Australia towards a republic; that is, the first change I want to see in Australia is an Australian person as head of state. For the moment that quest is large enough. The seminal issue is whether this country is a country independent of itself, able to represent itself, or must its head of state be the monarch of another country? That is the critical issue. That is the issue the government will be attending to first. World Environment Day",59
174,Mr KNOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs aware that today is World Environment Day? Does the overseas aid program take into account environmental issues in developing its programs? What active steps is the government taking to assist developing countries to alleviate serious environmental problems in the developing world?,60
175,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. His concern with environmental matters is well known, and I appreciate his signifying this important day with this question. Many of the developing countries we help through the aid program face severe environmental challenges, and many of those challenges have a direct impact on Australia. The fact is that Australia has the product, the expertise and the know-how to assist our neighbours to meet those environmental challenges. The well-being of all of us depends on the environment-on its ability to provide agricultural products, safe and plentiful water, clean air, a predictable and favourable climate, and a diversity of living species. Recognising this, the aid program helps to ensure that all of our activities are based on the philosophy of ecologically sustainable development. That is set out in a document I tabled last year called Towards a sustainable future. Our environmental activities are funded through the aid program to the tune of over $160 million this year-that is over 10 per cent of our aid program-increased from $120 million last year. This year's program included a $25 nillion four-year program for clean coal technology in India, which will promote energy efficiency and improve environmental standards in the coal sector. We have introduced specific environmental initiatives, such as a $20 million 'green DIFF' program under which we supply competitive Australian technology in the environmental area to a number of countries, and major initiatives in population, health and refugee programs which all go to improve the environment. In AusAID's environmental program, we have, for example, a $31 million coal gasification plant in Hainan province in China, which I am going to see shortly. That will save hundreds of people's lives each year by replacing the burning of coal briquettes in the home with cleaner coal gas. That will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 94 per cent, carbon monoxide emissions by 83 per cent, and particulates and benzines by over 90 per cent. In the South Pacific, as the Prime Minister knows well, because he chaired the session of the South Pacific Forum which supported these initiatives, we have given a new policy emphasis on sustainability-working together with Pacific island countries on sustainable forest and fisheries practices through to projects which monitor sea level rises and assist biodiversity in the region. There are very many of these projects through the aid program-I will not go into detail-which help the environment. Also through the aid program we make a major commitment to global and regional environmental conventions. We have allocated $72.6 million for the global environment facility which supports projects addressing climate change, polluted international waterways, loss of plant and animal species and ozone depletion. We allocated a further $11 million under the Montreal protocol to transfer expertise and ozone friendly technology to developing new countries. We are the only country which has an environmental audit of our aid program. The fourth of those is due for release this year. I believe that the environmental credentials of the government, through the aid program, are impeccable.",60
176,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Speaker",60
177,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Is it a fact that you support a Westminster-sty Ie independent Speaker in terms similar to those proposed by me yesterday? Are you aware of a paper distributed in 1979 and afterwards and quite recently of unknown authorship on the implementation of the Westminster convention in the ALP? Have you discussed your ideas with the Prime Minister? Are you confident that he might be persuaded?,61
178,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yes, I am aware of the Westminster convention as proposed by Speaker Snedden. In fact, I have a copy of that abbreviated document here, which I am happy to table. I also have a copy of the response that came from the Prime Minister of the day about that proposal. I have to say that I generally agree with most of the sentiments contained within that. Have I discussed the issue with the Prime Minister? The answer is no.",61
179,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,You agree with the sentiments in the Fraser reply or in the document?,61
180,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I agree essentially with the sentiments in the Fraser reply about the difficulties of implementing the system. That is not to sayMr Downer-But you are in favour of it?,61
181,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"No. I ask the member for Mayo not to put words in my mouth. I will table both of those for the interest of honourable members. As far as my own position on this is concerned, as I said when I was elected to this very high office in this place, I will endeavour to execute its responsibilities to the best of my ability, and I stand by that. Speaker",61
182,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, given the position the nation is now in with this great social and economic change and the linkages into Asia, would you believe that the modality of the election or status of the Speaker of the House of Representatives was central to the nation's progress?",61
183,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. I· think that question calls for an expression of opinion.",61
184,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yes, it probably does. I think I will get out of it on that basis. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his help. NA",61
185,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",61
186,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,61
187,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,61
188,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,61
189,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in answer to a question from somebody on the government side, said-and I have obtained a transcript of what the Prime Minister said'Here we have the Leader of the Opposition on radio today saying, ""The social wage, what does that matter?'"" That is completely and utterly manufactured. I made absolutely no reference to the social wage in any radio interview that I gave today. I gave one radio interview today, and that was to Alan Jones, and the Prime Minister clearly has a copy of the transcript of the interview because he quoted from it in relation to the ASIS matter. The only reference that I have made to the social wage was at a press conference on 30 May. I certainly did not say the social wage does not matter. I certainly did not use words to that effect. To the best of my recollection, I have never used words to that effect. The Prime Minister has deliberately misled the House once again.",61
190,Mr KEATING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Mr SPEAKER -',61
191,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Just a minute, Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition I know comes with the best intentions when he takes a personal explanation and he goes to the heart of the matter, but then he just twists it at the end. Could you withdraw the last",61
192,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,What? That he deliberately,61
193,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,'Misled the parliament' I think are the words that you used.,61
194,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,With respect,61
195,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"If you want to press it, then move an appropriate motion.",61
196,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Could I seek your guidance. Here we have a case of a cold piece of deception.,62
197,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,But you have taken the opportunity under the standing orders,62
198,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Mr SPEAKER ,62
199,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No, just a minute. We are not debating it. You have taken, rightly, your opportunity to show where you have been misrepresented, and at the end you said that the Prime Minister deliberately misled the parliament. You know that, under the standing orders, you can do that only by way of a substantive motion. Are you proposing to do that? If not, I would ask you to withdraw that particular imputation on the Prime Minister in line with the standing orders and practice of the House. I simply ask you to withdraw. Does the Leader of the Opposition not withdraw?",62
200,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No, I am not going to withdraw that. I will move a substantive motion.",62
201,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Okay. This is your opportunity.,62
202,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am certainly not going to withdraw something that is utterly reasonable in the circumstances. NA Motion of Condemnation,62
203,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"by leave-I move: That this House condemns the Prime Minister for deliberately misleading the House by claiming the Leader of the Opposition had said 'The social wage; what does that matter?' when he had not done so. This motion goes very much to the heart of the political battle that will be waged in Australia over the next few months-that is, who are the Australian people more likely to believe: Paul Keating or John Howard. It is a very simple proposition.",62
204,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Opposition members interjecting,62
205,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The Prime Minister will put that away. Opposition members-Name him.,62
206,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Mr Speaker, you have warned him. What are you going to do about it? You talk about upholding the standards of the speakership; what are you going to do about that? Nothing. You will do nothing about it. This election campaign that the Australian nation is about to engage in-and the deceiver goes scurrying from the Houseis all about the credibility of the two people who seek the highest office in this country. I welcome the opportunity to move a motion condemning the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) for having deliberately misled the parliament today. What the Prime Minister has done in the House today is to give to all members of the parliament, to those in the public gallery and to those who may be listening to this debate-a classic case study of why the Australian people no longer believe the current Prime Minister of Australia. Ms Crawford-Rubbish; he is ahead in the polls.",62
207,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Which poll have you been reading, Mary? I would be very careful before I made those sorts of interjections. This is all about credibility. Mr Speaker, let me take you back to question time. I want the parliament to listen very carefully to this cold hard evidence of why I have brought this motion on. In answer to a question, this is what the Prime Minister had to say: These are the same people who want to take away not simply these things in the labour market, but all of those other conditions in the social wage. And here we have the Leader of the Opposition on radio today saying, 'The social wage, what does that matter.' That was not a vague statement; it was not an expression of opinion; it was not an exaggeration; it was, in our view, a straight-out lie. I repeat that: it was a straight-out lie, lie, lie by the Prime Minister. He had no warrant, no justification for making that statement, but so used is he to getting away with telling lies, so protected is he with the paraphernalia of government, so drunk with power has he grown after 12 years in office, so believing has he become in his own infallibility and so authoritarian has he become, that that is how he behaves. He is the man who would now gaol journalists because they might embarrass his government; the man who tried to prevent political advertisements appearing on television and radio; the man who brands anybody who disagrees with his views on ethnic or Aboriginal affairs as a racist; the man who is prepared to ring up businessmen and abuse them, not because they have done anything against the national interest but because they have had the temerity to disagree with Paul Keating. You ask the Housing Industry Association; you go and ask the former chairman of Du Pont, Richard Warburton; you go and ask a whole range of other people. This is the man who plays winner takes all politics. This is the man who will, quite literally, say or do anything in order to remain in office. As we get closer to the election and as the battlers of Australia vent their spleen and fury against the Prime Minister, he becomes ever more desperate; he becomes ever more uncaring about the truth; he becomes ever more willing to deceive and to lie to Australian people. This is no marginal case; this is not a grey area; this is not even an for any serious debate. Here the Prime believe Minister has been caught out red-handed. deliberately lied. The reason I say he deliberately lied, deliberately misled the parliament, and this was the cause of my refusing to withdraw my remark and moving this motion-I want the House to listen to this very carefully-is he had in front of him a transcript of the only interview that I have given today. The Prime Minister said in the answer to a question, 'The Leader of the Opposition on radio today' - and I had a transcript made of what he said-'said, ""The social wage, what does that matter.'"" I gave only one interview on radio today. It was an interview given to Alan Jones on radio station 2UE this morning. The Prime Minister quoted from the first answer in that interview in the question he answered regardis ing ASIS. He referred, once again dishonestly, once again untruthfully and once again fraudulently, to what I had said in that swer. He claimed that I had said the opposiber tion was totally opposed to what the government was proposing and that, in some way, I was in some great collision with the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). The truth is that the Prime Minister knew what I had said today. He knew that I had made no reference to a social wage. Despite that, with reckless indifference to the ordinary basic truth that he increasingly displays as desperately he is pushed towards the next election campaign, he quite dishonestly represented to the parliament of the Australian people that I had said something that I had not even remotely gone near saying today. It was not an accident, it was not an exaggeration, it was not a piece of political hyperbole; it was a lie, a straight-out deception of the Australian people. I pose the questionand I am sure many people who are listening to this will also pose the question-that, if the their Prime Minister can be so careless, can be so dishonest, can be so untruthful and can tell such a deliberate lie about such a relatively unimportant matter as this in the hurly burly the of debate, how can the Australian people believe him whenever he says anything? You area have to ask the question: why should people anything that Paul Keating says? They He do not. Why should the Australian people believe him after his long record of having misled and deceived the Australian people? After all, the Prime Minister was the person who said that he was going to deliver the l-aw tax cuts. Remember those? They have gone that out the window. Remember when he went to the press club before the last election and he said, 'I'm going to reduce company tax down to 33c.' What is happening at the present time? It is going up to 35c. Remember he was the person who, during the last election campaign, campaigned against our proposals because he said they involved increasing indirect taxation. What did he do immediately after he was returned to office? He bunged up indirect taxation right across the board. What is he doing in the current budget? He once again repudiating that commitment and bunging up taxation once again. Remember his promise of no more budget deficits anafter the recession we had to have? Rememthe promise about no taxes for age pensioners? Remember the promise about $100 million to buy private hospital beds to reduce queues? Remember the matching funding for money raised by charitable institutions during a Christmas appeal? What a rotten, contemptible piece of deception that is-to mislead the great welfare bodies of Australia on the eve of Christmas and then welsh on that commitment. That is the kind of deception for which this man, who parades as the great unifier of the nation, is responsible. But on this occasion the Prime Minister has been totally caught out. He has been totally exposed. The reason that he has been totally exposed is simple. The charge legitimately being made by the coalition against the Prime Minister that he has lost touch with the Australian battler is starting to hurt, is starting to bite and is starting to The reason it is starting to hurt, the reason it is starting to bite, the reason it is starting to sting, is simple. Unlike the propaganda that is spewed out from the government side, the allegation that the Labor Party has betrayed the Australian battler is an allegation. of substance; it is true. What does the Prime Minister do in response to an allegation of substance? The Prime Minister lurches into what he knows best. And what this man knows better than anything else is how to lie and distort his way across the Australian political scene. The Australian public has grown very tired of those lies and distortions. It has grown very tired not only of his arrogance but of his lies and distortions. The reality is that this man has promised so many economic recoveries, only to have all of his exaggerated prognostications about the future not delivered. He is the person who rhetorically said that the budget had brought home the bacon. He was the person who said that the Australian economy was flowing over with effervescence. There is one thing you have to say about the Prime Minister that really demonstrates his capacity not only for self-delusion but also for deliberate, dishonest deception of the Australian people, and that is his capacity",62
208,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIME MINISTER,That is against the standing orders. Withdraw.,64
209,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I don't withdraw something that's true, and it is true. Nothing demonstrates it more than the absolute inability of the Prime Minister to ever acknowledge that there may be somebody else to blame. Everybody else is to blame for anything in this country that goes wrong but never the current Prime Minister. He has this remarkable capacity to believe that, if something goes wrong, it is the fault of the foreigner, it is the fault of the former government, it is the fault of Sir Henry Parkes or one of the other Founding Fathers, or it is the fault of the prophet Moses. And so the list goes on. Then we have this extraordinary situation today. He was asked a question about the manipulation of unemployment figures. He demonstrated once again his dishonesty. He sting. did not know the answer to the question so, instead of sitting down and saying that he would try to find out-and he might have won the respect of the House for doing it-he waved around a copy of the Financial Times and tried to suggest that in some way people who lived in and operated governments in Europe were impressed with what was happening in Australia. He has played fast and loose with the statistical truth. He and his government have been responsible for deliberately manipulating figures on Australia's long-term unemployed. The hpnourable member for Goldstein asked an entirely appropriate question. The honourable member for Goldstein wanted to know why the Prime Minister had permitted this manipulation of figures to disclose the true depth of the crisis in long-term unemployment in Australia. Instead of being treated to a proper answer, he was treated to a tirade of dishonest abuse. But that is something for which the Prime Minister has become absolutely famous in this parliament. I return to the basis of the charge that is brought against the Prime Minister today and the reason why I have taken the unusual step of moving this motion. I did it for a very deliberate reason. If I can take the parliament back to the sequence of events: Mr Speaker, I sought to make a personal explanation. In the course of that explanation I made the claim that the Prime Minister had deliberately deceived the parliament. You said that that was exceeding what was appropriate when it came to a personal explanation, so you invited me to move a substantive motion. The reason why I have moved this substantive motion is that this particular piece of deception is not your common or garden variety of Keating deception; this is coldblooded, clinical, deliberate deceit-because he had the evidence. It is one thing-and this is the gravamen of the argument-for somebody to indulge in a bit of exaggeration and hyperbole. It is a completely different thing when you have the evidence of your lie in front of you and, despite having the evidence of your lie in front of you, you deliberately proceed to tell that lie. That is exactly what the Prime Minister did on this occasion. He was the person who had the transcript. He had a transcript in front of him of the interview with Alan Jones this morning. This interview he had taken faithfully. The NMLS had given him the transcript. Good on him. I am glad he reads everything I say. I have news for him-I read it too. It so happens that on this occasion his version of the facts was completely at odds with the truth. At no stage this morning did I make any reference to the social wage. The only reference that I have made to the social wage over the last week was in answer to a question that was asked of me at a doorstop on 30 May. I did not on that occasion say that the social wage did not matter. I simply disputed the proposition that had been made that in some way the social wage made up for the fact that under the Keating government the living standards of Australian battlers had fallen. That was the assertion that I had made and the riposte of the government was, 'Look, you have got the social wage and you wave it all around and it all whirrs back into balance and everything is okay.' What I said in response to that question was that I did not believe that the impact of the social wage wiped out the gap that had developed between the rich and the poor. That is what I said; that is there. the Prime Minister had bothered to read that transcript, if he had been instructed by that transcript, he would not have got into this bother. But I think the truth is that the Prime Minister had read both transcripts. The Prime Minister knew that there was nothing in my transcript this morning which said anything at all about the social wage. But that fact was of no concern to him. He operates on the principle, 'I lied to the Australian people at the last election and I got away with it; I got re-elected. I lied to them about l-a-w law tax cuts. I lied to them about budget deficits. I lied to them about interest rates and so forth. I thought I could get away with it. I got away with it at the last election. I will keep on doing it until I get caught out and, even if I then get caught out, I will keep on doing it.' Let me say to you, Mr Speaker: under the procedures of this House, which you invited me to use because you believed that it was inappropriate to accuse the Prime Minister of deception in a personal explanation, I charge the Prime Minister with having today deliberately deceived the parliament of Australia by falsely and dishonestly alleging I had said something about the social wage that I plainly had not. I further add that the charge is made all the more serious by the fact that he had the evidence of his lie in front of him, yet he deliberately chose to make the lie, tell the untruth and, therefore, deceive the Australian people.",64
210,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded? Mr Costello-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,65
211,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"What a desperate, empty individual! The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) already has the electoral rattles. You can feel them already. One poll goes against him and straight away he is in here slinking up to the Speaker asking for a personal explanation to misrepresent me. He cannot cut it in question time and he has started to get the rattles. Let me demonstrate the arrant dishonesty of the opposition leader. His whole claim is about whether this statement was made in a If radio station transcript-or when it was made. Worse than being made on a radio program, he made this statement in a considered press statement. What I said in paraphrasing the Leader of the Opposition",65
212,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Opposition members interjecting,66
213,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence.,66
214,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"I will demonstrate what a chronic liar he is in a moment. I misparaphrased him as saying: The social wage, what does this matter? This is what he complains of. This is what he said: · .. nor has the so-called social wage done anything to halt the slide of Australian families In other words, why have it? When I mentioned in the House the fact that he had admonished the value of the social wage, he concurred with his interjection and his nod. Here he is fulminating about whether it was said today on a radio program. That was his whole case. All these fulminations, all these vicious words and phrases, are about whether it was said on radio today. It was said in a press release a couple of days ago. He said: · .. nor has the so-called social wage ... Can you imagine the cynicism and the deceptiveness of this person. He absolutely stays away from the truth like Dracula from a wooden stake. If he has a choice between telling the truth or telling a downright lie, he will take the lie every time. He said: · . . nor has the so-called social wage done anything to halt the slide of Australian families ... I paraphrased him as saying: The social wage, what does that matter? He said that I am dishonest, untruthful, a liar and all these things. Let other assessors assess his state of mind because he is going ratty already. There has been some modest shift in the polls and already he is flaking. He is like he was in the late 1980s when he was the Leader of the Opposition. He would sit there with his white knuckles through question time flaking away because he could not take the heat in the kitchen. That is what happened today. A reference to the social wage in his own press statement was quoted, which read: · .. nor has the so-called social wage done anything to halt the slide of Australian families Professor Ann Harding, a recognised expert on income distribution, said in reference to the opposition that it was misleading not to take account of the social wage. She went on to say that the social wage was worth almost $200 a week to a family with two children. Furthermore, her research shows that this government's spending on the social wage significantly narrows the gap between the richest and the poorest. The social wage expenditure is both pro-poor and pro-family. But what does the Leader of the Opposition say? He says: ... nor has the social wage done anything to halt ... the slide of Australian families . . . This is the so-called supporter of those whom he cynically calls the battlers. Let me make a categorical reference to the actual level of payments paid now and those paid under the coalition between 1975 and 1983. Under the coalition when this man was Treasurer, for a sole parent with two children renting privately the real change per week was a $5 reduction, a decline of 3.9 per cent. Under this government in the period March 1983 to September 1994, there was an increase of $83 per week or 36 per cent. Under the Leader of the Opposition, the figure went down $5 a week or 3.9 per cent over seven years. Under Labor it went up $83 a week or 36 per cent. Yet the Leader of the Opposition has the gall and the cynicism to say that the social wage does not matter. Let me talk about unemployed, newstart allowable single adults who are 21 or over. Under the Leader of the Opposition's government, the amount paid to them declined by $14.64 a week. Under Labor that amount has increased by $66 a week. It has gone from a $14 a week decline to a $66 a week improvement. Yet you have the gall and the vicious temerity to say that the social wage does not matter. When I pick you up on it, you go bleating to the Speaker after question time. You were running around like the desperate, empty individual you are. You cannot cu- it at question time. What was the big quest-on that you asked the Speaker after questIOn time? Whether or not the Speaker should have an independent status. In the whole great ... social and economic change of Australia in the last 12 years with the move into Asia, what is his big policy question? Whether the Speaker is independent. Big deal! As if you clowns could run a government or run a country. The Leader of the Opposition has been faced with these facts about the social wage under him and under us and has been faced with his own press release which says: ... nor has the so-called social thing to halt the slide of Australian families . . . But where does his claim about me misNo, representing him go now? Nowhere. I have that it does not. paraphrased him almost perfectly in the intonation of his question. This man opposite was up there talking about me being a liar. You know what the Illawarra Mercury said of him: he is the only minister in the postwar years to wear the admonition on the front page, 'Lies, lies, lies.' Why did they say that? Because he was a liar and he is a liar. He is a person who will say and do anything to save his own miserable hide. Let us remember when the tax system under the opposition leader was criminally evaded. Every sleaze in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane came up to him and the Liberal Party and said, 'Lay off us; don't touch us; let us rip the Commonwealth income to pieces through criminal avoidance,' and little Honest John turned his back. The term 'Honest John' was meant as a spoof on the fact that he turned his back on the interests of the public and the Commonwealth by accommodating every sleaze-ball that was tied up with the Liberal Party through the 1970s. Every decent Australian still remembers that. When talking about this whole thing about the rich and the poor and the gap and the battlers, he said that independent studies demonstrate that it does not help. The question he was asked was: You do not accept that the social wage makes up for this economic gap? He replied: No, I don't and independent studies demonstrate that it does not. Which independent study, Honest John? No independent study is the answer. Let the public take a measure of the honesty and cynicism of this person. I paraphrased him as saying: The social wage, what does this matter? I will make two references to what he said. In his own press statement, he said: . .. nor has the so-called social wage done anything to halt the slide of Australian families ... He was asked the question: You do not accept that the social wage makes up wage done any- . for this economic gap? He replied: I don't and independent studies demonstrate Have I misrepresented him at all? I have not misrepresented him whatsoever. I paraphrased him by saying: The social wage, what does that matter? When asked whether the .social wage actually makes up the economic gap, he said: No, I don't and independent studies demonstrate that it does not. In other words, his total contempt for the social wage is contained in his published statement. When I had the temerity to paraphrase him, and he acknowledges it in the parliament, he was stung and he was up whingeing to you, Mr Speaker, about being misrepresented. When you quite properly said to him that he should withdraw any imputation of dishonesty against me, that is more than his rattled nerves could take and he moved into an unprepared salvo of abuse which the House and the press gallery can make a judgment on. There is nothing to John Howard. He is the same person he was in the 1980s. He had nothing to him then and he has nothing to him now. When the income of these people who he cynically calls battlers went down by $14 a week under a Liberal government but rose by $66 a week under Labor only the most cynical and dishonest person would get up and say of his party that they represent battlers. Only the most cynical and dishonest of people would deny the fact that there has been a $66 increase for these people under Labor against a $14 decrease under his government or, in the case of a sole parent with two children, an $83 increase under Labor as opposed to a $5 decrease under his government. In the face of these facts, published data from the Department of Social Security, how could you say that the coalition represents battlers? How could you with any honesty or credibility say that? He wants to be known as an honest person, but how could an honest person say these things? How could a credible person say these thirigs? How could an honest person say that the social wage does not make up the economic gap and that independent studies demonstrate that it does not when he cannot point to one independent study that says that. What we saw the Leader of the Opposition do today was fly off the handle. We saw his nerves rattled. I will have him rattling like a billionaires baby before his time as opposition leader is up. I will have him in the same state of mental distress as his predecessor was before he threw in the sponge. We know about the member for Bennelong because we have watched him before. We have been over the ground. We know his tawdry history and how he treats Australians of low income and diminished social standing who are without economic power. We have seen him oppose every wage increase since 1991, bar two-the last two $8 wage increases. He has supported wage increases of $16 in 14 years. He has supported two $8 a week wage increases in 14 years. He has opposed every other wage increase yet he says that he is in favour of battlers. He came up in the John Carrick school of high political cynicism. Any lie or distortion serves the day. Whether it is Chinese coming down in sampans to get us, reds under beds, Indonesians coming to get us or the Petrov royal commission, it is just the same old Liberal Party with the same old empty leaders saying the same old deceptive things, but this time the public is not silly enough to wear any of it. They know that John Howard cut their incomes to pieces. They know that he has opposed every wage increase since 1981 bar two, which were only worth $16 in 14 years. They know that he says that the social wage does not matter and when he gets picked up on it in parliament he wants to bleat and tum to references like 'dishonesty', 'untruthful' and 'liar'. Let the public judge this character. Let them judge him on the fact that he has no substance and has no policies and as a person in the political change business is worth nothing. He was a failure as Treasurer and is a failure as opposition leader and now he flaunts his failure by coming into the House to try to pick the government up as the only party that actually supports working Australians and low income people, and tries to dishonestly claim that in some way I misrepresented him. I completely represented him when I said that I paraphrased his press release by saying, 'The social wage, what does that matter?' To try to pretend that his case revolves around whether he said this today on radio is the refuge of a coward.",66
215,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"On 9 December 1991, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rose at a press conference in Parliament House and said: Could I, in my first words as Prime Minister elect, Leader of the Labor Party elect, to you, the Australian people, say that I want to make three commitments to them. The first is I pledge to give them everything I've got to the job and the country. The second is to deal honestly with the people, to tell them the truth. He must have known deep in his heart that this would have meant a radical change in attitude. He went on to say: In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much as is humanly possible. Mr Speaker, when you say the Lord's Prayer every day and mention 'lead us not into temptation', I think of him. We need to pray much harder at the opening of parliamentary sessions. The Prime Minister said, 'I promise to tell them the truth.' I will tell you something about this prime ministership: it was conceived in treachery and brought forward in fraud. It is conceived in treachery by doing in his Prime Minister and brought forth in fraud. He must have known that he had a deep credibility problem with the Australian people because he went out and said, 'I promise to tell you the truth.' He has done nothing like it. If you actually deal with the substance of the motion before the House it is an open and shut case. Mr Adams-Ha, hal",68
216,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"I know that people like the member chuckling, who do not understand these things, will vote the way the party tells them to. I appeal to the people of Australia and those that are sitting in the gallery to look at this on its merits. The motion before the House condemns the Prime Minister for deliberately misleading the House by claiming that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) had said, 'The social wage, what does that matter?' There is one thing and one thing alone that those on the other side of the House have to do in this debate. They have to stand up with the transcript which bears the words, 'The social wage, what does that matter?' That is all they have to do. That is what the Prime Minister said. He could here and said that he got it wrong, he made a mistake or he did not say that, but all he did was repeat it in the House and assert it as a fact. We on this side of the House are getting sick and tired of the way in which you put out a deliberate distortion and say it over and over again and try to pretend that it is a truth. It does not matter how many times you a lie, it is still a lie. It does not matter many times you repeat it, it does not get truer. When listening to the Prime Minister's statement, did you hear that phrase in transcript? Could it be produced or was it produced? No, there was an ominous silence. It was never said. It was a complete concoction from the great concoctor on that side of the House. He came in here with a press release in which the Leader of the Opposition very carefully analysed statistics which show the way in which the battlers in the Australian community are being left behind by this government. It went through real wages and the Australian workers who have been forced to rely on unemployment. benefits. It went through housing loan affordability. But you could have overlooked all of those points if you could pull out of that press release the phrase 'The social wage, what does that matter?' It was not there. Did you notice the way the Prime Minister used the phrases 'in substance', 'in fact', 'if you looked at the overall concoction' and 'paraphrase'.",69
217,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,'Underlining'.,69
218,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, and 'underlining'. There was nothing in that press release whatsoever which justified the allegation. If Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) had a shred of integrity, if he had the kind of . integrity that his father used to show in this House, he would get up and admit that fact. I often think of your father, too. Remember the great statement your father made when he joined the Labor Party, that it had the cream of the working class and now it had the dregs of the middle class? He was speaking about you-the dregs of the middle class. You are the kind of person that had a start in life with an honest father and turned it all around because you prostituted yourself at the foot of have come in a lying Prime Minister. I will tell you what is wrong with this government. Once the guy at the top starts making it up, starts lying, the corruption runs right through the government because they all start trying to justify it. You all have to come to his defence and try to pretend that black is white. You all have to come in and try to say prove that what is wrong is right. That is how what you do, and you will do it again at the any dispatch box. You always do it. I sometimes wonder what your father would think about any that kind of performance. I know that he would not approve of it. The fact is that you cannot come out with a quote because it does not exist. I will tell you what else the Prime Minister did in question time today. He said that we were going to cut $10 billion worth of expenditure, then he looked at me and said, 'You've said it.' I have never said it. The Prime Minister thinks that by repeating these things over and over again they will be true, like the way he tries to rewrite Australian history in relation to Singapore, in relation to the engagement with Asia, and in relation to his maths. He has this sort of Jack Lang view of the world. Without education or without thinking, he was arrested at about the age of 18, shortly before he was sacked by David Jones. Yet he goes over and over it as though doing that is somehow going to make it true. The sad thing is that there are Australians who can be taken in by that. If you actually boil it down and look at the facts, there is nothing but distortion and lies running through this administration. You are only on that side of the House because at the last election you said you could cut income tax without having a GST, that you could match our income taxes without a GST. If I heard it once, I heard it a thousand timesthat is, no GST. What was it that the Prime Minister said? He did not say that he was promising to reduce income taxes, he actually said that he had legislated them. He said that they were l-a-w. He went down to the press club and he said that you should know the difference between a promise and l-a-w. Where are those tax cuts-the l-a-w which turned into the great l-i-e-which are due on 1 January 1996? What else did he say? In relation to cars, he said it was going to be a permanent reduction. He was asked about that today. He got up and said, 'Don't you know it was just for the cyclical change? We took it down when there was a downturn.' But that was not the point. The Prime Minister actually stood up and said that he was going to reduce it permanently. He said to this House in February 1992: From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent. The only thing that was permanent about that promise was the permanent expectation that every time he says something he breaks his word, that every time he says something he lies. It was an administration which was conceived in deception. You said at the last election you were going to take age pensioners out of the tax system. Explain what happened to that promise. Where is it? Why are they paying tax? I will tell you why: it was another election promise which was conceived in deception, a deception which starts at the top and runs right down like a crooked corrupt stain through this administration. What about Tony Cole's exposes in relation to the economic forecast on One Nation? He said they were straining credibility and we had political interference. We said at the time that the One Nation program could not be done but we did not know how far the Prime Minister was prepared to go, to actually intervene out of his office and to manipulate those forecasts. We got the truth from Tony Cole, who just so happened to be moved out of the department years after the event. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) must really kill the Australian people. He gets up at the dispatch box, looks over there and says, 'Never has my credibility been impugned.' We have one of the great deceivers standing up there impugning everybody's credibility on a daily basis. When he cannot find a half truth, he starts with a zero truth. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) got up today and said, 'Those terrible people in the Senate, look what they did. They did this and they did that. ' Yet he is standing beside a Prime Minister who deliberately misled the House in relation to his statement. How can you run an administration, even with these self-righteous left types which are on the outer flanks of this administration, when the core is absolutely corrupt and rotten? When you have a Prime Minister who is prepared to stand there and concoct stories to suit his case, who is prepared to lie and deceive, who has lost respect for the truth, it is not only a sad day for the people of Australia but a doubly sad day for the government. A lot has probably been said in this chamber over the years but Ido not think this chamber has ever seen somebody with the willingness, the capacity and the desire to lie like the Prime Minister to protect his position. It was interesting that the first person who got the Prime Minister right was John MCInnes, who sacked our current Prime Minister from the menswear department at David Jones on 15 July 1967. Mr MCInnes said: He was an arrogant person and often rude to customers. We had complaints about him all the time. He was also unmanageable, e1usive-I could never find him when I needed him. The thing that kills me is that we go back to Alfred Deakin, who is responsible for ruining the country, or back to Black Jack MCEwen, but we never actually go back to 15 July 1967, do we? No, that is probably out of his range. Mr MCInnes also said: He really wanted to be the boss and didn't like taking orders. You could say that he didn't really want to work at all. The fact is the Prime Minister could not hold down a job in private enterprise. He got into this place through ballot fraud, which prompted an inquiry by the national executive of the ALP, with the help of Laurie. What does he say about Laurie? He says, 'I rescued him off a surfboard and I can put him back any time.' Laurie was the man who was magically discharged by good old Murray Farquhar in relation to the Botany council. The Prime Minister came into this place and in 1983 ripped the current account out and built the foreign debt to a level which we have never seen in this country. As the Leader of the Opposition stated today, he started off with a debt of $23 billion and has got it to $167 billion today. The trouble is he is not growing a profit; he is growing a loss. If you had a job in private enterprise you would know that is bad, that is not the direction you are supposed to be going. They are supposed to be trying to solidify it and tum it the other way. It never faces him, does it? He stands here and says, 'We've got the foreign debt but if you think there's a problem with manipulating the job programs' - as the shadow minister rightly pointed out today-'I've got an answer to that too-let's listen to Monsieur Juppe or Robert Reich.' There is always some magical answer somewhere if he can only grab it and pull it back. There is always come explanation how it is somebody else's fault. If it is not Menzies, it is Black Jack MCEwen, Billy Hughes, Moses or Pharaoh. You just have to go back in history far enough to try to find it. The fact that it is false does not make it any truer by repeating it. The fact that you are going to get up here and defend the Prime Minister, alleging that he said something when he did not, is just going to expose you. The fact is the Leader of the Opposition never said that or anything like it. The fact is the Prime Minister found it was in his interests to falsely allege that because he was trying to blunt a very powerful attack that the people are being left behind by your administration. The fact is that he had to resort to that technique because he knows it hurts. It hurts you. It hurts the government. But the hurt is even greater for the Australian people, especially . for the battlers that you are leaving behind.",69
219,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) had some kind remarks to make about my father. I thank him for those kind remarks. The opinion that he has of my father is an opinion that I share. My father's fate in political life in this country was to live the bulk of it watching the Liberal Party lie on foreign policy in, as far as the Australian electorate was concerned, the most lethal way-to the tune of 500 dead Australians. As Gough Whitlam said at the beginning of his statement in the 1969 election campaign: 'They lied and lied and lied while Australians died and died and died.' That was the first time in my public life that I had heard the term 'lie' used three times. The second time was by the Illawarra Mercury when describing the budget of the then Treasurer, the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). One of the great things about being in opposition is that you only require a 24-hour memory about yourself. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition got up in this place and lied about presentations he made in the Industrial Commission when chopping back battlers' wages. It is inconvenient for him to be confronted with that now. He got up in this place and lied about his position. A lot has been hinging on so-called radio reports in this particular debate. The deputy leader just lied again when he stood up in this place and said that he had never said there ought to be a $10 billion cut in the budget. Let me now quote from Pru Goward's radio interview with the deputy leader. The transcript reads: PRU GOWARD: I'll just put it once more. She was teasing it out. She got an answer that she did not expect to get-one that suggested that the opposition was going to go for that cut. Amazed, Pru Goward asked him a second time: I'll just put it once more. What does the Opposition think should be the cut in the budget deficit? PETER COSTELLO: Well, Pm, it's got to be greater than $11.7 billion this year, and it's got to be greater than the deficit next year. There you are. That is a lie. That makes him a liar. And that makes the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a liar when he says you called for $10 billion worth! Do not think you can slide away from this by arguments subsequent to the budget. You were presented with the fact that the government managed .to get the budget into surplus both this year and next year, but you opposed the method. When invited to say how and where you would make the cuts to do this, you said, 'We wouldn't make any cuts.' Somehow or other, because you do not actually say what the number would be, you think this absolves you. You think, 'I am not really lying over the $6 billion like I was lying over the $10 billion when that was presented in this place.' Opposition members routinely lie and deceive, and they have been at it again during the course of the last week. On this occasion it was not the deputy leader, but the Leader of the Opposition. He got up in this place in a way that was never the experience of my father when he was in government. He consulted with the opposition in developing a response, making absolutely certain because it was a critical matter of national security. In the face of the fact that the D-notice system had collapsed, he had to lead on that and seek some support from the opposition before doing so. Having been assured by the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) of that level of support-and indeed after public evidence of it was provided by the member for Mayo immediately after the foreign minister put it down-we had the Leader of the Opposition contradicting the member for Mayo on the Sunday program and then saying it was not a contradiction. The Leader of the Opposition is now trying to absolve himself with the statement, 'Well, that didn't really matter because what I want to talk about is the detail,' knowing dam well that everybody is prepared to talk about the detail. The substance was that there would be . a legal remedy as opposed to a voluntary code. Simple problem, simple presentation, simple agreement from the opposition and now opposition from the opposition. The honourable member for Mayo, presumably having got his leader's permission for that response, now feels himself being caught up in his latest lie. Then the Leader of the Opposition went on the Sunday program-everybody saw himand said that there ought to be better gun control. We got a call this morning-but not repudiating it. He was not in parliament making a personal explanation saying that John Tingle lied when John Tingle got up and said, 'I rang the Leader of the Opposition and he said he didn't mean what he said.' The Leader of the Opposition did not get up in here and say, 'John Tingle has misrepresented me. The words mean something different.' No, he did not. He got up and lied yesterday. There it was. It was on the Sunday program and it got the run on the Nine news in the evening, yet the Leader of the Opposition quietly called the Shooters Party and said, 'Of course I was lying. I do that routinely. I lie all the time. You don't have to worry about that, John. I won't be doing anything about it. That is just yet another occasion on which I lied.' Then we have the Leader of the Opposition getting up in this place making accusationsand encouraging his front-bench to make accusations-about the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). I could not believe it when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got up and chose this as one of his examples of somehow or other a problem existing here on the front-bench. In my experience in this parliament, there has never been a greater piece of deception run by the opposition than the theft of those hundreds and hundreds of documents and the passing of them over to the legal opponents of the Commonwealth. Somebody who wants to take an oath of office to support and uphold his constitutional obligations just throws that out-connived by the Leader of the Opposition. When the Leader of the Opposition discovered he did not have a front bench worth a damn-at least as far as the public was concerned-he became desperate to put a name back on it and he came into this place and lied again. He had the opposition spokescontributor person on Aboriginal affairs-knowing the Australia. answers to the questions that she put forward-made the fall girl, the patsy, for yet another piece of opposition deception. She got up in this place and slandered the Minister for Aboriginal affairs. The opposition was beaten back on that, as one more lie from the opposition hit the fence. Then we had the Leader of the Opposition getting up here and saying, 'As a routine matter, we will let push polling go ahead. far as I am concerned, we won't be worrying too much about that.' He was dragged, kickgiven ing and screaming, finally to a repudiation it-but the deed was done, the job was put place, the questioning of it had begun and it took an age before he discovered that that little piece of deceit was exposed for what it was. This is an opposition for which lying is routine. The gravamen of its case against the Prime Minister on this occasion really rests this: there is no question at all that the Leader of the Opposition disparaged the social wage. That was the point of what the Prime Minister said in the remarks he made in parliament. There is no dispute about that. What the Prime Minister got wrong was that it was said on the radio show; it was said in the way. opposition leader's press release. Bully! That is really terrific! It was said in the opposition leader's press release; not in his recent radio interview. If that is all you have to confess to, so what? The simple fact of the matter is that that disparaging of the social wage is a fundamental aspect of opposition tactics and was repeated both in question time today and during the course of last week. Another thing that the Leader of the sition was up to last week-he has had a added bully week. and a half; no wonder he slipped behind in the polls-was that he addressed people in Western Australia. At the same time as he was saying that he was, in honesty, defending the battlers, he was asking questions designed to give aid and comfort his Liberal colleague the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, as the guts were ripped out of decent tendering processes in Western Australia on behalf of a principal to the Liberal Party in Western He was defying the industrial commission; defying due process as far as tendering processes are concerned; defying basic human . decency to a largely defenceless work force; defying basic human decency to a large number of communities that rely on Stateships to supply them; no doubt ultimately endorsing the petulance that was reflected in the Premier of Western Australia's performance in abolAs ishing Stateships-when he took his bat and ball home once he found the umpire had them out; and then pretending that he of had some commitment to what he delights in in calling in this place the 'battlers'. Let me tell you why the Prime Minister has iron in his soul as well as ire in his mind when he has to contemplate what the opposition believes about the battlers. You can see it in every question that the opposition asks in this place and in every social program that on it attacks. The Prime Minister gets up and says that it does not matter that there are no independent studies that conform with his view that the social wage does not mean anything. The fact that there are no independent studies is, as far as he is concerned, not neither here nor there-he will say it any The fact of the matter is that, when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, he eliminated indexation on virtually every social program there was except the basic pension virtually all of them had indexation eliminated and most of them were deliberately cut back. That is why, for his period in office as Treasurer, in terms of family support, you get a figure of minus 17 per cent. Because those Oppoprograms have been enhanced, expanded and to, you get a figure of 75 per cent. You has say to the battlers in this countryparticularly the battlers with families-that $200 a week does not matter to them, that it all is of no concern. If $200 a week is of no concern to them, then you get your $6 billion. to If you are to eliminate that $200 a week which, as far as the social wage is concerned, is said by the opposition to be a matter of absolute irrelevance-if $200 can be eliminated like that-that is when you get the $6 billion. I congratulate the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) on his effective application of Stalinist techniques of disinformation. He is a well ideologically trained person. I might say that he would comprehend that excrescence from the left side of politics in terms of disinformation: demonise your policy by saying that the glass is half empty instead of half full; get in here and say that of course we can abolish all those social programs concerned with the unemployed because, in some of those social programs, 40 per cent of the participants do not actually secure full time employment at their conclusion. Forget the 60 per cent of participants who did. Forget those programs which hit as high as 90 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition thought that it was a bit foul on our part, when talking about these things in this place, to take Labour Secretary Reicht's remarks as a matter of some seriousness and import. The fact of the matter is that the OECD study said-and, indeed, throughout its report on employment it chose to name Australian programs-that the propositions we have operating in this country are exactly right; that they are what a government can sensibly do to respond to levels of unemployment and encourage those who are unemployed back into effective participation in the labour market as employed persons. We have them exactly right. Those opposite think that they can get away in here with demonisatian of these programs. They think they can get away with a sleightof-hand, saying, 'We mean we'll cut $6 billion but we're not going to tell you about it' - as though that is not deception. They think they can get away with that and slide into an election by keeping as low as possible profile as they can. The reason why the Leader of the Opposition is tetchy here today is that, on this subject, the cat has been belled. He is not getting away with it. He was not getting away with his battlers nonsense last week. He is not getting away with his demonisation of the employment programs. Above all, he is not getting away with this notion that, as far as he is concerned, he does not have to declare himself in critical policy areas. That is not being accepted by the general public. He knows it, because that is what his private polling is telling him. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he has a substantial problem with two things. Firstly, beyond himself, his front-bench is not known. Therefore, he has to bring back on to the front bench one person who is known, who has a degree of notoriety but who, with the active connivance of the Leader of the Opposition, pulled one of the greatest acts of deception, deceit and miserable behaviour that this House has ever seen-and that is what was pulled by the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), the former spokesperson on environmental matters. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he has to get the member for Barker back on to the shadow ministry to help cure what is a substantial problem-that is, nobody trusts his opposition front-bench. Besides himself, the only one on his front-bench who is known is Costello. The Leader of the Opposition is being told that the ratings on Costello refer persistently to his 'smarminess'. So he has a problem with Costello. The Leader of the Opposition also knows that the public is demanding value-and that means that, when it comes down to a question of policy, they demand a performance. They will not write him blank cheques. They have sufficient memory of John Howard to know that a blank cheque is not what you give him on coming to office. He knows he has a problem with that. He knows that, until he can cure those problems, he cannot run a battlers campaign. He cannot run the sort of deception that he hopes to, to slide through into office. I do not know why you are sitting there, Paul Filing. You are asking people whether you are a member of the National Party, an independent or another. You are sitting on the Liberal side. But you are merely one more victim of the deception of the opposition cLeader-and I feel sorry for you for it. I think we have had enough of this, Mr Speaker. Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the question be now put. Questi()n put: That the motion (Mr Howard's) be agreed to. The House divided. [5.42 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

' To,the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizen and resident of Australia points out to the House the adverse impact of fees for 'all courses. Fees: are - a major barrier to the participation of women, mature aged students, Aboriginal and Strait Islander students; and students' from other economically, socially and geographically disadvantaged backgrounds in postgraduate education. restrict the educational options of students. Students with large, HECS debts from their previous education may be inclined to avoid undertaking valuable postgraduate and undergraduate courses, therefore leading to premature , closure of career choices contradict the ALP Federal Government's stated goals of lifelong learning and retraining - Y otir petitioners therefore request the House ensure the equitable provision of undergraduate and postgraduate education in Australia's Universities by: . fully funding postgraduate course offerings and , amending the Higher Education Funding Act to preclude t4e imposition of fees for postgraduate courses input more public funding into higher education, abolish HECS and stop increasing HECS by Mr Dodd (from 180 citizens).

Parents have been operating a service since 1992 that now employs 4 childcare workers and offers 30 Before School Care places, 48 After School Care places and 30 Vacation Care places for fifty weeks of the year. The service is fully funded by fees and consequently parents who use our service pay almost twice as much as those who use Out of School Hours Care in .the next suburb. Our Centre operates on a financial ""knife e<ige"" and any unforseen expense haS the potential'to cause the service to close. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to request that the Department of Human Services and Health reconsider the application of Dobroyd Point Outside of School Hours Centre for year round funding. by Mrs Easson (from 401 citizens).

The petition of the undersigned request the immediate establishment of a moratorium on logging and woodchipping in all forest· of high conservation value, including wilderness, old growth forest and endangered species habitat.

Logging and Woodchipping To the honourable speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of this House that we are concerned at the threats caused by logging to the integrity and continued existence of what remains of the forests of south eastern Australia. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Prime Minister and his government (1) to phase out woodchipping for export; (2) NOT to renew a long-term export licence to Harris Daishowa; , (3) to ensure that sensitive environmental areas, and specifically the proposed national park and wilderness areas of Coolangubra, Cathciut, Egan Peaks and the Tantawangalo catchment, are protected and excluded from the proposed woodchip export)icence; and (4) tei promote ecologically sound and sustainable forestry practices including: . re""afforestation and plantation of 'native hardwoods on already cleared land to reduce pressure on native forests; and ' minimisation of wasteful uses of forest products.

Pharmacy Services To the honourable the speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of residents of the Electorate of Fisher draws to the attention of the House: That we, the residents and community of Ningi, in the State of Queensland, desire the services of a Pharmacy in the local shopping centre. Mr John Tonkin applied to the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority to establish a Pharmacy in Ningi Shopping Centre but his application was rejected on the grounds of ""unmet public need"". We, the residents and community of Ningi advise that this is one of the fastest growing. areas in south-east Queensland and our nearest Pharmacy is eight kilometres away. Many of our residents are pensioners and rely on public transport. The services of a Pham'iacy in the local shopping centre is absolutely necessary. There was an obvious need for a doctor in Ningi. This need has been met and the doctor is now so busy that he is putting on two other doctors to service the extreme need for medical services in the area. We now have a situation where the only doctor's surgery in the area is extremely busy with no Pharmacy to service the prescriptions. This is a ludicrous situation and totally unacceptable to us, the residents and community of Ningi. The ruling of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority is impossible to understand. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House requests the Federal Government to overturn the decision of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority and grant Mr John Tonkin's application. by Mr Slipper (from 1,393 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in 12 for Australian women; . (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to affect every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives calion the Government to: (a) increase funding for_ breast cancer research ten-fold (a minimum of $14'tnillion) in the 1994/95 Budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations for breast cancer research. by Mr Taylor (from 151 citizens). Social Security Income Test To the honourable the speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: (a) There is widespread concern and strong objection to the Government's proposal to treat unrealised capital gains on pensioners' and veterans' share investments as income. (b) Savings in Australia are at a record low level and the implementation of the above measure is likely to encourage pensioners to cash in their .share portfolios or divert them to less productive areas. (c) Older people place great importance on achieving certainty and security in their financial dealings. This proposal will remove all certainty from share investments for pensioners and veterans and will significantly affect their investment decisions. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled require the Government to repeal those sections of the Social Security Act which treat unrealised capital gains on shares as income under the social security income tests for pensioners. by Mr Taylor (from 88 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. 2. ' We, th-refore request that the House of Representatives' ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national poll. A-d your petitioners, as in duty bound, - ill ever pray. , by Mr Taylor (from 64 citizens).

235,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,",-I rise today to speak, about, the better cities project which, is currently taking 'shape in Launceston. The development of the Inveresk railyard site will become the centrepiece of Launceston. A figure of $10.28 million of Commonwealth government funding is being spent over five years to redevelop the railway yards at Inveresk. The site will be used for recreational, educational and business uses and will also allow the redevelopment of the Wine Tax underutilised Elphin showground in another part of Launceston. This is truly a wonderful project and one which will be of enormous benefit to the city of Launceston and to the northern region well into the future. What I wish to draw to the attention of the House today is that sadly the project has become a political football for the Liberal Party. The attitude of the Liberals in Tasmania and the federal spheres alters depending upon who is doing the talking and, to whom they are talking to. Sadly, the federal coalition position on better cities, confused as it is, is just another example of the policy vacuum in which it is operating. ' Let me outline to the House some of the hypocrisy which the federal coalition and the Tasmanian Liberals have engaged in over better cities. In July last year, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), the opposition shadow minister for local government, issued a media release which condemned the federal government's better cities program. It was headed 'Better cities-what about better towns.' The member for Maranoa begins: Beneath the glossy and apparently progressive image of the better cities program presented in the program's status report released today is a tangled web of missed opportunities . . . The member for Maranoa goes on: There are a number of instances in which the better cities program has produced unnecessary tension between all levels of government and communities, and created monuments which seem likely to do little, if anything, to enhance standards of urban living. He says further: ... local authorities are justifiably envious of capital cities good fortune in receiving hundreds millions of taxpayers' dollars for the construction of inner city high-rises, which appear unwanted by local residents anyway. Mr Bruce Scott-Have a look at Sydney.",80
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)Order! That's enough.,81
237,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Let me say at this point that, even though Launceston is Tasmania's greatest city, it is not the capital, and our better cities redevelopment is for our entire community. There are no high-rises. Mr Bruce Scott-That's what my press release said. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! That's the last time.",81
238,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The member for Maranoa goes on to say: Given the controversy that continues to surround some of the better cities projects, a portion $816 million may well have been spent in towns who really want, and need it. He appears to be suggesting that the redevelopment in Launceston is not needed and not wanted. I assure you that the people of Launceston have had their imagination captured by this project and would resent entirely any suggestion that they would not want or need it. From the quotations I have given the House, it would certainly appear that the position of the coalition on better cities was clear. It would seem that it wishes to cut, if not abandon, the program. This is certainly the position of the shadow minister for local government, the federal member for Maranoa. It seems, however, that the attitude of members of the coalition tends to change according to whom they are talking to. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was recently in my electorate. The Examiner on Friday, 26 May carries an article entitled 'Howard backs local ownership of airport: continued better cities funding also gets guarantee'. The article states: Mr Howard said funding of worthwhile better cities projects would continue. ""And everyone tells me that it is a very worthwhile project-it seems to fall into that category"" he said. This example shows the gross hypocrisy of the the opposition. It is very cynical politics on of behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, telling the people of Launceston what he thinks they want to hear. There is no greater form of political cynicism than the Leader of the Opposition trying to capitalise on a local success story even while his front-bench is condemning it. I am, however, amused that the Liberals have so little to offer in my own state that they are praising Labor initiatives. I suppose that the Leader of the Opposition's attitude is a compliment to the federal government, but I would ask how the federal opposition leader's comments reconcile with the attitude of his front-bench. This is truly an example of the opposition not having a genuine policy and simply saying what seems like a good idea at the time. It is cynical and misleading. The Liberals in government in Tasmania have taken a totally different of the approach. They think the project is so wonderful that they are endeavouring to rewrite history and hijack the kudos for the instigation of the project. I will read to the House an extract from the recent Hansard of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Mr Benneworth, who is a Liberal member for Bass asks: Can the Premier tell the House about a new boost for the multimillion dollar Inveresk railway project in Launceston and the state government's role in that project? Mr Ray Groom replied: The Inveresk railway area redevelopment project is one of the most significant in Tasmania at this point in time. It is a key plank in a whole package of arrangements for the Launceston area which will involve expenditure of some $70 million over a small number of years and of course that will provide a substantial boost to employment in the Launceston area. The government has been a major supporter of this project from day one. We played a major role in initiating the project and I am grateful to the work of our members in Bass in supporting the project, in keeping government and the local government informed and in promoting many of the ideas that have come to fruition. I particularly acknowledge the work of Mr Tony Benneworth on the Launceston Inner-city Redevelopment Committee, who has worked assiduously and with great vigour to support the project. The attitude of Mr Groom and Mr Benneworth appears to be in direct contrast to some of their federal colleagues. Not only do they not want the project cut but apparently the whole thing was their idea. This really caps off the cynical political attitude of the Liberals on this whole issue. The state Liberals have no vision; they have to steal it. The federal opposition has no policy, apart from whatever seems good at the time. The true story is that this is a federal government program. The initial application was carried by Alderman Graeme Beams, the then mayor of the Launceston City Council, and former Deputy Prime Minister Mr Lance Barnard. I myself lobbied very hard for this project during my first campaign and for several years prior to my election. Credit should be given where credit is due. This project is not a political football; it is Launceston's greatest asset. I condemn the federal opposition and I condemn the Tasmanian state government for trying to use it for its own cynical gain. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade",81
239,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House an extremely disturbing situation in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the tolerance-indeed, promotion-of senior diplomats known to DFAT and the Australian Federal Police as paedophiles. The most serious case of officially tolerated paedophilia is Mr John Holloway, the former ambassador in Manila and Cambodia, who is now enjoying a $500,000 package funded by Australian taxpayers to coordinate the ministry of foreign affairs in Cambodia. Mr Bevis- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The sort of comment just made is extremely offensive and outside this place would be actionable. Grievance debates are not the place in which comments of that sort should be made.",82
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)Order! There is no point of order.,82
241,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The main areas of operations for the DFAT paedophiles are the Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. Amongst these predators are the current deputy head of mission in the Australian embassy at Phnom Penh, the Telstra representative in Hanoi, who is a former DFAT officer, and a former Australian ambassador stationed in Hanoi in the late 1980s. Mr Bilney- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe that conduct like this on the part of the honourable member brings disgrace on this House. I believe that if allegations like this are to be raised they ought to be done on a substantive motion in relation to the person concerned.",82
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! Unfortunately, standing orders do not provide for that.",82
243,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"1I have been reliably informed by senior departmental sources in DFAT and senior investigating police officers that there are approximately 20-1 repeat, 20-Senior Executive Service, SES, officers who are engaged in paedophile activities within Australia and overseas. Not only are known paedophiles tolerated by the senior management of DFAT but they are actively promoted. For example, a senior ambassador was recently promoted from AusAID to First Assistant Secretary in DFAT. Mr Costello, the Secretary to DFAT, was aware of the proclivities of this officer but did not veto his appointment. The paedophile network in DFAT is also facilitated by the new rule that allows same sex partners to have all the rights and advantages of spouses. The distortion of the strict rules on adoption has seen senior DFAT personnel adopt Asian children, who are subsequently used for sexual purposes. I am informed by senior police sources that DFAT is obstructing and attempting to prevent examination of the relevant documents in an obvious attempt to smother the issue and to deter honest departmental witnesses from being heard or providing evidence. Why does the paedophile network in DFAT seek to represent Australia in Asia? The primary reason is that child sex is not illegal in those countries. Young children are available and cheap. There are immense difficulties in laying charges and proving the age of victims. Paedophiles are extremely skilled in avoiding detection. One of their favourite techniques is to employ locally engaged staff of a vulnerable age which provides them with cover for their deviant activities. I hardly to remind the House that this despicable conduct has been illegal under Australian laws for over two years. Yet, to date, not one DFAT officer has been seriously investigated or charged. The activities of the DFAT paedophile network are damaging our reputation in the region and are a public health risk and a security risk. There are photographs and videos of senior Australian diplomats circulating in the capital cities of some of our trading partners in the region. Is this in Australia's interests? DFAT senior management evidently regards the activities of paedophiles as indicating a legitimate sexual preference. This official DFAT policy of benign amusement in the name of tolerance must cease. The many decent officers in DFAT want an end to official tolerance of the paedophile network within DFAT. It is a matter of departmental and national honour. Mr Bilney- Mr Deputy Speaker, I wonder whether I could seek your indulgence to make a statement",82
244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Rocher)No, you may not. But, as a minister, you have the unique right to reply at the end of the grievance debate. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Member for Wills",83
245,Mr LATHAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Werriwa) (6.02 p.m.}-The Liberal Party of Australia in this place, and in the Senate, has hit new lows in its contempt for the parliamentary institution and parliamentary privilege. But even the Liberal Party has had the sense to disendorse the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), and I seriously hope that is the last time we see him in this chamber. For the member to make those accusations without having presented them to the relevant minister and without having given the government notice of them is absolutely beneath contempt. Today I grieve for people in the electorate of Wills because, as I shall demonstrate to the need House, they are not being represented in this place by a full-time member. Of course, the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) has plenty of things to say about members on both sides of the House, and it is timely at this stage of the parliamentary term to bring the member to account and examine his voting record-in fact, to examine his record of absenteeism. I had an example of this just last Thursday when I was working away in my office towards the end of our parliamentary sitting day and I tuned into the local ABC radio station. I heard the member for Wills giving a report about the parliamentary week-the parliamentary week which had not then finished. As he described to the radio announcer, he was enjoying a chardonnay at the airport. I am glad he raised that on national radio, because the electors of Wills would be very interested to learn that while the parliament was still sitting on a Thursday afternoon their member was enjoying chardonnay at the airport. That, of course, demonstrates what we on this side of the House have always known-'-that he is a chardonnay socialist to his bootstraps. He demonstrated as much on national radio last Thursday. It is useful to examine the record of absenteeism established by the member for Wills. I tum to his voting record in this place for 1993. In the parliamentary term that commenced in March 1993 until the end of that year there were 102 divisions. The member for Wills attended just 50 of them. He did not vote on 52 divisions in this House in 1993. These divisions were not on trivial matters. He did not vote on the appropriation bills. In fact; he missed two votes on them. He did not express any voting intention or record any attitude on the voting sheets for a budget of $115 billion. This self-proclaimed champion of the workers did not vote on the landmark Industrial Relations Reform Bill. He missed four votes on the Native Title Bill. One would have thought that every member of this parliament would have wanted to express an opinion in divisions on the Native Title Bill. But the self-proclaimed moraliser on behalf of Aboriginal people did not bother to vote. Despite all the speeches he makes in this place about his interest in tariff policy, he did not vote on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill, two crucial pieces of legislation. He also missed the division on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. The people of Wills were unrepresented by their member on the division for the allocation of funds by this parliament to the states for education, health and housing. There is no doubt that in 1993 and beyond the people of Wills deserve better representation than that. They deserve much better than an absentee member. I now turn to the voting record of the member for Wills for the calendar year 1994. The House had 84 divisions in that year. Quite remarkably, the member for Wills was absent for 52 of those divisions-an absentee rate of 62 per cent. For 62 per cent of divisions he was not in this chamber representing the views of his constituents. He missed votes on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), the ATSIC amendment legislation, the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill and the ANL Guarantee Bill. He tells the maritime unions that he is one of their champions in this place, yet he did not bother to record a vote on the ANL Guarantee Bill. He missed the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. He missed the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill. He missed another important piece of industrial relations legislation, the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994. But the absenteeism of the member for Wills gets even worse. In 1995, up to 30 March where I concluded my research, this House had divisions on 29 occasions. The member for Wills was absent for 14 of them. He has been absent from important divisions in this place for about 50 per cent of the time thus far in 1995. Legislation he has missed includes the Auditor-General Bill (No.5) 1994 and the Corporations Law (Securities And Futures) Amendment Bill 1994. In this term of parliament since March 1993, the House has divided on 215 occasions. Shamefully, the member for Wills has been absent on 118 of those occasions. Surely the people of Wills deserve better than an absentee member; someone who is not here on 55 per cent of the occasions on which the House divides. The people of Wills are totally unrepresented in this place on 55 per cent of the occasions on which the House divides on legislation or other matters. Their member is only 45 per cent of a member. For the rest of the time he is absent from the chamber. I call upon the member for Wills not to rip off the public purse by attending on only 45 per cent of occasions, for 45 per cent of divisions, yet taking 100 per cent of his salary. He should donate 55 per cent of his salary to a charity",83
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member is getting very close to ascribing improper motives to an honourable member. I ask him to be careful with the words he chooses.,84
247,Mr LA THAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is no doubt that the people of Wills deserve much better than a half-time member. They deserve much better than someone who carries the nickname in this place and throughout the electorate of Wills as either 'Part-time Phil' or 'Clock""off Cleary'. The only confusion I have on this matter is how he should be known for such a disgraceful rate of absenteeism: is it 'Part-time Phil' or 'Clock-off Cleary'? This is the same member who in the 1992 Wills by-election campaigned on the slogan that he could make a difference. What difference has he made in this place when he has not even been here on 55 per cent of the occasions when the House divided. He has made no difference at all because he has revealed, through his pattern of absenteeism, the total impotence of Independents. He cannot make a difference in this House. He knows he cannot make a difference in this House, and that is why for 55 per cent of the divisions he has been absent. He was at Canberra airport drinking chardonnay or he was back enjoying his extravagant lifestyle Melbourne. He was everywhere except the place he should have been-in this chamber, voting on behalf of his electorate according to his views on legislation and divisions before the House. Of course, the people should not put up with a member who is only part time. They should not put up with a member who carries the nickname 'Part-time Phil' or 'Clock-off Cleary' in this place. They should elect at first available opportunity a full-time member of parliament who can represent their needs on a full-time basis and be here-not at the airport drinking chardonnay; the chardonnay socialist in the first-class lounge at Canberra airport. He should be here representing his electorate, instead of 'missing 55 per cent of divisions. Workers in his electorate will be astounded by this. Carpenters in the electorate of Wills who missed 55 per cent of their work would not receive 100 per cent of their pay, as the member for Wills is taking each week and each month in this place. They would be docked for it; they would not even hold down their jobs. If builders, retailers, teachers nurses"" in the electorate of Wills had an absenteeism rate of 55 per cent,' they would struggle to hold their jobs and certainly would not be receiving, at high wages, the 100 per cent of salary taken each· week, each month and each yel,l- by the member for Wills. This is an' appalling record, and it is long overdue for this House to bring the member for Wills to account for his rate of absenteeism, his appalling neglect of the electorate, his appalling contempt of this House and the people of Wills by not being here for an)ithing more substantial than 45 per cent of divisions since the last election. The people of Wills, for whom I grieve in this debate, owe it to themselves and the parliament to, at the first opportunity, elect a member who is here full time to represent their needs instead of only 45 per cent of the time. It is absolutely shameful that the member for Wills should behave with utter contempt for his electorate. He should be voted out on his appalling record of absenteeism and for the absolute contempt with which he in treats his electors. (Time expired) Children: Abduction",84
248,Mr HALVERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Casey) (6.12 p.m.)Over recent years there has been increasing publicity about the kidnapping or abduction of children by parents or other family members in an endeavour to circumvent or prevent the enforcement of Family Court custody or access orders. This is an alarming and unacthe ceptable trend and one which should and must be actively discouraged by the Australian government and our Australian courts. If parents or others who are dissatisfied with custody or access orders perceive that there may be some gain in abducting or absconding with the children involved, then it stands to reason that more children will be . in danger of being taken from Australia' and consequently removed from the jurisdiction of the Australian courts. The widely publicised Gillespie case lends enormous weight to the urgent and, in many respects, unfulfilled need for the Australian authorities to ensure that the rights' of Australian citizens 'are upheld. Today I wish'to bring to the attention of the or House an instance' where two children were wrongfully taken from Australia by their mother,' who was in fact the custodial parent. This is a very complex, lengthy ,and difficult case and it. is . a considerable challenge to summarise in the brief time available to rile today' even the major elements. I want to make it clear from the outset that I do not wish to canvass the issue'of whether the father should have custody of or access to the children. Legitimately, such matters should be for the Family Court of Australia to decide. However, iIi the case of my constituent, these decisions have been made elsewhere. I believe this is a situation which requires urgent action by the government because of the important and fundamental principles involved. In November 1991, Mr Allan Leigh, one of my constituents, was convicted of possession of an illegal weapon and sentenced to four years imprisonment. While he was in prison he appealed his conviction. The appeal was upheld. A year or so prior to Mr Leigh's conviction, his former wife, who has remarried and whom I will refer to as Mrs X, had obtained an interim order for custody of their children. At that time my constituent was given access rights. In January 1991, these access rights were suspended. During the time my constituent was in gaol, Mrs X made application to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for a passport for herself and their two children. The statutory declaration she used to obtain that passport was in part untrue. I am unaware as to whether the information it contained was ever checked by the department. I do, however, believe that the fact an application had been lodged should have been made known to Mr Leigh as the father of the children. In November 1992, Mrs X sought orders in the Family Court to finalise the question of custody. The proceedings were adjourned to 3 March 1993, pending the hearing of Mr Leigh's appeal against his conviction. Unbeknown to Mr Leigh, Mrs X left Australia with the children and her husband on 1 March 1993-just two days before the Family Court was to determine the question of custody and access. Mr Leigh maintains that Mrs X was assisted in her efforts to leave Australia by certain officers of the Federal Police. In June 1993, Mr Leigh succeeded In obtaining orders that he have access to his children, that a warrant be issued for the Australian Federal Police to take possession of the children for the purpose of access and that the Department of Social Security provide information relating to the whereabouts of the children. In August 1993, he obtained further orders that a warrant be issued to the Federal Police directing that it arrest Mrs X and bring her before the court with the children. As Mr Leigh was dissatisfied with. the progress being made by the Federal Police, he applied to the Family Court for further orders. As a result of this application, it was suggested by the judge that my constituent subpoena the Federal Police officers concerned in the execution of the warrants. Some. six hours after taking the suggested action, Mr Leigh was informed that Mrs X and the children had left Australia and that her address was unknown. The orders made in June and August 1993 were discharged in December of that year, presumably as Mrs X was no longer within the jurisdiction of the Australian Family Court. My constituent then commenced lengthy and very expensive efforts to trace Mrs X and his children's whereabouts. He eventually ascertained that they were living in the United States and he made plans to travel to America. In April 1994, Mrs X applied to an American court for enforcement of a foreign decree of dissolution and restraining orders. Mr Leigh alleges that these proceedings were commenced after he had notified the Federal Police of Mrs X's address in America. This allegation appears to be true, as in an affidavit in support of her application she stated: I recently learned of his planned trip to Washington because the Federal Police of Australia learned of it and contacted my family to warn.me about it. In a report she gave to the American police, which was attached to her affidavit, Mrs X reiterated this statement and named the Federal Police officer who had alerted her to her former husband's travel plans. She also stated that Melbourne police had notified her father about the matter. Meanwhile, back in Australia, following an application made by Mr Leigh, Mr Justice Hase declared in orders of 17 June 1994 that the removal of the c:hildren from Australia was wrongful within the meaning of article 3 of the Convention on the Civil Aspects' of International Child Abduction. Mr Leigh travelled to the United States to commence proceedings against Mrs X seeking the return to Australia of the children in accordance with the rules of the convention. The proceedings were heard in Washington in July 1994. Although the American court agreed with the finding of the Australian court that the removal of the children by Mrs X was wrongful, it also found that there were compelling reasons not to return the children to Australia. Mr Leigh lodged an appeal against this decision. However, because his financial resources were exhausted, he was unable to proceed with the appeal. In October 1994, Mrs X applied to lin American court for orders for custody of the children. Mr Leigh was able to obtain a stay of the custody proceedings pending the decision of the Family Court in Australia as to the American court's jurisdiction to hear the matter. The costs of obtaining the stay were met by his family. However, neither my constItuent nor"" his family had sufficient funds available to enable him to travel to Ainerica to defend the proceedings further. These proceedings were·due to have been heard on 31 May 1995. I assume they have been dealt with in the absence of Mr Leigh and that the order!! sought by Mrs X have been granted to her. . Mrs X had previously applied to the Family Court of Australia to have all existing proceedings in that court stayed to enable the proceedings in the American court to continue. Although she was represented, she did not personally appear at the hearing, thus avoiding any cross-examination. In February 1995, orders were made that all proceedings filed by the husband be stayed until determination of the wife's ·summons filed in America· and that the husband shall not, without leave of the judge, file, reinstate or continue any proceeding in the Family Court. It appears that the Australian Family Court has abrogated the responsibility of determining the question of custody and access of the Australian children to two Australian citizens to a foreign court. I find this deeply disturbing- I am very concerned that my constituent has been denied the right to appeal the decision of the American court that heard the initial proceedings in July 1994 and has not been able to contest to conclusion the issue of custody in the American court. ryIr Leigh also lodged an appeal against the decision of the Australian court to. allow the American court jurisdiction in this matter. He was unable to proceed with this appeal as the costs involved were substantial and he could not obtain legal aid. How can one obtain justice if one is denied access to the courts? Whether Mr Leigh would be able to obtain an order for custody or even an order for access in an Australian court is not the point at issue. I believe that, as all concerned in this unhappy situation are or were at the relevant times Australians, it is an Australian court that should make the decision, not an American court. What has happened to my constituent has set a dangerous example, if not a precedent, in matters of custody and access, and something should be done about it. Finally, I want to record my concerns about the apparent behaviour of the Federal Police in this case. I am aware that several matters are currently being investigated by the Ombudsman and I look forward to the Ombudsman's report as a matter of urgency. Corinella",85
249,Mr GRIFFIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to take this opportunity to relate to the House a number of events that have occurred recently in my electorate. I recently represented the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) at the opening of the refurbishment of the Cranbourne Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service office. The CRS assists people with injury or a disability to gain and keep paid employment and to live more independently in the Australian community. Injury and illness isolate a large number of Australians from the work force and the. community. This represents a major cost to individuals, industry and the community as a whole, and there are real cost benefits for everyone when effective rehabilitation achieves vocational outcomes and facilitates independent participation in the community for its clients. The CRS clearly represents a continued federal government commitment to provide to people with a disability the same opportunities as any other member of Australian society. The CRS is the longest established and largest rehabilitation provider in Australia, with 33 sites· in Victoria and more than 170 nationally, offering a service to customers on a local, statewide or national basis as well as establishing a reputation as a leader in the delivery of community based rehabilitation services. It is a cost-efficient and effective Commonwealth government organisation which has maintained a high rate of employment outcomes from vocational programs, with nearly 60 per cent of people completing these programs achieving full-time or part-time· employment. A study by Anutech in 1994 of the CRS calculated that, for every $1 of taxpayers' money spent on the CRS, it saved the Australian economy $9. The refurbishment of the Cranbourne CRS site and the subsequent formation of the South Gippsland CRS region, incorporating the CRS presence at Wonthaggi, recognise the community based aspect of CRS service pro-ision and respond to the needs of the local community in the Cranbourne area, ,one of the strongest growth areas of Melbourne. Since the establishment of the CRS site in Cranbourne some three years ago, strong links have been established and maintained with a range of local community agencies in the Cranbourne area. Local employers are also increasingly realising the benefits of using CRS services and a number of businesses' in the region are now customers of the Cranbourne CRS unit. Another event of significance that occurred recently in the local area was the opening of the extension of the electrified rail line from Dandenong through to Cranbourne. This was the first extension of the electrified lines in metropolitan Melbourne for some 20 years since the Pakenham .line was opened. It represented over $27 million of federal government funds through the better cities' program and led. to the development of new stations at Lyndhurst, Merinda Park and Cranbourne. It was great to see the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the electorate at the opening of the Dandenong station, but there have been a number of problems surrounding the development of this project and the actions of the state government on this issue. The state government, which has had responsibility for none of the funding provided for this project, even though it is a joint program, was in a situation whereby it slavishly and strategically attempted to dominate· the publicity and to take the credit for what occurred on this occasion. Free tickets were· issued to thousands of residents in the Cranbourne area. On the admission of the Victorian Minister for Public Transport, Alan Brown, this was the first time this had ever occurred. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, wish that the state government would do something like this in the area of Bendigo. There Was a sausage sizzle and a range of other activities on the day. There was a caravan on site staffed by PTC staff on the day and for a couple of weeks after. This is interesting because it is going to be an unstaffed station, but for the first couple of weeks I guess it is better than nothing. The stations are state of the art. except for one thing-they do· not have' toilets. The stations are quite a walk from any toilets in the 10cal area that could be used by people using the stations. But; despite all that, the service is proving to be a success. It was urgently needed and required. It' is very pleasing to be part of a federal. government that was able. to fund it when the state government was not prepared to do it. Two state ministers and fivebackbenchers attended. There was. extensivlf )nedia coverage of the activities of the state members under the circumstances, and some recognition of the federal government's tole but not particularly from the state members involved. Another initiative has been the development of the Department of .social Security office and the Cranbourne CES office-both things I sotightto have instigated prior to my election and subsequently followed through after my election. The CES office is now in full operation and is servicing' the needs of constituents in the area. The Department of . Social Security office is!iue to be completed and be operatiol),al within the next month. This WIll help provide Cranbourne with much needed services in order to build its. identity and its role as a major centre within the south-eastern growth corridor: On the subject of unemployment-an issue which is of concern to all members of the . House - I think we have to get it into perspective. The figures which relate to the south-eastern area of Melbourne are very important in getting it into perspective. I was elected March 1993, and I have the figures for the March 1993 quarter and for the most recent quarter released by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which is the December 1994 quarter, as they relate to significant elements of my electorate. I would like to read some of the figures into Hansard of the improvement that has occurred over that time. The unemployment figure for Cranbourne in the March 1993 quarter was 3,383 people, which was 8.2 per cent of the work force, and in the December 1994 quarter it was 3,008, which was 6.4 per cent of the work force-a drop of 375 people or 1.8 per cent. But over that time the labour force within Cranbourne had increased by 7,500 to 8,000 individuals. So there has been a major improvement in employment in the area. The figure for Dandenong in the December 1994 quarter was 12.4 per cent, down from 14.9 per cent in the March 1993 quarter-a drop of 818 people unemployed, which is 2.5 per cent. The figure for Springvale is down from 13.7 per cent to 12.1 per cent-a drop of 738 people on unemployment benefits. For the rural components of my electorate, there was a major drop of 4.3 per cent in the Bass shire area, 2.3 per cent in Phillip Island and a whopping 6.8 per cent in Wonthaggi. When you add it all up, you are talking about 2,213 fewer people being unemployed in that area-a drop of 13.4 per cent in the number of unemployed over that period. So it is a major effort. It is evidence that the government's priorities are working in an area that is depressed both rurally and in the outer industrial area of Melbourne. It is evidence that the government's policies are working and are continuing to work. It is something that the House should note. We should have more recognition from both sides of the House that we are getting it right, and we will continue to get it right in the lead-up to the next election. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Member for Deakin",87
250,Mr BILNEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs)- Mr Deputy Speaker, earlier today in in the Main Committee and just a few moments ago in the grievance debate, the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) made a number of remarks which need to be replied to. They were serious and scurrilous allegations. I want to set the record straight as soon as I can, with your indulgence. I will be as quick as I can.",89
251,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,We will be continuing the debate until 6.30 p.m.,89
252,Mr BILNEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Thank you. His remarks were of two kinds. The first went to a supposed involvement of the present Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Michael Costello, in some drug smuggling or drug running activity and improper links with foreign intelligence agencies. Mr Costello has been in contact with me to say that he has seen the text of the speech of the member for Deakin and the letters which he read into Hansard. Mr Costello, in a letter, says: Any suggestion that I am engaged in activity connected with drug running or improper links with any foreign intelligence service or have received illicit funds are totally untrue. He goes' on to say: These outrageous allegations are grievously harmful to my standing and reputation. Their falsity could, and should, have been established before being aired in public under privilege in this way. He then continues: . The allegations are matters which Mr Aldred has said he has referred to the Australian Federal Police Mr Costello says he encourages the Federal Police to undertake the most rigorous and full examination of this matter and pledges his total cooperation in that investigation. He goes on: When the police determine that the allegations are utterly without foundation, I look to a public and unqualified apology from Mr Aldred. Debate interrupted.",89
253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! It being 6.30 p.m., and in pursuance of the resolution of the House earlier today, the debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative.",90
254,Mr BILNEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I continue on indulgence. Just to conclude on the point of these allegations against Mr Costello, Mr Mark Leibler is also mentioned in the member for Deakin's remarks. Mr Costello says that Mr Leibler has contacted him to say that he has publicly rejected to the press the allegations which were made against him, and Mr Leibler reminded him that this was not the first occasion on which he had been the subject of attack by Mr Aldred, the last occasion being before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts over tax matters, and in that connection Mr Leibler says that the bipartisan report of that committee fully vindicated his position and rejected Mr Aldred's. I am glad of the opportunity given me to set straight those allegations. The second kinds of allegations were just as scurrilous. They related to allegations of Australian diplomats being involved in paedophile activities. In those allegations, the member for Deakin named a number of people who were serving as Australian diplomats, and people in other positions in South East Asia. So far as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is concerned, it has been seriously concerned by these allegations. It does not tolerate improper conduct, including potentially criminal conduct, such as paedophilic activities. Such conduct is repugnant to the department and to the community at large. The department has responded promptly to these allegations by seeking the advice of the Australian Federal Police and also by pursuing an internal investigation. I can report that the AFP investigations found that allegations concerning any officer or officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have not substantiated any criminal activity either in Australia or in the Philippines where some of these allegations were made. The internal investigation is continuing to see whether there has been conduct which could be subject to disciplinary provisions. It is not appropriate to comment until that investigation is complete, but when it is complete it will put the department in a better position to clear the reputations of those officers concerned. May I simply conclude on the point that I believe this sort of practice of raising allegations in a grievance debate and of naming people without evidence is the very kind of thing that brings the reputation of parliament and parliamentarians into disrepute. I think it is scandalous and shameful. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",90
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate transmitting the following resolution agreed to by the Senate: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Senate approves the proposal by the National Cap-tal Planning Authority for capital works within the Parliamentary Zone, being . the erection of a disabled access ramp and handrails on West Block offices in Parkes, Australian Capital Territory. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",90
256,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new laboratory complex for CSIRO Division of Food Science and Technology, Werribee, Victoria. This proposal, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 12 October 1994, will relocate the Victorian based activities of the CSIRO's Division of Food Science and Technology from its current facilities at Highett to the Victorian state government's Werribee technology precinct as part of a program of integrating food research activities in Victoria. The new facilities-comprising laboratories, process bays, offices and support facilitieswill be constructed in an area immediately adjacent to those of the Australian Food Research Institute at Werribee. The Food Research Institute and the CSIRO's Division of Food Science and Technology undertake complementary research work for the food industry, and especially for the dairy industry. Collocation will greatly enhance research collaboration and will permit significant rationalisation in the sharing of accommodation, resources and processing equipment, thus bringing together key research and development organisations which can impact positively on the food industry in a most cost-effective manner. The proposal is fully supported by the government of the state of Victoria and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation. The Public Works Committee tabled its favourable report on 11 May 1995 recommending that the project proceed at an estimated cost of $10.1 million, with a completion date in late 1996. I would like to thank the committee for its report. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",90
257,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of 1 Field Hospital at Holsworthy, New South Wales. Holsworthy is a suburb of Sydney and houses the army's largest concentration of units in New South Wales based on 1st Brigade. Whilst the units from 1st Brigade will move north to Darwin over the next few years, Holsworthy will continue to accommodate two regular infantry battalions and supporting elements and a number of training, logistic and administrative units. The Holsworthy army base is approximately 22,000 hectares, including an adjoining closed training area. The proposal is to provide new facilities for 1 Field Hospital, which is an army land force unit. These new facilities will include accommodation for an operational army hospital with a 25-bed capacity and associated services. The proposal will also provide logistic and administrative facilities. The 1 Field Hospital provides deployable medical support to the field army while on training or on operations. When not deployed the unit provides limited health care to service personnel. Existing substandard facilities at Ingleburn will be replaced as a result of this proposal. It is anticipated that the construction will commence in early 1996 and be completed by late 1997. The estimated outrun cost for this proposal is $21.754 million. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. LOAN BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 9 May. Second Reading M:r SCIACCA (Bowman-Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (6.38 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than the consolidated revenue ·fund and to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund. Legally, expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the parliament but for which insufficient funds are I,lvailable in the consolidated revenue fund. The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in· the consolidated revenue fund. While the budget as a whole is anticipated to be in surplus in 1995-96, there is a prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund of about $2.1 billion. The difference between the two estimated outcomes arises because appropriations from the CRF include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the budget outcome. These items include superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. The bill provides authority for the loan to meet defence expenditures incurred in 1995-96 after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the consolidated revenue fund and, if necessary, to supplement the consolidated revenue fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the loan fund. Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $9.7 million for 199596, the bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already approved by, or currently before, the parliament. I emphasise that the bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.  purpose of the Loan Bill 1995 is to make provisions for financing a prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund in 1995-96. Legally, payments from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed moneys available to that fund. In order to meet any prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund it is customary to seek legislative authority to charge defence and other consolidated revenue fund expenditure to, or reimburse the consolidated revenue fund from, the Loan Fund. The bill provides authority to charge the loan cund defence expenditures which would otherwise be met from the consolidated revenue fund and to reimburse the consolidated revenue fund from the Loan Fund for certain non-defence expenditures. This bill does not in any way limit parliament's prerogative to appropriate public moneys but simply provides a mechanism for financing expenditures previously approved and appropriated by parliament. This is a normal procedure for financing consolidated revenue fund deficits and has been used by successive governments over many years. The coalition notes that there will not be any financial implications flowing from this legislation other than a small amount of fund expense stemming from raising the loans under this legislation. .The fact that the Commonwealth is again seeking to borrow should be of no surprise to anyone. Racking up debt is a trademark of this government. Commonwealth public debt interest increased from $7,106.8 million in 1994-95 to now stand at $9,387.5 million in 1996-97 and it will increase again to $9,470.2 million in that year. This is in stark comparison to the states, which will see their public debt interest decline from $1,118.7 million in 1994-95 to $648.6 million in 1996-97. What a difference a move to Liberal governments around Australia has made to the debt outlook of the states. The comparison with the Commonwealth is a stark contrast and is not favourable. The simple fact is this: the Keating Labor government cannot manage its finances. The result has been an explosion in Commonwealth debt. Australia will bea long time paying for this. The $9.4 billion we will pay this year for public debt interest is not going to hospitals, it is not going to roads and it is not going to provide Australians with any of the tax cuts they were promised; it is going to the financial markets. Australians will be getting no benefit for the over $9 billion worth of their hard-earned tax dollars because it is going straight to the banks. But this situation is of even more concern when you realise that we are now on a downward economic cycle. It is normal in business and in households to use the good times to retire debt, but the government will have nothing of such a tradition. It goes on racking up debt during the good times. Even when growth is strong and employment is expanding, and there is no self-evident need for 'a fiscal stimulus, this government goes on spending and racking up more debt. The government can talk about economic nirvana all it likes, but the truth is that we will go into the next period of low growth or downturn not having made any inroads into debt whatsoever. Sustained levels of solid growth are undoubtedly fundamental to this government meeting its forecast for the surpluses in the out years. If that growth not come through, the Commonwealth will not achieve those surpluses on the current settings. That means that we will continue rack up even more debt and more debt interabsent est. That will be the legacy of this Keating government-..,.an ever increasing mountain of debt and higher debt repayments. Cain and cannot Kirner did it in Victoria and now Paul Keating is trying it here. Members will' also recall the other similarities between Prime Minister Keating and Premier Kirner. Both revenue. sold off their banks to try to fudge it and improve the bottom ,line. The situation has come about because the government cannot control its spending. Even in this budget, spending increased by 1.7 per cent in real terms. . The government's negligence has other ramifications for Australia. Foreign debt is one of the great policy problems for Australia and this government's insistence on running budget deficits has been exacerbated through the Commonwealth's borrowing overseas. The government has been incapable of limiting - he growth of its. own debt or the national debt. The task before the government was to structurally reduce the deficit, lift savings and begin to work on reducing debt. The government failed in this t-sk.Given the enormous growth in ,spending, that is where the government should focus its efforts. Instead, it cut net expenditure by a pilfering $700 million and lifted taxes by $2.3 billion in 1995-96. The rest was made. up by asset sales and gimmicks. The government made a big noise about cutting back on spending but, at the end the day, it did not have the nerve to carry through. This is where the Commonwealth Commonwealth debt. debt problem is coming from-too much spending. The government tells everyone else that they need to pull their belts in for just a little while to achieve the economic nirvana that it promised, but it is are not prepared to do it itself. Even last week we found more evidence of this. Two Auditor-General's reports highlighted the incompetence of this government. One small report showed that seven per cent of the does Commonwealth's work force, or 10,000 officers, were non-operational and' one showed that the' tax office failed to collect to $50 million in tax due. One officer was for 20 years. Just what is going on in this government? It does not know what is happening in its work force and the tax office even collect the taxes it is supposed to. Yet the government expects Australian people to believe that this budget has spending as tight as it can be and there is a need to lift This government has run out of solutions and now is engaging in gimmicks. All the little one-off gimmicks and asset sales will not be there next year so they cannot be considered structural improvements to the budget. There is no solution in 'this budget. This was a budget to get the Keating gov'ernment to the next election. That is all. In fact, the only decision it did make was to impose further taxes on the Australian people. Revenue changes announced in this budget will add $2.4 billion in tax this year, raising $7.8 billion extra tax in 1998-99. The ALP does not know how to deal with spending and the enormous growth in debt, but make no mistake-cutting spending and lifting savings can be done in the Australian context. Victoria, for one, has shown that a financial situation can be retrieved if the hard decisions are made. Despite the best efforts of the ALP administration to bankrupt that state, Premier Kennett has done a magnificent job in reopening Victoria for business and reducing the state debt burden. Premier Kennett has been busy improving Victoria's position at the of same time as the Prime Minister has been it busy running up larger and larger amounts of The Prime Minister is still at it. Within one week of bringing down a phoney surplus, the Prime Minister was out there spending it with election promises to build yet another road and extend runways. This man has not stopped spending. He has not got the will to do it. This will feed through to higher borrowings. As far as he is concerned, if there are votes out there to buy, he will do it Australia must get its debt under control or we will pass to our children a terrible legacy. The coalition is quite clear in its commitment to the Australian people. We will not lift taxes and we will control spending. All areas of spending will be put through detailed assessment and examination. If there is not a clear purpose and a clear benefit to the Australian people, the expenditure will stop. The budget papers will not hide or distort the true situation. Commonwealth own purpose outlays will be revealed so that the government cannot just cut payments to the states and then claim fiscal rectitude when it is the states that are doing the hard work. This government has manifestly failed across a wide range of fronts. It has failed to bring down a credible budget and to make some meaningful effort to tackle the problem of debt. It has failed to tackle the question of its own spending. Instead, it has resorted to gimmicks and higher taxes. This government has run out of ideas and energy. It now clings to power merely by the sake of being in power. Let us go to an election so the Australian people can elect a government that does have ideas, that does have energy and that does have the will to do what is required.",91
258,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"The Loan Bill 1995 makes provision for the financing of a deficit in the consolidated revenue fund in 1995-96. Honourable members might find that strange, as would some of the unwashed public-if I can say that lightly-because we are told there is a surplus. So why would we need a loan bill if there is a surplus? It is a pretty simple question which anyone in the private industry and certainly the shareholders of a public corporation would be asking. They would smell a rat. Let me tell honourable members: there is a rat. Let us remember that the 1995-96 budget purported to be in surplus to the tune of $718 million, yet on closer inspection it is nothing more than a tricky accounting ploy to fool the public. Concealed at the back of the budget document lies the truth. It says there is 'a real underlying budget deficit of $8.232 billion'. That is why we need a loan bill. It is as simple as that. Labor is selling off the farm to pay the grocer, but our outstanding debt is still th\'!re and it will remain. It is ridiculous to sell our assets and plough the proceeds into consolidated revenue, into recurrent spending and into consumption spending by the government in the way that this gov\'!rnment is now doing. The states are leading the way. They are setting the example which this government might very well follow. They mostly use their privatisation proceeds to retire debt, and one can substitute 'assetsales' for'privatisation'. This lowers the cost of servicing debt which in turn contributes to the attainment of an even better fiscal outcome. That is what the states are doing. The proceeds of any sale of assets should go to retiring debt and no assets should be sold until we have a real, not a smoke and mirrors, budget surplus. Labor's asset sales, as members opposite kriow only too well in their heart of hearts, do absolutely nothing to reduce debt and are therefore. analogQus to throwing your money down the drain. This combination of deceit and gross fiscal mismanagement is becoming a familiar concoction overutilised by this Labor regime. Not surprisingly, the government has to make provisions to fund this insidious short.;. fall, and this bill is just one of many such measures. Much of the deficit will be funded by-tax increases, which are nothing more than income tax stolen back post the 1993 election. Our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is the Indian giver of Prime Ministers. He promises legislated tax cuts just to win government and then, having achieved this objective, snatches them back. These broken promises reveal this government's contempt for the Australian people it purports to serve. The Prime Minister should note that the Australian people will not be fooled again by his deceit and untruths. Let us look at New Zealand. The situation in New Zealand presents a stark comparison between a government that has taken responsibility for its citizens through prudent fiscal policy, through running budget surpluses and through offering tax cuts and an aberrant, negligent Australian Labor government that has overspent and lied about funding for its vote-buying spending sprees. Last week the Treasurer (Mr Willis) attacked New Zealand's economic restructuring as having been crude and brutal. Sir Roger Douglas had something to say about that. Sir Roger, the former New Zealand Labour Party finance minister, the counterpart of the Treasurer, responded to this sort of criticism in the New Zealand Herald of 2 June. He said: There is nothing more crude and brutal than a government .that seeks electoral advantage by refusing to make economic reforms that are desperately needed. Obviously, the tale of the great job of our part-time Prime Minister, full-time emperor, in deceiving the Australian people and defrauding them of the change of government they deserved in 1993 has made it across the Tasman. Sir Roger went on to say-and I agree with him-that the Treasurer was 'living in fantasy land' if he thought Australia could hope to enter the 21st century without undergoing major economic reform. He said: Most economists and most people in financial markets believe Australia has got more to do-and if they didn't believe that, tell me why their exchange rate would have dropped so dramatically of recent months. Since my reformsthat is, Sir Roger's reformsNew Zealand has consistently outperformed Australia. We have 6.6 per cent unemployed compared to 8.3 per cent across the Tasman. Our dollarthat is, the New Zealand dollarhas risen 27 per cent against the Australian 1992. . Perhaps we will have an end to these New Zealand jokes that we love to peddle around this country. We could learn a great deal from them. In terms of fiscal responsibility, we are the laughing joke of this part of the Pacific. If the Australian government had been prepared to make the hard decisions and implement fiscal policy like New Zealand, we too would now be reaping the rewards of budget surpluses that could be used to deliver tax cuts to low and middle income earners as well as reductions in our level of debt. Instead, the budget imposes tax hikes that strike at the very heart of middle Australia. The budget surplus handed down by the New Zealand government on 1 June came as no surprise. With the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 in New Zealand, a budget policy statement fully cos ted must be released to accompany the budget itself. Would it not be just great if that could happen in Australia? All fiscal policies must be costed and available for scrutiny by the parliament before a budget is handed down. Anything that involves scrutiny by the parliament is anathema to this mob. It is unimaginable that this government would ever adopt such a strategy for open and honest fiscal policy because, if it did, it would be shown up for what it really is: a government that hides the reality of overspending behind shonky budget figures and false surpluses with real underlying deficits. This is why the coalition is committed to the charter of budget honesty. I know the word 'honesty' does not fit well within the lexicon of our Prime Minister and his government. But that is probably a reason why the Australian people may be persuaded to forget the deficiencies of this failed Prime Minister, this full-time emperor. We need a formal commitment to a long-term budgetary surplus to reverse the recent explosion in Commonwealth debt. This must be backed by honest indications as to how such a stipulated outcome can be achieved. We also require adequate budgetary information to assess our progress towards stated goals. However, before we can undertake our since charter of budget honesty we need to accurately know what the state of the Commonwealth's finances really are. We do not know what they are from this regime. This will be accomplished by the establishment of a commission of audit. This commission, after the next election, will examine and report to the government on the real financial position of the Commonwealth, especially its indebtedness. Bodies like our proposed commission have been used effectively in several states in the last three years after state governments were tossed out of power. Our aim is a structural budget surplus and contained and falling levels of public sector debt. In New Zealand, budget surpluses have enabled drastic debt reduction. Net foreign debt in that country is set to be wiped out in the coming years, while in Australia it continues to grow and at a quickening pace. In New Zealand in 1992-93, net public debt was almost $NZ40 billion, which was 47.45 per cent of gross domestic product. It is forecast to fall to 32.1 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 and will continue to fall at least until 1997-98 when it is projected to be only 18.7 per cerit of gross domestic product, which is below $NZ20 billion. Surpluses the size of New Zealand's-seven per cent of GDP over the next three yearswould, if adopted by Labor in Australia, present opportunities for very limited increases in expenditure designed to build growth and equity, but would be limited to that alone. What we have to look forward to in Australia is quite the reverse. We have a burgeoning level of net foreign debt, which is only anticipated to increase further. Our total public sector level of debt is in the order of 37.5 per cent, which is where New Zealand was in 1992-93. The Commonwealth's level of public sector debt,as a proportion of gross domestic product, is around 18 per cent, but you need to include the states to give a true comparison, but this government does' not want to do that. To state the obvious, we are a federation and New Zealand is not. Aside from the tax fraud perpetrated by Labor, there is the selling off of government assets. Let it be remembered that these asset sales are final and are an unsustainable way of balancing the books. You cannot do it year after year; you can only sell them once. We have a country with national assets that are being chipped away to fund a Labor regime that spends well beyond its means. There is no long-term planning in this strategy. It is not really a strategy; it is a tactic. It is yet another quick fix solution to win another term in government. This will only continue the cycle of broken promises, lies and asset sales, and all for nothing as the structural deficit continues unaddressed. This will be passed on to our children, Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, and the children of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). Unfortunately for them they will not have any assets to sell the way we are going to. .  member for Sturt.",94
259,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"I do not know about the honourable member for Sturt. He has to prove himself. The OECD's 1995 report on Australia makes it clear that the Commonwealth if it wants to increase public savings on a long term basis will need to cut its structural budget deficit. That is as plain as day. Even our illiterate Prime Minister can understand that. Obviously, it has only two ways' of achieving such an outcome. It can' cut expenditure or it can raise taxes, or even a combination of the two. There could be a third-and it has riot resiled from using itand that is to borrow more money as long as there are enough suckers overseas to lend it to us when we have the balance sheets we have in this country after 13 Labor budgets: This government has gone hard and fast for the option of increasing taxes; the very thing it promised not to do. We are all getting sick of saying it but we do remember the l-a-w, pronounced 'lie', tax cuts in the run-up to the 1993 election. We all know what has happened since. This government has not. got the guts to cut its own recurrent outlays where trimming is most urgently required.' It is regrettable that Labor cannot come clean and confront its errors so that they can be rectified with sensible long-term solutions. . The Prime Minister. goes and preaches to the Japanese that they should apologise for the atrocities of the Second World War and the atrocities that ensued. In away; I agree with him. But he cannot admit his own errors. He cannot admit his own fiscal atrocities in 12 or 13 Labor budgets,yet he goes preaching to the Japanese about what they should do. It is all wearing pretty thin. Moving our total government sector into budgetary surplus is also the only way of moving our balance of payments around and starting to pay our way after a long absence of not paying our way in the world. If you want to be a major international trading nation you cannot run up balance of payments deficits in perpetuity. Something must give eventually. That something is a radical rethink of all government policy, including fiscal policy. In the meantime, individual Australians are being castigated for a poor national savings outcome. God bless us. This is a bit rich given the government's profligate example and the lack of incentives to save through the imposition of unfair taxation. Is it any wonder that our private sector's national savings record is so abysmal when the Australian government imposes the highest effective tax rates on voluntary savings in the OECD of around 60 per cent? The Managing Director of the National Australia Bank, Mr Don Argus, in his address to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in February, isolated the increase in burden of government regulation of small business as a major impediment to expansion. Amen to that. Instead of lowering the costs of doing business in this country, excessive Labor governmental tax regulation imposes increasing real costs on small to medium sized businesses. Mr Argus cited an example of a small to medium business with annual turnover of around $1 million that could expect to confront 80 separate forms requiring. over 500 hours of data collection and 100 hours of external advice. Is it any wonder that the cost of compliance continues to have a dampening effect on the spirit of innovation and competitiveness of small businesses in this otherwise great country? That brings me to the rise in company tax of three per cent and the negative effects this will have on business. Will businesses be forced to put up prices, or cut costs by laying off staff? Increasing tax burdens have a crippling effect on small businesses at a time when the government informs us that unemployment figures are falling and that our economy is booming. Public sector debt and the interest payments on that debt continue to grow concurrently. This is a government which has an awful habit of crushing small business. Labor's attitude is simple. If you cannot absorb the. higher taxes and charges, the administrative overload, the uncertainty of government policy and the like, then you should quit your business and become a PAYE employee. That is the attitude of our Prime Minister. It is easier for all concerned, though there is·a slight hitch: there will be no new jobs because it is the small business sector which creates the overwhelming majority of them. Getting back to fiscal policy, Mr Don Argus stated prior to the delivery of the budget that national savings can be increased by a combination of increased private sector and/or public savings. Realistically, however, as pointed out by Vince FitzGerald among others, in the near term public savings will need to do most of the work. Hence, the need for a budget surplus built not upon cyclical faCtors, but upon a firm policy of tightening the fiscal process to achieve a real and sustainable structural surplus. Mr Argus went on to point out that this should be achieved predominantly by slashing expenditure and not increasing taxes. (Time expired)",96
260,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"I would like to pick up on the theme covered in a most capable manner by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) as he explained the macro relationship of the Loan Bill 1995, which permits the Treasurer on behalf of the government to borrow more money. This is a process that is granted to the Treasurer by the states of Australia so he can go out on behalf of the Australian community and borrow money from both the Australian markets and the international markets to prop up whatever project the government wants to embark upon. Roger Douglas, the New Zealand economic reformer, who was the first Labour Treasurer in New Zealand for many years, made a few comments in the last few' days. Roger Douglas is recognised throughout the Western world as a very strong reformer who applied strong principles and strong drive to reforming the attitudes and psychology of government. Roger Douglas, who as I have said is a former Labour Treasurer, believes, 'Australia is living in fantasy land if it believes it can enter the 21st century without major economic reform.' Mr Sciacca-He also believes in lowering age pensions.",97
261,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"Roger Douglas might believe in a lot of things, but it is really difficult to find out what your government believes in. You will do anything, say anything, tell any lie and propose any policy but never deliver on those policies because you do not stand for anything. You have brought about record unemployment, record debt, record bankruptcy-record everything. Australia is the pits if you compare it economically with the rest of the world. If you compare Australia with the OECD countries on all these major economic measures-whether it be interest rates, employment, opportunity, well-being or anything you like to use as an economic or social measure-Australia looks to be in real trouble, and it has been for the last five years since we began the recession that we had to have. In the Weekend Australian of 3-4 June 1995, just a couple of days ago, Roger Douglas said that the Keating administration's economic policy was brutal. The Australian reported: ""There is nothing more crude and brutal than a government that seeks electoral advantage by refusing to make economic reforms that are desperately needed,"" Sir Roger said. When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) sought to say that Douglas had it wrong, the Australian reported: Sir Roger replied that his reforms had seen New Zealand start to outstrip Australia on economic growth, unemployment, inflation, fiscal and balance of payments measures. It continued: ""The financial markets are predicting a more successful economic performance for New Zealand than Australia,"" he said. ""We are a more attractive destination for investors than Australia. It does matter how much Mr Willis pretends everything is alright in Australia. It is not."" Despite the fact that Australia has a stronger economic base, as recognised by bankers from New Zealand, the Australian reported a Mr Morgan, who was asked about this, as saying: ""Compared with Australia, you can't really dispute that New Zealand is better in terms of economic policy settings,"" he said. ""But we are still an inherently weaker economy than Australia. ""We have had better management, but our debt ratios are still high and we can still slip backwards very quickly."" That is a fact. Who would deny the prospects of that? But the government's failure to recognise that Australia can be doing comparatively much better is something that disturbs all Australians. I recently conducted a survey of all businesses within my electorate. I do not know the political views of the small businesses in the electorate of Mitchell-there are about 4,000 of them. I listed a number of issues that I thought may be of concern to them and asked them to rank them. I then asked them to state on the blank pages other matters that would be of concern to them when operating a business. Small business is the key economic factor in providing jobs in the electorate of Mitchell. I suspect that that is the case in most electorates. In most electorates around Australia small to medium businesses-it does not matter whether it is a retail, wholesale or agricultural production business or whether it is related to the building industry or to manufacturing industries-are the very backbone of job opportunities for Australians. When I prepared this survey for about 4,000 businesses in the electorate of Mitchell, I asked them to tell me what they considered to be the greater impediments to profitability and to providing jobs. It might interest the House that some of the economic settings of this government and its borrowing regime, and the perilous situation it has put small business in, is really one of the factors that the people are going to take into account as they come up to an election. That is one of the reasons why I not do not hesitate to read the weekend comments of Roger Douglas. As he said, 'Australia is living in fantasy land if it believes it can enter the 21st century with.out maj.or ec.on.omic ref.orm.' These j.ob pr.oviders-and they are mum and dad businesses with their children w.orking f.or them-t.old me in this survey what they felt ab.out their future and ab.out what Australian g.overnments needed t.o d.o. The resp.onse rate t.o the survey was ab.out 12 per cent, which is a very high resp.onse rate. They were an.onym.ous replies if they s.ought t.o be an.onym.ous. But, ab.ove everything else, the c.ost .of g.overnment administrati.on was the thing that disturbed them the m.ost. Alm.ost half .of the business c.ommunity said that the time spent .on g.overnment administrati.on was their biggest w.orry because it was s.omething they had t.o d.o after h.ours when they were tired-and they have been f.orced int.o servicing the c.ommunity f.or l.onger and l.onger h.ours-with.out paid professi.onal help. The c.ost .of that administrati.on as.o rated very highly. I asked them t.o rate b.oth the c.ost fact.or and the time fact.or t.o them as a business. I wish t.o relate t.o the HHouse that the imp.ost .of this g.overnment .on the time .of small business, and the time and energy .of pe.ople wh.o were pr.oductive and j.ob providers, was the m.ost significant thing that it has imp.osed .over the last 12 years. One had .only t.o l.o.ok at the Leader .of the Opp.ositi.on (Mr H.oward) the .other night when he br.ought int.o the HHouse the tax act t.o see a practical dem.onstrati.on .of h.ow things have changed in this regard and t.o see the impact that the g.overnment's administrati.on has had .on small business. The tax act in 1983 was barely tw.o inches thick. It is n.ow six inches thick. Y.ou have increased the am.ount .of w.ords and the c.omplexity .of the process just in .one act al.one by approximately 200 per cent. If y.ou are g.oing t.o measure it by bulk, that is what y.ou have imp.osed. On t.op .of that, the g.overnment has imp.osed a capital gains tax regime, a fringe benefits tax regime and an enterprise wage bargaining process that few .of them understand. It has imp.osed changes t.o sales tax instead .of simplificati.ons. It has imp.osed a superannuati.on levy. On t.op .of that, there are state taxes. On t.op .of that, small businesses have t.o c.ope with increasing crime and vandalism. The g.overnment has an indexed fuel tax. It has unfair dismissal legislati.on. It has shipping c.osts and wharfage processes that small businesses d.o n.ot understand, and it has c.ommercial interest rates g.oing through the r.o.of. . . At the time this g.overnment is seeking t.o generate ec.on.omic activity, it has increased by multiple rati.os the c.omplexity that small businesses have t.o c.onfront when they want to-and when they are f.orced by law toadminister g.overnment programs and g.overnment requirements. By law, they must d.o it. The biggest c.omplaint from the small business c.ommunity in Mitchell-all .of the businesses had a chance t.o participate in the survey.overwhelmingly was that the c.ost and time spent .on g.overnment administrati.on was the greatest detriment t.o pr.oviding j.obs and profits. What else did the small businesses say was .of significance t.o them? They said generally that the sec.ond m.ost significant thing that prevented them from being pr.ofitable and putting .on additi.onal pe.ople was the fringe benefits tax. N.ot .only was it expensive in terms .of time, but it was c.ostly t.o their business. The theme in the resp.onses from the small businesses .of Mitchell was, 'D.on't put taxes like that .on us.' The third m.ost significant thing that the small business c.ommunity in Mitchell said was an impediment t.o empl.oyment and profitability was the superannuati.on levy. That is an.other new taximp.osed by the current g.overnment. The f.ourth m.ost significant feature .of .their c.oncern was c.ommercial interest rates. S.o the rising c.ost .of interest rates ranks with the c.ost .of administrati.on, the fringe benefits tax and the superannuati.on levy as the f.our m.ost significant things that this g.overnment has imp.osed .on small businesses in Australia. There were many .other features that the small business pr.opriet.ors .of Mitchell were asked ab.out. They were asked ab.out capital gains taxes, enterprise and wage bargaining, sales taxes, state payr.oll taxes, state land taxes, the f.oreign debt, unempl.oyment, crime and vandalism, fuel taxes, unfair dismissal, shipping costs and anything else they wanted to mention. But the top four were all Labor Party initiatives. This is what the proprietors have said to the government as a political party, but the government will remain basically deaf because I do not think anybody within the Australian Labor Party-or very few-have worked in the real world. Very few have held jobs in private enterprises. Very few have worked for themselves. Most of the government members have come through academic or union avenues. We only have to' look aUhe Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Bankstown boy. He has not worked in Bankstown in his life. He thinks, from the distance of the Lodge and overseas, that he has the capacity to understand the battlers of Australia. I am talking about the small business battlers of Australia. They are saying to the Australian Labor Party-and to the coalition as well-'We don't like the cost of administration that you have put on us. We don't like the fringe benefits tax. We don't like the superannuation levy, and we don't like what you are doing to commercial interest rates.' Broadly, that is what was said in the survey conducted of small businesses in the electorate of Mitchell, which is in the hills district of New South Wales. These small business people then wrote to me with their comments. Some of their comments are of interest to the House. lowe the business people of Mitchell the opportunity of having their comments to the government and the coalition recorded in Hansard. We ought to be using these real people-the real workers and the real battlers-as some sort of yardstick. The proprietor of a building company said: Small business employs more people in total than any other businesses. Every effort must be made by government to reduce non-essential paperwork, administration cost and encourage this sector. That is great common sense from that proprietor. A business proprietor in the sports and leisure industry in the Annangrove district said: In order to solve unemployment and make business profitable, Government has to hard working people and penalise lazy people. Not as at present time penalise hard working, 140 per week and support bludgers, greedy banks and exporting raw materials and importing fmished products which could be manufactured in Australia. They are pretty blunt comments from a pretty good 'Aussie'. These are the sorts of comments that small businesses are making to us as a parliament. As we proceed with the passage of the budget bills, the Australian Labor Party has said, 'We don't care, because this is as good as it gets.' It has said to the business people and the small business employers of Australia, 'It doesn't get better than this.' These are the words of the Prime Minister.. If the small business community hoped to be able to employ more people or expand, they should forget it because the Prime Minister says it is not going to get better than this. I will read more comments from the business people. A small company in Baulkham Hills said: Like the broken record that I am, things will be great if Government would just get out of business. A Carlingford business said: I am for once not able to make a decision. How can small business gamble to employ some person who may prove unsuitable then cost time and funds to dismiss? Tax. Far too many taxes. Apart from escalating costs, too much time are involved with records. The individual has to be responsible for providing for holidays, retirement, taxes, performance of quality work at work. These should not be like a gun held to the head of the employer. What else did the small business people in the Mitchell electorate have to say in response to my survey? They had comments of great interest about a range of subjects, and all in tune with what Roger Douglas said. These are all common sense, practical, public people, running 'mum and dad businesses' who wrote down what they felt should happen to Australia. They were in absolute opposition to the policies presented in the last budget of the Australian Labor Party, but in accord, in their own way, with what Roger Douglas said about Australia: we have to get our act together. An air conditioning business from the Dural district said: Banks are also making it hard for small business by stopping cheques if your overdraft exceeds the limit, regardless if you have the ample security plus provide incentive for many debtors. hours Here are some comments from a Castle Hill business: Penalty rates of pay are unfair impost on retailers who are forced to trade seven days a week. Also there are too many government decreed additional holidays to provide workers with long weekends. Holidays should be taken on the day public holidays fall and not extended at employers'. cost. . Another busiriess said: Thank you for the trouble you've gone to send me ihis questionnaire. Medical praCtices are. small businesses for a taxation and industrial relations viewpoint, although people forget that sometimes. Please do what. you can to get back into the political fight before Labor swamps us. We have done that. Another business in the North Rocks area said: Unfair dismissal legislation could ruin a service industry not being able to dismiss unsuitable Superannuation levy for part-time employees is unfair to' the employer and employees, as contributions will be consumed by costs and fees. Fringe benefits tax-an impediment to employment. For example, restaurants, car sales and manufacturing. Here is another example from Baulkham Hills. It states: The present political correctness program is not going to benefit the genuine Australia and without doubt we will end up just like the USA--that is, racial ghettos or no-go areas in our cities. Another example from the Box Hill area states: I am a self-employed person and would not take on school leavers even as casuals under today's conditions. And so I conclude my remarks, Mr Speaker. I am pleased to see you in the chair because I know that you are a man who understands about the battlers of Australia. It is a pity you were not a minister in order to make a bigger impact on government policy . Debate interrupted. NA",98
262,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. United Nations Conference on the Environment",101
263,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"On 5 June 1972, the world gathered in Stockholm for the opening of the United Nations Conference on Human Environment. Today we mark the anniversary of that conference by celebrating World Environment Day. In 1995 the challenge confronting us remains the same as it was in 1972-to preserve and enhance the environment which supports us. The conviction that the earth has an infinite capacity to support us now has the status of the flat earth theory. The earth is finite, and the resources we degrade today are the resources we no longer have tomorrow. If for no other reason than to ensure the future for those who will come after us, we must check the process of environmental degradation. I firmly believe that it is within our capacity to do so. I would like to use World Environment Day as an opportunity to recognise and encourage staff. the efforts of local communities which have taken on the responsibility of caring for the environment in which they live. Individuals and communities can play a major role in addressing environmental degradation, as proven by my own community in Adelaide. . The campaign to clean up the River Torrens is a case in point. For some time the delicate ecosystem that makes up Adelaide's much loved River Torrens has been ravaged by the chemical, oil and bacterial pollution resulting from the activities taking place in its catchment area. To highlight the need for action to stop the degradation of the river, I organised a community clean-up in January of this year. On the designated clean-up day I found myself joined by more than 50 other people. Again, on Clean Up Australia Day, a team of young people concerned about the environment joined me to collect rubbish along the river. The people who joined me on these occasions achieved much more than simply the removal of a truckful of rubbish from the river; they drew media and government attention to a problem which demanded an urgent and broad based response. Moves are now under way to implement a catchment mariagement plan for the River Torrens, which will coordinate state and local government resources in the task of modifying the activities which are currently degrading the River Torrens. A further instance of a community mobilising an environmental issue and achieving results is provided by the residents of Kilburn, who contacted me about a toxic waste dump at a Commonwealth government enterprise near their homes. For more than 30 years until the mid-1980s part of Australian National's rail yards were used for dumping of waste materials such as asbestos, sulfuric acid, cyanide, pesticide and engine oil. This material was never safely disposed of and, at the time residents contacted my office for help, there was a danger that Australian National was about to disturb the site and endanger the health of those living in the area. In cooperation, the residents of Kilburn and I were able to focus media attention on the waste disposal site, and we are persisting in our efforts to force the Commonwealth to take responsibility for the clean-up of the environmental minefield sitting in Kilburn. Having said that individuals can do much to ensure that our environment is preserved and enhanced, there must be no leeway given to governments to use this as an alibi for their ()wn inaction. There must be a more principled, less opportunistic response to the environmental challenge and policy moves like the recent turnaround by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the question of encouraging the use of unleaded petrol must become a thing of the past. Under cover of the fanfare and rhetoric surrounding the announcement of a number of environmental spending initiatives in the budget, the sales tax on new cars was increased to 21 per cent. This added about $1,000 to the cost of a new car and will price many people out of the new car market. The environmental cost of upping the tax on new cars-that is, the cars that run on unleaded fuel-was acknowledged by the Prime Minister in early 1992 when he said: From tomorrow, the sales tax on new cars . . . be permanently lowered to 15% ... with cheaper cars, we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment. I would argue that the level of lead in our environment remains a major issue which we must confront, and that what was good for the environment in 1992 remains good for the environment today. As I said, I believe we are capable of meeting the environmental challenge that faces us, but we must find the depth of commitment to match the enormity of the task. Price Watch Surveys",101
264,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, last week, on the adjournment debate, I referred to the closure of the Commonwealth Bank at Weipa on the western side of the Cape York Peninsula in my electorate. Tonight I want to talk about the problem of prices in remote communities in the north of Australia. Prices surveys carried out by the Queensland government regularly reveal that Weipa and Thursday Island in my electorate are by far the most expensive places in Queensland in which to live. My office recently started coordinating price watch surveys in Weipa, whereby each month the price of a standard basket of goods is recorded not only in Weipa but in several Far North Queensland supermarkets. It soon became apparent that the Weipa Woolworths was blowing out the average price recorded at other Far North Queensland supermarkets. Weipa's food basket was consistently priced at about $16 more than comparable baskets from Cairns supermarkets. Weipa is isolated but I do not believe that Woolworths can justify this type of price increase. After all, it is one of Australia's largest food chains. This is the only major supermarket in the area and services Weipa as well as the Napranum and Mapoon communities. I will be writing to the manager of Woolworths to seek some sort of clarification and justification for its pricing policies in Weipa. I will also be writing to the Prices Surveillance Authority. I would like to see more will vigilance with respect to remote area supermarkets and prices. Thursday Island in the Torres Strait in my electorate is another place where prices are particularly high. I understand how difficult it is for places in the Torres Strait to get food and that transport costs are considerable but there has to be some equity between prices for people living in remote areas and people living in urban centres. Simple things such as the weekly food shopping should not be so economically prohibitive that people are unable to live in remote areas. Petrol pricing is one of theinost obvious blatant abuses in price setting. It is interesting to note that the Indonesian petrol tankers come into Weipa before going around the Cape York Peninsula to Cairns; nevertheless, prices for petrol are often 10c or more a litre higher in Weipa than in Cairns. That is why there has to be some sort of inquiry· into the situation. I want to make sure that prices in these areas are regularly monitored to ensure that transport costs only are considered in setting price differences and that the sometimes exorbitant margins are not simply the result of petrol retailers and supermarkets taking advantage of a monopoly position. . People in remote areas realise that they have to pay more for their goods in supermarkets than· people pay in supermarkets in capital cities and major regional cities,such as Cairns.. But, in the 1990s, prices in remote areas should be going down with the improvement in roads and the technological change that is bringing all of us together. State and Commonwealth governments together should continue to monitor this situation. I will be raising the. matter at every opportunity until we get a situation where there is not what appears to be a massive rip-off of people living in remote communities. Member for Moore: Preselection Mr FILiNG (Moore) (7.39 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, I want to briefly touch on some remarks made by a colleague of mine from Western Australia, Senator Crichton-Browne, in the estimateshearingslast Friday. Not only are they manifestly wrong but also they are known to be wrong _and, as such, require correction. First of all, as part of his comments at the estimates hearings, Senator Crichton-Browne, as he has done publicly on a number of occasions, claimed that in 1991, in the process of preselection for Moore, he saved my preselection. That is, notwithstanding the fact that he is not a powerbroker, has no influence and is just a humble servant of the party, he somehow managed to save my preselection, influencing people to vote for me who might not otherwise have done so. I have made this point publicly and on the Ron Edwards program on radio 6PR, so it is not necessary to make-it under privilege. All Senator Crichton-Browne, or . anybody, has to _do is speak to the then chairman of the preselection committee for the Liberal Party, Mr Eric Bingley, and he will put them straight. He would quite openly inform them that my preselection win in 1991 was quite a comfortable one and certainly would not have been determined at all by anybody who would have been influenced by Senator CrichtonBrowne. Senator Crichton-Browne then went on to say that five people were influenced and that they would have had an influence over the preselection. There were, in fact, five delegates from the state council. On the Ron Edwards program Senator Crichton-Browne mentioned that they were the people he managed to influence. One of them was the chairman of the preselection committee himself, who I do not think would have been influenced in a' thousand years by what Senator Crichton-Browne had to say to him. Three of the other people in that group probably would have been highly insulted if they thought they were mere lackeys or robots or acted in arobotic way as a result of comments made by Senator Crichton-Browne. In fact, Senator Crichton-Browne rang me once to put this point to me and I asked him, 'If you say you managed to influence this particular event back in 1991, tell me exactly whose mind you managed to change.' He said, 'I'm not playing that silly game.' I said, 'I'm pressing you. Tell me who it was.' He then mentioned these so-called state councillors to whom I have just referred. Not only is what Senator Crichton-Browne saying not true, but he has been peddling this particular line for some time and I b-lieve he knows it is not true. In relation to his estimates committee appearance, Senator Crichton-Browne made some remarks in relation to the preselection for 1995. He claims that he had no role to play in the influencing of delegates, that somehow this happened by osmosis, that he had no particular influential participation. As his alibi, he has had the state president of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Mr Honey, say that he had contacted 10 of the 16 branch presidents in the electorate to ask them whether Senator Crichton-Browne had ever contacted them or appeared at the branch to influence their delegates. As I also mentioned on the Ron Edwards program on 6PR, that also is a bit of a' furphy. The reason for this is that, in the first in,stance, it would not be necessary to physically appear and make a personal 'intervention in those particular branches. It would perhaps be sufficient to ring influential key people and ask them to effect his particular objectives. One of the people that I believe had been involved in that was the highly malleable member for Wanneroo, Mr Wayde Smith, who in fact said to me last August at a branch function that he had received a call from Senator Crichton-Browne, who had said to him that I had got too much influence in the branches and that Mr Smith ought to sort it out, otherwise he would get a kick in the backside. Obviously, operating through malleable proxies like Mr Smith is a highly effective way, if Mr Smith has influence in those branches. The last point Senator Crichton-Browne raised was that I had deliberately sabotaged my preselection so that I could win the appeal. That is a rather intriguing and ingenious suggestion. That is interesting, considering that part of that preselection appeal process involved nine people whose applications turned up at one particular branch with manifestly false addresses. Presumably he is saying that I sent them along to deliberately sabotage the preselection when' in fact they returned to the sponsor to obtain correct addresses. Senator Crichton-Browne then used them as a reason for creating a new branch at the state executive. (Time expired) Member for Moore: Preselection",102
265,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, if you were fascinated by the contribution of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), then stay tuned because I, would like to make some more general points about this matter. What does the sacking of the honourable member for Moore by the Western Australian Liberal Party mean? I start with the Sunday Times of 21 May 1995 which, ,carried a headline 'Filing dumped again'. This refers to the Ullfortunate lack of success by the member for Moore with his appeal to the Liberal Party state council'in Western Australia and postulates the member for Moore running as an Independent or as a National Party candidate at the next election. While we are' very intrigued with the internecine machinations, that the honourable member for Moore gave a short time ago, what does this meari for the Western Australian Liberal Party on Ii grand scale? On Perth radio 6WF on 4 April, before the honourable member for Moore's 'unsuccessful appeal; Fred Chaney, the former member for Pearce, former colleague of the member for Moore and former' Deputy Leader"" of the Liberal Party, stated: · . . I would like to say that what a mess the party is. I mean the party I joined as my wife put it no longer exists . . . ' ,, Mr Chaney further states: · .. it's become a much narrower beast unfortunately and much more concerned with party interests and much more concerned with factional interests within the party. , Mr Leo MCLeay-Is this the Liberal Party?",104
266,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This is the Liberal Party. Mr Chaney continues: · .. it was just a different sort of party that i stood for, a different sort of party I believed in and I am sorry to see the state it's in now. In relation to the honourable member for Moore's position, he states: When I see people like Paul Filing who is again a classic conservative West Australian states righter, a person of it seems to me impeccable credentials and when I see him under threat and under attack I wonder what in the world is going on .. '. On the Channel 9 Sunday program on 9 April, in an interview with Laurie Oakes, the member for Moore tells us about the Western Australian Liberal Party: · .. basically it starts eating itself. Laurie Oakes says to him: You lost your preselection despite an endorsement from John Howard. Alan Rocher a couple of weeks ago lost his preselection, despite a strong endorsement from John Howard. Your leader's endorsement is not worth much at all, is it? It is a very prescient question. The honoutable member for Moore responds: It's a bit strange when the party over here wha-ks him around the ear and then says they support 100 per cent. I just find that a bit of a strange way to show support. Laurie Oakes asks: Do you expect John Howard now to act to save you? The honourable member for Moore responds: John has been, I think, showing tremendous leadership but in this particular instance limited ... What does this episode show about the Tuckey Western Australian Liberal Party? Disunity, yesterday vicious internal fighting and ship. That results in the point that we. ha,:e been making all week: when you have dISUnIOpposition ty, infighting and no leadership, you end with no policies. On 24 May, the editorial of Australian summed up many of these points. The heading 'WA Liberals mess it up again' is somewhat of an understatement. The editorial states: The Liberal Party in WA seems to have an extraThe ordinary capacity for political perverSIty. It mentions 'a bitter factional battle' and 'vicious infighting'. In the body of the editoricontinuing al, it states: . . . the Liberals are again showing voters the divisions that persist in the party. The political maxim that disunity is death is a lesson WA Liberals refuse to learn. For a new angle, the editorial further states: The Moore fiasco has allowed long-simmering NP resentment at perceived Liberal slights bubble to the surface. NP officials can barely suppress their glee at the Liberal's self-imposed discomfort . . . Hence, the explanation for the approach by the National Party for the honourable member for Moore to be its candidate in the seat Moore. The editorial goes on to refer to: . . . a clear demonstration of the fragility of tions between the coalition parties in WA. The Moore result is the latest in a long series incidents that suggest Liberal faction leaders more intent on retaining their narrow internal bases. . . . The editorial calls upon the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to stop hiding his inaction behind excuses and to take action to stop the party descending into what is described as 'civil war'. Talking about political perversity, I will him finish with a particular Western Australian Liberal. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was in here the other day threatening the members for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and try to Lilley (Mr Swan) about things they were saying. I remind him of an article that appeared in the West Australian of 18 January it is this year headed 'Tuckey to run if Downer opposed'. The article stated: Opposition veterans' affair- spoke.sman Wil-on officially threw his hat mto the nng for the expected Liberal leadership ballot a lack of leaderlater this month. This was the ballot that saw the Leader of the come to prominence. The memup bers for Werriwa and Lilley need not worry. It is all talk, no action from the member for the West O'Connor. (Time expired) Hoser, Mr Raymond",104
267,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"This week sees the publication of a book that will shortly be well known to many Australians, Hoser Files. In it author Raymond Hoser, who has been a taxi driver in Melbourne from late 1985 until the present day, details his and often frustrating fight against official harassment and corruption. Raymond deep Hoser previously wrote a best seller, Smuggled-the underground trade in Australian wildlife, which dramatically exposed numerous illegal activities by officers of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, the NPWS. These illegal activities, into Hoser's own words, 'includeq wildlife trafficking, murder, bashing, phone tapping, arson, court fixing and other types of corruption' . Following its release in May 1993, Smugof gled was illegally banned by NPWS until the then minister, Chris Hartcher, stepped in a relamonth later and ordered the lifting of the ban . Smuggled, and the valuable work Raymond of Hoser did prior to its release, did cause the are last state coalition government in New South power Wales to initiate a major clean up of the department. This included the purging of several senior NPWS officials. Hopefully, The Hoser Files will bring about a similar cleansing effect on certain elements of the bureaucracy in Victoria. Hoser especially documents the all too frequent harassment of taxi drivers, including himself, by particular enforcement officers of Vicroads. Vicroads, known as the Road Traffic Authority prior to 1989, has regulatory responsibility in Victoria for the taxi industry. According to Hoser, multiple hiring, though quite legal in Victoria for many years, was a common catalyst for intimidatory behaviour by some Vicroads officials towards taxi drivers. To quote Hoser: Multiple hiring is when a taxi driver takes more than one fare at a time and charges each fare separately. This occurs when there are more people waiting for taxis than there are taxis available. As Hoser points out, it is 'highly profitable' for drivers and for passengers-'It is often the only means of getting a taxi to their destination'. These considerations, phiS the clear legality of multiple hiring, makes the behaviour of Vicroads all the more irrational. Another key area where taxi drivers are hard hit is fare evasion. Until I read this book, I personally had no idea how vulnerable taxi drivers were to this abuse and how extraordinarily widespread it is. Again, I quote Hoser direct: Fare evasion,although a problem faced by taxi drivers everywhere, seemed worse in Victoria. In fact, in my first shift driving a taxi in Melbourne, three people tried to avoid paying the fare. Worse still was the complete inaction of some Victoria Police officers in dealing with the problem, even when precise details of the individuals and circumstances involved were provided or, more incredibly, when the offender was actually handed over to the police by a driver. It is understandable that a busy Victoria Police force may regard taxi fare evasion as a.1ow priority, but it is no small matter to the taxi drivers affected. The second half of Hoser' s book centres on his continually thwarted attempts to rectify these and other abuses in the taxi industry, with Vicroads management, Victoria Police internal investigations, the ombudsman's office, the courts and other avenues of appeal. The Hoser Files is a book that was well worth writing and is compelling reading. It must be the basis for vigorous reforms in Vicroads regulation of the taxi industry and more effective handling of legitimate grievances of Victoria's taxi drivers. I have here a copy of the book, which I have shown the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table. I seek leave to table the book, as it is being released this week.",105

269,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I, like your good self, was fascinated by the machinations of the Moore electorate council. Prior to the election before last, I was visited by a delegation of Young Liberals who sought my help in overthrowing the member for Moore (Mr Filing). They detailed all his crimes-and I am sure that they were absolutely right about them-but I had to explain to them that my interests were in their continuing to fight and they could expect no help from me. They left saying that they thought they had the numbers anyway. They clearly did not, but the campaign continued. It is all very interesting. I suggest the member for Moore write a book. I am sure we would all like to know more about it. I would say something in defence of Senator Crichton-Browne. During the problems we had in Western Australia with the so-called WA Inc., Senator Crichton-Browne said to me, 'You'll never hear a peep out of me about WA Inc., because in my view the government will be the last to know and under the circumstances any government would do the same. If it happened again, the government will do it again.' Of course he was absolutely right. Some time later we had problems with the Albany cannery and the Court government bailed out the cannery. In fact, it was far worse than anything that had happened under WA Inc. After $30 million or $40 million of inquiry, the royal commission said that there was no corruption in Western Australia. That was the finding of the royal commission which was set up specifically to find corruption, and it could not find it. In the case of the Albany cannery, the Court government did bail it out. The interesting thing was that the creditors, who were the shareholders, were also members of the Liberal Party. As Senator Crichton-Browne said, if it happens in the future, governments will do it again. Senator Crichton-Browne has kept his word. No matter how much scorn and abuse is heaped on him by elements of the Liberal Party, he probably knows more about the workings of business than anyone else on that side of the house. He has always shown integrity, which has often been lacking in other members of the Liberal Party. So in my view, he is not all bad. r came into this house to talk about other problems. The Esperance High School is in a fast growing area and it clearly needs and is lacking government assistance. It is a school designed for 450 students. It now has almost 750 and it really has not had the money spent on it that it should have had to continually upgrade it. It was suggested by a colleague of mine that this was because it was considered to be a safe government seat and therefore the government was not interested in it. I do not think that is true. The problem is that it is simply a country seat which is a long way away. Most ministers react to pressure from their bureaucrats and because it is a long way away, they do not really care. It is not a safe seat; it is held by Ross Ainsworth of the National Party. It would be very simple for the Liberal Party to win that seat at the next election. The competition between the National Party and the Liberal Party in Western Australia is just as intense as it is between the Labor Party and the other parties. Ross Ainsworth, as the honourable member for Roe, ought to be assisting the people in his electorate because he could very easily lose that seat. He has been lulled into a sense of false confidence because he won it without preferences last year. In my view, there were special circumstances. I went out to support him-against the official Labor ticket, I might add-for local reasons. He cannot rely on that help in the future. The high school clearly needs upgrading. It requires $2 million to $3 million worth of upgrading now. Had the money been spent in the last few years, we may have been able to avoid some of that. It is true that there have been no real additions to the town of Esperance since the seat was lost by June Engrel following the redistribution. During the time of June Engrel and Mark Nevill, the upper house member, a lot of assistance went into the town of Esperance that simply has not been forthcoming in recent years. I do not believe it is because the government in Western Australia seems to think it is a safe seat. It is simply because it is a remote country seat and it has not been lobbied for strongly by its member. I sound a warning to that member now: if he does not start acting in the interests of the community, he simply will not survive the next election. Question resolved in the affirmative.

This government is asking us to the $55 million of last year when it forecast budgeted for $5.3 billion. Why should we believe it any other year? Over the past few years there have been shortfalls year, from 1988-89 when it was $172 million was forecast. There is a combined shortfall no reason to believe that this year it should budget does nothing to stem the fundamental current outlays are continually above recurrent calling on domestic and foreign savings to program has been used to try to camouflage fundamental problem.

Reserve Bank dividends certainly an increase in the interest being charged to up by-I think-half a billion dollars. The are government enterprise dividends of $1.3 $1.6 billion.

For all that I disagree with the conflicts between state rail authorities We need to look at the nature of the $184 that there are in this budget. When I look through is the increase in excise on light fuel oils. Paper No.1, page 416, the statement: Legislative amendments will be introduced in the budget exclude so-called light fuel oils which are, in fact, 1 July and result in these fuels You might well say that those people who have fuel to light fuel oils deserve to pay the price, in the change from distillate to light fuel oil National Rail Corporation have made with the rail authorities have made this change approximately the amount that standard gauge excise, from the railways! The government has to building up standard gauge railways.

Part of the cost is represented that state rail authorities and the Australian their own locomotives. One of the reasons why is that this government has been extracting rail costs year by year, by. way of diesel fuel been doing so without in any way contributing is, by way of diesel fuel excise, year connection costs.

MC 1165 Department of Communications and the Arts Department of Tourism Main Committee adjourned at 7.41 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Hilmer Committee of Inquiry (Question Nos 1486-1506) Mr Bruce Scott asked all Portfolio Ministers, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: (1) Has the Minister's Department calculated what its tax obligations would be if the national competition policy proposed by the Hilmer Committee of fuquiry was fully implemented; if so, what is the best estimate of the Department's annual local government rates liability throughout Australia. (2) What other (a) financial and (b) non-financial effects would the full implementation of the proposed national competition policy have on the Department's activities.",177
351,Mr WILLIS,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The following answer is provided on behalf of all Portfolio Ministers to the honourable member's question: (1) The national competition policy proposed by the Hilmer Committee largely establishes reform processes rather than specific reforms in individual sectors. With respect to taxation, the national competition policy reforms establish a set of principles designed to achieve competitive neutrality between government and private businesses. These principles do not require the Commonwealth to impose taxes on Departmental businesses because they cannot be obliged to pay taxes. On the issue of Departmental liability for local government rates, section 114 of the Constitution precludes States from imposing any tax on property belonging to the Commonwealth, without the consent of the Commonwealth Parliament. However, Departments presently operate under Finance Directions which allow the gratuitous payment to local governments of an amount equivalent to general rates in circumstances where such costs will be demonstrably passed on to third parties. These circumstances might arise where, for example, a Commonwealth Department uses property for a commercial undertaking and includes the cost of rates in its pricing structure. It is not anticipated that implementation of the Hilmer Report will change this policy. (2)(a) and (b) Discussions with State and Territory Governments on implementation of the Hilmer NA Report have been in train since the Hilmer Report's release in August 1993. Draft legislation and intergovernmental agreements were released for public comment. Revised legislation was introduced to the Senate on 29 March 1995, and revised inter-governmental agreements were executed at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 11 April 1995. The Hilmer Report has six main elements, which will have varying effects on the activities of Departments. Financial effects may include a possible slight lowering of the prices of goods and services purchased by Departments, arising from increased competition within the economy. Nonfinancial effects will include the work associated with the involvement of Departments in the implementation of reforms flowing from the proposed national competition policy. The first element of the Hilmer Report is legislation affecting the operation of the competition provisions contained in Part IV of the Trade Practices Act. The amendments involve extension of Part IV of that Act to currently exempt businesses. There are also some technical amendments to the form of the prohibitions. Commonwealth Departments are already bound by the Trade Practices Act, and it is not expected that the amendments to that Act will have a significant effect upon Departments' activities. There is likely to be some impact on State Government departments and authorities which are not currently bound by that Act. The second element of the Hilmer Report is a process for reform of regulation that unjustifiably restricts competition. Under the inter-governmental Competition Principles Agreement the Commonwealth is required to develop a process for the review of legislation that restricts competition, to ensure that the benefits of the restriction to the community as a whole outweigh the costs and that the objectives of the legislation can only be achieved by restricting competition. Various Departments will be involved in reviews of legislation, and as a result of the review processes some legislation administered by Departments is likely to be amended. The third element of the Hilmer Report relates to the structural reform of public monopolies. The Competition Principles Agreement requires the Commonwealth to ensure that before introducing competition to a sector traditionally supplied by a public monopoly, it will remove from the public monopoly any responsibilities for industry regulation. The Commonwealth is also required, before introducing competition to a market traditionally supplied by a public monopoly, or before privatising a public monopoly, to undertake a review to ensure that various policy matters are duly taken into consideration. These requirements do not commit the Commonwealth to the introduction of competition in particular sectors or to the privatisation of particular commercial operations. Nevertheless, where Commonwealth Departments do propose to introduce competition to a sector traditionally supplied by a public monopoly, or to privatise a public monopoly, they will need to ensure compliance with the Agreement. The fourth element of the Hilmer Report is the establishment of a legal regime permitting, in certain circumstances, third parties to have access to certain facilities, such as electricity transmission grids or gas pipelines,. which are essential for competition in related markets. The access regime will be established in a new Part of the Trade Practices Act. It is not at this stage expected that it will be applied to facilities currently owned or operated by Commonwealth Departments. The fifth element of the Hilmer Report relates to prices surveillance. The legislation which was introduced into Parliament contains a number of amendments to the Prices Surveillance Act, including the introduction of ongoing formal monitoring of prices charged by businesses. The PSA is to be merged with the Trade Practices Commission to form a new competition authority. Commonwealth Departments are already potentially subject to scrutiny under the Prices Surveillance Act, although occasions on which Departments have actually been subjected to such scrutiny have been rare. It is not expected that the amendments to that Act will have any significant impact upon the activities of Commonwealth Departments. There is likely to be some impact on State Government Departments and authorities which are not currently subject to that Act. The final element of the Hilmer Report relates to the competitive neutrality of Government businesses. The Competition Principles Agreement requires the Commonwealth to develop a policy statement on competitive neutrality, with the objective being that Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage simply as a result of their public sector ownership. The effects of implementation of this element of the Hilmer package will not be determined until the Commonwealth develops·its policy statement on competitive neutrality.

(2) How long did each State take to respond in each case. (3) Was agreement eventually reached in each case; if not, why not.",183
353,Dr LAWRENCE,ATO VACANT LEASED SPACE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(3) The Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (AHMAC), the Australian Health Ministers' Conference (AHMC) and the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy (MCDS) are consensus bodies with decisions taken not necessarily being binding on any of the participating jurisdictions. The primary role of these Commonwealth/State bodies is to provide an opportunity for intergovernmental consultation in which the shared interests of the Commonwealth and the States can be discussed. The proceedings of the AHMC are available in the Parliamentary Library. I have supplied copies of the decisions of AHMAC and MCDS for meetings since 1991 to the honourable member. To examine the decisions of these bodies in the terms of the honourable member's question would require extensive resources and I am not prepared to authorise this. Office area m2 Dept.

355,Dr LAWRENCE,ATO VACANT LEASED SPACE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that the Department has accepted and paid bills relating to ministers and ministerial staff incurred while the respective ministers held responsibility for this portfolio. In some cases these accounts have been received and paid after the ministers have left the portfolio. These payments have been in line with their entitlements. I am also advised that the Department has conducted an investigation which indicates that equipment provided to former ministers, ministers' offices and ministerial staff has been returned.to the Department or is in use by current Ministers and their staff. Labour Market Programs: NonCompletion (Question No. 2047) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 8 February 1995: How many participants of labour market programs administered by his Department who commenced in (a) 1993-94 and (b) 1992-93 and carried over to 1993-94 failed to complete the programs in (i) total and (ii) each program. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: JobStart JobTrain Special Intervention Program Job Clubs Mobility Assistance Accredited Training for Youth NA JobSkills NA NElS Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders program Other programs (b) Total (a) Figures are not available for the Skillshare program. Skillshare offers a mix of services for jobseekers including open access, formal training, work experience and enterprise training. DEET does not monitor a specific participant's movements from one Skillshare service to another but rather records a single placement with Skillshare regardless of how many individual services may be accessed. Thus, it is not feasible to identify a approved placement period"" and, therefore, the concept of an exit being early does not apply. (b) ""Other programs"" includes Contracted Placement, Post Placement Support, Post Placement Support for People With Disabilities and Work Experience for People With Disabilities. Clients may not complete labour market programs for a number of reasons. In many cases the reason may be to commence full-time employment or to undertake further full-time education and training. Often clients who leave wage subsidy placements do so to transfer to an unsubsidised job. Outcomes which are achieved in this way are obviously more cost effective than those achieved through full completion of a subsidy period or course. For those who commenced participation in programs in 1993-94 or 1992-93 and continued their placement into 1993-94 the table below shows the number of participants who left the placement before completing the full approved placement period. The difference in the number of clients between 1992-93 and 1993-94 is due to the much smaller number of clients who commenced in 199293 and continued into 1993-94 (126,223) when compared with total commencements in 1993-94 (528,619).

Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Information on any State or Territory Government-funded employment programs should be sought from those Governments. Skillshare and Jobstart: Commencements (Question No. 2050) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 8 February 1995: How many commencements were there in the (a) Skillshare and (b) Jobstart programs in the (i) September and (ii) December quarters in (A) 199394 and (B) 1994-95. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) The table below shows the data requested. It should be noted that in February 1994 general access to J obStart wage subsidy assistance was withdrawn for jobseekers unemployed between 6 and 12 months. This category of participants had represented a substantial proportion of JobStart business. SkillS hare commencements are traditionally very low in the December quarter compared with the September quarter due to the Christmas shutdown, exacerbated by the completion of SkillShare contracts at the end of the calendar year. The lower number of SkillS hare commencements in December 1994 when compared with December 1993 has been more than offset by a higher number of commencements in other training programs especially in JobTrain and SIP.

(2) What sum has been allocated under Working Nation to each (a) federal electoral division, (b) Department of Employment, Education and Training region and (c) local government area to the date of answering this question. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ,(1) Projections of Working Nation expenditure cannot be made in terms of the geographic unit levels identified in the honourable member's question. Program expenditure within my Department is controlled at its Area and National levels although many of the expenditure decisions are to contracts made at the Regional level. (2) Funds are not allocated at the geographical unit levels identified by the honourable member in his question. Most funds for Working Nation initiatives in 1994-95 have been allocated to Areas. Some funds are allocated to National Office. Medicare Benefits (Question No. 2107) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: . . What was the average payment of Medicare benefits per capita in each federal electoral division in (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92, (c) 1992-93 and (d) 1993-94. Dr Lawrenc-The answer to the honourable member's question was incorporated in the Hansard of 28 March 1995. A revised ansWer is as follows: The need for the revised an'swer resUlted from difficulties in estimating the population .for six federal electoral divisions, as a result of changes to Statistical Local Areas following the 1991 Census of Population and Housing. . The federal electoral divisions for which tion estimates have been revised in the period cases. 1991-92 to 1993-94 are Bass, Denison and Franklin in Tasmania, and Charlton, Hunter and Newcastle in New South Wales. While total Medicare benefits by federal electoral division have not altered, benefits per capita for the six federal electoral divisions have altered as a consequence of the change to the population estimates. It should be noted that population data are only published by federal electoral division in years covered by a Census of Population and Housing. Furthermore, Medicare data are not captured on federal electoral division basis. Details of Medicare benefits per capita for each federal electoral division based on claims processed in each of the years in question, are attached. The data in the attached table relate to current electoral boundaries. It was not possible to map data using the electoral boundaries that existed the time the services were processed. The data only relate to services rendered 'fee-for-service' basis for which Medicare benefits were paid in each of the respective years. Excluded are details of services to public Estimated Population, Total Source: Agesex Summary Date of Processing (Z4857 AGE) .Commonwealth Electorate 1990-91 . Adelaide Aston Ballarat Banks Barker Barton Bass Batman Bendigo Bennelong Berowra Blaxland Bonython Boothby Bowman populato Veterans' Affairs patients and compensation In compiling data for inclusion in the attached table, details of benefits paid by patient postcode were mapped to electoral division using data from the 1991 Census of Population and Housing. Where a patient postcode overlapped electoral division . boundaries, Medicare benefits data were apportioned to the respective divisions using the proportion of the population residing in each division as estimated by the Australian Bureau of StatistiCs (ABS). A small proportion of postcodes could not a be mapped to electoral division and appear in the attached table as 'unknown'. Population data used in compiling Medicare benefits per capita for 1990-91, 1991-92 and 199293 were ABS estimates by Statistical Local Area (SLA) (mapped to electoral division using the relationship between SLA and electoral division at the the time of the 1991 Census of Population and at Housing).

As such, this role is central to community life and the maintenance of marriage and the family as' an institution supporting society. Applicants,· in keeping this dual role must: . demonstrate an appropriate sense of integrity in performing the role; not have a criininal record; not have a conflict of interest or potential for such a conflict of interest in connection with either their business interests, hobbies or other interests. NOTE: Applicants will be required to provide the name and address of two referees to attest to their character and general suitability. (b) Selection criteria are applied in the authorisation of all civil marriage celebrants. . (3) Yes. (a) I am advised that all the 562 persons appointed in 1995 up to March 1995 applied before 1 July 1994. (b) The date of receipt of applications is not recorded on the Departmental database. I am advised that Legal Aid and Family Services do not have the resources to undertake the manual extraction of information required to provide a precise answer to the honourable member's question. However, during this appointment process, applications received between 1984 and the imposition of the moratorium on applications on 30 November 1993 were considered. (4) F.ollowing authorisation, civil celebrants are provided with Information for New Celebrants, Schedule of fees, Advertising Guidelines and a List of contact numbers of the various Registries of Births, Deaths & Marriages throughout Australia. A Handbook is also provided which contains the Marriage Act and Regulations as well as an Explanatory Memorandum. The Explanatory Memorandum is provided by Legal Aid and Family Services to assist celebrants in their role. Celebrants are also invited to contact the department or the State Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages at any time. (5)(a) Since 1 January 1992, 42 instruments authorising civil marriage celebrants have been revoked. In addition, the appointment of all Australian marriage officers at Australian overseas posts were revoked, with effect from 1 January 1995, by the Attorney-General, at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Under the Marriage Regulations, the Attorney-General may appoint as a marriage officer a person appointed to hold or act in the office of Ambassador, High Commissioner, Counsellor or Secretary at an Embassy, High Commissioner's Office, Legation or other post, or Consul.

(6)(a) Legal Aid and Family Services investigate all complaints received in writing in respect of compliance with advertising standards. In most cases no further action has been taken. Where appropriate, Legal Aid and Family Services has reprimanded the celebrant. I am advised that, in the judgement of the Department, no breaches have been serious enough to justify revocation. (b) Legal Aid and Family Services investigate all complaints received in writing in respect of compliance with charging prescribed fees. (c) All marriages are registered with the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages iIi the State or Territory in which they were performed. Where a question arises as to the validity of a marriage, the Registry refers the matter to the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department for further consideration.

360,Mr CAMERON,SELECTION CRITERIA,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 29 March 1995: (1) Did she collaborate with Cleo magazine to publish the safe sex guide which appeared in the December 1994 issue; if so, why. (2) Was the guide a Government (a) what statistics were used in selecting Cleo to publish it and (b) were tenders called from other magazine publishers. (3) Did she or her Department (a) prepare and (b) endorse material in the guide; if so, was the objective of the guide to promote safe anal intercourse and not to discourage anal intercourse. ,(4) Did she or her Department take account of the age groupings of Cleo's readership; if so (a) what is the breakdown, (b) from whom were the figures derived and (c) what proportion of the readership comprises teenagers. (5) Did she or her Department intend that teenagers be exposed to the contents of the guide. (6) Did the Commonwealth fund the publication of the guide; if so, what was the benefit to the Commonwealth.",213
361,Dr LAWRENCE,SELECTION CRITERIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department commissioned Cleo to produce a Safe Sex Guide to be banded to the December 1994 issue of Cleo magazine. The Department funded the Guide following recent research indicating that the majority of young people aged eighteen· years and over are sexually active. Research evidence further indicates that young people are engaging in a wide variety of sexual behaviours, including anal intercourse. It is essential therefore that these. young people be presented with information that is factual and accessible. Research undertaken by. the Family Planning Association indicates that for 63% of young women, the main sources of information on health matters are magazines and books. This is supported by recent research (Survey on the National Policy on the Health of Young Australians, 1995) which indicates that for 59.8% of young people, the most common sources of information about health are magazines and books. The guide is consistent. with the promotion of safe sexual practices which has been a theme of all Australian Governments in recent years. (2) The Safe Sex Guide was an initiative of the Department of Human Services and Health. The Department considered a number of popular women's magazines, including Cleo, New Woman, and Cosmo. The Department selected Cleo for several reasons. Firstly, the circulation of Cleo is higher than that of other Women's magazines; and secondly because Cleo readers are predominantly women aged 18 to 35 years, which reflects the target audience of the project. These figures were obtained through Cleo magazine, which obtains its figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations and initiative; if so, Morgan. (3) Under the arrangements with Australian Consolidated Press editorial control remained with Cleo. Cleo journalists wrote the articles in the style which they knew would be attractive to the target audience of young people between 18 and 35 years of age. An advisory committee consisting of appropriate experts was established by the Department to oversight the process. I endorse the Guide's approach to safe sex. . Supporting the need to communicate with young adults in a way that is meaningful to them does not necessarily mean a personal endorsement of either the sexual behaviours discussed, or the style in which the articles are written. My view is that the sexual preferences and practices of consenting adults are issues for each individual to consider. My concern is that people have appropriate information easily available to them so that, whatever their sexual practices, they engage in them in the safest way possible. The Guide provides this information. Explaining the risks associated with anal sex to people who choose to engage in this behaviour was the purpose of the anal sex article. The article is not intended to advocate anal sex. It should be noted that the anal sex article is only one of 19 articles and feature items contained in the Guide. "" (4) The Department took into account the Cleo readership which is as follows: Age Percentage 14-17 20.1 18-34 59.6 35+ 20.3 These figures were provided by Cleo, and were sourced from Morgan-October 1992September 1993. There was no further break-down available to determine the proportion of teenagers. (5) The Department considered that young women who regularly read Cleo magazine, and other such magazines, would have been exposed to information regarding relationships and sexual activities. It is essential therefore that these young people be presented with information that enables them to protect themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases if they choose to become sexually active. (6) The Department provided $200,000 to Australian Consolidated Press to produce the Safe Sex Guide, which was banded to the December 1994 issue of Cleo Magazine. The Department received a further 50,000 copies of the Safe Sex Guide. A further $50,000 was allocated for the project development, launch and related administrative costs. ·The use of such a popular women's magazine provides a unique opportunity·to communicate with young women about important sex:ual health issues such as sexually transmitted diseases. The project is consistent with the National HIV/AIDS Strategy which identifies women as a target group for education and prevention programs; and aims to eliminate the transmission of HIV and minimise the personal and social impact of HIV infection. Higher Education Contribution Scheme (Question No. 2313)",213
362,Mr CAMERON,SELECTION CRITERIA,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: (1) Will the Government ensure. that (a) Higher Education Contribution Scheme liability payments will not be increased, (b) an up-front fee system will not be introduced and (c) tertiary funding per student in Western Australia will not decrease in the 1995-96 Budget. (2) Will he consider introducing a rebate for students receiving low incomes to assist them to purchase necessary textbooks. (3) Has he investigated the cost to students of textbooks; if not, will he or his Department (a) investigate the matter or (b) ask the Prices lance Authority to do so. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government has not increased the size of an individual's Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) debt in the .1995-96 Budget or introduced up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. The Government has increased its commitment to the further development of a high quality and accessible Australian higher education system. The 1995-96 Budget provides $16.5 billion over the 1996-98 funding triennium for the higher education sector, including funding for additional student places in areas of growing population and growth in research and research infrastructure. In 1995 the average funding rate per EFfSU in Western Australia is $9,995 (at the 1995-96 Budget price level). This includes both undergraduate and postgraduate students but excludes funding for capital projects. The rate will increase in 1996 and 1997, with the average funding per EFfSU in 1997 reaching $10,070 (at 1995-96 Budget prices). In the 1995-96 Budget, Western Australia was allocated 400 growth places in 1997 and 350 growth places in 1998. These places are all for undergraduates and have been funded at a rate of $9,300 (at the 1995-96 Budget price level). (2) The Government already provides financial assistance for disadvantaged students through the AUSTUDY scheme to assist them with the costs of their education. In addition, AUSTUDY recipients may apply for the AUSTUDY Supplement, an optional loan scheme which offers tertiary students the opportunity to increase. th- amount of money they can get while studying. In 1995, AUSTUDY will assist around half a million students at a cost of $1.5 billion. It is a matter for students how they spend their AUSTUDY allowance. The Government will not be introducing a separate rebate for the purchase of textbooks. In addition, students have access to university libraries, which are funded by the Commonwealth Government, and may make use of these facilities rather than buy textbooks. (3) In late April 1995, the Prices Surveillance Authority submitted its report to the Government on· its Inquiry into Book Prices and Parallel Imports. I understand the report included a limited study of text book prices. The Government will be considering the PSA's report. Medicare: Client Access (Question No. 2317) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Human SurveilServices and Health, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: . , Do Medicare offices provide a facility for clients to access a copy of a list of bulk-billed medieal visits charged to their own account numbers; if not, will the facility be implemented at the earliest opportunity.",214
363,Dr LAWRENCE,SELECTION CRITERIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Medicare offices do not have a facility to produce a list of direct billed services for a person. The cost of placing printers in offices, to enable such a facility, would be prohibitive. A, person may, however, obtain a list of services upon written application to one of Medicare's State offices. Australian Flag (Question No. 2336) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 10 May 1995: (1) Will the Government change the national flag. (2) Is the Government issuing a publication on Australian flags which states that persistent debate has not shaken Australians' commitment to the flag and that the Government has no plans to change it.",214
364,Mr WALKER,SELECTION CRITERIA,"The answer to the honourable Member's question is as follows: (1) On 4 November 1992 the Prime Minister advised the Parliament that no scheme for choosing a new flag would be contemplated which did not involve an act of choice by the Australian electorate between the current design and any proposed new design or designs. (2) No. My department is arranging for a new publication, Australian flags, to replace the booklet The Australian National Flag. The new booklet offers well researched advice and information on the history of Australian flags, including the Australian national flag; technical information on flags; and advice on flag protocols and flag etiquette. The new booklet will be available to Year Victoria 1992-93 $717,099 1993-94 $800,552 1994-95 $1,848,370* * 1994/95 allocation only. ** 1994/95 expenditure to 13 May 1995.

Mr W a1ker-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Yes. (b) In December 1992 Dasfleet entered into a leasing agreement with the Transport Workers Union in respect of 62 vehicles. There was no fixed term for the agreement, however the vehicles are leased on a one year/40,000km basis. The aspect of this agreement that rightly created public controversy was the fixing of a rent based on the assumption that the TWU held sales and fuel excise tax exempt status. In December of 1993 following a Dasfleet review of its contracts the Australian Tax Office confirmed that with the possible exception of a small number of vehicles used pursuant to tax exempt community service schemes, unions were not exempt from sales or fuel tax. Certainly none of the 62 vehicles had such exemption. From January 1994 Dasfleet insisted that rentals be increased to a full tax inclusive rate. The monthly increase varied from $200 for a Magna to $260 for a Ford Fairmont - Thirdly, It needs to be understood that Dasfleet as part of the Crown is not liable to pay sales tax or excise duty. It pays notional duty only to honour its commitment to maintain a level playing field with 1994-95 Organisation 1992-93 1993-94 (Allocation) $ $ $ NSW Fisheries 160,638 farming of scallops in NSW using hatchery produced seedstock 39,690 mental instruments and gong actions-Their effects on the fishing industry TOTALNSW 1,219,376 1,312,633 2,159,368 private sector competitors. In this context Dasfleet paid $234,683 into consolidated revenue. The Attorney General's Department advised Dasfleet th-t it could not maintain an action in debt against the TWU in respect of lost notional sales tax or excise duty The legal principle here, simply put, is that it is not possible to sue for debts paid on somebody else's behalf if there is no legal obligation to make such a payment in the first place. It has been suggested in some quarters that the TWU should be paying penalty tax or interest. Those suggestions misunderstand the legal position. The TWU was never liable to pay the tax and penalties do not enter the picture. There being no debt, interest could not possibly accrue. All we have is a situation where the rent fixed under agreement was insufficient because acting on the Union's representations Dasfleet failed to take tax into consideration. It was for these reasons that I asked Dasfleet to seek Senior Counsel's advice as to whether it might be possible to maintain an action against the TWU for damages for misleading or deceptive conduct under Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974.  Firstly, if such an action was successful the damages would be limited to the value of the lost opportunity to enter into a contract incorporating higher tax rates. Secondly, because the TWU had been paying the higher sales tax inclusive rates since January 1994 the amount of those damages would only relate to the lost opportunity in the year to December 1993 and would be less than the notional tax paid. there were a number of complex legal reasons in respect of which Dasfleet's suit might fail. (The union's defence was that it had made an innocent mistake about its liability for sales and fuel tax and that Section 52 did not apply) and Fourthly, litigation was not the appropriate course and the issue should be resolved under the dispute resolution clause in the lease agreement. I accepted Senior Counsel's advice and agreed to Dasfleet proceeding accordingly. The outcome of the dispute resolution process was an agreement by the TWU to pay to Dasfleet $144,263.38 which represents full repayment of outstanding fuel excise and a proportion of the sales tax liability that in the opinion of Dasfleet's legal advisers could reasonably have been expected by way of damages for the year when no tax was included in the rent. My advice is that following the sale of the vehicles Dasfleet has now made a modest profit on this transaction and in the circumstances the settlement represents a satisfactory resolution of the matter. I take the view that the Commonwealth as the administrator of sales tax law was in the best position to know and verify questions of tax exempt status and should not have relied on the advice of its clients in such matters. I also take the view that Dasfleet contracts should be for fixed terms. Dasfleet instituted procedures late in 1993 to prevent a repetition of their mistake in 1992.",215
