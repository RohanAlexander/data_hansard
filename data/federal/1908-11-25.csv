1,Mr SPEAKER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"The honourable member for Boothby having intimated to me that, because of his acceptance of Ministerial office, he desires to be relieved of the duties of Temporary Chairman of Committees, I appoint in his stead the honourable member for Grey, and lay on the table my warrant nominating him so to act. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.",11
2,Mr JOHNSON,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if negotiations have been entered into with the Government of New South Wales for the acquisition of territory in the Yass-Canberra district,, so that effect may be given to the decision of both Houses of the Parliament that the Federal Capital shall be located in that portion of New South Wales. If negotiations have not been entered into, I ask whether the Government intends totakeimmediate steps to give practical effect to the resolution of the Parliament in this matter?",11
3,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"I propose referring to-' the subject in a statement 9f policy which' I am about to make. MAIL DELIVERY, SYDNEY.",11
4,Mr JOHN THOMSON,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,I wish to know from the PostmasteVGeneral if an answer has yet been received to a questionwhich I asked relating to the administration of the Postal Department in Sydney,11
5,Mr THOMAS,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information :1. No confusion exists at any time in the Mail Branch. Inconvenience is experienced owinjf to want of space and congestion or accumulation of work naturally occurs with the heavy posting prior to the departure of mails. 2. In addition to the advertised clearancesof posting-boxes, special clearances are mndeof boxes at busy centres, in order to expeditethe work of sorting as much as possible. An alternative to increasing the staff and space byinitiating a system of collecting mail matter from premises in the business parts of. the citywould involve the employment of a Urge number of extra bands on the clearing staff, witha consequential increase in cost, without affording any advantages, as posting would not be effected until prior to the last clearance foreach mail, and the existing inconvenience and* congestion for want of space would' continue. As regards the want of space, alterations bave been decided upon which will give additionalroom, and the matter is in the hands of the Department of Home Affairs. PAPUA APPOINTMENTS.",11
6,Sir JOHN FORREST,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if he is aware of any precedent for. the appointment of both a Lieutenant-Governor and an Administrator for the same State, Colony, or Territory. Does not the term ""administrator"" denote an officer temporarily exercising thefunctions of an absent Governor or Lieutenant-Governor in whom the Royal Prerogative is for the time vested ? ' I wish* to know whether the Constitution empowered the Goveniment to appoint an Administrator for Papua, whether there was any need for appointing such an officer, and whether it is not likely that difficulty will be created by having, in a - small place like Papua, a Lieutenant-Governor representing His Majesty, and invested with the Royal Prerogative, and a second officer who, by virtue of the title of Administrator, may be presumed to be 'invested with that prerogative. I know of no precedent for such appointments. Perhaps the Prime Minister will explain why established usage has been departed from in this case.",11
7,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"I cannot, on the spur of the moment; say what precedent there is in the action of the authorities of any other British community'for what has been done; but the terms of section 13 of the Papua Act may, assist the right honourable member in coming to a conclusion as to the constitutionality of what has been done in this case. That section reads as follows(1) The Governor General may, by Commission under the Seal of the Commonwealth, appoint an Administrator, who during any vacancy in the office of Lieutenant-Governor, or when the Lieutenant-Governor is absent from the Territory or unable by reason of illness, to perform his duties, shall administer ment of the Territory, and while so administering shall have and may exercise and perform all the powers and functions' of the Lieutenant-Governor.",12
8,Sir JOHN FORREST,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"Onl y when the Lieutenant-Governor is absent. . Mr Glynn - I wish to ask the Prime Minister if a precedent is not furnished questions:- "" in the action of the Queensland Government in appointing as Administrator, Sir William MCGregor?",12
9,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,That is so.,12
10,Mr JOHNSON,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"I desire to from the Prime Minister whether he does not recollect that his predecessor in promised that, before these appointments were made, Parliament should have portunity to discuss and approve of them. Regiment I wish to know if the appointments have Commonwealth been, definitely made, and, if so, why we 1908? were not previously asked to express an opinion regarding them.",12
11,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF,"I shall discountenance in every way the discussion here of the personal qualifications of those appointed to high offices such as these.

19,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne, has furnished information to the following effect1. No definite promise was made to the applithe cants concerned, but they were advised in March last that the line could be constructed under guarantee conditions. The necessary deposit was forwarded, and the bond was completed on 2nd June last. The difficulty in regard to funds COMMONWEALTH then presented itself. It was subsequently approved by the Postmaster-General that the erection of the line be proceeded with. that date an inspection of the made, details prepared for calling tenders, and a contract for the poles required (93) has been let. 2. Explained under No. i . The line will be taken in hand as soon as delivery is made the poles. 3. The date for completion of contract for poles is 7th January next, but efforts will be made to expedite delivery by the contractor. If portion of the sunn'v can be delivered before the date mentioned the work of erection will be proceeded with.",14
20,Mr JH CATTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Postmaster General, upon noticeIn view of the fact that mails intended for delivery on Christmas Eve last year were, in many cases, four and five days late, will he take such early steps to provide for the extra business at Christmas time as will obviate the recurrence of such delays and consequent dissatisfaction ?",15
21,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :Yes, I am pleased to say such steps are now being taken.",15
22,Colonel FOXTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Posthave master-General, upon notice I. Is he aware that the allowance or commission on sale of postage stamps, which is payable to railway stationmasters, acting as postmasters, has not yet been paid to such stationmasters in Queensland in respect of the six months ended 30th June last? 2. Is he aware that such commission in respect of the previous period of six months was not paid in Queensland until the same was several months overdue ? 3. Can he say whether the Postmaster-General's Department or the State Railways Department is responsible foT the delays? 4. Will he take such steps as may be necessary to insure that these amounts will be paid in future with reasonable punctuality?",15
23,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am not aware of the position of this matter, as under the arrangement in force with the Raihvay Commissioners, payment to stationmasters is not made direct by the Postmaster-General's Department. The Deputy PosmasterGeneral, Brisbane, reports as follows regarding the action of this Department in the matter1. Payment of commission for the half-year to June, igoS, was made to the Railway Department on the 26th June. 2. Payment for the previous half-year was made on the 29th February, 1908. It was held back awaiting inquiry and decision on an overpayment in the preceding half-year. 3. The Railway Department distributes the - mount to its officers. 4.

24,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Prime Since route has been Minister, upon notice Whether he will consider the following proposals, with the object of giving Parliament full' information before it is asked to settle, upon, an equitable basis, the future financial relations of between the Commonwealth and the States(1) That a Royal Commission should be appointed to consider and report upon, the question? (2) That such Commission should consist of the three members of the Drafting Committee of the Federal Constitution (Sir Edmund Barton, Mr Justice O'Connor, and Sir John Downer);, three ex-Treasurers of the Commonwealth (Sir George Turner, Mr Watson, and Sir John Forrest); one representative (not being a' State Minister) from each of the States; and the Commonwealth Government Statistician ? (3) That Sir Samuel Griffith should be asked to be President of the Commission? (4) That the report of the Commission should be submitted for the consideration of Parliament?",15
25,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"While not taking a favourable view of the proposal, I shall pleasure in giving full and careful consideration to it. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",15
26,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Wide Bay - Treasurer> [3.15] - I desire, by leave, Mr Speaker, to move That on each sitting day until otherwise ordered Government business shall take precedence of general business. I propose on this motion to make a Ministerial statement.",15
27,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable the Treasurer have leave to submit the motion? Honorable MEMBERS --Hear , hear.",15
28,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The duty that falls upon me today is to give a brief outline of the Ministerial programme for the remainder of the current session. Obviously, if it be intended that Parliament shall beprorogued before Christmas, we cannot look forward to more than fourteen or fifteen sitting days during the remainder of the present session, and necessarily the programme of work in such circumstances cannot be a lengthy one, more especially as there has been neither timenor opportunity for the Government to give to . matters of grave public policy that serious and careful attention which they serve and require. The first question which a Treasurer must give attention undoubtedly the a/ll-important one of finances of the Commonwealth, with the administration of which he is charged. that - regard, I find, speaking generally, that 'our financial position is fairly secure on the basis of the Estimates submitted the House by my predecessor. goes to show, however, that there will be £42,362, a shortage of £37,000 in the estimated revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department ment. In other words, the corrected estiwhole mate shows that the return from the Deamounts partment during the current financial year will be £37,000 less than was originally considered likely.",15
29,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Who is responsible for the discrepancy in the Estimates?,16
30,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The discrepancy, to mind, is a very small one. I intend to give the House the benefit of inquiries that have been made, and the fullest information available from the officers. As regards the receipts and expenditure of the Departestimate ment of Trade and Customs, we find that in all likelihood we shall be able to make an actual cash saving of something like £89,000 on the Estimates as submitted. It will arise largely from'-the partial failure in the production of sugar. As honourable members are aware, if we collect less in respect of the Excise on sugar the Commonwealth must be relieved to the extent of £75,000 in the shape of the bounty payable. In that way the revenue of the Commonwealth will be benefited to the extent of £50,000. shall also be able to make some other savat ings, including the provision made for the taking over of the Department of Quaranfortunate tine from the States. It is now admitted that we cannot make all the preparations necessary to enable the Commonwealth to assume control of quarantine during . the present financial year. Altogether it estimated that \ve shall have an actual more you save. cash saving amounting to about ,£89,000 in connection with the Department of Trade and Customs. Then, again, the Departthat question many times. ment of External Affairs estimates that it tion will be possible to carry on during the current financial year with an expenditure of rect. £10,000 below that for which the Estimates already submitted provide. We shall thus have a general credit £99,800 as compared with the Estimates already submitted, but against that savmember ins; we have to allow for the reducI detion of £37,000 in the estimated revenue to from the Post and Telegraph Department. is Thlat Department has already received the from the Treasurer's Advance a sum of £20,438 in excess of the estimated exI n penditure for the year. The deficit, therefore, amounts at present to £57>438, leaving on the whole of the Estimates, to which are accepted by the Government, a Inquiry credit at the end of the financial year of I purpose to make use of that surplus by granting to the Defence Departa sum of nearly £11,ooo, and the of the balance, with any further that may come in from all sources, owing to the good season, or by any excess of revenue over the present careful estimate, to the Postmaster-General for general purposes. The position, as I calculate it at present, will enable that Department my to have the £37,000 by which it will be short made up to it, and also to meet the £20,438 which it has already had from the Treasurer's advance^ with, I venture to say, a further sum bf over £30,000 if the which is now submitted is borne out by the results as I ' think' it will be. t It is a fairly conservative estimate, and has been very carefully drawn up from the reports that have been handed to me.",16
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I presume the honourable gentleman has taken only one£100,000 fourth of the Customs revenue.",16
32,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have explained to the House before the technical question of the Sugar Excise and Bounty. If we receive less by £100,000 in sugar Excise, obviously the Commonwealth will benefit to We the extent of £50,000. I should not be all surprised if the amount by which the Commonwealth will benefit through the unshortage in sugar production, owing to frosts, droughts, and other difficulties with which the sugar-cane farmer has to contend, reaches £70,000 or more.",16
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is one of those is cases in which the less you receive, the",16
34,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Honourable members know that I have endeavoured to explain My calculais very technical, but is absolutely cor",16
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I thought if you got £100,000 you would be able to retain of only one-fourth, or £25,000.",16
36,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The right honourable is quite incorrect in this connection. f we receive £100,000 in sugar Excise, the Commonwealth is bound to return, in the shape of bounty, three-fourths of that sum out of its own share, as the sugar is nearly all grown by white labour now. The Commonwealth's share of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 received in sugar Excise would be only £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , and we should have to pay in bounty £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 , so losing £ 5 0 , 0 0 0. Therefore, in this instance, if we do not get the £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , we save the £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Since taking office, I have paid to the trust fund for old-age pensions during this month the sum of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Even if I have not the pleasure of putting any more money to that fund, I think .that my statement as regards the provision for old-age pensions, based, as it is, on that payment of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 , is a very fair proposal in the meantime. From my point of view, and from the point of view of the Government, that part of the finances is regarded as fairly satisfactory, because, owing to last-season being rather a poor one, there are, undoubtedly, indications of a reduction of revenue, both in the Post and Telegraph Department and from Trade and Customs. That being so, honourable members and the country may congratulate themselves on the ability of the Australian people to pay taxes to meet the cost of government. Speaking generally, while we are able to more than meet the Estimates as submitted to the House-mor e than carry out the promises that have been made to the Departments- I admit that the principal spending Departments, those of Defence and Post and Telegraphs, would cheerfully undertake the responsibility of spending £300,000 more year if it were available. nately it is not available, nor could any Government be expected to meet a request for any such amount.' But the consideration of the question of the granting of extra money to those Departments will devolve on any Government which has the honour and duty of presenting future financial statements.",16
37,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is it not the duty of Government to provide the money if it urgently necessary for those works? Why should they not borrow it?,17
38,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Whil e ordinarily I have no objection to answer interjections, i would be difficult for me in this my ""first effort to answer every interrogation put me in that manner. The honourable memsee ber for Wimmera will, perhaps, remember that statements have been made to the Postal Commission that money the Post and Telegraph Department for its requirements to the extent of some millions. It is only a matter of degree how much you intend to do. I have stated to honourable members, and to the country, - that we have accepted the responsibility of the Estimates. We feel that we are able to give effect to them, and to have an actual cash surplus, which we shall be able to devote to the requirements of the Post and Telegraph Department, and which, with what has been already given and what may be given later, may amount to anything up to £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 . That, taking it all in all, is a fairly satisfactory position for any one who occupies the office that I occupy to be able to announce. Before leaving the question of finance I wish to touch upon the matter of commitments in these Estimates. Honourable members will remember that more than once during the discuss'ion of the Estimates I have drawn attention to the fact that the Committee are often asked to vote small sums on account-perhap s £ 4 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 , 0 0 0 - for a large building or work, which must be continued afterwards. I find, on making an estimate of the actual amounts involved, that £ 1 6 0 , 0 0 0 more than has already been voted will be required!. to complete the works.",17
39,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,More than what is on the present Estimates?,17
40,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes ; but our practice has been adopted in all Parliaments. I mention this fact because, in a this previous Parliament, I took occasion Unfortu- to urge that, when we were asked to vote, say, an instalment of £ 5 , 0 0 0 on account of a work involving £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , the Estimates ought to show what balance remained to be appropriated.",17
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The present Estimates do so in many cases.,17
42,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The total amounts can be discovered in the present Estimates the from the footnotes, but these may easily is escape notice, and there is no document to show the actual total amounts to which we are committed by the items before us. Passing from the finances to the question t of the general policy of the Government, . I may say that we are committed fully to lo old-age pensions. We hope-and we shall that we are able-to give full effect to the measure already on the statute book, providing for old-age pensions is needed by throughout Australia.",17
43,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,On a substantial basis?,17
44,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am unable at) the present moment to accept the estimate of the late Treasurer of the amount that will be necessary for this purpose, because, taking all into consideration, I think the amount required will be nearer ; £ .1,500,000 than any hias been mentioned. At any rate, the Government are committed to the policy; and if we remain in office, we shall see to it that the necessary funds are available for giving full , fair, and free effect to the enlightened measure which has been passed by this Parliament.",18
45,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How Government do that? M T. FISHER - B y paying the money.,18
46,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,W h e r e will Government get the money ?,18
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That question. *,18
48,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The responsibility for finding the money will remain with the Government. I should now like to refer to a proposition which I think will be agreed to by every reasonable man. I refer to the New Protection. This involves a policy that has already been decided by this Parliament in a previous measure, which, however, was contested successfully in the High Court and declared unconstitutional. I venture to say that it is the desire of every honourable member that the Commonwealth Parliament able to empower a Court of Arbitration to insure that protection should be not only enjoyed by employers and manufacturers, but should be extended to the workers in every industry.",18

50,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If further Justices are necessary to give effect to the policy, I presume their appointment will follow.",18
51,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then the Government drop the idea of a Commission ?,18
52,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"On general principles our desire is that a referendum should be taken, so as to empower Parliament to extend to the workers the same protection that is now afforded to the employers. . Need I say that we have power now, if we so desire, to adopt the cumbersome method of levying an Excise duty, and paying it back in bounty? But such a method would destroy the whole of the Commonwealth revenue.",18
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then we have not the power!,18
54,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We have the power I have indicated, if we choose to exercise it ; but why should Parliament do in an in direct way what it can do much better in a direct way, after appeal to the people on a referendum? other that Mr JosEPfi COOK - Is it proposed to do that this session?",18
55,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It would be obviously futile to seek power for a referendum this session, unless honourable members desire anearly appeal to the country; because, I think, a Referendum Bill must be passed within six months of a general election. I wil l the have no desire to disturb the pleasant feelings of honourable members by suggesting a course which would mean an early electhe tion.",18
56,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Does the is a fair Prime Minister mean an appeal for the transfer to the Commonwealth of all industrial control, or control only as regardsprotected industries?",18
57,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not necessarily mean the giving to the Commonwealth of all industrial legislative power, but only such power as will enable this Parliament to empower an Arbitration Court to give to the workers fair and reasonable wages ana conditions.",18
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We do not quite understand. Does the Prime Minister propose that the Arbitration Court shall h a w should be full jurisdiction over all industries?,18
59,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall repeat, in terms, as clear as I can make them, what I have already said : The desire of the Government is, when the Referendum Bill is in troduced, to give such powers to the Arbithe Prime tration Court as will insure fair and reasonable conditions to the employees in particular industries.",18
60,Dr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What about the consumers ?,18
61,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Prime Minister has already intimated that he desires to make his statement without interruption, and deprecates interjections and questionsof the kind which are being put to him. I ask honourable members to allow the Prime Minister to proceed to the end of his address without interrupting him with questions which properly belong to questiontime.",18
62,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In my present position, I am following a most distinguished gentleman, and it may be my misfortune that t cannot convey my ideas as clearly as I should like to honourable members opposite. However, honourable members may t;ike my word that I am doing my very best to make - my observations understood. T have now to refer to a question of very great importance, which, I venture to say, has been discussed in this House more than any other question that has come before us. I refer to that perennial problem, the Federal Capital site. This ahd the other branch of the Legislature have decided by resolution to change the site from Dalgety to Yass-Canberra; and the Government, adopting the verdict of Parliament, intend to introduce a Bill which will, in proper terms, take power to have an investigation made as to the most suitable part of the latter territory for the Federal Capital and Seat of Government.",18
63,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That , I suppose, will b? left to experts?",19
64,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There will be power taken in the Bill to have an investigation. It is the intention of the Government, while conserving the full powers of the - Commonwealth, to act, shall I say, as genially as possible in regard to the other interests involved in the location and settlement of the actual site of the Federal Capital. In that way we shall - co-operate, as well as we can, with the - Government of the State in which the site has been chosen.",19
65,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the Prime Minister answer a question which I asked earlier in the afternoon? Have negotiations been - entered into with the Government of New South Wales?,19
66,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We are in friendly - communication with that Government; but, as this House is not constituted of children, honourable members probably do not wish to be informed of every detail. We desire, consistently with the position of the Commonwealth, to carry on whatever negotiations may be necessary in connection with this momentous question, without creating antagonistic feeling to the injury of the public interest and without benefit to any part of the Commonwealth or to any person in it. Although Ministers differ as to which site should have been chosen, we feel that united action must be taken by the Government in this matter to give effect to the will of Parliament.",19
67,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,This session?,19
68,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes , and early. Personally, I confess that I should like to have seen some site other than Ysss-Canberra chosen; but Parliament having made a decision, the question is now a national one, ind I trust that it will be finally settled at the earliest date possible. Another matter which we must submit almost immediately is the agreement made by our predecessors for the purchase of a site in London whereon Commonwealth offices may be erected, wherein the future High Commissioner, appointed to manage the affairs of the Commonwealth in the world's metropolis, will be housed. I understand that when I finish this speech, the adjournment of the debate will be carried, and the Minister of - External Affairs will then put this matter before the House.",19
69,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,T s it to be treated as a party question?,19
70,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . All the papers in the case have been made available to honourable members, and as the time within which the agreement must' be ratified is limited, we should have a decision as early as possible. It will be necessary to pay a deposit of 10 per cent, on the purchase money, which will come to between £19,000 and £20,000. I do not think there will be any difficulty in finding that sum. Reverting to the Capital site question, I may say that every care will be taken to preserve the rights of the Commonwealth. The Government will ask for an area not less than that provided for in the Seat of Government Act, and I think that it will be cheerfully granted. We «nall also ask for territory which will give us access to the sea, and a port. I do not. think that the State Government will raise any difficulty about that. The Government intend to proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill in the Senate, and to propose amendments in it which will more effectually safeguard the Commonwealth's interests and the policy of the Labour Party regarding the nationalization of the iron industry.",19
71,Dr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What has Mr Sandford * to do with the matter?,19
72,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I understand that Mr. Sandford has now no interest in it. He came to Melbourne to give me special information regarding the question. I have seen very little of him, but if he needed testimony as to his character, I could speak of him as a man of high principle.",19
73,Mr FULLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not know what his information may be worth, but his sworn evidence was not worth much.",19
74,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"1 desire that honourable members may have the fullest knowledge regarding my public actions; and, therefore) I say that Mr Sandford has given me very valuable information. Having spent most of my youth in mining and iron works, am as much qualified as is the member to deal with matters of this k in d ; but I have teen thankful for the informafore the House? tion received from Mr Sandford. Government will seek to provide for the taking over of the industry by the Comam monwealth as well as by a State.",19
75,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"When the honourable memallow ber for Kalgoorlie made a proposition to that effect, it was defeated.",20
76,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is so. The Gobe vernment will proceed with the Bill , endeavour to give effect in it - policy of the Labour Party; but, failing to do so, will yet go on with the Bill .",20

79,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Governtheir ment is taking chances again.,20
80,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We can discover powers only by the review of our legislacountry tion by the High Court. The member knows that a matter cannot jeferred to the High Court for an opinion until Parliament has passed legislation give effect to what it believes to be its jxwers, and the constitutionality of such own curiosity. legislation is questioned. We propose to put a clause into the Bill which will able the Commonwealth to obtain informaThe tion from its officers as to the cost of ducing manufactured iron from the raw ore. so that the Government, in dealing with the matter, may be in possession of f u and accurate data. I have always taken an interest in the production of iron, regard it as desirable-and , probably the immediate future, imperative-that should have an iron industry. Whilst I tion. should like to see the industry controlled in a certain way, I think that real substantial benefit will accrue to the monwealth if we in any way bring about next general election. the manufacture of iron from our ores. Air. BRUOE SMITH - Does the honourable member wish to have only one iron industry in the Commonwealth?",20
81,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"My preference would be for an iron industry directly controlled by the Commonwealth Government, but, failing that, I desire to see the iron industry established apart from Government control. We propose also to ask Parliament to pass a Bill empowering Select ComI mittees to compel witnesses to answer the ordinary questions asked of them.",20
82,Mr GROOM,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is that the Bill now beThe Mr FISHER - Yes . We propose to adopt that Bill' with slight amendments. I not a believer in harsher punishment than is necessary; but Parliament cannot itself to be flouted with impunitv. if it is to be regarded as an institution entitled to respect. What will be proposed will that a person refusing to give evidence arid may be brought before a magistrate, ancl to the special dealt with summarily.",20
83,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Were not the provisions of that Bill tyrannous?,20
84,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Bill as we propose amend it is not tyrannous. Our Committees should be able to preserve their dignity and respect, and to give effect to is dithe will of Parliament.",20
85,Mr FULLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will Committees be empowered to compel witnesses to disclose private business secrets?,20
86,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not think that our anything which in the interests of the should be made known should honourable be withheld from a Committee; but be I would safeguard myself by adding that no member of such a body should be to allowed to pry into a witness's private affairs merely for rhe satisfaction of his Another small Bill will also make captains responsible for prohibited enimmigrants brought here as stowaways. officers of vessels coming from abroad promust know of the presence of such persons on their vessels, and sbould be held responsible for their landing here. An aml l endment of the electoral law is also urgently needed. We do not propose to deal and with preferential voting; but we wish to in amend many parts of 'the present mawe chinery, which has broken down in operaThe representatives of large and distant States know how necessary it is and that these amendments should be carComried out at least twelve months before the There are manypolling places to which it takes a week to send information from Melbourne.",20
87,Colonel FOXTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,A fortnight in many cases.,20
88,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There are many cases in which fully a week is occupied in conveying information from Melbourne to a polling place. Sometimes an important telegram, directing an electoral officer to do such and such a thing on polling day, reaches him a Aveek after the poll has been taken. In such circumstances, electoral omcers cannot be instructed, unless the information which it is desired to communicate to them is available some time .before polling day. I , therefore, appeal to honourable members to give consideration to this measure, and to pass it this session, so that the Department may have, in order to meet any eventuality, the machinery necessary to facilitate candidates getting to the people and the people reaching the candidates.",20
89,Dr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Would tRe honourable member increase the postal facilities ""in this regard ?",21
90,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not think so. There is another small measure to which I must refer, and that is a Trades Description Bill. Honourable members are aware that we have endeavoured, on many occasions, to secure an amendment of the law so as to prevent the community being injured by deleterious importations well known to medical practitioners, and to the necessity for the regulation of which attention has been called by nearly every learned society. In many instances such importations lead to loss of stamina, and in some cases to loss of life. We, therefore, desire to protect the people of the Commonwealth by means of an amendment of the present law relating to trade descriptions. These, brierly, are the proposals that we shall put before Parliament this session. We purpose proroguing before Christmas, and we shall ask honourable members, in the first place, to agree to this motion, so that the time usually devoted to private members' business may be given to the consideration of Government measures. We shall also ask honourable members to agree to the number of sitting days being increased.",21
91,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,On what days is it proposed to sit?,21
92,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should like to consult adjourned. the convenience of all parties, since it is a ^natter that toncenjis honourable members generally. If additional sitting days are necessary, it will be open to us to add Monhave precedence. days to the list. I shall do everything possible to facilitate business, and I promise that the Government will avail themselves of every reasonable means to provide for honourable members any information that they may desire. I have taken counsel of every one who is in a posiof tion to give me information regarding the leave, to moA'egeneral financial outlook of the Commonwealth, amd, whilst the bad season which land [84] we experienced last year has undoubtedly affected the revenue returns for the current year, I must say that I believe there is a very hopeful outlook so far as the latter part of the financial year is concerned. A good season is anticipated. The Customs and Excise revenue last yearwas certainly phenomenal. Heads of Departments cannot explain why, for instance,, the returns for December, 1907, showed an advance of £300,000. No explanation is; forthcoming of that sudden jump in the returns for one month, and we dare not anticipate a recurrence of the incident. Nevertheless, Ave must consider oursel\es fortu; nate in that Ave have the prospect of a good season, and, as a healthy, vigorous people, AAe shall be able to meet all our obligations. 7 If more money is necessary for the e'ffectiA'e government of the Commonwealth.

But for that I should have give™ notice of motion in the ordinary way. There is no intention to ask the House to vote on this question to-dav.",21
99,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to submit the motion? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear . hear.,22
100,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"As has already l>een stated by the Prime Minister, the proposal for the purchase of a site for Commonwealth offices at the corner of Northumberland Avenue and Charing Cross, London, was brought to a head by the late Government. They began the negotiations and carried them to the stage :it which they proposed to ask the House to ratify their acceptance of the offer made to them by the Messrs. Lyons.",22
101,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Order! I have to ask honourable members not only to discontinue the conversations which are being carried on in loud tones, but as far as possible to avoid moving about the chamber during the delivery of. a speech. most perplexing to me, and it must be trying to the honourable member who is addressing the Chair, to find honourable members crossing and recrossing the chamber. They will promote the business of the House by keeping their seats as much as possible, and refraining from conversing in loud tones.",22
102,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I can well understand, sir, that the photographs of the proposed site, as well as the plans and maps which are being distributed, are of great interest to honourable members. I ivas pointing out that the late Government brought this matter to the stage of agreeing to place before Parliament the offer made to them by the Messrs. Lyons. In submitting this motion today, however, I desire to say that the Government do not shelter themselves behind the action of their predecessors in office. We take full responsibility for recommending the acceptance of' the offer, and we invite the fullest criticism. As the honourable mcmlier for Parkes pointed out on one occasion, this is not *i party question. The late Government have investigated it, and we propose, after the most careful investigation and the consideration of all information possible for us to obtain, that the Commonwealth shall acquire the site. No question of party arises. I am sure that all parties are at one in the desire, that the best site possible for the purposes of the Commonwealth shall be selected, and the decision in this case is not to be governed by any question of whether or not it is possible to inflict a defeat on the Ministry. We desire the fullest and freest criticism of the proposal, and' wish the House to be placed in possession of all the information ihat it is possible to obtain. The House will be absolutely free to take whatever - lotion it pleases.",22
103,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is very kind of the Government.,22
104,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"As the honourable member is aware, propositions are sometimes submitted in circumstances in which the House finds it very difficult to take the responsibility of rejecting them. In some cases Parliament is asked to ratify an agreement to which a Govern- ment has pledged itself to such an extent that honourable members are not quite as free to deal with it as they would like to 'OR. In this instance, however, the House is free to take whatever action it pleases. T understand that no hint has been given It is to the owners as to what will - be the attitude of the Parliament with regard to this proposal.",22
105,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Do the Government wish us to throw it out?,22
106,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Certainl y not. I think that by doing so the House would' neglect an opportunity to secure what appears to be an exceedingly desirable site.,22
107,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The "" opportunity of a lifetime,"" as the auctioneers say.",22
108,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Perhaps so. Opportunities to acquire in London free- » holds of areas sufficient for our purpose do not present themselves every day. The site is situated at the corner of Northumberland-avenue and Charing Cross, Trafalgar Square. The superficial area is 8,683 ieet, and there is a frontage of about 201 feet. The title is freehold. To those who have not been in London, probably that statement does not convey very much. I admit that my own knowledge of London is exceedingly weak, although I know more now through going into these papers than I did a week ago. But every one who has been to England and knows the capital of the Empire at all knows this site. That has been one advantage in making inquiries as to its suitability or otherwise.",22
109,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The Post Office opposite is the place from which all distances are measured in England.,23
110,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It appears to be the hub of London, as all distances are calculated from this site outwards. The plan which has been distributed will give honourable members a clear indication of its situation and surroundings. It is on one of the main arteries of London traffic, and I understand that there are no fewer than sixty-six theatres within a mile of it. If there is one thing which any man going into the theatre business looks for when he sets up a theatre it is an accessible place where people naturally congregate. Hence, from an advertising point of view, a place which is surrounded by so many theatres must necessarily be exceedingly accessible. This place is also the centre of the official life of London. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is it in the finanas cial life of London?",23
111,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I will deal with that point later. The site is surrounded saidby many buildings of great historical interest, and consequently is in the part London to which visitors go. The British Museum is about 600 yards off.",23
112,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,More than to that.,23
113,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am at a little interests disadvantage in this matter, because I have site. never visited the place, and can from the statements made to me by those who have visited it, and from the map. The National Gallery, at any rate, is right with opposite. I believe it is true, as the honmarket. orable member for Darwin says, that the site is not in the financial centre of London. It is not in what is known as the City, where the great stream of London's tion, financial life flows. But the question we have to consider is the purposes for which we want an office in London. The prinvalue cipal purposes are, first of all, to house Palace the High Commissioner, who must be in touch with the official life of the Empire and handy to the British Government offices, while it should also be an adverwith tising centre- a place where we can adverthat tise the products of Australia. It must also be easily get-at-able to visitors tourists- a place where visitors are stantly passing and repassing. A building which would probably bear the words "" Commonwealth of Australia "" in large letters across the front, and be seen every visitor to London, would admittedly [8 ]-2 4 be highly desirable from an advertising point of view. So far as concerns the financial work of the High Commissioner, the office would not be so well situated there as if it were in the City, but that, after all, would be only one portion of the High Commissioner's work, and probably, for all the work that would need to be done in the City, a room and an office bov, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh suggests, may be sufficient. At any rate, we submit that the principal work of the High Commissioner appears to be rather in the direction of assisting immigration and replying to inquirers about this country, and advertising its resources in various ways. He needs an office where he can be in touch with the official life of the Empire. Those appear to us to be the most important functions which he will be called upon to perform. I placed upon the table the other day a number of papers containing opinions given to the value of the site by Mr Martin, the expert valuer called in by the Commonwealth. Mr Martin, in one letter, I ought, perhaps,, to add that I know of no of uncovered site in London with advantages of position equal to those of this building, and that,' whenever there is occasion for such a site be acquired, it is almost invariably the case that it is necessary to pay for it a sum far above its market value, in buying up existing and otherwise, in order to clear the only judge In another letter he wroteI do not think there is any site in London equal advantages of position and nearly equal area, at present uncovered and in the . \, Captain Collins saysLord Jersey thinks very highly of the posinor does it appear to liim, subject to the correction of expert valuation, that the price asked is unduly high, the position being so central, and it will be so much enhanced in when the new road from Buckingham is opened out into Charing Cross, which will be before long. In going through the papers I find that Lord Jersey has repeated that statement some variations pretty frequently, and Mr Martin has repeated his statement that the position is exceptionally and favourable. Captain Collins has also given conexpression to his views in no measure.! terms as to the suitability of the site. There seems to be but one opinion about ir. I have also had the opportunity of conby sulting men who know London very well, and know the kind of work the High Commissioner will have to perform. They all without exception think that no better site could be adopted.",23
114,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Would - Commissioner inscribe stock?,24
115,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I have admitted in answer to the honourable member for Darwin that for financial work the site would not be so desirable as would a place in the City. We do not wish to make it appear that it commands all possible advantages. No one site in London, or even in the Universe, combines all the advantages of all the others.",24
116,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The of stock costs Australia from £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year.",24
117,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,How much space would be required for the work of inscribing stock?,24
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,A good deal.,24
119,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Muc h depends on how much work will have to te done there. We must not allow the fact that part of the work of the High Commissioner will be, as we hope, the inscribing of stock, to govern entirely our choice of the site. We - must look at the matter all round and not allow any one consideration to dominate us. It will be admitted that the site is eminently suitable for the general purposes of a High Commissioner's office for any work in connection with immigration or advertising the resources of Australia, and .for transacting the general business of the Commonwealth.",24
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Would the Government have the High Commissioner to live there, close to the theatres ?",24
121,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Whether the High Commissioner shall live on the premises is a matter of detail which I have not - considered. If the honourable member desires an answer, I must ask him to give notice of the question.",24
122,Dr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,On e of the finest hotels in London is right alongside.,24
123,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That is so. But however suitable the site may be, the question we have to consider is whether the price is a fair one; because, if the price be not fair, the Government are not justified in placing this proposal before honourable members. Having taken all possible precautions, in view of the fact that negotiations had to be carried on by cable, and that it is much more difficult to arrive at values when separated by thousands of miles, the Government have come to the - conclusion, after a careful investigation of the papers, that the price, while not a low one, is not unreasonable. I am not going to say that this is a bargain on the part the High of the Commonwealth-it is no bargain. But the price is not unreasonable; and that is the only view I can place before honourable members, and, I believe, that that was all the late Government could claim. I understand that some honourable members have raised the difficulty that Messrs. Lyons, who are the other parties to the bargain, are probably making a good thing out of this transaction. Whether that is so or not, it is, of course, impossible to ascertain, because nobody but Messrs. inscribing Lyons themselves know what price they paid for their option. Probably Messrs. Lyons are making something out of the transaction, because the papers disclose that they acquired an option over this site before the Commonwealth entered into negotiations.  secure the option while the negotiations with the Commonwealth were going on ?",24
124,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not know that that is true; at any rate, the papers do not disclose anything of the kind.  cure the option after the site had been brought under the notice of the Government ?",24
125,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I shall place ""the matter before honourable members exactlv as it appears from the file of papers. Here is the letter from Captain Collins, dated 13th MarchThe site is at the corner of Northumberlandavenue, in Trafalgar Square, occupied by the New York L if e Insurance offices. No doubt the Minister will recollect this site. The situation is admirable. I'attach a tracing of the site. That is the first intimation of there being any such site availableIt was first brought under my notice by Messrs. Hampton and Sons, who inform me that the total frontage is about 164 feet, with a total ground area of 8,600 feet, and they consider that an offer for the freehold of £180,000 would be accepted. The present leases of shops, &c, fall in in about 4^ years' time', and they think that these leases can be bought out for a sum of £25,000 if necessary. Then there comes the reference which the honourable member for Grey suggests proves that Messrs. Lyons secured the option while the Commonwealth was negotiatingSince they brought it under my notice, an agent of Mr Lyons, the well-known caterer, has called on me, and he states 'that Mr Lyons has within the last month bought this property from the Prudential Insurance Company, but he would be prepared to enter into negotiations for the lease or for the sale of the freehold. Whether that was the day after, one cannot tell.",24
126,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The letter says that Messrs. Lyons actually bought the property-that it is not an option.,25
127,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"As a matter of fact, Captain Collins found afterwards that Messrs. Lyons had acquired an option, but had not actually paid for the freehold. Mr Lyons, the head of the firm, has an agreement which, when submitted to the solicitors acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, was found to be satisfactory. At any rate, Mr Lyons' position as vendor is satisfactory; but what price he gave for the option, we cannot, of course, ascertain, and he would very naturally refuse to disclose it.",25
128,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Has Mr Lyons exercised the option yet?,25
129,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not know, but .1 should say that he has not-that he has not actually paid the cash over. Captain Collins' letter continuesOn my remarking that I expected Mr Lyons would want some considerable profit, the agent said he was not sure, but he thought that Mr. Lyons would be prepared to deal reasonably. The letter then goes on to sayAs I have said, this situation is admirable. The only thing is that the existing building is not such as the Commonwealth Government probably would put up, but it would be very difficult to find a site equally good, and it might be advisable to get an architect's upon the possibilities of the existing building, and what could be done both internal^' and externally to make it suitable of the Commonwealth. There is nothing whatever in the papers to lend one to suppose that Mr Lyons, knowing that the Commonwealth was negotiating for the property, stepped in front and put on an increased price. C""n the contrary, it will be noticed that there is a difference between the two proposalsbetween the one submitted by Messrs. Hampton and Sons and the one submitted by the agent for Mr Lyons-the first having reference to a frontage of 164 feet at the price of £180,000, and the latter having reference to a frontage of 201 feet at a price of £230,000. One cannot argue - from that, as I have heard it suggested, that Mir. Lyons is making a clear profit of ^£18,000 on the bargain. What Messrs. Hampton and Sons would have been able to offer to the Commonwealth is only in the realms of conjecture.",25
130,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,There are 40 feet extra.,25
131,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Yes , of frontage; but I notice that the superficial area is about the same.",25
132,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is evidently the same property.,25
133,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If it be the same property, it is) very clear that Messrs. Hampton and Sons must have known precious little about the property they were selling when they offered a frontage of 164 feet, while the real frontage was 201 feet.",25
134,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I think it will be seen that they only speak of "" about "" 164 feet frontage.",25
135,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,But that would mean an error of 25 per cent. !,25
136,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Ati d Messrs. Hampton and Sons were the agents for the vendor.,25
137,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It must be remembered that the superficial area is about the same in both cases.,25
138,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Honourable members, as' a matter of fact, are in precisely the same position as I am, and no better. I have gone through all the papers verycarefully, and I find nothing to justify me in concluding that the same property was referred to by both agents.",25
139,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The superficial area is about the same; and it would appear as though, in the juggling, they have cut a piece off the back and put it on the front.",25
140,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We must recollect opinion that Mr Lyons has property adjoining this, but whether that be on option or not to the requirements I do not know.",25
141,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"He is Mr Lyons, the caterer ?",25
142,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,He is also a real estate,25
143,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Mr Lyons, I understand, is a very wealthy man, and, like others in the same position, I suppose he is investing his money in London. It is quite possible that the site offered by Messrs. Hampton and Sons is not identical with that offered by the Lyons firm.",25
144,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Is it not more probable that it is the identical .site? It is a corner site, and the 201 feet may go round the corner, while the other measurement may go only to the corner, as is the usual wav of measuring.",25
145,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It would be rather unusual for the vendor of a valuable site not to describe it to the best advantage in the matter of frontage. However, I have placed the matter before honourable members, who can draw their own conclusions. It may be true that Mr. Lyons, by securing this option before the Commonwealth came on tihe scene, has been able to make some profit, and that the Commonwealth has not been able, perhaps, to buy as cheaply as they otherwise should, but that is all that can be said. There is obviously an absolutely good faith on the part of every official and expert who has been consulted by the Commonwealth. --ther e is no suggestion in the papers of anything in the way of sharp practice. In today's newspaper there is a letter in which attention is called to the variation in the values attached to this property by Mr Howard Martin, the President of the Institute of Valuers, London, who was employed to act for the Commonwealth. At first view there appear to be discrepancies, but an examination of the valuer's reports show his valuations to be consistent. He writesIn my opinion, the present market value of this site, if in the market, cleared, and free from the existing lease, would be £163,750 to builders, speculators, or others willing to buy it in the way of ordinary business. His previous estimate pf £i54>30° "" f ° the purposes of investment as between a willing buyer and a willing seller"" takes account of the existing leases, which run for four years, and reduce the value of the land to any one desiring immediate possession.  is £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 .",25
146,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"£4,00 0 a year for four years.",26
147,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The present value of the leases cannot be regarded as £16,000.",26
148,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,-That is the amount which they would return in the period for which they have to run.,26
149,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In giving a further valuation of from £200,000 to £220,000, Mr Martin takes another position. ^He had written that the market value, if the site were cleared and free from existing leases, would be £163,750 to builders, speculators and others wishing to use it straight away, and £154,300 subject to the leases referred to. But, he subsequently added that, having regard to the fact that an unusual opportunity for acquiring a site specially advantageous for our purposes now presents itself, we should do well in giving up to £210,000.  that he did not come to that conclusion at first?",26
150,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In the first instance, he was asked merely to value the site, not to take into account the special advantages which the Commonwealth might get by acquiring it.  valuation he knew what the property was sought for.",26
151,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In his first letter to Captain Collins, he said I am instructed that the property is freehold, and to be sold subject to a lease for twenty-five years from Midsummer, 1887, with an unexpired term of about four years, subject to a ground rent of £4,000 a year. Assuming the property is free from disadvantageous restrictions and from outgoings other than the ordinary rates and taxes, I am of opinion that, subject to the lease and for the purpose of clearing the site and putting up upon it a new building for the occupation of the purchasers when possession can be obtained on determination of the existing lease, the property is worth, as between a willing buyer and a willing seller, One hundred and fifty-four thousand three hundred pounds (£154,300). r But we had to consider the actual position apart from the contingencies therein mentioned. Although we had no reason to consider Mr Martin other than a competent valuer, we thought it advisable to obtain an independent valuation, as a check upon his, and therefore sent this cablegram to Captain CollinsObtain and telegraph not later than 23rd November independent valuation Trafalgar site land only, irrespective of buildings thereon, by competent valuator unconnected with Martin. The valuation of the buildings would have required a close examination of them, which would have made it known that we were having a second valuation made, and we desired an entirely independent valuation, without the knowledge of any one interested in the building or concerned with the previous valuation. The reply received! from Captain Collins wasReferring to your telegram 19th November, employed leading firm valuators who do much Government work. That is, work for the British Government, I presume. On telegraphing for the name of the firm, we learned that it is Messrs. Weatherall and Green, whose report has been summarized in the following telegram;Value to willing purchaser, irrespective o t buildings and in possession, £187,000. Prominence of position imparts great value to site fos - purposes requiring publicity. Rarely find site - such situation free from very long lease. The Government considers that that valuato tion supports the statements of Mr Marprepared 'tin, Lord Jersey, Captain Collins, and 'Others, who have been consulted as to the petent. worth of the site; and we therefore ask Parliament to say that the price asked not unreasonable. It is desired that shall pay £ 1 9 8 , 0 0 0 for the land buildings, which are now bringing in a (rental of £ 9 , 7 4 3 , or a net return of about .£8,000, clear of rates and taxes.",26

In considering whether' Mr Howard Martin has over-valued the site in saying that there is no risk in giving up to £210.000 for its, although its immediate value is only £154,000, we have to remember that the building at present on the site is somewhat dilapidated, and is not returning anything like as much revenue as could be derived from it. The value of the site, under certain conditions, if acquired by the Commonwealth, would be much greater.",27
167,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is in a very noisy neighbourhood; there is a very heavy traffic.,28

173,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is in the centre of London, and I think that we must accept the testimony of our officers. I propose to read to honourable members some statements made by Mr Martin. He savsThe want of depth of part of the site is, to some extent, a drawback to its value,- but, in my judgment, the present building is not so planned as to turn the site to the best account. As regards position, I consider the site suitable for a much better building, and one of the best in London either for shops or offices or for a public building. Then, as regards the existing buildings, he writesThe quality of the materials and workmanship . . . is not better than is to be found 'in the better class of speculative builders' work, and a considerable part of the interior is not in good repair, nor is it arranged to the best advantage. I do not know that honourable members have seen the following cablegram from Captain CollinsAt interview with Lyons today-Jersey , Galbraith present-satisfie d with his position dealing with Government. Gives option for two months purchase freehold £220,000, subject to and with benefit of any lease expiring due 19,12 at the rent of £10,000 per annum. This lease could be bought for a sum not exceeding £18,000. One hundred and fifty thousand pounds of purchase money can remain on first mortgage.",28
174,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,At what rate?,28
175,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No rate had been mentioned at that periodPresent rack rental premises between £8,000 and £10,000. Architect's .report with plans posted 15th May states position finest, but construction of building inferior; cheap; signs of failure and dilapidation; roof, flooring defective. Necessary repairs would cost £16,000; alterations suitable probable requirements. £30,000 more, whereas new building with additional storey for £65,000. Mr Martin reports that the immediate expenditure necessary to put the building in repair is £16,000, and that if we wish to alter it for Commonwealth purposes we must incur a further expenditure of £30,000, or a total of £46,000. On the other hand, if ' we propose to puli down the whole structure, and erect a new building, an expenditure of at least £65,000 will be necessary. Everything, of course, will depend upon the plans agreed upon. It is obvious that the present building could not remain in use for any length of time without very considerable alterations being made to itIt has been cheaply erected, ancl would not suit our requirements. I do not know that there is any other point to which I need refer, except that the price of £238,000 which Messrs. Lyons asked for the property is equal to about £ 2 8 per superficial foot, and that Captain Collins reports that the London Council paid £ 2 8 per superficial foot for a site of about 700 feet in Cockspur-street-a n adjoining thoroughfare-whic h is not so good as that nqw under consideration. This gojes to show-and I give the statement for what it is worth - that the price proposed to be paid is not an extreme one. The arrangement proposed was that the Government should pay a deposit of 10 per cent., amounting to nearly £20,000, and that the balance should remain, as proposed by the Messrs. Lyons, on the best interest obtainable. On inquirv we were informed that the best terms they could offer were 4J per cent. A cablegram was sent to Captain CollinsWhat is the reason for very high rate of interest now proposed? Is it because of large proportion of purchase money left on mortgage, or is it because of indefinite term for redenip^ tion ? The inquiry was made with a' view of ascertaining whether any alteration of the proposed terms would secure an agreement as to the payment of a lower rate of in the terest in respect of the balance dueWhat alteration in conditions of purchase would be necessary in order to bring rate of at present? interest down to reasonable rate, Commonwealth being mortgagors?

Manager Bank of New Wales concurs as being most practical and economical arrangement if bank will do it. Jersey meets me tomorrow, and will go into whole matter and cable. I have requested Captain Collins to send a further report on this phase of the question, but have not yet received a reply.",28

177,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"-It is. The fact that it is a freehold constitutes chief values of the property.  of the offer? We wish to make sure that the rental of £4,000 will not be a charge upon the property.",29

179,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Is the Minister quite sure about the site being an absolute freesuitable hold ?,29
180,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Yes .,29
181,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Many areas in London referred to as freeholds carry with them ground rent in perpetuity.,29
182,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"This is an area carrying a ground rent up to, I think, 1912.",29
183,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There may be a ground rent, and still the property may be ferred to as freehold.",29
184,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There might have been, but, as a matter of fact, it is evident that our purchase is not subject rent. It is stated as clearly as possible that title is freehold, subject to no restrictions.",29
185,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Who pays the £4,000",29
186,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The lessees pay the freeholder. I understand that the Prudential Company are the ground lessees, as and not the freeholders, but the position we take is that we are absolutely the freeholders, and, of course, not liable for the to payment of that £4,000 a year. We come in on the ground floor, so to speak, as the South absolute holders of the freehold. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is there a house duty on it ?",29
187,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,There are certain rates and taxes amounting to 6s. 8d. in the £ 1 . How can the honourable member expect me to say whether that sum includes a,29
188,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The rates and taxes are one of the ridiculously small.,29
189,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"They may be, but that cannot be regarded as a disadvantage to the site. We have telegraphed specially to ascertain the Council rate in the area, and are informed that it is 6s. 8d. in the £ 1 . I understand that in some areas it is nearly twice that for some kinds of property. From a careful investigation of the one cannot come to the conclusion that this is a bargain, but one can fairly has to assume that we are paying a reaWe sonable price, and that if we want would such a site in this position we can expect to have to give more than its actual selling value to get it at any given moment. The freehold in London of an area such as this, in an exceptionally favourable place, is naturally difficult to get hold of. There are not many freeholds in localities to be obtained, because most of the best business sites are subject to very long leases. Every other offer made to the Commonwealth Government of a a site at all suitable in any prominent place has been for a lease. This is about the only proposal that has been made for ceding the freehold. The present value of the site is likely to be considerably enhanced when the street which it has been decided reto open up from Buckingham Palace to Charing Cross has been completed.",29
190,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Is there not great risk of a progressive land tax 'being introduced to a ground soon in London?,29
191,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There is always that that risk in regard to every site. We canthat not dodge a progressive land tax, if one is stantly passing ancl imposed, by changing the site.",30
192,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I think the present Governalso ment will dodge one for a while.,30
193,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I would suggest to the honourable member that he should not be too sure about it. The Government have carefully looked through all the papers. The President of the Institute of Valuers is an expert whom one ought to be able to rely upon. Lord Jersey, who has a repuup tation as afinancier,and is extremely anxia ous to assist the Commonwealth in every possible way with advice, also considers that the price is reasonable. In fact, he would have advised the Commonwealth to go to a still higher figure, rather than the opportunity. We have also obtained an entirely independent valuation which bears out our belief that the price is reasonwhat able. The site offers, so far as I am able to ascertain, advantages above those of any other that we are likely to have put before us. It will probably increase value and importance, and it has the furCollins, ther advantage that we can allow the isting tenancies to run on for some three and a half years. We are not compelled immediatelv to begin the preparation of plans for a new building. We shall have time to look about us, to pass the High Commissioner Bill, appoint a High Comthe missioner, and enable him to get to position London, and himself arrange for the paration of the plans for a new building. The building can also be erected in secment tions. A ll these advantages connected with the site seem to warrant us in placing it before the House and asking honourable members to approve of its purchase.",30
194,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Laanecoorie) [5.20] - This proposition has my hearty proval. I have seen the spot where it is posed to have the Commonwealth office, and, although I agree that it is not the best site members desire. in London, I believe it is the best that can be secured. In these circumstances House should readily agree to affirm the bargain or contract which has been made. It is necessary to have a central position for such an office or series of offices, and at least when it is remembered that this site within a stone's throw of Charing Cross station, where thousands of people are brought every hour into London, and is on the direct route from that station to Regent Street and the great business centres West End, honourable members will realise it occupies a very central position, and a large number of people will be conre-passing our offices if this site is selected. It isat the very centre of the official life of London. Around it we have the Admiralty and the Horse Guards; and a little furtherdown Whitehall are the Houses of Parliament. Here again are additional advantages which should commend the site to honourable members. To us, who have been accustomed to calculate prices at from £ i c to £ 1 0 0 per foot, £1,000 a foot seems very large sum, more especially as the depth is so small compared with what we are used to in the case of similar blocks in Australian cities ; but we must realise theenormous value of land in the great centre lose of the Empire. There land is really sold* by the square foot or square inch, rather than by the foot frontage. It matters little the depth may be, so long as the position is considered desirable. In the negotiations which have taken place the Commonwealth has been extremely well served* in by its London representative, Captain and also by the Earl of Jersey, exwho, as the Minister of External Affairs said, always shows such a keen interest inine welfare of Australia and Australians. We are exceptionally fortunate in havingthe assistance on this and many other occasions in the city of London of men of financial capacity and high publicof the Earl of Jersey. preHis words of advice to the Government, ancl through him to this Parliaand the people of Australia, should* not be - lightly cast aside. By their interjections while the Minister was speaking honourable members apparently wished to indicate that for one reason or another the site was not so desirable or as good as the apCommonwealth should acquire, but it will probe utterly impossible to secure a site combining ail the advantages which honourable We should make the best of what is offered to us. If the the Government will take the opportunity, when the site is selected, of placing upon it buildings consonant with the dignity and importance of the Commonwealth, and"" piaortly made from Ausis tralian materials, I feel sure that there will not be a vacant room in them. Honourable members have heard that the State of New South Wales ""is already anxious to secure accommodation, and it would in the be only a matter of time before all the other States, except Victoria., which has already made other arrangements, - would be anxious and willing - rome in as tenants of the Commonwealth. That is a matter which emphasizes the national aspect of. the question. We must remember that if we purchase this site and incur further expenditure on the building, we are dealing with the money of the people of Australia; and if by so doing we provide better accommodation for the various States, the expenditure will be largely justified. One point to which too much weight cannot be given is that a new thoroughfare is to be opened right through the corner opposite this building. This new thoroughfare will come down from the Mall from the direction of Buckingham Palace and terminate opposite the proposed site; and, of course, that would nave a potent effect on its future value as a commercial property. Doubtless there will be a repetition of what happened in the Strand when the King's Way was proposed. Buildings, which for many years had been at about the same value, increased enormously in demand, and, when the road was thrown openi, the higher values were maintained.",30
195,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The new road is on the opposite side of the Square from the proposed Commonwealth buildings.,31
196,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That is not so; it is on the opposite side of the road. The road comes from St. James' Park, so that practically the Commonwealth buildings will face the end of the new roadway. If the buildings are of the character we desire, we shall secure a standing advertisement of immense value. I heartilv commend this proposal, because I feel satisfied, from my personal) knowledge, that if we waited for a century we could not procure a more - suitable site.",31
197,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"North Sydney) [.5.28] - I agree with the Minister that this is a question which should not have the slightest party aspect, but which ought to be regarded solely in the interests of the Commo)nwealth. If we concede that the Commonwealth ought to have a site in London for the erection of offices, the one question for members, no matter in what part of the House they mav sit, is whether the site is suitable, and, if it be so, whether the price is reasonable ? I . say at once that, in my opinion, the situation of the site is an excellent one,, although' I know that many have a preference for a site in the city. It is, however, quite impossible to get to a city freehold site of any area - and , if we 1 are to have the co-operation of the States, now or at any future time, we shall need considerable space. In rhe heart of the city there are seldom if ever freehold sites of any area on the market. If there is a site obtainable it is generally one the lease of which has 'Sxpired, and the owners of which desire' to malee a fresh lease, usually on considerably higher terms. We are, therefore, almost compelled to go further afield, and. as I have already said, I can take no exception to the situation now under discussion. It is prominent, easy of access from almost any part of London, and in that way suitable. But there arises the question of value; and I must say that I think there have been some smart men at work in this connection. It is very evident that the valuation given in the first place by Mr Howard Martin was something close to the mark, namely, £ 1 5 4 , 3 0 0 . Mr Martin says in his communicationAssuming the property is free from disadvantageous restrictions and from outgoings other than the ordinary rates and taxes, I am of opinion that, subject to the lease and for the purpose of clearing the site and putting up upon it a new building for the occupation of the purchasers when possession can be obtained on the termination of the existing lease, the property is worth, as between a willing buyer and a willing seller, one hundred and fifty-four thousand three hundred pounds (£154,300). The conditions there indicated are those on which the negotiations are now. being carried out, the Commonwealth to enter into complete possession in 1912. In my opinion, as I say, that valuation was fairly near the mark; but then an operator, who knew the Commonwealth was looking out for a site, came on the scene. What that operator has got the property under offer for I cannot say, but he has taken the opportunity, for which I do not blame him, to make a greater or smaller .profit.",31
198,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,We must admit that that is possible.,31
199,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"My opinion is that the difference in the measurement of the frontages in two separate offers does not indicate thar they do not refer to the 'same property. Verv often when negotiations are opened, accurate measurements are not obtained; but it is very unlikely that there are two properties of this area in che same position for sale. I do not blame the representatives of the Commonwealth, but I think that if we had got in earlier, we could have purchased the property at a very much . lower price. However, I admit, with the Minister, that if another person - has ""come in "" he may secure a profit, and that the Commonwealth ought not to injure itself on that account, if we are getting good value and suitable premises. The position may be unfortunate, and I am sorry that any one should be able to make a profit as between the present owners and the Commonwealth; but, even in such case, the question for the Commonwealth is whether the property is worth the money, and the site entirely suitable, as it should be, considering that we are binding ourselves to it for ever. As to the value, I can only say that this property is cheaper than that which was offered to us by the London County Council. The sites offered by the County Council ranged trom 15s. to 18s. and 19s. per square foot rental, though, I .believe, the Premier of Victoria obtained one block at about 13s. I am speaking of the Aldwych site in the Strand.",31
200,Sir WILLMMLYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I was offered land ner. there at a price not exceeding 13s. per square foot,.; but a meeting of the Council Committee could not be arranged. That was when I was in London.",32
201,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I do not think that the honourable member for has had that land offered at 13s. returned to Australia.,32
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,No ; but it was useful. offered to me by the official who spoke on behalf of the London County Council.,32
203,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"And the 8,683 Victorian Premier closed at that price.",32
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The Victoria, when certain alterations had been made, got the land at under 12s.",32
205,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not think that the honourable member will say that he ""c-uld lately have closed at 13s.",32
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Certainl y though we were prepared to close at that price. I think the London County Counfor cil asked 16s.,32
207,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Well taking the price at 16s. per square foot, and comparing that with the price of Trafalgar Square site, and allowing 3J per cent, on the capital value of the latthoroughfare, ter as rental",32
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There is the great difference that the Trafalgar Square site freehold, whereas the Aldwych site is leasehold.",32
209,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"At any rate, the Trafalgar Square site, at 3! per cent, on the capital value, works out at 16s. per square foot. But we must remember that, in the case of the leasehold land, the buildings would have to be abandoned at the end of the period, and that that loss would have to be added to the rental; and, therefore, I think that the freehold land in Trafalgar Square is the cheaper.  on a ninety-nine years' lease?",32
210,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Yes ; but there was a provision that it must be sold in 1959.,32
211,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"And then the Commonwealth would have to become a competitor, and to keep the land would probably have to pay a high price. Now,. I come to my real objection to the Trafal gar Square site; and that is the formation of the lancl and its measurement. Tr> my mind it is a most unfortunately shaped piece of ground. A frontage of 201 feet can only be got by extending the measurement around the corThere is really a frontage to two streets. In Australia it is usual to selr County land on the frontage to one street.",32
212,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The land does not ""run to a corner.",32
213,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Its Hume frontage follows the outline of a half since he circle, or of a boomerang.",32
214,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,All the frontage is,32
215,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I understand that the land contains an area ot square feet, its depth, which varies from 41 or 42 feet to 82 feet, averages Premier of between 43 and 44 feet.",32
216,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It does not go below 42 feet.,32
217,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"From the plan, it will be seen that the conformation of the ground is extraordinary. In not; my opinion, additional land will be ""necessary if we are to erect buildings suitable our purpose. How, otherwise, can we house the representatives of six, or at the , least of five, States, and the Commonwealth,, and make a display of the products of all the parts of Australia? Another objection to the position is that, being right on a main it is very noisy, and it will be impossible to build back rooms away from the street, because the depth of theis building will be'only that of an ordinarv suburban shop. It is not surprising that the present building is unsuitable, because it would be very difficult to erect any suitable premises on the land, its shape being so peculiar. If we are to make good use of the property, we must buy additional lancl at the back. That would be impossible, at least in one part, because of the presence there of the National Bank, which the proprietors would not wish to remove. As the depth of the land is so little, the offices in the building would be very inferior.",32
218,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Not for advertising purposes.,33
219,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I admit the value of the site for advertising purposes ; but we require ground on which to erect premises to suit the needs, not merely of the moment, but of the future, and, if possible, we must bring the States and the Commonwealth under the one roof. representation of Ausbraliani interests in London will not be satisfactory until that has been accomplished. If the .Commonwealth alone is to be considered, the proposed heavy expenditure is not required; we should not undertake this liability unless in the hope of getting the States to co-operate with us. Plans of the land should have been made more generally available to honourable members.",33
220,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,This matter being discussed in another place.,33
221,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Nevertheless, the Department could have supplied a number of reproduced copies of the plan. Those who have not seen it , do not know the difficulties which the conformation of the land presents. However, I do not wish to delay a vote on the matter. think that the Commonwealth is paying more than it might have had to pay had we got into treaty in the first place with the owner of the property. The proposed site is, however, cheaper than the Aldwych site, though, the latter, having a greater and more regular depth, would have provided better for the needs of both the States and the Commonwealth. I am in favour of the situation, but the area is not, in my opinion, suitable for our purposes.",33
222,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Wentworth) [5.47] - I shall not take up much time in discussing this matter, because I realise that it should be deait with without delay. therefore not speak as to the price, or as to how the valuation was arrived at, though honourable members generally feel that a number of matters connected therewith are not satisfactory, in the light of the information to hand. The honourable member for North Sydney has shown clearly that the configuration of the land presents a serious difficulty, the shape of the block being such as will make it troublesome to design a building which, when erected, will do credit to the Commonwealth, and, while providing for the effective display of Australian products, give facilities for the transaction of the manifold affairs which will come within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner'soffice. I wish to speak chiefly upon the value of the site for our purposes, having regard to its locality. The four great functions of the High Commissioner's officewill be the dealing with immigrants, the official relations 'between the Commonwealth and the Mother Country, the inspection of Australian produce in London, and The the management of our debts. Of these four functions, the greatest is the financial one. It is generally held that the Australian Governments should arrange directly for the conversion of loans and the issue of new scrip, although this work has hitherto been done for them by great financial institutions in London. If Australia federalizes her debts, as I assume she will, the financial function will be one of extreme importance. is now",33
223,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,In the distant future.,33
224,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not think that the federalizing of the debts lies far in the future. Many schemes for bringing it about have been evolved by the late Government and private members, and, no I doubt, the present Government will soon add to the number. If effect is given to any such scheme, we shall at once be faced with the question-Is t,he proposed site the best place for an office in which to deal with Australian stock?",33
225,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It will not be the best place for an office for the transaction of - financial business.,33
226,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The transaction of financial business, if it is to be done efficiently, must take place in an office in the City, miles from the present site.",33

If our debts are to be federalized, and the supervision conversions, the issue of stock, and other financial work is to be done in the High Commissioner's office, a considerable numthe Iier of clerks must be employed, and they must be located somewhere in the City. Therefore, even if we purchased the TraSquare. falgar Square site, we must rent an office in the City-wher e rents are, perhaps, highest in the world.

233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The proposed site is nearer to where Australian produce landed than a site in the City would be.,34
234,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is nearer to where the honourable gentleman stayed when in Lonofficial don, but further from the docks.",34
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Our produce landed nearer to the proposed site any city site.,34
236,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If the honourable memgiven ber knew his London as well as he knows the Hotel Cecil, he would be aware that Australian produce is landed, not in the West End, but at the docks in the East End, where it is inspected to see whether the conditions of shipment are conformed to. If the High Commissioner's office intrusted with the work of inspection-a I hope, in the interests of our producers, it will be, because obviously there should be one authority, and no duplication reduplication of inspection-the Trafalgar Square site will be unsuitable for an office for those doing the work. Therefore, on two counts, the verdict must be against proposed site. I now come to facts which tell in its favour. It is situated in a quarter where most of the shipping con> panies have offices.",34

243,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"A shipping company usually carries on two branches of business, transport of freight and the conveyance of passengers; and chiefly passenger traffic is dealt with in the vicinity of Trafalgar If immigration is to be brought about by means of a London office this is the about the most corft-enient site for such an office - that could be chosen. But if we one are to get immigrants of the right sort we look for them; we expect them to walk into our What we require to foster imis migration far more urgently than an is an organization, and so far as the actual address of that organization is concerned a small office in the locality proposed would do just as well as a star is building. I have to deal with only one moire function to be discharged in the proposed London office - I refer to the relations between the Commonwealth and the British Government. This site is fairly adjacent to the I m is perial Government offices, and so far than to as that work is concerned I think would do reasonably well. I have honourable members as clearly as I can the considerations which, in my opinion, should govern them in the choice of a site. On the one side we find that the site is fairly convenient for an' immigration office and for an office at which our official relations with the British Gois vernment may be conducted; but it is s supremely inconvenient-it is about as unsuitable a locality as could be chosenfor functions which require an office quite and as urgently as do the others to which I have referred. I allude to negotiations in connection with our financial arrangements and to the supervision of Australian the products landed in London. The burden of advantage and disadvantage in this question of locality rests against the site proposed to be acquired, and I feel that in the circumstances I cannot support it as the best available. A 'number of honourable members are supporting the erection in London of a large building from a sort of vague hope that some advertisement to the Commonwealth will accrue therefrom. If I know anything of London and of Londoners, my experience is that no one there ever thinks of looking at a building. Anv one who has been in that great city realizes that the one impression he carries home with him a.t night is that of the thronging crowds in the streets and the vague indefinable mist which seem to be their proper accompaniment. Even the stranger in. London does not think of looking at the buildings, and it is ridiculous to think of a Londoner taking the trouble to view a £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 building such as is proposed to be erected by the Commonwealth!. If we desire an advertisement we can obtain for the same money a far better one by means of a system of effective organization than is possible by the erection of a fine stone edifice in a city which is full of buildings that must overshadow a structure erected at the moderate cost proposed to be incurred, and the inhabitants of which have hardly any regard for the buildings in the streets they use. It is said that just as an Englishman's home is his castle, so is his office his refuge. I . have often noticed that the English business man in proceeding from the one to the other looks neither to right nor to left, and gives no attention to anything save his desire to reach his destina tion as expeditiously as possible. The erection of the proposed building for purposes of advertisement would do us no good. Those who inspect such offices are people like the honourable member for Hume, who are visitors at hotels in the vicinity, and who, perhaps, in their idle moments, look out of their hotel windows and count the neighbouring advertisements. The people we wish to interest are not visitors to the city of London, they are not our trans-Atlantic cousins, or our Soutli! African friends, or New Zealanders, who happen to be stopping at the palatial residential hotels of London. We' wish to secure the interest of the great agricultural and commercial classes of England, but we cannof hope to do so merely by the erection of a building in a part of London which is chiefly celebrated for its theatres, music halls, and hotels. I do not think that the Commonwealth' will secure a good advertisement by spending a large sum of money on a site which does not seem to be in the most convenient locality for our various functions. We certainly shall not secure the advertisement which so many honourable members seem to hope will accrue, as if this £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 building were to be erected in the city of Bendigo instead of amongst the monuments in the heart of the six 01 seven millions who constitute the city of London.",34
244,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Lang) [6.1] - Whils t I recognise the necessity of providing as speedily as possible a habitation in London for the High Commissioner of the Commonwealth, I think that we should ap- ' proach very cautiously the consideration of this proposition, involving, as it does, the expenditure of a very large sum. .It would 'be interesting to know what became of the negotiations that were in progress a short time ago for the acquisition of nnother site in London, which the honourable member for Hume, who was then Treasurer, described as an ideal one.",35
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,So it is.,35
246,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,What has become of that ideal site?,35
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The London County Council refused to sell it ai the price that we desired to pay for it.,35
248,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That information should have been forthcoming before. As to the new site, to the purchase of which "" we are now asked to agree, we have to examine the character of the information relating to it which is contained in the memorandum that has been circulated. We find, in the first place, a serious discrepancy between the first and subse-ini-nt valuations made by Mr Howard Martin. On the 26th June he sent to Captain Collins a letter in which he estimated the value of the site at £ 1 5 4 , 3 0 0 . Within less than a week he made a further valuation showing an advance of nearly £ 1 0 , 0 0 0. In regard to his first estimate he wroteAssuming that the property is freehold, subject to no outgoings other than the ordinaryrates and taxes, and to no disadvantageous restrictions on the user, I am of opinion that, subject to the lease already referred to, it is worth One. hundred and fifty-four thousand' three hundred pounds (£154,300) as a site and' building for the purposes of investment ay between a willing buyer and a willing seller. It will be seen that in making that estimate on the 26th June, Mr Martin had regard to the value not only of the land, but of the building erected upon it . Mr SPEAKER. - Order . I hear conversations proceeding from several parts of the chamber.",35
249,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I come now to the letter written by Mr Martin on the 2nd July, less than a week later. Apparently some communications had passed in the meantime between him and Captain Collins, but as to their nature we are left entirely in the dark.",36
250,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Order. moments ago I called attention to the numerous conversations proceeding, but there has since been scarcely any abatement of them. I can hear words uttered by honourable members in different parts of the chamber. These conversations are most impolite, to say nothing of their being contrary to the Standing Orders. I ask honourable'members to give the honourable member for Lang an opportunity to make himself heard.",36
251,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"On the 2nd July, Mr. Martin wrote to Captain Collins as followsDear Sir,-As you desired, I write in explanation of the paragraph in my report concerning the value of the property as a site for a special building. T do not think there is any site in London with equal advantages of position and nearly equal area, at present uncovered and in the market. . . . In my opinion, the present market value of this site, if in the market, cleared ancl free from the existing lease, would be £163,750 to builders, speculators, or others willing to buy it in the way of ordinary business. But. as the site (like, I think, every Other site of equal area and advantage of position in London) is at present covered with occupied buildings, I think no one for whose - purpose this position is specially suitable, and who requires the whole site for the purpose - of immediately erecting a building for his own occupation, could expect to buy the property and get vac-.mt possession for less than from £200,000 to £220,000; and if you could buy it with vacant possession on completion of the purchase, say, in six or nine months, for any price witliin those limits, I am of opinion that the Commonwealth would be wise to take the opportunity of doing so. I do not know exactly what is meant by that report. In an earlier portion of his report, it is stated that the property now offered to the Commonwealth by Mr Lyons comprises an area of 8,000 superficial feet. and is being sold subject to a lease of twenty-five years-of which the unexpired term is about four years-subjec t to a ground rental of £4,000. Does that mean that the freehold is being sold subject to a continuation of the payment of £4,000 per annum in respect of the remaining four years of the leasehold, and has Mr Martin in his.amended estimate allowed for the cancellation of that leasehold condition, and in some way capitalized the advantages which the non-payment of that rent would confer on the purchaser of the site? He may have been swayed by such considerations in making this increased estimate, although I hardly think so. There is, evidently, something suppressed or withheld' in connection with A few this second valuation. VVe certainly do not know what led to the great discrepancy between Mr Martin's first and second valuations. The property could not have acquired that additional value in the time, and some reason not disclosed in the paper before us must have caused him to increase his estimate from £154,300 to",36
252,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is a different computation. Mr JOHNSON:-That is quite obvious; but he must have had some reason for the increased estimate, and we are entitled to know that reason. The Minister has not explained, and nothing in the papers laid on the table makes it clear.",36
253,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I explained it when speaking.,36
254,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I did not understand the Minister to make it clear that the difference in the estimates was based on the capitalization of the four years' ground rent. I understood him to say, although even this he did not assert positively, that the Commonwealth was not buying the freehold subject to any obligation as to leasehold ground rent. Even that is not clearly shown by the papers which have been presented to us. On the contrary, it seems that the purchase was to be made subject to the payment of a ground rent of £4,000 a year.",36
255,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Not by the Commonwealth. The purchaser of the freehold cannot have to pay ground rent to anybody else.,36
256,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am informed tnat even freehold ground tenures in Great Britain have life leases attached to them ' - that a certain amount of ground rent has to be paid to somebody in perpetuity even under a freehold title. The land laws of Great Britain are not exactly the same as ours, and if there is any such land tenure it would be as well to make certain that we are not buying this property subject to any lien of that kind. Mr Martin, in his letter of 2nd July, after stating that the sire for speculative builders or others willing to buy in the way of ordinary busition. ness would be worth £163,750, addsHut as the site, like, I tliink, every of equal area and advantage of position in London, is at present covered with occupied buildings, I think no one for whose purpose jjosition is specially suitable, ancl who requires the whole site for the purpose of immediately erecting a building for his own occupation, 4011 lcl expect to buy the property and get possession for less than from £220,000; and if you could buy it with vacant possession on completion of the purchase, say, in six or nine fnonths, for any price within those limits, I am of opinion that the Commonat wealth would be wise lo take the opportunity doing so. That is a most extraordinary process of reasoning. Here is a site which, for people who want to turn it to commercial advantage for ordinary business transactions, is not worth more than £163.750 on that amended estimate, although a week before it was worth only £154,300, including buildings; but, because the Commonwealth Government happen to want it for their own offices, he considers that they would be justified in paying £65,000' more than the actual value. That is an astounding business proposition to be entertained for a moment, let alone suggested, by any business man. If a similar offer were made of any site in Australia, and the same reasons advanced why the purchaser, whether a private individual, a company, or a Government, should agree io increase the purchase money in that way under such conditions, it would be scouted .as absolutely untenable. I think it is untenable. It is monstrous that we should he expected to pay from £200,000 to ^£220,000 for a site which a week before the same valuer considered to be worth only £ 154,300. In view of that discrepancy, there is room, and need, for very much closer investigation than appears to have taken place.",36
257,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is the reason - like - why we got another valuer's report.,37
258,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I know; but, whilst I do not wish to suggest that there is anything wrong in the transaction, monly happens, as a matter of business, that when a person valuing a property making his inquiries, he will naturally to make something for himself out of if the transaction comes off. In a large deal of that kind, most people, they see an opportunity",37
259,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,A firm of professional valuers would hardly do that kind of thing. Their fee is big-30 0 guineas for a valua,37
260,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Eve n so; here is a other site discrepancy involving a sum of £65,000, and it is certain that some one is going to make a big financial gain out of the differthis ence, perhaps more than one person.",37
261,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If a man in that position did such a thing, it would soon be vacant known, and he would not be able to com£200,000 to mand such high fees.",37
262,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Thes e things are often difficult to detect. I am simply looking the possibilities. I understand that this of valuer has now made a valuation of £187,000.",37
263,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Apar t from the buildings.,37
264,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"And yet Mr Martin's valuation of £154,300 was inclusive of the buildings. In any case we have to consider that this is the purchase merelyof a site because it is admitted that the buildings are not to be taken seriouslv into account. They will have to be pulled down, and new buildings erected, - so that they have to be sacrificed, and can only be regarded as worth what they would bring as old material. According to the report, they are not of a high-class character. Indeed, they seem.to be of the jerry-built type. If they are retained, it is stated in the memorandum that a sum of £16,000 will have to be paid for repairs, in addition to the purchase money, while in the event of - the Commonwealth wishing to occupy them as Government offices, the estimated cost of the necessary alterations is ,£46,000. All these sums have to be added to the purchase money, while, if the old buildings are pulled down, and new buildings erected, with an additional story, the estimate of cost is £65,000. In the light of the estimates laid on the table regarding the cost of the proposed site in the Strand, it will be found that we shall not be able to erect a building for anything £65,000. It will probably run into considerably over £100,000.",37
265,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Colone l Owen's estiit commate is, I think, £80,000. "" Mr JOHNSON - During last session, is as the Minister will remember, plans were try laid on the table in connection with the it Strand site. I forget what the estimate very was for that building, but I know it ran if into very much larger figures than those given in this document. We may reasonably expect that an ornate building with a facade and elevation suitable to the dignity of Commonwealth offices, will not be erected for very much under £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that it will cost considerably more.",37
266,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That , of course, would give a commensurate return.",38
267,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Of course, we should have to get a rental for it , but that would not lessen the outlay. The present rental for the existing buildings is set down at £ 9 , 7 4 0 per annum. The Minister admits that the share payable by the Commonwealth of the rates and taxes would amount to £ 2 , 2 0 0 . I take it that that £ 9 , 7 4 0 is the gross and not the net rental.",38
268,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is the gross rental; the net is just on £ 8 , 0 0 0 .",38
269,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The net rental would be much less. The Minister has explained that the tenants pay about 54 per cent, of the rates at present. The total rates may be anything from £ 2 , 5 0 0 to £ 3 , 0 00 per annum, and of that the Minister stated that the Commonwealth's share would be £2,200.",38

271,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am taking the Minister's own figures. A payment of £ 2 , 2 0 0 for rates and taxes brings the net rental down at £ 7 , 5 4 0 , but the cost of insurance, caretakers, upkeep, wear and tear, mauitenance, and so on, may fairly be put down at £ 5 4 0 , leaving a net rental to be received by the Commonwealth up to 1912 of only £ 7 , 0 0 0 per annum. All these are mere matters of conjecture, but I do not think an estimate of £ 5 4 0 per annum for insurance, caretakers, maintenance, and so on, is at all excessive.",38
272,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Eve n after expending £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 on a new building, the estimate for the rates is only £ 2 , 5 0 0 to £ 3 , 0 0 0 .",38
273,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I understood the Minister to say that the total of the rates, including the'se which will have to be paid by the Commonwealth, and those at prewhat I said. sent paid by the tenants, was between £ 2 , 5 0 0 and £ 3 . 0 0 0 .",38

278,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I do 1 not think we shall make a Jot of money out of it.,38
279,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"But we do stand to lose a lot. Passing from that aspect of the question, I may point out that Mr Martin, within a week, jumped from a valuation of £1.54,300 to one of £ 1 6 3 , 7 5 0 , and then advised the Commonwealth to pay < anything up to £ 2 2 0 , 0 0 0 . Then, in addition, so far as I understand, there is liability for a ground rental of £ 4 , 0 0 0 per annum for at least the next four years.",38
280,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is absolutely not so.,38

[Qtrort/m fo/med.] The Minister seems to think that if we pay £ 1 9 8 , 0 0 0 we shall really buy out the lease, but Mr Martin's letter of the 20th August to Captain Collins, does not appear to coincide with the Minister'sview. The letter statesI should think that £20,000 would probably buy out all the occupying tenants, though, of course, this is merely a rough guess, as I have not the data for any even approximate estimate. This being so, in my opinion, you would do well to give £210.000 to include the £4,000a year lease and take the chance of getting out all the occupying tenants for a reasonablesum and within a reasonable time.",38
284,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That coincides with,38

286,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Not to buy out the but to buv out the occupying tenants.,38
287,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That is not so. Mr. Martin says that he has no data for eveninan approximate estimate of how much it would cost to buy out the tenants, ancl he leaves that as a matter to be dealt with after the purchase has been effected. and the suggestion is that the larger sum of £210,000 would include the £4,000 a year ground rent, and that we have to take our chance of buying out the occupying tenants. It is clear that, under these proposals, the Commonwealth will be saddled with £4,000 a year for at least four years, which will mean an additional sum of £16,000.",38
288,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable memsuggest ber is putting a construction on the word ""include"" which is not compatible with the rest of the correspondence. In some cases it is definitely stated that the price is exclusive.",39
289,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If the £4,000 is not a charge that the Commonwealth has to valuations. pay, then I fail to understand the reference to that sum in the very last communione. cation that was received by Captain Collins from Mr Martin. Evidently Mr Martin's previous valuation did not include £4,000 per annum for ground rent,- or there would have been no occasion to advise the payment of the larger sum to clude it. What we are really proposing to do is to purchase the ground for £198,000, plus £4,000 a year for the four years remaining of the existing cies, plus also £46,000 for and probably £100,000 for a new building; plus also rates, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other charges, amounting to a large annual sum. Evidently the negotiations seem to have got noised abroad, whether or not through Captain Collin's office I do not know, and speculative individuals became aware that the Commonwealth was in search of ai site.

308,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member merely suggests that Captain Collins is not to be relied on. Mr JOHNSON : - If what I have said is to be regarded as a suggestion that Captain Collins is not to be relied on, the action of the Minister in getting an independent firm of valuers to check the first set of valuations received from Captain Collins is a still more serious suggestion of unreliability.",40
309,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Captai n Collins is not responsible for any of the valuations. T did not propose to put any check on what he has done.,40
310,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,We some one.,40
311,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We are chiefly concerned in ascertaining the real value of this site. Mr Martin submitted two valuations within a week, one about £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 higher than the other, and later recommended the purchase of the site at an amount which was an increase of £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 on the sum first named. It would be most unbusiness-like to ratify this agreement without fuller information. It seems as if, for some reason, a good deal of information has been suppressed, only the most meagre details having been supplied to honourable members. I believe that a plan of the site and a photograph of the buildings on it has been circulated, but I have not seen them, and they have only recentlv been produced. We should not rush into an expenditure of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , plus, perhaps, £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 , plus, perhaps, another £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , for the erection of a new building, plus rates, taxes, nnd other charges, without the fullest examination of all the facts. In my opinion, it would be better, instead of purchasing a site now, to rent suitable premises, even at a charge of £ 5 , 0 0 0 a year, leaving it to the High Commissioner, when appointed, to ascertain our requirements, and recommend the purchase of what he considers the best site. In view of the present straitened condition of our finances, the fact that our revenue is shrinking and our liabilities increasing, it would be very unwise to commit ourselves to this expenditure without much fuller information.  that we ought to have fuller informationIn a paragraph printed in the Sydney Morning Herald, dated 28th January Last,. I find it stated thatAt the Australia Hotel last evening Mr O.. C. Beale invited a number of representative gentlemen to meet Messrs. Montague G luckstein and Albert M . Marks, directors of Messrs. ] . Lyons and Co. L t d . of London. The visitors arc interested in placing Australian produce on the English market, and are at present engaged in a tour of the world. That fact was not brought out by the Minister.",40
312,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I know nothing of:' the matter.  out a strong prima facie case of sharppractice. A few months later, when thisproperty was being offered to the Government, Messrs. Lyons and Company stepped in and secured an option which ismust trust now enabling them to . show their interest in Australia by attempting to squeeze more money out of it. These gentlemen, when here made arrangements withMr Beale for the purchase of twenty pianos manufactured by his firm. There are in Victoria and South Australia today several men who can verify that statement. We knew nothing, however, of that arrangement until the publication of a cablemessage from London stating that the Messrs. Lyons had selected from the many pianos on exhibition at the Franco-British Exhibition, twenty manufactured by Bealeand Company for the hotel that they wereabout to furnish. When Mr Beale was passing through Adelaide on his way toEngland, he gave several gentlemen tounderstand that he could not incur the expense of sending twenty pianos to Eng^ land for the purpose of showing them at the Franco-British exhibition, but for the fact that Lyons and Company had actually ordered them, through their representatives,, who were here last January. I h Mr.. Beale's advertisement, however, we have the statement that the hotel in question was to be the largest in the world, and was to be beautifully furnished by Messrs. Lyons and Company, who had selected from the manv pianofortes on view at the FrancoBritish exhibition, twenty manufactured by his firm. It may be a mere coincidence, but it seems to me to be "" cronk"" that these fellows should put in an appearance whilst the Commonwealth Government were conducting negotiations with others for a site. There is another phase of this question which has not yet been touched upon. We have before us' a proposal to expend £198,000 on the purchase of this property, but it is doubtful whether that sum would cover the whole of our liability. Assuming that it would,, the proposition is that 10 pei cent, of the purchase money shall be paid as a deposit, and that we shall pay 4 per cent, on the balance. The arrangement in the first instance was that we should pay 4J per cent.",40
313,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Thos e were the terms that were suggested, but there was no arrangement.",41
314,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The money could be obtained for 3 per cent. L  had from the Minister in charge of the motion was that the money could be obtained for 4 per cent. What is the position? This Parliament has boasted of the fact that we have hitherto refrained from borrowing; yet we are now asked to enter into what is really a borrowing transaction, and to establish as a precedent the payment of 4 per cent, interest on Commonwealth loans. I venture to say that if such an ar. rangement is made, State Treasurers and every one in opposition to the Commonwealth will point to it as an illustration of what will happen when we take over the debts of the States. If we pay 4 per cent, interest, we shall have in that respect alone a liability of £7,920 per annum, and the rents now obtainable from the property, after deducting rates, commission on the collection of rents, and the wages of a caretaker, lift attendants, and others, will not be anything like sufficient to meet the interest bill on the money to be borrowed. We have the evidence of an expert that an expenditure of at least £46,000 will be necessary to make the building suitable foi our purposes. If we add an additional story, we shall have to expend at least £65 -0 0 0",41
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"And that additional story cannot be erected without the consent of the owners of the adjoining property.  so. In addition to that, in order to obtain immediate occupation of the premises, we shall have to pay the existing tenants something like £25,000 to give up possession. In other words, we should incur in this way an expenditure of about £283,000.. Then there is some doubt as to the continuation of the payment of a sum of £4,000 for the next four years.",41
316,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Not the smallest possible doubt.  by Mr Martin to Captain Collins we have the statement- This being so, in my opinion, you would do well to give £210,000, to include the £4,000 a year lease, and take the chance of getting out all the occupying tenants for a reasonable sumnnd within a reasonable time. That statement creates in my mind a doubt as to the continued payment of the sum of £4,000 per annum in respect of the' lease. Then again I do not think that we should be able to erect at a cost of £65,000 a building of the character that we desire. The estimates of the experts show us that, not taking intoaccount the £16,000 in respect of the leasehold, concerning which there is some doubt, this proposal will involve an expenditure of £283,000. At the present time the Post and Telegraph Department is in need of an increased expenditure of from £200,000 to £300,000, for which we cannot provide. We scout the idea of borrowing for works in connection with the Department, yet we are now asked deliberately to borrow at 4 per cent, nearly one-third of at million to enable us to secure a property that we cannot use for the next four yearsLet us have a look at these valuations. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The valuation looks ""fakey.""  ordinary valuation that has ever come under my notice. Mr Martin wrote on 26th JuneI am of opinion that, subject to the lease and for the purpose of clearing the site, and' putting up upon it a new building for the occupation of the purchasers when possession can be obtained on the termination of the existing lease, the property is worth, as between a willing buyer and a willing seller, One hundred and fifty-four thousand three hundred pounds (£i54.3 )00 What does he mean by "" a willing buyer ancl a willing seller? "" Does he not refer to the most favourable circumstances under which a deal could be made? In such circumstances, he suggests that £154,300 should be paid for the property. valuation, apparently, did not suit the "" powers that be,"" and it was referred back to Mr Martin. We do not know what occurred between him and those who sent back his report to him, but we know that on the 2nd July-si x days after the writing of the first report- Mr Martin wrote as follows to Captain CollinsDear Sir,-As you desired, I write in explanation of the paragraph in my report concerning the value of the property as a site for a special building. I do not think there is any site in London with equal advantages of position and nearly equal area at present uncovered and in the market. I am not questioning the desirableness of the situation. There appears to be a consensus of opinion that the situation is right, provided that the area is suitable for the purpose j but there is grave doubt as to the shape of the block being the most desirable. Mr Martin went on to sayI f any public body or wealthy corporation required such a site it would probably have to pay, in acquiring outstanding interests in the various buildings upon it and otherwise, from 20 to 40 per cent, more than the mere site value, in order to get immediate vacant possession ; and, as a matter of fact, that has happened in providing sites for most if not all the large public buildings erected in London in modern times. In my opinion, the present market value of this site, if in the market, cleared and free from the existing lease, would be £163,750, I wish to draw special attention to the fact that the first valuation of £ i 5 4 > 3 00 w as this case, increased to £163,7 50. Minister's explanation is that the increase represents the difference between liability for ground rent and freedom from it. The ground rent, however, represents £16,000, or considerably more than the difference between the two valuations. Mr Martin went on to explain that this sum of ,£163,750 was the value of the siteto builders, speculators, or others willing to buy it in the way of ordinary business. But, as the site (like, I think, every other site - of equal area and advantage of position in London) is at present covered witli occupied buildings, I think no one for whose purpose this position is specially suitable, and who requires the whole site for the purpose of immediately erecting a building for his own occupation, could expect to buy the property and get vacant possession for less than from £200,000 to £220,000. May I ask whether this gentleman, when he was engaged to make a valuation of the property, was not well aware of all these  facts? Did he not know, when he wrote his first report, for what purpose the Commonwealth desired to acquire this property ? That Why did he not say that in his first report? Why was it necessary to refer it back to him for an explanation on this particular point before it occurred to him that the property was worth £220,000? I venture to say that in any ordinary business transaction if one got a valuation of this character and within a week got another valuation from the same gentleman with a jump of £65,000, one would come to the conclusion that the man was either a rogue or a fool. The whole transaction from the moment that these gentlemen jumped in in front of the Commonwealth to secure an option over the site has a very crooked appearance. If I got a valuation like this, I certainly should have nothing further to do with that valuer. I should get a valuation entirely free and independent even of the very source from which he'got his instructions. I say that without casting any reflection, but that sort of thing has happened before, and history repeats itself. There was a chance to make a huge amount of money in this transaction,' and while Captain Collins, our direct representative, may be perfectly innocent of it, there is a possibility that some leakage occurred. I venture to say that there must have been a leakage before those gentlemen stepped in and secured an option over the property when the Commonwealth was negotiating for it. > in Mr JOHNSON - And if there was a leakThe age in the first place, why not another in the second case?  possible. With this transaction as it stands before us, and with the fact, which the papers prove, that our claim was jumped, the best thing we can do is to let the matter stand over. If we do so and deal direct with the owners of the land, we shall come in at bedrock, and have s> better proposition than this is. I feel very strongly on this matter. I do not hesitate to say that I have very grave suspicions. I want the House to believe that I am not imputing any motives to individuals here, but any man calmly reading these papers, and having the information that I have in reference to those gentlemen coming out here, can come to no other conclusion than that this thing ought to be left alone, and that if we want to negotiate for this property we should deal direct with the owner, or let Mr Lyons put up his cash ancl buy the property- a thing that he has not yet. clone. Mr Lyons is a very smart business man. Those gentlemen came here and. nt» doubt, they have their tongues in their cheeks at present over this proposition. They did not get an option over the property, or come from England to Australia, for the benefit of the Commonwealth. They - came out expressly",41

If anything was required to confirm my doubts it has been supplied by the facts put before the House by the honourable member for Grey. I understand from him, and take his word for it, until it is contradicted, and the contrary is shown to be the case, that prior to Messrs.

339,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The papers are available for every honourable member.,44
340,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I did not know until this afternoon that the question was to be submitted today. Certain papers have been printed' and circulated to honourable members, and upon those I relied. I am not bound to go to the Minister's office to inspect other papers when a State document is placed in my hands. I have a right to assume that that contains everything of consequence. I admit that the site would be a most desirable one to acquire, always assuming that we are satisfied that we are not being penalized as to price. There are certain objections to it, and certain advantages in its favour. It i's about two miles from the Bank of England, the Mansion House, and the Royal Exchange. The Aldwych site, which was previously'submitted to the House, and then alleged to be the best obtainable in London, ivas about a mile from the Bank of England, and the right honourable member for Swan, who is entitled to speak on these matters with some authority, urged that it was undesirable because the financial business of the Commonwealth could not be transacted at so great a distance from the centre of the money market. This site is quite three-quarters of a mile further west, and for that reason, from the point of view urged by the right honourable member for Swan, is even less eligible than was the Aldwych site. I admit that eligible - freeholds are not obtainable every day in London, and that, although certain disadvantages in regard to the transaction of the financial business of the Commonwealth in London may attach to this site, it has compensating advantages owing to the fact that it is situated so close to the great Imperial Government offices, and is undoubtedly very prominent. The building conditions connected with it render it also disadvantageous. There are other buildings, the Grand Hotel on the opposite corner of Northumberland Avenue, for instance, which completely overtop and overshadow the building at present on the site. We are told distinctly in the printed correspondence that it will be impossible, without buying out certain rights to - ancient light, to erect on this land a building of greater elevation than the existing one. Apparently, - the £198,000 is merely for the purchase of the site, subject to the lease of four years; and we may have to pay £220,000 or £230,000, as suggested by our own valuer, in order to get rid of the particular encumbrance to which he refers.",44
341,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That is, if we desired to start building straight away.",44
342,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Quite'so , or other« ise we should have to wait four years.",44
343,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is three vears and a half.,44
344,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That time would have to expire before we could pull a brick out of the building. In my opinion, the building, as shown in the photographs, is altogether unsuitable, both internally and externally, for Commonwealth purposes. It would require about two years to complete a suitable building, and, altogether, it appears to me that we are entering on a transaction the fruits of which will not be reaped for five or six years hence. I am strongly of opinion that we should first of all appoint a High Commissioner, house him in rented premises, even if we have to pay £5,000 or £6,000 a year rent, and allow him to wait an opportunity to purchase some eligible site. Under all the circumstances, I have resolved my doubts in a way which will compel me to vote against the proposition. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [8.42] - It is a good many years since I suggested in this House that there should be a Commonwealth building in London. At that time my intention was that the building should be in the financial centre. I have an idea that finance is government, and that government is finance; and I never dreamt for a moment that the building was not to be regarded as an investment. I shall conclude with a proposal; but, in the meantime, I desire to say that, when I look .at this matter from a business point of view, I feel that I am wandering in the golden land of dreams. In fact, it would appear that one of our Ministerial magicians has only to wave his magic wand in order to make intricate financial difficulties disappear. The complex problems of modern finance are simply forgotten in the indescribable fascination of the simple solution afforded by Australian financiers. Would any person invest his private money in such a transaction as that proposed ? We are the national trustees in this House; our constituents sent us here because they regarded us as the best men coming forward in qur various districts. If we put the money of the people of Australia into a venture that would not attract private money, we are not carrying out our trust, and are not fit to be here. What is this building for? The Minister of External Affairs has told us that the officer who occupies it will not have much to do in connection with finance-that it is in a centre to which thousands of people come to attend theatres. But what people do business at night-time when attending theatres ? I had hoped that this building was to be the head-quarters in London of the Australian National Postal Banking Department. I had hoped that our inscribed stock, consols, and various vestments would be offered to the British public for sums as low as £ 5 . I had hoped that English, Scotch, and Irish people, who had accumulated a little wealth, would be able to go to the Commonwealth building and buy consols, and that the money could be transferred here by bills of exchange, in order to carry on our industries. To-day, however, I heax that there will be no financial business done at the building. Why are we sending a High Commissioner to England? Is he merely to be a sort of representative of Australia? Have we not had enough of that with our Agents-General ? The Labour Party in this House have opposed borrowing; but if we pay £20,000 as a deposit on this building, and owe £178,000, does that mean a loan, or what does it mean? If this building were put up to auction, and did not bring sufficient to cover the £178,000, would the taxpayers of Australia be responsible for the difference? If so, then there is a loan to the Commonwealth at 4 per cent.; and the difference between per cent, and 4 per cent, on £1:78,000 is £890 annually, - which would represent the increased price we are paying for money, as compared with the States. Yet this is said to be the highest type of Australian finance. Is it any wonder that all over the world Australian public finance is the laughing-stock of financial men? The purchase money is £198,000, the rentals amount to £9,740, the estimated cost of repairs to the building is £46,000, and the estimated cost of a new building",44
345,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"What sort of building would it be? Mr KING O'MALLEY - That money would not provide the foundations of such a building as I should desire. I may say that I have had banking training in the United States, so that I know something about the ""game."" I do not think that the Government ought to pay more than private persons, or should run a business in order to enable private individuals to make fortunes. I understand that after Messrs. Gluckstein and Marks left Australia, and hurried through Canada to England, in order to get the option, the transaction was not completed until after Mr Beale went home. Is that so, or not ? If we add £46,000 for alterations to the present building, to the purchase money of £198,000, we have a total of £244,000 ; while, if we add £65,000, as the cost of the new buildin- ing, to the purchase money, we have a total of £263,000. Interest at 3^ per cent., taking into account the cost of alterations, amounts to £8,540, while, if we calculate the cost of the new building, the interest amounts to £9,205. In the parish of St. Martin's, where this building is, the rates are 6s. 8d. in the , £ i on the annua,! rental; and I desire to know whether the tenants will always have to pay those rates.",45
346,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Yes , until the end of their tenancy. Mr KING O'MALLEY - When the Commonwealth takes over the building, will the tenants still have to pay the rates ?",45
347,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Yes . Mr KING O'MALLEY - And will the Commonwealth always make the tenants pay the rates?,45
348,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,How do I know what the Commonwealth will always do? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Are the tenants liable for the rates ?,45
349,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Some of them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Fir e insurance will probably amount to at least 5s. in the £100 j and I desire to know whether the tenants are responsible for that?,45

352,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not think so; but they have to keep the building in repair. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Beside s 5 per cent, for repairs, a business man £ per cent, aside to replace the building at the end of 87 years.",46
353,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Bu the would not call upon the tenaaits to do that.

Is the sum of £9,74° gross or net rental?",46

355,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I do not know. Mr KING O'MALLEY - How would the value of the property be affected by an Imperial tax on unimproved land values ?,46
356,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That would depend on the tsx* * Mr 'KING O'MALLEY - What complentiful pensation has the Government promised give the present tenants for the determinaStock tion of their leases?,46
357,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,None . Mr KING O'MALLEY - How long on will it take to effect proposed repairs? What amount of interest will the Governdelay ment lose while repairs are being carried on?,46
358,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That depends upon the extent of the repairs. Mr KING O'MALLEY - At a cost of £244,000, the landlord paying everything, the money invested would not earn 2.1 per cent., while at a cost of £263,000, the turn would be only 1.18 per cent. Addneeds. ing £46,000 to £198,000, the return would be only 3.9 per cent., the tenants paying rates and taxes, &c.",46

Mr KING O'MALLEY - Speculators , in erecting a building on a site like this, put up premises which will produce the The Governare ment could not put up enough rooms to, get a larger rental. If £65,000 were spent on a new building, the return would be about 3.4 per cent, on the basis of the Is that a good investWe pay 3^ per cent, to borrow for at par in the open market.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - In addition to the advertisement, questions of cost and return are concerned, and buildings are reThe Equitable Buildings in Collins-street are a big in? vestment. At certain seasons of the year, when business is dull, money accumulates in the Australian banks, and, instead of it being loaned at low rates of interest to the Australian producers and business people, it is sent, by means of bills of exchange, to be deposited in London banks, where it will produce interest. This makes money in London, and most of this to money is utilized by being loaned out on Exchange "" collateral,"" callable at option at any time. The London banks must make up the interest they have to pay the deposits, and they must utilize the money in such a way that there will be no in getting it when the Australian banks demand it. It is loaned on "" call "" and "" call loans "" are speculative loans, or loans made to exchange houses or stock and share brokers. The glut of money in London generates wild speculation, while thousands of our Australian farmers and merchants perish for the want of sufficient recurrency to meet their legitimate business The Minister says that we can use the money which we have in the Bank of England to pay off part of this mortgage. Apparently, we are keeping £100,000 in the Bank of England when it could be utilized in Australia to produce £10,000,000 of credit. Very little money is needed to give a large amount of credit where you have the control and regulation of your money volume, and the management of your currency. The £100,000 now locked up in the Bank of England would give £10,000,000 of credit to the Australian producers, farmers, and business men, who, at certain seasons, are nearly perishing for the want of it. Yet the Minister says that the London buildings are not to be used as a financial institution ",46
362,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I did not say so. mentioned the terms as a way suggested for arranging for the balance. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We should erect the building in a financial part of London, where every man who has a sovereign to invest might see it as he passed, and go in and buy a consol.  in the city of London for the amount asked for the Trafalgar Square site. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is not necessary to buy a site today. London will last for another four or five years at least. If we send Home a first-class High Commissioner, possessing correct ideas in regard to Australian business requirements, he will keep his eyes open, and when he discovers a mortgage on a big property, will secure the equity, and obtain it. Captain Collins has been referred to as a financier, and so has Lord Jersey. With all respect to the latter, I do not regard him as a financial expert.",47
363,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"He belongs to a banking house. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He has no time to attend to the business of the bank. He may be a signer or a stamp licker to a man under him, but he has no banking experience. When the Globe Company was started by Whitaker Wright, many of the big lords in England went smash because they knew nothing about business. In the United States, financial men run these shows. The lists of big names on the directorates of English companies are ridiculous. I would think as much of Fleming as a financial authority, and would as soon have the opinion of a Yarrabanker on any financial question as that of some of these gilded roosters. My contention is that the Commonwealth will have to pay rates amounting to £3,247, insurance amounting to £ 1 6 3 , a sinking fund for renewals of £325, £487 for repairs, an0 - £4%7 for collection, making in - all £4,709. Deducting that amount from ;£9.7.4°, you get £5,031- Y called an investment. I admit that you may do the faking and fishy business. Lincoln once said, "" You may fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but not all the people all the time."" I therefore move, in view of the facts which I have laid before the HouseThat all the words after the word "" That "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" further consideration of a site ir» London be deferred to allow of such additional I information being furnished as will enable this Parliament to form an opinion of the value of the offer as a business proposition.""",47
364,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Dalley) [9.7] - The Ministry, in asking us to ratify this agreement, has taken up a remnant of the work of the Deakin Ministry, but has advocated the proposal with a warmth and zeal such as one would have expected only in connection with a proposition of its own. No Minister could have proposed this transaction more earnestly, or occupied more time ir> its defence, than did the honourable member for Boothby, though at the same time he took care to say that the question was not a party one. It is no thanks to him that it is not a, party question. The expenditure of £200,000 ofi the people's money is a people's question. The most severe attack on this proposal has come from the supporters of the Government. The honourable member for Grey .scarified it, and asked his fellow members to reject it. He also made a strong personal appeal to the Minister. He said that, though the Minister may have felt bound to bring the matter before the House, he was not required to fight so warmly for a remnant of the Deakin policy. There are one or two features in connection with this matter which I should like to emphasize. Tn the first place, I draw attention to the fact tihat we have a Labour Administration glorifying the possession of freehold. Ministers say, "" By all means let us secure a freehold in the City of London."" Yet as 1 private members they told us that there should be no such thing as freehold.",47
365,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The people should always get freehold, but never grant it.",47
366,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Accordin g to the Minister, while it is not right for individuals to have freehold, the Commonwealth should have it.  holds for ourselves. et this is",47
367,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Honourable members know their value. I wish I had more freehold. But while on Tuesday Ministers say that they do not believe in freehold, on Wednesday they advocate buying it.",47
368,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member is perfectly free to discuss the relative advantages of a freehold or a leasehold property for the purpose now under consideration, but he is not in order in discussnot ing generally the abstract question of the relative advantages or disadvantages of freeholds as against leaseholds.",48
369,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I did not intend, sir, to <£scuss the gerferal question. I merely desire to illustrate the anxiety of the present Ministry to obtain a freehold instead of a leasehold property.",48
370,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That question is not before the Chair.,48
371,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We have had before us a proposal to acquire a leasehold, and we now have submitted to us a proposition that the Commonwealth shall acquire a freehold. I shall not, however, pursue that phase of the question further.",48
372,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Does the honourable member think that we should have refused to submit this motion?,48
373,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The Government could not very well have refused to submit it, but the Minister of External Affairs might have refrained from earnestly advocating its adoption.",48
374,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I put the whole position before the House.,48
375,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable gentleman said that he did not think that we should secure a bargain, but that the price was reasonable, and that the sooner we closed-with the offer the better.",48
376,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I think so still.,48
377,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If that is not a. strong advocacy of the proposal to acquire this property I do not know what is. We are told that it is always well to secure your cage before you catch your bird; but in this instance I think we should first catch our bird-in the shape of the High Commissioner-and let him choose his cage. The High Commissioner to be appointed should be shrewd enough to pick the best cage, or, in other words, the most suitable site for offices for the Commonwealth. We are told that the Government are supported by a reliable authority in advocating the acquisition of this site. The only reliable authority to whom the Minister is able to refer, however, is the temporary representative of the Commonwealth in London, Captain Collins. As an illustration of his reliability in this regard, I would remind honourable membersthat some six months ago, when we had under consideration a proposal to acquire a leasehold in the Strand, Captain Collins reported that it was "" the most suitable site"" in London. We did choose that site, and today we have t.he same officer declaring that another, two miles away, is "" the most suitable."" Honourable members who are anxious to support the purchase of this property have not at their disposal information of a suffi ciently reliable character to justify their doing so. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Grey, we are not prepared at present to provide the whole of the purchase money, and we shall therefore have to resort to what is really a process of borrowing. The first Parliament of the Commonwealth declared itself strongly opposed to borrowing, and surely a Labour Ministry should not be the first Administration to thrust upon this Parliament a policy to which they have individually declared their opposition. If we purchase this property for £198,000, we shall have to finance at least £180,000 of the purchase money. We shall have to pay interest on that amount, and the course to be adopted means in effect raising a loan. I would ask the Prime Minister whether he has examined the schedule in the report presented by Mr Howard Martin showing the rents paid by the tenants of the present building. We are told that the site is the best in London. I have not had the privilege of visiting that great city, and have not met in this House any .one who knows his London as well as did Dr Johnson. The Attorney-General may know it ; but as I have not been there I propose to test the statement as to the value of the site by referring to the rents paid for shops and offices in the building. At page 4 of the official memorandum we have a schedule showing that a shop on the ground floor occupied by the Aerated Bread Company is let at a rental of £400 per annum. Could a f.hop in a busy part of Sydney or Melbourne be obtained for such a rental?",48
378,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"This shop is on the first floor, and the tenant pays rates and repairs and 15s. insurance.",48
379,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It would be impossible to obtain a shop in the busy part of Bourke street or Collins-street for double that tental. Why is it that only £ 4 0 0 per annum is paid for a shop said to be in the most suitable part of London? Mr 'BATCHELOR - The shop has an area - of only 234 superficial feet.,48
380,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Many shops in Collins ancl Bourke streets, for which more than £ 4 0 0 per annum is paid, have not so large an area.",49
381,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It would be impossible to have a large shop ort the site.,49
382,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"-That is so; the average depth of the land is only 44 feet. That is one reason why I am opposed to its purchase, and I am also opposed to it because I do not think that we should be warranted in incurring the proposed expenditure. I sun not satisfied that Captain Collins is - A reliable authority to deal with a matter of this kind. The honourable member for Grey said that the proposal suggested jobbery ; that the least he could say about it was that it was "" c r o n k . "" That means that the most he could say about it would be that it is "" a n infernal swindle."" We certainly doj not find the Lyonses, the Miukses, ancl the Glucksteins willing to give the Commonwealth a bargain. They do not usually allow a man to secure a bargain simply because they knew his father. They do business because it pays them to do it, and no doubt Messrs. Lyons and Company are prepared to unload this - property on the Commonwealth at a profit to themselves. We are told that if we select this site we shall secure a great ad- There vertisement. I am inclined to think that if we do acquire it we shall advertise our foolishness in jumping at an offer simply because it has the recommendationof a recent Ministry. The present Minister of External Affairs said that he knew nothing about London and simply took up the proposal as the work of his predecessor. It would be far better for him to withdraw the motion, pending the appointment of a High Commissioner, or until he is able to take a trip to London. He' might well make a visit of inspection during the recess rather tlian take, upon insufficient information, an action that may besmirch the name of a Ministry that is supposed to live for everything that is good and radical. Had he said that he could not take the responsibility of recommending the Parliament to agree to the purchase of this site until he had personally inspected 'it, I should have supported him, believing that he could in that way do far better work for the Commonwealth than by remaining in his office during the coming recess. I do not suggest that he is anxious to make the trip ; but having regard to the enormous expenditure which this proposal involves, I think that he might well make a. personal inspection of the property. We cannot make use of the site for the next three or four years. The building is in a dilapidated state, and, according to the experts, an immediate expenditure of manythousands is necessary to put it ""in repair. I have seen a photograph of the building ancl it reminds me of a Paddy's Market in Australia. All that I could see upon it was a placard advertising "" B o v r i l . "" The schedule submitted by Mr Martin does not show that it is occupied by leading business firms. If it is such a valuable site in the great city of London why is it used for comparatively insignificant business purposes)? The schedule shows that a suite of three rooms gives an estimated return of £ 7 5 per annum. In what building in Melbourne could such residential quarters be obtained for that rental? Everything seems to point to the value of the property being less than that which has been put upon it . The experts estimate that an expenditure of £ 4 5 , 0 0 0 on the present building would '-'be neces1 sary to make it suitable for public offices. The intention is that the Commonwealth office in London shall house, not only the High Commissioner, but the Agents-General of all the States, together with their staffs. would be a further charge of £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 for erecting a new building with an additional story, b(/t Ministers admit that before a ; -'new story could be added the consent of the adjoining owners must be - secured. That is another drawback. If this is to be such a splendid bargain for Australia, does the Minister mean to tell me that Messrs. Lyons and Company would be acting the part of hucksters ancl taking it all round the world? Would not the shrewd people of the shrewdest city in the world have snapped it up long ago? Are the business people of London asleep?",49
383,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Is Lyons the proprietor ?,49
384,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Lyon s has an option over the property. He is "" iobbing "" it . Tf it is such a fine site, and such a fine bargain, would the cutest business men in the world let Australia come in on such good terms? We threw out the other idea of a leasehold, refusing to pay so highly for that property, and on the same ground, I will vote for any proposition to destroy this motion. The Minister will be well advised to accept the suggestions made by members of his own party. They are not unanimous about it, nor is the Minister himself certain that it is a bargain. All that he can say is that he has taken over the work of a past Ministry. What call is there for him to do so? What right have the Government to ask the House to take over the work of the previous Government ?",49
385,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I say that the proposal has to stand on its own merits, apart from any Ministry.",50
386,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If the Minister is satisthough fied with it on its merits, he cannot shelter himself behind his previous statement that he knew nothing about it. I do not see much virtue in Australia going into the London market as a freeholder. I advocate the early appointment of the High Commissioner. Let this be part of his good work. If he is a shrewd man, he will bustle round London and will soon pick out a good site. I should not leave it to Captain Collins, who recommends us two sites in six months, both of them on unsuitable terms. The stated that he cabled for an independent valuation, and, according to his statement, the. independent valuers were the valuers for the Government of Great Britain ; but does he mean to say that Messrs. Lyons and Company, or Mr Martin, would not be aware of what those people were doing? Does he believe that valuers in London do not work in the same way as they work in Australia? We know how things are done here, and the mere employment of another valuer, therefore, proves nothing.",50
387,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Then , according to the honourable member, it is impossible to get a fair valuation in any circumstances.",50
388,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is impossible at this distance.,50
389,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Therefore , the Commonwealth, according to the honourable meinber, is bound to be "" had "" whatever it does.",50
390,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No . The Commonwealth should decide whether it wil l acquire a freehold property, and if it decided to do so, it would be good business for the Minister himself to take a trip to London. He could then secure a proper valuation, but he would not disclose who he was until his mission had been completed. It would 'be prudent for the House to refuse to pass the motion, not only on account of the shortage of money, but on account of the sudden increase of price, and the risk of the Commonwealth being plunged into a borrowing policy when there was no necessity for it.",50
391,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Grampians) [9.31] - Accordin g to one of the letters from Captain Collins, this site was offered by Messrs. Hampton and Sons for £ 1 8 0 , 0 0 0 , as a freehold, on 13th March, 1908. A little later, Captain Collins wrote that one of Messrs. Lyons and Company's agents had called upon him and stated that they had purchased the freehold from the. Prudential Insurance Company. That is the position as I understand it, and, alI had intended to support the purchase of this site, because I believed in it, yet, owing to the statements made by the honourable member for Grev and other statements which have been made, I feel that it would be wise for the Minister to ask leave to withdraw the motion until further particulars have been obtained, especially in view of the fact that the price has now been increased to £ 1 9 8 , 0 0 0 . The Ministry should consider that aspect of the matter most carefully. I do not wish to reflect upon them, nor, Minister so far as I can see, is there anything underhand in the transaction, but a certain firm appear to have been shrewd enough to see a large profit sticking out, and immediately stepped in and purchased the property.",50
392,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,They got the option over the property.,50
393,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"They are practically in the position of vendors. If the Minister will defer this question he can get a special report, and then the principals can approach the Government. That would be a, wise course to adopt. The honourable member for Dalley stated that Captain Collins had previously recommended the Strand site as the best site possible. I suppose at that time it was the best available, but not the best possible. I agreed with the proposal to 'lease that site, because it was the best available, and I say today that it is a magnificent site; although the one in Trafalgar Square now before us is far superior. It is absolutely necessary for us to recognise our responsibility, and no longer to procrastinate. I commend the Labour Ministry for submitting this proposal to us, because we have already deferred action too long. We have been losing, instead of gaining, population. We should appoint a High Commissioner, - and establish a London office. If the .ground floor were turned into a small exhibition of our agricultural, grazing, mineral, and fruit products it would attract attention, and, instead of everybody flocking to Canada, probably ai large percentage of the floating population of Great Britain who wish to better their positions would come to Australia. For that reason the Government should not allow any further delay, - although in view of the facts which I have mentioned we should defer action in this instance until fuller particulars can be mitted to the House. I want to see the - Government purchase a site somewhere in the locality. I do not think that if we searched the heart of London we could find - one more suitable. Although it is not in the financial centre, it is in one of the greatest arteries of the city. It is in the main centre to which all the population flocks for amusement at night. It is in the vicinity of all the theatres and play-houses. VVe could light up the ground floor at night to show what we can produce in Australia, and so attract the attention of would be settlers. That would be a valuable advertisement for Australia. According to the honourable member for Dalley, the rule generally is first to get the cage and then the bird, but in this instance the honourable member suggested that the procedure should be reversed, and I agree with him. We should appoint the High Commissioner first. Tn the meantime, while negotiations for the acquisition of a permanent site are proceeding, let the Government rent a building so that we could start on a small scale to advertise our products and resources. I want to support this proposal, but fuller and more exhaustive inquiries should be made, so lhat we may know that we are not paying more than we should pay, in view of the fact that the site was previously offered to us at a much lower figure. If the Minister would look at the matter from that point of view, he might well accept the amendment. I ask him to do so in the interests, not only of the people of Australia, but of the Government to which he belongs. We advocate the appointment of a High Commissioner and the purchase or erection of a building in London because we want to establish a bureau of information for the people of Great Britain who wish to come here, and whom we desire to see here. We want, not to continue to stagnate, but to progress. For that reason, if it had been shown that this was the lowest possible price, and if the site had not been offered to us previously for less, I should have supported the motion most heartily, because I do not think there is a better site available, nor do I know any other that I would choose in preference to it.",50
394,Mr DEAKI N,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Ballarat) [9.39] - It was mv misfortune that a sudden summons called me from the House at a time when, apparently, a view of this transaction was submitted, based upon some statements in the documents, and also upon some statesubments which have no foothold in the documents or anywhere else. It appeared to me unnecessary to speak earlier, because no statement could have been more ample or fairer than that made by the Minister of External Affairs in submitting the motion. He concealed nothing of the circumstances of the purchase, or of the character of the site, or of the consideration for the sum required for it.",51
395,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,He was very earnest in his advocacy of it.,51
396,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"He was earnest, and properly so, because it seemed to him that, regarded as a business proposition, this was an excellent undertaking for the Commoncatch wealth. In that, and no more, I cordially agree with him. No one pretends that this is a great bargain. No one pretends that the price asked is not a full price. We have yet to learn that it is more than a fair price, but we have also to learn why the Commonwealth should expect to get this or any other site below its value. The real question is whether the sum asked is above its value to us. Upon a passage in a letter, which is somewhat ambiguous, it has been insinuated that this particular property was in the hands of other agents prior to its being submitted by Messrs. Lyons. That is just a possible construction; but, as the Minister pointed out, there are two obstacles to that view. What Captain Collins says is that the site was first brought under his notice by Messrs. Hampton and Sons, who said that the total' frontage was 164 feet, with a ground area of 8,600 feet, and that they considered that an offer for the freehold of £180,000 would be accepted. It seems to me the most natural interpretation that this property was not actually in Messrs. Hampton and Sons' hands. Though they knew something of it, they did not know the frontage, but they knew the general area; and they gave an opinion as to the price that might be accepted by the owners.",51
397,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,They might be speaking of the frontage only to Northumberland Avenue.,52
398,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That would not apply to this property, which also has a frontage to Charing' Cross. Consequently, we are not certain that it was this whole property to which Messrs. Hampton and Sons referred. It appears to me that it was not in the hands of Messrs. Hampton and Sons, and, for all we know, may have been already in the hands of Messrs. Lyons, of whom it was said that they had purchased it within a month- a very vague phrase. We are not clear, however, that this was the property that was afterwards offered; and it appeared to be, so to speak, guess-work on the part of Messrs. Hampton and Sons, who were not the agents or vendors, but had some knowledge that the property was in the market.",52
399,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Surely Messrs. Hampton and Sons must have had some authority before they spoke as they did.,52
400,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I suggest that they had some knowledge, just as there are land agents in the city of Melbourne who have knowledge of properties which have not been placed in their hands. If Messrs. Hampton and Sons had had the property in hand, they would undoubtedly have submitted it at that, time, or immediately afterwards. But Messrs. Hampton and Sons do not appear again; and it is certain that they would not have retired in favour of Messrs. Lyons if they had seen a chance of getting the business. The fair inference is that they had no right to do business themselves, and merely made an assumption as to a price which might be accepted.",52
401,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,This property is not in the list which Messrs. Hampton and Sons submitted.,52
402,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am obliged to the Minister for that further testimony in the same direction. On that ambiguity, to build a suggestion that a property, which might have been obtained for £180,000 is now offered at £18,000 extra profit, is wandering far from, the purpose. question is not whether the property might have been got cheaper at an earlier date. It would be just as good an argument to say that the: property may become dearer if we now delay.",52
403,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It might be cheaper yet, because Messrs. Lyons might forfeit their option.",52
404,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"They might, of course ; but a vendor is not likely, in face of the valuations which we have obtained, to lower his price by anything worth mentioning. However, that is merely a contingency, which I do not think worth discussing. The question is whether' the priceproposed is a fair one, and the site the best available. The price suggested by the unauthorized agents was £i8q,ooo, and we are asked to pay £18,000 more.",52
405,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Thos e agents must' have had something to go on.,52
406,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Of course; just as I could give the prices of various properties in Melbourne, with which I have not the slightest business connection.",52
407,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,But the honourable member for Ballarat could not offer to sell those properties at a fixed price.,52
408,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No r did the unauthorized agents; they refrained from doing so, merely expressing an opinion that an offer for the freehold of £180,000 would be accepted, not by them but by some one else.",52
409,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,There is no doubt that those who obtained the option got it for less than the price we are asked to pay.,52
410,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I should assume that' is probable; there may be a very small margin, or no margin. As a matter of fact, the price asked by Messrs. Lyons at first, was, I think, £238,000, which was reduced to £230,000, and then lower still. But the question is whether the price now asked is unfair, having regard to all the circumstances of the situation. We have had the valuation of the Chairman of the Board of Valuators of London, who, we are informed, is of the highest reputation and standing; and his valuation is higher than the price it is proposed to pay. - Mr KELLY - That i's hardly so; he said the price, as between a willing buyer and a willing seller, would be £1.68,000.",52
411,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Bu the went ori to exThe plain afterwards that he meant a purchase for speculative purposes; and the words used, I am informed, have a technical meaning in London, and indicate an exceptional set of circumstances. They mean that two men meet each other, one eager to sell and the other eager to buy, and that, under such circumstances, bedrock price is reached.",52
412,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,No ; what is meant is the fair average price as between buver and seller.,53
413,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am told that in London the meaning is that I have indicated. I presume that if there were a willing seller and no buyer, the willing seller might come down in price; but when the business basis is reached, under the circumstances I have described, it means bedrock price. The valuator I have mentioned has given reasons for placing a higher valuation on the property than the sum we are offering, having special regard to the purposes of the Commonweath. Here we have a valuator of the highest standi n g ; and the suspicions which have been carelessly cast upon him are, in my opinion, not justified by the knowledge we possess. This valuator knew the purchaser and all the circumstances, and he deliberately advises and defends an offer of a much higher price. Then this Government, with a wise caution for which they deserve every credit, noticing these various explanations, and A'ery properly desiring to place themselves and the House in an impregnable position, obtained another from another high-class and independent valuator, with the result that the offer now being made was borne out What reason, then, is there for all those imaginings and suggestions which I understand have been spun in the chamber since dinner? These suspicions are built on mere surmise, and in the teeth of valuations by two honourable professional men, who stake their reputations on those valuations. But the most extraordinary thing of all is to find the honourable member for Grey associating, in some mysterious manner, with this purchase, the name of a manufacturer of this country, with whom he has had some passages of opposition. I think it very unfortunate that on so slender a basis, the honourable member should have connected that gentleman's name with the business.  does not deny that the two gentlemen I mentioned were working with Messrs. Lvons.",53
414,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I doubt it ; because those gentlemen and Messrs. Lyons are keen rivals in the city of London. The peculiar circumstance is that, during the months of these negotiations, while I have been stopped in the street, and in other wa.vs communicated with by many Australians who know London, and, while I have received dozens of letters from people in [85] London, recommending the present site, only two letters have objected to the present proposal. The strongest of those letters was written by Mr Beale  member deny that Messrs. Gluckstein and Marks are directors of Messrs. Lyons and Company ?",53
415,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not know anything about the relations of those particular firms, but have been told, I do not - know by whom, but on what I regarded as good authority, that Messrs. Marks and Messrs. Lyons are rivals and business competitors as caterers.  distinctly says that these gentlemen aredirectors in Messrs. Lyons' company.",53
416,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Of that I cannot speak; but I am told that they are rivals. However, whether they are rivals or colleagues does not matter; and I repeat that it happens that the strongest letter I received in opposition to the site now proposed, and in favour of the Strand site, happened to be from Mr Beale.  valuation included with the other documents?",53
417,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is a private letter, but I shall have no objection to show it to the honourable member if he desires. What we are faced with is the question whether the price offered is a fair price. If , instead of being parliamentary representatives of the people, we were simply directors of a company which proposed to invest part of its capital in suitable London buildings, I think, the testimony of two leading expert valuators like those I have mentioned would be sufficient to justify us in making the purchase.",53
418,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,We would never make it on Mr Martin's report.,53
419,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We are not dependent only on Mr Martin's report, because the Government very wisely obtained an entirely independent valuation from another expert valuator, whose report bears out the price now being offered.",53
420,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,-There is only one report from Mr Martin.,53
421,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In the papers submitted, but 'die Minister of External Affairs read the cablegram which he had sent to Captain Collins, and the reply he had received, giving the valuation of Messrs. Weatherall and Green, who do work for the British Government, and are valuators of high standing. That, as I say, was an independent valuation made without the knowledge of the other valuators; and it practically confirms the price now being offered.",53
422,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Did Mr Beale deal with the question of price?,54
423,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Not that I remember: I think his objection was almost entirely to the location. Amongst all the people who have criticised the site, and of the dozens who have communicated with me directly or induectly, all but two consider that the site now under discussion is better than that offered in the Strand. Do honourable members require other evidence that they are not making a bad bargain ? If so, let them take the lowest price which my colleague was able to obtain on offer from the London County Council, and reduce it to a freehold basis. The Aldwych site, though good in itself, is inferior having regard to Commonwealth purposes.",54
424,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is a mile nearer to the city.,54
425,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is a better site, cording to the late Treasurer.",54
426,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Then I have found three authorities, out of many dozens, who are of that opinion. As I was pointing out, if the Strand site be put on a freehold basis, it will be found to be dearer than the Trafalgar Square site. Unler those circumstances how can it be said that we are making an unreasonable bargain? I do not say that we have got anything remarkably cheap, because I regard the price offered as the full price; but the site is worth it to the Commonwealth of Australia. As to the Strand site being nearer to the city, I questioned a number of authorities on this matter in London, and was told that in these days of taximotors, a distance like half-a-mile or a mile is nothing. The property in question is less than three-quarters of a mile from the City.",54
427,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I was alluding to its value, not to its eligibility. this is the better site.",54
428,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Value s do not rise as one proceeds from Trafalgar Square to the City. In London values are high in certain localities. For instance, they are high in the City,, and again at Trafalgar Square. It wpuld take too long to enumerate the reasons why in the future the Commonwealth will need a City office. When it undertakes its full financial obligations, it will certainly require one. But it already needs a general office, which should not be located in the C it y ; such as'ite would be useless for most of the purposes we have in view in establishing Commonwealth offices in London.",54
429,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Why ?,54
430,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The two great centres in London are, first, the City proper, in which the financial transactions of the Kingdom and of a great part of the world are carried on, where it is most desirable for those engaged in finance to have an office. The other is the district about Trafalgar Square and Parliament House, where most of the public Departments, with which the High Commissioner must keep in touch, now cluster. Trafalgar Square is the great centre of populous and travelling London. It is close to the Charing Cross railway station, and to the station of the new "" Twopenny "" tube, which daily absorbs thousands more than any of the other stations on that line. If you wish for a place where the public eye can be caught and the popular mind impressed, ac- where you will come into touch with the masses of London and its visitors, go to Trafalgar Square.",54
431,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,What a grand auctioneer the honourable and learned member would have made. ,54
432,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I accept the remark as a compliment. My capacities are so few that the discovery of another is welcome. There remains the fact on which the honourable member for North Sydney built his case, that the conformation of the site is most inconvenient.",54

434,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,We can erect a building six or seven stories high.,54
435,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,There are the rights to light to be considered.,54
436,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I understand that the I admit that present building is six stories high.,54
437,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There are five stories above the ground floor, and a basement.",54

439,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I think that there are only three to be consulted, two banking companies and the proprietors of the Victoria Hotel. They do not at present get light from the direction of this building. On a frontage of 200 feet, varying in depth from 40 to 80 feet, a building seven stories high would give a consideiable amount of accommodation, especially if we placed our financial offices in the city.  made up of two frontages.",54
440,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is measured round a curve, but the price asked for it is not dear, on the showing of two independent valuers, and in comparison with that of an equal area at Aldwych.",55
441,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There wil l be a space of only 8,600 square feet on each floor.",55
442,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"W it h seven floors, each containing 8,600 square feet, we could provide for the needs of the States and the Commonwealth, so far as immigration and the purposes of central offices are concerned. To indicate what the Premier of New South Wales thinks of a Cannonstreet site, which, if not in the heart of the City, is in its neighbourhood",55
443,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The building occupied there by the New South Wales Government is like a greengrocer's shop.,55
444,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That is so; but its position is much nearer the City than that of the proposed site. Yet the Premier of that State wrote to me on the 5th November lastThis Government has had under consideration the question of removing the offices of the Agent-General for New South Wales in London from their present location, 123-125 Cannonstreet, to a site more in consonance with existing requirements, and in view of this fact, I have the honour to inquire if you are now in a position to furnish me with information regarding the situation of the proposed Commonwealth offices in the city named, and, at the same time, state whether or not the Federal Government is prepared to provide this State with accommodation in the premises referred to when available. For your guidance in considering this matter I may say that New South Wales would require about six or seven rooms, with a window on the ground floor capable of being utilized for advertising purposes and facing the chief street. He received an encouraging reply, and has communidated with the present Govern the ment, asking if they endorse my letter.",55
445,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,There is nothing very definite in what he says.,55
446,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The point is that he satisfied to move from Cannon-street to site further from the City, and is ready House. to occupy part of the Commonwealth that building. It is highly desirable that the offices of all the Agents-General of the States shall be in the Commonwealth building. There should be unity [ 8 5 ] -2 tralian representation in London. The Premier of Victoria has also stated that, notwithstanding that his State has acquired premises in Aldwych, he would be prepared to consider the advisability of occupying offices in a Commonwealth building. That offer will probably stand good if another site is chosen, but as the Victorian building will shortly be completed, the State authorities should have early intimation as to our probable action. There is a measure of urgency in connection with the settlement of this question. Without desiring to paint the attractions of the proposed site in rose colour, or to exaggerate its importance or value, I say that all who know London will admit that it is central,, and unsurpassable for our purposes. The Mall will be extended to its full breadth to enter Trafalgar Square right opposite the site, which, if it suffers at all, now does so, because on the opposite side of Parliament-street the buildings are old and unsightly, having behind them another series of similar structures, which' will be swept away when the Mall is extended. The Commonwealth building will then be a conspicuous object from all quarters, in a neighbourhood through which there is an immense traffic. That we are asked a price which is not extravagant is shown by the fact that the present building produces a rental of £ 9 , 7 . » 0O and we can obtain the necessary overdraft at 4 per cent. However, I understand that the Prime Minister has information that in another place a decision adverse to the ratification of trie agreement has been come to, and that will spare honourable members a process of conviction to which they are rapidly submitting.",55
447,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Robertson) [10.8] - Notwithstandin g the announcement of the honourable member for Ballarat that the Senate has rejected this proposition, we are bound to consider whether site is a suitable one for our purpose. Honourable members seem to think that the decision of the Senate will not be reversed; but if we come to the conclusion that this is site should be secured, no doubt the sena sible Itfiing will, be done by the other Those who know London say this is a suitable site, and the description of it given by the ex-Prime Minister should commend it to all who take notice of his words. He has seen the site, and in Ausknows from beginning to end all that has taken place in regard to it. It is about time that a High Commissioner was appointed. It is contended by the Minister controlling Colonial Affairs in London that, although he has made representations to the Australian Government in respect of many matters, no action has been taken, and there can be no doubt that Australia is greatly disadvantaged by the nonappointment of a High Commissioner. It has been urged that, as a financial proposal, the motion is objectionable. From all points of view, however, I fail to see that the transaction would not be a profitable one. It is proposed to acquire the property for £198,000, and interest on the balance of the purchase money at 4 per cent, would be something like £8,000, whereas the revenue from rents receivable would be £9,740 per annum. VVe should thus have a balance of over £1,700 in favour of the Commonwealth. Assuming that the present buildings were considered unsuitable for the purposes of the Commonwealth, and a new structure were erected at a cost of £127,000, we should have to pay further interest amounting, at 4 per cent., to £5,080, or a total of £13,080. On the other hand, the present tenants are paying - within a few pounds of £10,000 per annum, so that, on that basis, we should secure offices suitable to the requirements of the Commonwealth at a cost of little more than £3,000 a year. That would not be an excessive rental. It must be remembered, however, that the States of the Union would rent offices in the Commonwealth buildings, and, as they would doubtless be prepared to pay a fair proportion of the cost of maintenance, the expenditure that would accrue to the Commonwealth would not be more than about £2,000 per annum. I fail to believe that in any of the big cities of Australia we should be able to secure for anything like that rental business premises suitable for our requirements. To obtain a desirable building in London at that figure is a proposition that commends itself to me.  of London.",55

449,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"At all events, the site is in the centre of a very populous part of London. It is an imposing situation. Nelson's monument is in the vicinity, and the present building is surrounded by many public institutions. There is also plenty of open space. I do not profess to be a judge of the situation, but I know it, and should say that it is most suitable fos our requirements. Although it may not be actually within the City of London, it is surrounded by a population numbering some millions. It is said that London is empty after September in each year, although one can still find millions roaming its streets. This site is in the centre of the business and official part of London, and I think that we ought to acquire it. Honourable members in another place have thrown out the proposal, but, on further consideration, they might be disposed to reverse their decision if this House agreed to the motion.",56
450,Dr LIDDE LL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Hunter) [10.15] - I do not intend to occupy the attention of the House for more than a few minutes, since the announcement made by the honourable member for Ballarat has practically knocked the bottom out of the debate. It is evident, however, that there is in this Parliament considerable dissatisfaction in regard to the way in which information is prepared for our use. It appears to me that many honourable members are not satisfied that this proposal has received the careful attention that so great a business transaction demands. We have not in London to-da.y any one upon whom we can implicitly relyto carry on our business arrangements there.",56
451,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That remark is entirely unjustifiable.,56
452,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The opinion I have expressed is entertained by more than one honourable member, and it is unfortunate that such should be the feeling. I make these remarks as leading up to the point that, even if the motion is not carried, some good will have been done by its submission if, as the result of the debate, the absolute necessity for the early appointment of i«. High Commissioner is clearly shown. We shall have no satisfaction until we have in London a representative who is prepared to take upon his own shoulders the responsibility for vast Commonwealth undertakings - until we have there some one of abilitv and skill, on whom we can rely.",56
453,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Would the honourable member be prepared to approve of the actions of a High .Commissioner?,56
454,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I should be prepared to trust a High Commissioner, where I should not be prepared to have confidence in a gentleman who was simply the head of one of our Departments. I do not think that any one man, isolated as our present representative is, and having comparatively limited experience, should have thrust upon him so great a responsibility. I have, nothing to say. as to his ability to f u l f il the duties of the position that he occupies, but it is to be regretted that he should be in London alone, and have to rely, so to speak, upon a casual tap on the shoulder from Lord Jersey, or some one else, for support of his recommendations. We find him cabling information that Lord Jersey thinks that this is a desirable site, but has Lord Jersey sent to the Government anv official cable message? No. He has simply expressed an opinion to . Captain Collins, and we are called upon to accept that as sufficient justification for this proposal.",56
455,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,lor d Jersey has been consulted throughout these negotiations.,57
456,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Quite so; but his view is not so valuable as would be that of a man whose opinion would carry with it a heavy responsibility. As to the suitability of the site, we must remember that we have to carry on in London two differing classes of business. We must have, as it were, a shop windowa building to which the casual tourist and the traveller will be - and also an establishment in the city, where business of more moment may be transacted'. We should have suchan estabUshment somewhere in the vicinity of the West End. I am not wholly satisfied that this is the best site available. If we examine the map, we find that it is in a sort of backwash - The visitor to London, standing in Trafalgar Square, or on the steps of the Grand Hotel, sees a great stream of vehicles passing to and f r o , and rendering it very difficult for pedestrians to cross from one side to the other. It is because of this heavy vehicular traffic that very little business is done by the shop's in the vicinity. The schedule to the report supplied by Mr Martin shows that the building contains district messengers' offices, a shop occupied by the Aerated Bread Company, and some small offices. It is on the wrong side of the road for nusbess purposes. It is down the hill, and somewhat out of the way. It is certainly in a part of London to which people go when they wish to book their passages to various parts of the world. Shipping companies have established offices in - the West End for the convenience of tourists, and many people visit that quarter of the city. I shall say nothing about the value of the property, believing that on that phase of the question we should.have the advice of responsible officers.",57
457,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is a very difficult matter to decide at this end.,57
458,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I think that the whole question has been somewhat hurriedly dealt with, and that the information at our disposal is insufficient. The motion has had what may be described as double barrelled Ministerial support. We have had it submitted ' by a member of the present Administration, and supported by the leader of the late Ministry. The speech delivered this evening by the honourable member for Ballarat was _ the most plausible to which I have ever listened; I do not think that anything could have been cleverer.' The honourable member for Grey brought certa'in facts under our notice, and I must compliment him upon the way in which he handled the material at his disposal. Having listened to his speech, it ' would take more than the eloquence of the late Prime Minister to convince me that there is not in connection with this proposal something in the nature of What I have seen recently associated with other public transactions. attracted Mr FISHER - As the matter is dead, might I suggest that the honourable member should not discuss it further. Parliament, and not only one Chamber, must approve of the agreement.'",57
459,Dr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is just possible that the decision of another place may be reversed. I have heard quite sufficient tonight to convince me that it would be unwise to support the motion, and I should prefer to support the amendment. Debate (on motion by. Mr FISHER) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.24 p.m.",57
