1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. ""W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. PUBLIO WORKS COMMITTEE. Motion (by MT . HUGHES), by leave, agreed toThat, in accordance, with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Aet, the following members be appointed members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, viz.:- Mr Atkinson, Mr Bamford, Mr Gregory, Mr Maokay, Mr.  PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE.

2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"How many representatives had the Opposition before?  reduce our representation. No matter how they may protest, the members of the Farmers party constitute only the tail of the Ministerial party. ' Mr STEWART - Is the honourable member in order in referring to members of the party to which I belong as the tail of another party?",19
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I assume that the honourable member did not intend to use the term offensively, but if it is so regarded, I ask him to withdraw it.  the honourable members of the Farmers f arty; I was speaking metaphorically, f it will please them better, I shall call them the "" head"" of the Ministerial party. Had there been a decrease in the strength of the Opposition party, I would not have objected to the lessening of its representation on this Committee, hut we have, pn the contrary, increased our strength. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that after the 30th June next there will be only one Labour senator.",19
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"What was the Opposition representation on the Committee on behalf of the Senate?  eapnot make a bus-horse of Senator Gardiner, by appointing him to every Committee merely to secure representation for the Opposition.",19
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Perhaps , then, it would be better to postpone the consideration of the motion, to see whether some understanding can he arrived at.  done. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That the consideration' of the motionhe postponed until Wednesday next.",19
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [11.8] - When the Works Committee and the Accounts Committee were first appointed, several .years ago, the Opposition was given a representation of two on the Works Committee and of three on the Accounts Committee, and I told the "" Whip "" that it would not he fair on this occasion to give us only two members on the Finance Committee. Even without the representatives of the Corner party, the Ministerialists will have a clear majority on the Committee, because they will have at least two Senate representatives.",19
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It must not be forgotten that we number thirty-eight, while you have only twenty-five members in your party. Motion agreed to; debate adjourned. V ISIT OF THE PRINCE OF WALES. will ADDITIONAL SITTING DAY.",20

I make the intiof mation now, so that honourable members who, during the week end, may be going their homes in other States, may have an opportunity to make their arrangemembers ments accordingly.",20
9,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,You r proposition will that the House shall sit next Tuesday week.,20
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Yes . TARIF F DISCUSSION.,20
11,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"There are some persons in Queensland who wish to be in Melponed bourne when the Tariff is under discusbe sion. Therefore, I ask the Prime Minister to look at the notice-paper before making a statement next Wednesday, that he may then inform the House what business he expects to get through before *he Tariff is discussed.",20
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall certainly do that. I have already informally conwhether sulted with the Leader of the Opposition on the subject, and I shall, as soon possible, tell the House what we want get done. WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT.",20
13,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Is it the intention of the Government to continue in force the provisions of the War Precautions Act, which, according to the wording the Act itself, are to operate months after the declaration of peace? Is it intended that the Act shall force until three months after peace with landed on Gallipoli is commemorated by Bulgaria and Turkey has been declared? The general understanding was that it would cease to have effect three months after peace with Germany was declared.",20
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Act itself fixes the tinivfor its determination as the happening of a certain event, which --annot be brought about by honourable members, and certainly not by me. It must remain in force until that event has happened, or until legislation has been passed to amend it. Whether the Government apply its provisions is a different question; and it will be for the honourable member to draw attention to any exercise the powers conferred by it to which he of the may take exceptidn. of the ' ANZAC TWEED INDUSTRY.",20
15,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I have given notice my intention to move the formal adjournment of the Hou?e. this morning, to but at the desire of the Government, and in recognition .of the wish of honourable generally that the Repatriation Bill thail be proceeded with, I shall postbe pone action until Wednesday next. - Mr SPEAKER - In the letter which the honourable member has addressed to me, giving notice of his intention to move * the formal adjournment of the House, he speaks of his desire to discuss a definite matter "" of urgent public importance."" If action upon this matter can be postfrom day to day, some doubt may thrown upon the urgency of it.",20
16,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I think that the consideration of the Repatriation Bill is the so more urgent matter of the two. ANZAC DAY.  I shall be perfectly in order in what I am about to say, or whether I may as not be anticipating the remarks of the to Prime Minister, but I wish to draw attention to the fact that today there is being celebrated in Melbourne the landing of Australian troops on Gallipoli. I .should like the Prime Minister to make some statement in recognition of that fact. As Parliament is sitting, members of cannot join in the general celebrations until three taking place elsewhere.",20
17,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The anniversary of have the day on which Australian - troops the Commonwealth by the making of it a public holiday. In Victoria, however, it falls this year on the day appointed for the eight hours' celebration, and as it was thought that the clashing of the two festivals might not conduce to harmony, and would not give the public a proper opportunity to express their appreciation of the deeds of the ANZACs, it was arranged to celebrate the landing today instead of next Monday.",20
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It has been privately suggested to me by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) that we might pay our tribute of respect to the memory of the heroes who fell at Gallipoli by rising and remaining silent for the space of one minute. I had anticipated that the Leader of the House would perhaps have asked leave to move a motion. I will, however, ask honourable members to stand silent in their places for a few moments as a tribute to the memory of the gallant heroes who fell at Gallipoli, and as a mark of honour and respect to those who still survive that memorable landing. Honourable members rose and remained standing accordingly.",21
19,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"In New South Wales ANZAC Day is to be celebrated on Monday. The master retailers have decided to keep their premises open on that day, and to ignore the celebrations. Has this Parliament or Government any power to say that they shall not be permitted to do as they intend upon the holiday?",21
20,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I do not know whether we have. I shall look into the matter. NA DEPARTMENT. ALLOWANCE POST OFFICES.,21
21,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"for Dr EARLE PAGE) asked the Postmaster-General, noticeHow many keepers of allowance post offices have signified their intention of resigning, have resigned, their positions since January, 1920?",21
22,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answer to the honannum orable member's question is as follows:Two hundred and fifty-seven. The greater proportion of the resignations was due to the occupants of the positions leaving the district and to transfers of businesses in conjunction with which the post offices are conducted. The total number of non-official offices in the Commonwealth is 7,233.",21
23,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On 15th April the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Austin Chapman) asked1. Is it a fact that the Deputy Postmaster-General for New South Wales has intimated his intention of closing some of the post offices in country centres in that State, on the plea that those at present in charge are declining to continue the work at the low salaries offered? 2. Does he approve of this action? I furnished an interim reply on that occasion, and am now able to supply the following detailed answers:1. Yes. 2. Payment for control of an allowance office is based on the volume of business transacted. In some cases demands are made for payment in excess of that justified, and in such event the persons interested are asked to assist the Department in obtaining the services of a suitable person at the justified rate of payment. During the past two years thirteen sueh requests were made by the Deputy Postmaster General of New South Wales, but it was necessary only in one case to finally close the office. NAVA L RADIO SERVICE.",21
24,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeSeeing that the members of the Naval Radio Service are not to receive the war gratuity, although they were engaged on important defence work in Australia during the war, is it the intention of the Government to grant them a war bonus, the same as received by other Commonwealth Government servants?",21
25,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The pay of the Naval Radio Service was fixed on 1st July, 1916, and was revised on 1st July, 1918, and again on 1st July, 1919, having regard to the increased cost of living. In these circumstances it is not the intention of the Government to grant a war bonus. SUB-COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, BROKEN HILL . upon Mr BLUNDELL asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Sub-Collector at or Broken Hill was classified as a 3rd Class Subthe 1st Collector in the year 1.907? 2. Was the minimum salary for a sub-collector fixed by the classification at £380 per in the year 1907? 3. If so, was Alexander David Henry appointed or transferred to the office of SubCollector at Broken Hill in the year 1907, and paid by the Commonwealth the .salary of £335 per annum, which was £45 below the minimum salary fixed for such office? 4. Is it a fact that for a period of six years and ten months Alexander David Henry waa not paid by the Commonwealth the minimum salary fixed for the office of a 3rd Class SubCollector ?",21
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The information is being obtained. SENIOR CADET TRAINEES.,22
27,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Minister repreceived senting the Minister for Defence, notice Whether .there is any travelling allowance made or are railway tickets provided for youths who have to attend compulsory drills?",22
28,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is presumed that the above question refers, to trainees of Senior Cadet age. Railas follow:way tickets are not issued, nor are any allowances made, except in the case of years Senior Cadets proceeding to rifle ranges for the purpose of musketry, when rail tickets are issued. Attendance at ordinary parades does not, in the great jority of cases, involve any travelling. EXPORT OF SUPERPHOSPHATES.",22
29,Mr FENTO N,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether it is true, as reported, that he has decided to allow the export of surplus superphosphates from Australia to New Zealand? 2. If so, have Australian users of this fertilizer been secured against any riser in prices? 3. What quantities has the Minister allowed to be exported?",22
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are .as follow :1. The supplies of superphosphate are dependent upon the amount of phosphate rock imported. The Government have kept a very careful cheek upon supplies, and export of superphosphate has been prohibited u n t i l we are assured that Australian requirements are being full y provided for. The Government of New Zealand, for some months past, have been pressing us. to permit the export of superphosphate to that country, as their stocks were completely exhausted, and they depend upon Australia for supplies. We are now permitting a limited quantity to go to New Zealand, but it is impossible to say what quantity will be exported, as it depends upon the consumption in Australia and the quantity of phosphate rock imported. Up to the present, permits have been granted for 900 tons. 2. Owing to the proposals of the Government to vest the necessary powers in this Parliament having been defeated at the recent referendum, the power to fix prices is in the hands of the States. 3. See answer to No. 1. TAXATION. REVENUE FROM: ABSENTEES AND COMPANIES-TOTALISATO R DIVIDENDS.",22
31,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Acting Treasurer, upon notice I. What is the total amount of revenue refrom absenteesand from companies upon under land taxation? 2. What is the total amount of revenue received from absentees and companies registered outside Australia under income taxation?",22
32,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are 1. The total received from absentees for the 1910-11 to 191S-19 inclusive is £515,701. Separate statistics are not compiled in respect of land tax paid by companies. 2. The total received from absentees for the mayears 1915-16 to 1918-19 inclusive is £1,172,961. The information is not available in respect of companies registered outside Australia.",22
33,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"for Mr JACKSON) asked the Acting Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether his attention has been drawn to the notice in the press, on the 21st April, regarding the imposition of a tax of 13 per cent, on totalisator moneys available for dividends? 2. Does the Government regard totalisator investments as a lottery in the same maimer as Tattersall's tickets? 3. Is the imposition constitutional? 4. If so, will the Government bring in a Bill to compel all racing clubs in Australia to install a totalisator service? 5. If not, does the Government intend to tax betting tickets in the same proportion, so that all persons investing money on races will be placed on the same footing? 6. Whether, in view of the alleged unfairness of the impost as proposed, the Government will delay the date of commencement of collection of the tax, so that honourable members may have an opportunity of discussing the matter?",22
34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The Commissioner of Taxation has decided that totalisator investments are a lottery within the meaning of section 7 of the Income Tax Act 1919. 3. Yes. 4. The Commonwealth has not the necessary power. 5 and 6. The Government will eonsider these matters. NA MEMORIAL S TO FALLEN . - Mr Ryan asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon 'notice I. Whether it is the intention of the Government to use Australian marble in the erection overseas of memorials, to Australian fallen 'soldiers? 2. Will the material used in the erection of such memorials be all Australian? 3. Will the workmen employed in the of erection of such memorials",22
35,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"The question of the erection of memorials to commemorate the deeds of the Austravernment, lian Imperial Force is being considered by the Government, and it is hoped make an announcement at an early date. The construction of the divisional memorials was, however, taken in hand whilst the troops were still in France, being the desire of members of the Australian Imperial Force to take part in the actual work. TANUNDA CLUB .",23
36,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether he intends to inform the House what are the reasons for the Government's fusal to allow the Tanunda Club to re-open? 2. If so, what are they?",23
37,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,I would refer the honourable member to my reply to a similar question asked by him yesterday. COAL SUPPLIES . DISTRIBUTION IN VICTORIA.,23
38,Mr CHANTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"the Prime Bank Minister, upon notice I. Does the' Federal Government still control the receipt and distribution of coal supplies to the residents of Victoria? 2. If so, is it a fact that the distribution of coal is confined only to those controlling lic utilities and manufacturing industries? 3. Is it a fact that retail fuel dealers complaining that they cannot obtain coal supplies for the use of private householders? 4. Is it a' fact that some dealers who have stocks of coal in hand state that the authotween rities will not allow them to supply it to housenot holders ? 5. If the rationing of coal is to continue, will the Prime Minister make arrangements by which private householders may obtain coal, seeing that supplies to them are claimed equally as necessary and meritorious as are those to manufacturing and other industries? FORCE., Mr HUGHES - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o llow :1, 2, 3, and 4. Yes. 5. The matter will receive the consideration of the Government. NA EMPLOYEES.",23
39,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"for Mr ANSTE Y) work asked the Minister for Trade and Cusbe Australians? toms, upon noticeAre the employees of the Produce Branch of the Agricultural Department in Victoria employed and paid by the Commonwealth Goor are they partly employed and paid by the Commonwealth Government and to the State Government of Victoria?",23
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"The employees of the Produce Branch of the Agricultural Dei t partment of Victoria are employed and paid by the State. The Commonwealth, however, reimburses the State a portion of these officers' salaries in respect of work performed in connection with the administration of the Commerce and Quarantine Acts. WAR SERVICE HMS. reOPERATIONS OF COMMONWEALTH BANK .  the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) asked1. On what date did the Commonwealth Bank agree with the Minister for Repatriation to administer certain sections of the Commonwealth War Service Homes Act? 2. On what date did the Commonwealth Bank commence to build war service homes? 3. On what date did the Commonwealth have the first war service home completed ? 4. How many war service homes have been built to date under agreement with the Commonwealth Bank? 5.

Whether the Prime Minister will lay on the table of the House copies of the agreements of sale of the 1917-18, 1918-19, and 1919-20 wool clips between the Central Wool Committee and the Imperial Government? 2. Will the Prime Minister also inform the House(a) The nature and personnel of the representation of the Central Wool Committee in England with respect to re-sales of wool by the Imperial authorities? (6) The quantity of wool re-sold, the amount received from re-sales with l-espect to each clip, showing-(a ) the Imperial Government's quota, and (6) the Central Wool Committee's quota on behalf of the Austra1 Ian - wool - growers f (c) What amount of money has the Central Wool Committee in hand from re-sales of wool and otherwise for disbursement amongst the Australian wool-growers; when is the next disbursement likely to be made; and, approximately, the total amount and the amount per cent, to the individual growers? I am now able >to furnish the following information:1. In reply to a question by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) yesterday, I laid on the table copy of cablegrams constituting the contract between the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments in regard to the purchase of the Australian wool clips 1916-17, 1917-18, 1918-19, and 1919-20. 2. I now lay on the table the remainder of the information desired by the honourable member for Echuca. The following papers were sented :Customs Act-Regulation s Amended-Statu tory Rules 1920, Nos. 50, 55. Wool Clips-(Lette r of Sir J. M. Higgins, Chairman of the Central Wool Committee, dated 10th March, 1920, respecting the cablegrams, &c, constituting the contract between the Imperial and the Commonwealth Governments regarding the purchase of Australian Wool Clips, and other matters connected therewith. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL. In Gommittee (Consideration resumed from 22nd A p r i l , vide page 1478) : > Clause 24 - Amendment withdrawn and clause agreed to. Clause 25 agreed to. Clause 261. Each Board shall be charged with the duties of(a) determining whether the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces in fact resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces, and in the case of incapacity the nature and extent thereof; (6) determining whether the death or incapacity of a person enlisted or appointed for active service in connection with naval or military preparations or operations in fact resulted from his employment in connection with those preparations or operations;",23
41,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Illawarra ) [11.29] - I desire to raise a question with respect to the phrase, "" in fact resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces."" I would like to see some more accurate description of the ground upon which soldiers may be entitled to pensions and benefits. Every honourable member must have received scores of refusals from the Department to deal withcases of merit merely because the in j u r y to the party concerned was stated not to have resulted fro m warlike operations. W it h respect to this Bill , while the phraseology is a little different from that in the original Act, it appears that the interpretations of the officials will be much the same. There are many men who were accepted for service abroad, and who were apparently in fit condition. Under the strain of war service, howPAPERS. ever, disabilities developed, and, upon pre- their return to Australia, they were unable to earn a living, or to earn as good a living as before their departure for the Front. In stating their case for relief, they are now met by the medical report that the in j u r y or complaint which has developed is not due to warlike operations. The wording of the clause before us seems to make it much more difficult for them to obtain relief.",24
42,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,The provision in clause is much wider than the wording of the Act.,25
43,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,The clause provides that a member of the Forces must put his finger on an occurrence which happened during the period of his service in the Australian Imperial Force as something which has resulted in his present incapacity. But how can a man whose affection or disease has actually developed during his period of service with the Australian Imperial Force put his finger on any occurrence during that period of service as being such as to lead to the gradual growth of his infirmity ? The way ought to be made easy for relief to be obtained by any member of the Australian Imperial Force who has come back incapacitated because of the conditions under which he has laboured during his period of service.,25
44,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Darling Downs-Min ister for Works and Railways) [11.32] The existing Act provides for relief being given where the incapacity or death of a member of the Australian Imperial Force - has resulted from his employment in connection with warlike operations; but on occasions death or incapacity has been brought about, not as the result of anything in connection with warlike operations, but as the result of happenings during the term of his period of employment. The wording of the clause is expressly intended to cover occurrences not necessarily in connection with warlike operations. It really extends the provision in the Act. It will enable a pension to be granted in cases which the Act does not cover. Assistance is to be given where the death or incapacity of a member of the Australian Imperial Force has resulted from an occurrence happening during the period when he was a member of the Forces.",25
45,Mr GREGORY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Dampier) [11.34] It is purely a matter of administration, but while we are discussing a provision of this nature it is well to let those who are likely to administer it gain some idea as to what Parliament desires. I had before my notice some time ago the case of a miner who, before enlisting, was quite capable of following his employment, but after spending a couple of years in the trenches in France, he returned to Australia absolutely crippled with rheuthe matism. The Pensions Department declined to give him any pension, on the ground that he had suffered from rheumatism before enlisting. That was an administrative act, and I do not see how we can make the Statute clearer, because the determining factor in every case must be the Board; but in this instance I had to do that to which I always take particular objection- I had to bring the matter under the attention, of the Pensions Department, and point out that surely thia man's incapacity must have resulted from his employment in connection with warlike operations. Owing to my representations, he.received a small pension. However, that is not the way in which the Act should be administered.",25
46,Mr WATKINS,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Once a medical officer has passed a man into the Forces, and certified that he is fit to go to the Front, should not the military authorities assume every responsibility for him?",25
47,Mr GREGORY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"But we must leave a certain amount of discretion to the Board. I do not see how the wording of the clause can be altered with advantage, because we may throw upon the Board the onus of granting pensions to undeserving persons. However, it should be aware of the fact that Parliament desires this provision to be dealt with, not harshly, but humanely and sensibly.",25
48,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Yarra) [11.36] - I prefer the clause in the Bil l to the provision in the Act, because it gives the Board greater discretion. Members of the Forces have lost their lives or become incapacitated, not actually as the result of warlike operations, but through accident. One man who was invalided home formed one of a party which left one of our base hospitals for a trip to Ringwood, but, owing to his incapacity, he wandered away from the others, and, as a result, met with his death. His widow was not able to obtain any relief from the Repatriation Board. Soldiers should not be put in the position of having to secure the services of members of Parliament to voice their claims for pensions. I know that quite a number of them are quite able to push their own claims, but others are more diffident, and we ought not to allow them to suffer on that account. I shall always vote for any amendment of this provision that will place all men in the position of being able to get fair treatment.",25
49,Mr HILL,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Echuca) [11.38]-Quite recently a returned soldier repatriated on the land committed suicide. It can be proved that he was suffering at the time from the effects of his experience at the Front, but there is no provision in our legislation for giving assistance to his widow and family. ""Will the clause provide that relief?",26
50,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Darling Downs-Min ister for ""Works and Railways) [11.39] Apparently it is one of those cases in which the Board may exercise its discretion. The honourable member refers to the case of a man who has received such in j u r y resulting from an occurrence happening during the war as to destroy the balance of his judgment, and after his discharge from the Forces has committed suicide. I would not like to say that such a case is definitely excluded from the provisions of the existing Act. Once a member of the Australian Imperial Force has been discharged, he carries only the rights of an ordinary civilian; but the general intention is to grant relief in regard to occurrences happening during the period of the war. I shall submit the point raised by the honourable member for the consideration of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen).",26
51,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"I l l a w a r r a ) [11.4.1] - I m o v e That in sub-clause 1, paragraph a, the words, "" in fact resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was "", be left out, with a view to insert in lieu the words "" resulted from his employment as"". . If this amendment is agreed to, each Board will be charged' with the duties of determining whether the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces resulted from his employment as a member of the Forces. I think the Government should assume responsibility for any in j u r y which is suffered by a soldier through having enlisted, and that the competent Board which has power to investigate all cases should be able to deal with them on their merits. The clause as it stands does not cover the numerous cases of men who have been turned adrift unable to earn a livelihood, and whose applications for assistance are refused because the medical officers have determined that' before enlistment they were suffering from the various diseases and affections which now incapacitate them. Thus these men are placed in a position entirely different from that which they would have occupied had they not gone to the Front, because it is undoubted that their diseases or affections have been aggravated by their service in the Australian Imperial Force. Every honourable member has met dozens of such cases which are not due to any specific happening during the period of employment in the Australian Imperial Force, but have been aggravated owing to the worry and strain of their service, or to shell shock occurring during their employment in the Forces. At present we are helpless to deal with such cases. I have not heard any one attempt to set up a claim that we should not regard the aggravation of complaints which results in reduced efficiency as being on the same basis as accidents'that occur during the time of a soldier's service at the Front. Yet these cases are not covered either by the provision in the Act or by the wording of the clause now before us. We ought to clothe the Board with the fullest power to deal equitably with every case on its merits; but with the limitations imposed by the provision in the Act or by the clause before us, they will not be in a position to do so. My amendment would leave it open for relief to be granted in regard to everything that happened to a soldier during the course of his employment in the Forces. A man may have gone away apparently well, having had no difficulty in passing the medical examination, but because of the conditions under which he served, he may have returned inefficient and unable to do the work he did previously. My amendment would enable relief to be given to such a man. It cannot be given to him under the clause as it stands.",26
52,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Darling Downs-Min ister for Works and Railways) [11.45]. - In regard to the case mentioned by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Hill ) , I find on inquiry that the prin ciple on which the Ac t is now administered is that if , as a matter of fact, the death of a soldier can be connected with injuries sustained while he was a member of the Forces a pension is granted to his dependants. I am not pronouncing judgment upon the honourable member's case; I simply point out that it is merely a question of the application of the principle to the facts. Coming to the case stated by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), I learn that if the Medical Board certifies that a complaint from which an applicant for a pension was suffering has been aggravated by reason of his service a pension is granted.",26
53,Mr RILEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,Many have been turned down because of the finding of the medical men. This gives no relief.,27
54,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,They are not all turned down on that plea.,27
55,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,I can only suggest that cases of the kind to which reference has been made should be re-submitted.,27
56,Mr RODGERS,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,In the earlier days of the Department the Act was not so sympathetically administered. I know of many cases where men have exhausted the whole of their resources in trying to cure themselves.,27
57,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"I plead guilty to having re-submitted cases where pensions in the first case have been refused. I ask the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) not to press his amendment, since it would really have the effect of restricting what we now propose to do. Under the wording of his proposed amendment it would be necessary for an applicant for a pension to prove that his incapacity was the result of his employment in the service; that is to say, he would have to prove that he was employed to do a certain act, and that in the performance of that duty he suffered a casualty. The wording of paragraph a of clause 26 is much wider, and is intended to meet cases of the kind that have been brought uuder notice. There was a case in Queensland where a man, while on leave,, met with an accident which incapacitated him. Such a case would come within the meaning of this clause, since the casualty would be "" an occurrence happening during the period in which he was a member of the Forces."" We are going a long way towards meeting many of the cases to which reference has been made. There must be some one to determine the facts, and the Board will simply have to decide whether death or incapacity in fact resulted from an occurrence which happened during the period of the man's employment in the Forces. The clause does not speak of incapacity sustained while acting in pursuance of a military order, but is much wider, since it covers occurrences happening to a man while a member of the Forces.",27
58,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Flinders) [11.49] - The - wording of paragraph a of clause 26 is very wide, but it will be useless unless it is liberally interpreted. I do not think any words we could insert would cover all the cases that might arise; but if , as I understand, from the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), the attitude of the Department now is to construe tihe words "" an occurrence happening during the period in which he was a member of the Forces "" in such s way that a man who went away with some slight disease which was aggravated by his war service would be eligible  prove that he had a slight disease when he went away? Let every man who went away put in his claim without restriction.",27
59,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,The Department is continually asserting that it knows of these cases.  principle.,27
60,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"If the Minister in charge of the Bill is going to take up the very attitude which I suggested the Department would take up, it is perfectly obvious that we must amend the clause. If he would hear what we have to say instead of taking up a hostile attitude before he is able ,to appreciate the point we wish to make, it might be possible to allow the clause to go. I know of cases where men were rheumatic subjects when they enlisted, and would probably have suffered no serious inconvenience from the disease, but that they went on service. In some cases these men have come back practically hopeless cripples. They are cripjpled with rheumatism as a result of war service. I understand from the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom)' that the Department now takes up the attitude that the aggravation of the disease in such a case would be an occurrence happening while a man was a member of the Forces, and would deal sympathetically with it.",27
61,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,Provide d that the Medical Board certified that it was.,27
62,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Assuming , of course, thai the Medical Board certified that it had been aggravated because of his service. If that is a correct interpretation .of the attitude of the Department I shall be prepared to accept the clause as it stands; but if , on the other hand, the Minister  correctly indicated the attitude of the Department I am uot prepared to agree to it.",27
63,Mr RILEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"South Sydney) [11.53]. - I was pleased to hear the explanation given by the Minister for Works and' Railways (Mr Groom), but am not satisfied that the clause, as it stands, will meet cases such as those mentioned by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory). The fact that the men were pronounced sound and fit when they were accepted for service should be sumcient. When a man comes back crippled with rheumatism, and asks for a pension, he should not be told, "" Y o u had a taint of rheumatism before you enlisted.""",28
64,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,There might be cases of w i l f u l concealment.,28
65,Mr RILEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"That is so, but we do not want to be niggardly in this matter. If a man, after serving overseas, comes back crippled' with rheumatism, the fact that he was accepted for service as sound and fit should be a guarantee that he contracted the disease while on active service I hope that the honourable member for Dampier will ,press for a more definite statement from the Minister.",28
66,Dr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Melbourne) [11.55] - paltry - The medical men examined volunteers for active service under very troublesome and difficult circumstances. The Defence Department foolishly rejected an offer made by Dr O'Hara to place at the disposal of the medical officers examining volunteers in Melbourne his consulting rooms, where they could' have been examined under the best conditions. As it was, the men were examined at the Town H all , and the noise caused by passing trams made it very hard to listen to heart and lung sounds. Two men from the Hospital for Incurables here actually volunteered, and werepassed for active service, and in face of that fact the Government are wise in trying to secure that justice shall be done, while at the same time protecting themselves from unreasonable claims. It was very unwise for the Government to make a grant of £4,500 to the dependants of a certain officer, since it raises in the minds of the public a suspicion that those in high positions, with influence to aid them, can obtain what those in more lowly positions are unable to secure.",28
67,Mr LAZZARINI,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Werriwa) [11.57] I shall not be satisfied unless this clause is sufficiently wide to include every man who volunteered, and who contracted a disease while on active, service, or developed it as a ""result of his service. Whether a man had the germ .of a disease or not when he enlisted, if that disease developed while he was a member of the Forces, his case should come within this clause. I am prepared to admit, with the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), that it is quite possible that, owing to the difficult circumstances in which the examinations were made, in some in stances men were passed who ought not to have bean accepted for service. In dealing with thousands of cases, the doctors, no matter how efficient they might have been, were bound, on the law of average, to pass some who should have been rejected. Long before he enlisted, a man might have had in his constitution the germ of a disease, or might have had some slight complaint which did not in terfere with his industrial efficiency. Under active servioe conditions that disease might have been aggravated. The wonder to me is that every Australian soldier who spent any time in Europe did nob come back , troubled with rheumatism. Is the Board administering the Department to callously shelter itself behind' the excuse that a man is disentitled to a pension because, although crippled with .rheumatism on his return from the war, he had the germ of the disease in his constitution when he volunteered? That would be a barbarous attitude to take up. - Mr Fenton - The answer to such a plea would be that, even if the man had the germ of the disease when he volunteered, he was accented and used.",28
68,Mr LAZZARINI,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Yes ; I have no doubt that many of these men rendered just as effective service as those who have come back sound. The Act will be regarded as a barbarous instrument if it allows men to be treated in the way described simply because some one can say that before they enlisted they had the germ of the disease which developed during their period of service, and led to their incapacity.",28
69,Mr MAHON,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Kalgoorlie) [12.0] The Government should consider whether this clause can be satisfactorily administered. It throws upon each Board the onus of inquiring, not merely into a man's war service at the Front, but clearly also into his condition of health before he went to the Front. That opens a very wide field for investigation; and, as will be six separate Boards making investigations, and probably coming to decisions not in consonance with one another, we may expect a crop of injustices to result. There is an immense difficulty once you begin to make limitations as to who shall benefit and who shall be excluded from benefits, and it would almost pay this country to throw the door wide open and allow everybody who can prove incapacity within a certain period of the close of the war to share the benefits of this legislation. Otherwise we shall have some men receiving benefits under the law who, perhaps, are jot as much entitled to them as are men who have been excluded. It is not as if there was to be one body dealing with all the cases. There will be six Boards or Commissions, and the common experience of those accustomed to juries is that a verdict given by one set of men would be scouted by another set. Different bodies of men look at things from different angles, and draw different conclusions from the same facts. The Government would, therefore, be wise to withdraw the clause for further consideration, because as it stands it will undoubtedly lead to an immense amount of trouble andj which is worse, work out unjustly. to through today.",28
70,Mr MAHON,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,Not necessarily! The sun will not stop in the heavens if it is not passed today.  pensioners may get their money quickly. ,29
71,Mr MAHON,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,That is the idea; and then no hardship will ensue.  gest that everybody who went to the war should be a participant?,29
72,Mr MAHON,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"I recognise the difficulty the Minister had in drafting a clause that would operate quite justly; but it should be possible to frame a clause which, while not opening the door to everybody, would, at any rate, make for a greater amount of justice than this clause is likely to do in its present condition.",29
73,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Maribyrnong) [12.5] there I hope the Government will accede to the honourable member's request. The men who volunteered for the Front had to submit to medical examination. They were passed by medical men as fit for active service. _ In some cases, they were on active service for four years or more. They come back, and ask for certain benefits under Acts that we have passed; and then it is discovered, under medical examination, that they have some constitutional defect which, the doctors say, originated prior to their enlistment. Because of that, they or their dependants are not to be entitled to the benefits of this measure. That is a most cruel way to deal with men who have served just as faithfully and well as have any others. In the medical and other professions, differences of opinion arise, and it is not easy to assign an actual date to the beginning of a disease in the human body. Medical testimony will be found equally divided in many cases as to whether the trouble originated in the pre-war period or during the war. If there is any doubt, the benefit of it should be given to the returned soldier and his dependants. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  That the word ""active"", in paragraph &, be go left out.",29
74,Mr GREGORY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Dampier) [12.8] Paragraph c charges the Board with the duty of "" determining the extent to which persons alleged to be dependent upon a member of the Forces were in fact so dependent."" Under the principal Act, the pension was assessed upon the average earnings of the soldier during the twelve months prior to his going to the Front. Many boys of eighteen enlisted, whose earnings prior to enlistment were probably nil. Applications were made by the mothers of those boys who were killed at the Front. The applicants were told that, as in many instances the boys had earned nothing during the year prior to enlistment, only the minimum pension of 7s. per week could be granted. When those boys went to the Front, they did men's work. I know an instance of a boy who enlisted on his eighteenth birthday, was four years at the Front, and was killed. When his mother applied for a pension, she was asked what his average earnings were in the year before he went away. As he had been at school, she had to tell them that his earnings were nil. I have not been able to read this Bill carefully, and do not know whether a similar provision is contained in it. I cannot find anything of that nature in it, but we must make it absolutely clear that the same pension must be paid in the case of every boy who went into the firing-line as is paid in the case of a man. The provision to which I refer was one of the greatest anomalies in the old Act, and I sincerely hope it will not be perpetuated in this Bill.

79,Mr JAMES PAGE,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Maranoa) [12.12].. - The clause provides that where any assessment or determination in relation to the pension payable to a member of the Forces is required to be reviewed', the Commission may cancel the pension if the member refuses or fails to attend at the time and place fixed, or by his default makes it impossible to review the pension. Many of these men in the outback portions of Australia will be very hard to get at. One case was brought under my notice when I was away up the other side of Thargomindah. A letter was sent to a pensioner, care of the post office at Cunnamulla, where he used to draw his pension. He had left Cunnamulla and gone further out west, and consequently did not get the letter. Afterwards, when he came into the town he found that his pension had been stopped, because he had not turned up for the review. It appeared that the officer in charge of the Pensions Department had ordered him in the letter to go to the nearest Board for review. He came in from 170 to 200 miles for that pension, and when he got there he found himself absolutely stranded, and I had to get him Government rations.  penalty for a man who deliberately refuses to attend.",30
80,Mr JAMES PAGE,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"The most damnable indictment against the whole of this a Bill is that honourable members are legislating for the towns, and not for the country.  that, where the man's explanation was satisfactory, the pension would be restored, and he would receive back pay.",30

83,Mr JAMES PAGE,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"B y the time the appeal reached the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) from the places I am thinking of, the man might be dead and buried. The honourable member surely has sense enough to know that there are no railways, telephones, or telegraph facilities in the outback portions of Queensland. I do not wish men to escape review, but I want them protected in case they are unable to attend.  Senator Millen, with his knowledge of Australian conditions, would treat a man in such a position harshly 1 - Mr JAMESPAGE - No ; and when I brought the case under Mr Gilbert's notice, he ordered the man to be paid at once, until he could attend for review. But if I had not met the. man when he found that his pension had been stopped, there is no telling what he might have done. Honourable members know that in many - cases a bushman would use the good old Australian adjective, and say, "" Well, you can keep it . """,30
84,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"The Department will always restore back pay, but the difficulty is that the man does not turn up.",31
85,Mr JAMES PAGE,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,But you make it imperative on him to turn up.,31
86,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"It must be imperative. It is only f a ir to him. The peiuion would not be cancelled without giving him an opportunity of being heard. If he does not take advantage of that opportunity, the Department takes action, but if later on he comes in and shows that he had good reason for not attending, the matter is re-opened.

I am not appeal- ing for the men who were not able to work themselves up for a commission in Australia, but had sufficient money to go to England and' buv one there, but for those other men who enlisted in England either because they were there when the war broke out or because they were rejected in Australia on medical grounds.",31

102,Mr BLAKELEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"Darling) [12.30]. - The point raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) is very important to many men in Australia. I do not know the number of men who are affected, but five cases have been brought under my notice. One was that of a man who was resident in the Argentine Republic when the war broke out, and who paid his passage to England in order to enlist. He was not allowed to join the Australian Imperial Force. Of course, his pay, his pension, and all his privileges were considerably less than they would have been had he joined that Force. In another case which came under my notice only last week, a soldier who was rejected in Australia paid his passage to England, where he enlisted in the I m perial Forces, with which he served for a period of about three years. He was then given a free return passage to Australia. 1 recently made application on his behalf",32
103,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,For what did the honourable member apply- a pension or repatriation ?,32
104,Mr BLAKELEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"I broadly applied for any privileges which may be granted to Australians who, after being rejected here, went to England, and there enlisted in the British Forces. Nobody can discriminate between the individual who, having been rejected in Australia, paid his own passage to England, and the volunteer who enlisted in Australia.",32
105,Mr FOWLER,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"If any discrimination is to be made, it should certainly be in favour of the man who went to so much trouble to enlist.",32
106,Mr BLAKELEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,I think that the Minister will admit the correctness of the honourable member's interjection.,32
107,Mr FOWLER,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,The man also lost a large amount in pay owing to the difference between the rate paid to members of the Australian Imperial Force and the Imperial rate of Is. 2d. per day.  that difference in pay has been made up.,32
108,Mr BLAKELEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,Not in this particular case.  member received a reply to say that the man is not erititled to that difference between the two rates of pay?,32
109,Mr BLAKELEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"I have not. But that is not sufficient. The admission by the Minister that this man has some claim to the difference between his Imperial rate of pay and the rate paid to the Australian Imperial Force puts him on an equality with the members of the Australian Imperial Force. If he is entitled to be placed on an equality with the Australian Imperial Force in regard to pay, he is certainly entitled to be similarly placed in regard to pensions. I have here an amendment, which I drafted some time ago, but I would prefer that the Minister himself should move it . I would like to insert after the word "" service "", the words "" and any soldier who enlisted in the British Forces.""",32
110,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"The honourable member must make his amendment much wider than that. He must employ almost the same phrasing as is employed in paragraph c of clause 46, which reads:- "" is serving or has served during the present war in the Naval or M i l it a r y Forces of any part of the King's Dominions other that the Commonwealth.""",32
111,Mr BLAKELEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"I am sure that the Minister recognises the justice of the claim which I am urging. The Government, in their policy, have done so, and ] ask the Minister to incorporate in this clause the words employed in paragraph c of clause 46, to which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has directed attention.",32
112,Mr GROOM,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,The Minister has promised to look into the matter.,32
113,Mr BLAKELEY,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,"W it h all due respect, it is scarcely fair treatment for the Minister to promise merely to look into it . We require to know his decision.

I therefore move That after the word "" service "" , line 3, words "" and any Australian who is serving has served during the present war in Naval or Military Forces of auy part of King's Dominions "" be inserted.

If we adopt it we shall have to assume the obligation providing pensions for these men, and i so far as we do that we shall relieve the Imperial Government of their responsiAustralian bility to pay pensions which they are titled to pay to those who enlisted in service. On the other hand, it is just sible that these men may obtain a penstated sion from the Imperial Government also a pension from the Commonwealth. There is only one legitimate claim which can be made on their behalf, namely, we shall make up the difference between the Imperial rate of pension and our own rate.",32

He was very anxious to serve his country, and, being offered an opportunity of securing a passage to England, he accepted it , and went to the Old Country.

122,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT,That would be an exmen treme case. I do not desire to see any man drawing two pensions or enjoying two sets of privileges. But the amendment would apply to so few cases that the Committee may very well adopt it .,33

In one case, two young fellows before going to the Front had had some experience in engineering, and when they returned after some years' fighting they started a motor engineer's business in partnership. They are careful, steady men; but when they applied for assistance, the answer they received was to the effect that it was not within the scope of the regulations, on the ground that, prior to enlisting, they had not owned and conducted a similar business. It is true that, before enlisting, they were not in business for themselves, but were learning as paid employees. Why should young soldiers who are enterprising enough to start business, but who have not sufficient money to provide all the necessary tools, be debarred from advantages enjoyed by other members of the Forces? In another case, two young fellows, before enlisting, had been engaged on a newspaper for years, and the owner of the paper has stated that if they had not gone to the war they would have been made partners"". Since their return to Australia, these young men have been offered, by a sleeping partner, an interest in this newspaper.

It would be very unwise, however, to stipulate in the Bill particular classes of business shall be sisted.

There is no need, of course, why the Commission should follow in the footsteps of the previous Commission",35

132,Mr FLEMING,FOWLER,"Robertson) [12.55].. - I hope that the Commission and the Boards will interpret the Bill in the generous spirit suggested by the Minister (Mr . Poynton). There is no doubt that under the present Act there are cases of very grievous harship. Men desire to be established iD the businesses which they would have been following if they had and agreed to:not gone to the war, but under the present Act are unable to get the assistance necessary to enable them to do so. Many men who previously worked for their of fathers or others in a variety would by this time have been partners in had they not enlisted; but simply because they were not actually established in the is my businesses before they enlisted they are refused the benefits of the Act. I am glad to hear that the Commission and the e Boards will be enabled to take a wider in the administration of the Act , the whole spirit of which is more generous than that of the old Act . According to The this clause, the Commission is given to make recommendatons for the of granting of assistance to the incapacitated fathers of deceased or inAustralian soldiers who were, prior I wish to to the enlistment of the soldier, dependent p It seems to me that unless this provision very widely administered it will fall far short of what is desired. I am prepared to admit that to strike out the words "" who were prior to the enlistment of soldiers dependent upon the m "" might lead to some cases of imposition, but I draw attention to the limitation imposed by the word's. ' There are cases such the as that mentioned by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) a few what moments ago, and his remarks apply not asonly to mothers, but to fathers. I think that an incapacitated father, although he of may not have been dependent on the solthe dier before enlistment, ought in certain circumstances to come within the scheme, new and the Government ought to make certain that such cases will be met.

134,Mr WEST,FOWLER,"East Sydney) [2.20] I have on more than one occasion brought before honourable members the need for of the more thorough auditing of public accounts. Under the Bill as the auditing of the accounts of the Local Committees may be done by some person not under the control of the Auditor General. In my opinion, that officer is the sole authority . who can properly satisfy Parliament and the country the correctness of public and quasi-public accounts.. As one who a few years ago took a great part in forcing the Government to be more particular in requiring the auditing of the accounts by the Auditor-General's Department, that in this clause the words "" as prescribed"" should be left out, and the words ""by the Auditor-General"" substituted for them. I do not wish to say anything about discrepancies that have occurred in the past in connection with war funds. The Committee is aware that .the auditing of the Wool Committee's accounts is done by a person who is not under the Auditor-General. I have nothing to say against outside auditors, but the accounts of that Committee and of all similar bodies should be audited by the Auditor-General's Department. I have positive evidence that some of the outside auditors have not been as careful as they might have been. Had all the accounts of the kind I have, in mind been subject to audit by the Auditor-General, many improper transactions would not have continued as long as they did, because under the Audit Act there would have been a constant supervision, whereas actually the auditing was done when accounts were being closed, or upon an annual statement. Nothing can be better than the prevention of crime, and the Minister in charge of a Department, who cannot be supposed to over-* look every detail of administration, has a guarantee, when provision is made for the auditing of accounts by the Auditor General, that the money which he obtains from the Treasurer will not be wasted. Parliament should be very jealous for the proper accounting for moneys expended at its direction. The magnitude of our expenditure is in itself special reason for very careful auditing, and the Auditor-General should control the auditing of all accounts of Government expenditure. After all, the purpose of the audit is to satisfy the Government that the accounts these Committees are properly kept, and the moneys handled by them devoted it stands, to the proper purpose.",36
135,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,It is proposed that the audit shall be as prescribed.,36
136,Mr WEST,FOWLER,"That is what I am obof jecting to. That would give the Repatriation Department latitude to consent to the appointment of an outside auditor. Mr GROOM, - The honourable member should remember that there are 700 or S00 of these Committees scattered all I suggest over the Commonwealth.",36
137,Mr WEST,FOWLER,"That is but a greater justification for adopting the course I suggest. The operations-under this Bill will cover a very large area, and a very large amount of public expenditure will be involved by them. There is nothing in our laws, Federal or State, to prevent any man who pleases putting up a brass plate and describing himself as an auditor. I am sure that if the Minister will seek advice in this matter he will realise the wisdom of the amendment I suggest.",36
138,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,"At the present time, wherever any Commonwealth expenditure is undertaken by these Local Committees, it is subjected to Government audit. . Mr ""WEST - I am again justified by what the honourable gentleman has said in urging that it should be made imperative by this Bill that these accounts shall be audited by the Auditor-General.",37
139,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,What I have said shows that there is no necessity for what the honourable member proposes.,37
140,Mr WEST,FOWLER,"I would remind the Government that the adoption of the amendment I suggest would not prevent the Auditor-iGeneral appointing some person in any particular locality to act for him, and submit his audit to him. That is permitted by the Audit Act. No Government Department should, in a matter of this kind, be placed outside the supervision of the Auditor-General. It is said that figures do not lie, and, while that is so, our experience at election times shows that the persons who handle figures are often the greatest liars on earth.  be approved by an auditor.",37
141,Mr WEST,FOWLER,But auditors have often been shown to be wrong in their audits. That is not to be wondered at when any man may claim to.be an auditor. Are the Government prepared to adopt the suggestion I have made?,37
142,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,No ; the clause is all right' as it is.,37
143,Mr WEST,FOWLER,"Everythin g is right so long as Ministers get their own way, but it is of no use for us to discuss any measures if the Government are always to have their own way.

Very many of our returned men have been placed upon the land. I have no fault to find with the land settlement policy of the Government; on the contrary, I hope it will be liberalized extenapsively. But I think some provision should be made for men who have no trade OT calling, and my special object is to make it possible to do something for them.  operative enterprises to be 'beyond the - control of the Minister?",38
156,Mr HILL,FOWLER,"They might be subject to A Ausman who goes upon the land is entitled to £2,500 worth of land, and is further assisted to the extent of £625. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr . Gibson) pointed out recently that it would cost this country £1,500,000 to repatriate 500 men by means of land settlement, and £125,000 to repatriate the same num -' he ber of men by the establishment of cooperative woollen mills for their employment; in other words, that it would cost £3,125 to repatriate one man upon the and only £250 in providing him co-operative woollen m ill .",38
157,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,"Does the honourable memas a ber suggest how the scheme could be carried out as a co-operative enterprise, by how ""much capital would be employed, and",38
158,Mr HILL,FOWLER,"I suggest that £250 be advanced per head of those employed in the proposed co-operative enterprise. According to the honourable member for - CoTangamite, this sum would be ample. There may be some doubt as to whether a woollen mill run on these lines would be profitable; but the Inter-State Commission's report showed that the net profits - made by the woollen mills of the Commonwealth during the first three years of the war, actually exceeded by £50,710 the total of capital employed in 1914. The capital invested in that year in woollen mills producing blankets, flannels, &c., £536,639, and the profits made in the three years 1915-16-17 totalled £541,135, while the capital employed in mills producing tweeds, serges, &c, was £607,746, and the profits during those three years amounted to £655,960, showing a total capital investment of £1,144,385 and profits £1,195,095.",38
159,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOWLER,That was because of war conditions.,39
160,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FOWLER,The mills were working three shifts a day. - Mr HILL - The requirements of the people today are such that a co-operative woollen mill run by soldiers could also be worked three shifts a day and be quite as profitable.,39
161,Mr TUDOR,FOWLER,"Many of the mills did not work three shifts a day because they could not get a sufficient number of employees. Mr HILL , - I am not here to defend the great proprietary companies. I am here to put a word in for co-operative enter-prises. It goes without saying that the profits can still be made, not only by woollen mills, but by co-operative boot factories, fellmongering establishments, tanneries, wool-scouring works, saw-mills, and other similar establishments; and I would like to see some of those profits distributed amongst the rank and file. If honourable gentlemen sitting on this side of the House are deeply interested in the welfare of our returned soldiers, they now have an opportunity of proving it. I hope they will support me to the hilt, and that something will be done for those of our returned men who do not go upon the land. Will the Minister accept the new clause if the proposed enterprises are made subject to the approval of the Minister?  the proposal discussed before I express my opinion.",39
162,Mr HILL,FOWLER,"During the last two or three years a large amount of sustenance money has been paid to our returned soldiers. I do not wish to indulge in recriminations, but in my opinion this problem should have been tackled two or three years ago, and instead of paying sustenance money and keeping in idleness those men who did not want to go upon was the land and had no qualifications for land settlement, they should have been placed in the Commonwealth Woollen Mills or other private concerns to learn a trade and been paid a living wage, so that by the time they had become proficient, factories would have been erected and machinery installed.",39
163,Mr LATBD SMITH,FOWLER,Me n are being trained already.,39
164,Mr HILL,FOWLER,"I am aware of that, and there is good reason why we should continue training and employing these men by means of co-operative enterprises. If these industries are established, I hope that they will be set up as far as possible in country towns, with a view to bringing about decentralization. Honourable members opposite must recognise that the population of our capital cities is quite out of proportion-the disproportion is growing to an alarming extent-and we should be only too pleased to receive any support in the movement towards decentralization.  Home and Territories) [2.56] - The honourable member has referred to what he describes as a fearful waste of money in connection with the payment of sustenance to returned soldiers.",39
165,Mr HILL,FOWLER,"I did not say that the money was wasted. I maintained that it could be better employed.  that the average payment of sustenance to each soldier has been £8 5s., hardly exceeding a period of three weeks, it will be seen that expenditure in this direction has not been extravagant, especially when it is compared with the services the men have rendered Australia. The bulk of this money has been paid during one of the most troublesome periods we have had in Australia for many years past; that is to say, during the influenza outbreak and the seamen's and marine engineers' strikes. Not only have we been obliged to sustain returned soldiers who were thrown out of employment because of these industrial troubles, but we have also had to provide relief for thousands of people in the State of Victoria. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) must know that the Repatriation Department can only train as many men as the trade unions will permit.",39
166,Mr HILL,FOWLER,"No trade union would object to the employment of 100 men in the Commonwealth ""Woollen Mills.  week that the Castlemaine moulders objected to the employment of one trainee to every six journeymen. They would not allow more than one trainee to about thirty journeymen. If the Government had come down with this proposal, it would have been described as one of the most Socialistic ever put forward. Three men, over whom we have practically no control, are to be allowed to commit the country to the expenditure of millions of pounds without any check upon them.",40
167,Mr HILL,FOWLER,"I am willing to include the words "" subject to the approval of the Minister.""  clause is unnecessary, because the Repatriation Commissioners will be perfectly entitled to give consideration to such projects. The proposed new clause would make it mandatory on them to accede to them. The honourable member has put forward a simple illustration in regard to the establishment of a co-operative woollen mill, with, perhaps, a capital of £1,000,000; but his proposal covers not only woollen mills, but also boot factories, clothing factories, canning factories, and, in fact, it is so worded as to cover almost any, enterprise under the sun. The Government cannot agree to any proposal which would commit the country in this way to the expenditure of scores of millions of pounds.",40
168,Mr HILL,FOWLER,"We have not sufficient returned soldiers to absorb scores of millions of pounds.  tion of any limitation as to' the number of factories. If we start a woollen mill in Geelong, why should not one be started in Bendigo or Ballarat, or any other centre? If we establish a factory in one State there would be a call upon us to establish similar factories in other States. In the circumstances, I cannot consent to V the honourable member's proposal as it stands.",40
169,Mr TUDOR,FOWLER,"Yarra) [3.0] - I understand that the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) is quite willing to have the words "" subject to the approval of the Minister "" inserted in the clause. When the first Repatriation Bill was before this House, I pointed out that the man on the land was to be treated in an infinitely better way than the man who was engaged in an industry in a city. I consider the proposal of the honourable member a step in' the right direction, because I hold that every man should be placed on the same footing. Mr EENTOK' - What is the difference between providing money for a woollen mill and finding it for a man who is anxious to go on the land?",40
170,Mr TUDOR,FOWLER,"There is no difference whatever. The proposal of the honourable member for Echuca is on the lines of that put forward by the honourable members for  Blundell), for the establishment of cooperative concerns by returned soldiers utilizing their war gratuity bonds. They are already doing this in Geelong. The Minister says that the proposal before us is socialistic; but surely we have all got beyond being frightened by that name, as applied to any project. If this new clause will provide an opportunity for returned soldiers to co-operate for the purpose of doing something for themselves and Australia, we shall be taking a step in the right direction by including it in the Bill.",40
171,Mr STEWART,FOWLER,"Wimmera) [3.3] The object of the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) is to make provision for those men who, prior to the war, were not engaged in farming or in some business calling. A man who was a farmer before the war is placed on the land on his return; the man who was in a small business before he went to the war is placed in business again on his return, and the man who wielded a pick and shovel before he went overseas is given a pick and shovel on his return. The farm labourer who worked for a weekly wage is, on his return, put on the land, and placed in a position to become his own employer, but Avhat is done for the man who, before enlisting, worked for a sawmiller for a weekly wage? He is sent back to the sawmill under the old boss who was having a comfortable time while his employee was away fighting. In his  is often done by honourable gentlemen on the front bench, dealt with details, getting quite away from the vital principle at issue. We admit that there are obstacles in the way of the adoption of our proposal, but we are quite prepared to agree to any safeguard the Minister may think fit. These returned men should be given an opportunity, and I shall give an illustration of what I mean. When I was in the country the other day, I was in conversation with a number of men wearing military badges who were working at a saw-mill at a railway siding. They were engaged by an employer at a weekly wage, and I asked them whether, if provision were made for an advance from the Repatriation Department to enable them to purchase an engine, a bench and a few drays, they could not run a plant of their own. They replied emphatically in the affirmative, and said they would be only too glad to undertake the work on their own account if they could obtain the necessary capital. It is to cover such cases as this that we are endeavouring to incorporate this amendment in the Bill. We do not desire the measure to be amended in such a way that any one could come along and ask for an advance to launch some wildcat scheme, and we are quite agreeable to accept any reasonable safeguards. The bulk of the men. in the Australian I m perial Force before they went to the war were working for others. What have the Government done for the bulk of them? That is a question I desire the Government to consider, and I also appeal very strongly to those honourable members in this Chamber who are wearing military badges to support this reasonable proposition.",40
172,Mr JOWETT,FOWLER,"Grampians) [3.7] - I trust the Government will see their way clear to deal with the amendment in a sympathetic manner, as the proposal is a reasonable one and cannot be regarded as a communistic experiment or anything of that nature. The proposal in the amendment is confined to cooperative businesses, which, after all, are voluntary associations of men carrying on industries for the benefit of themselves and the whole community. It is to be regretted that the co-operative system has not become more widely established in Australia. Objections may be raised to this proposal, and although the amendment may not be in the form the Government desire, the principle is a perfectly sound one. Criticisms have been made concerning the Repatriation Department or the administration of the Act, because proper (provision has not been made to advance money to soldiers who desire to start in business. Although many of the men who went to the Front were employees before they left Australia, as stated by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), there are many who would by now have been in business on their own account if they had not gone abroad in the interests of Empire.  of the honourable member if the Government agreed to insert' after the word "" shall"" the words "" subject to the approval of the Minister""?",41

174,Mr HILL,FOWLER,But we will want something done.,41

176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FOWLER,"Wakefield) [3.10] - I agree entirely with the object of establishing co-operative concerns, but I do not want the soldiers and the taxpayers generally to believe that we are providing for something which will not really exist.",41
177,Mr FENTON,FOWLER,"I hope we are sincere, and that this is not to be regarded as a sham.",41
178,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FOWLER,I hope the honourable member is sincere. This is entirely a financial question.,42

182,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FOWLER,"Yes , and > I shall tell the honourable member why.",42
183,Mr JOWETT,FOWLER,"The Assistant Minister has already agreed to the proposal. Mr RICHARD""FOSTER- I do not care, and I appeal to the honourable member for Grampians, who knows something about business, to say whether this is not the crudest proposition ever conceived by a responsible Parliament. I desire to know whether we have any authority, as representatives of the people, to assist undertakings under the crude proposal before the House. It is an impossible proposition when considered from the financial aspect. Let honourable members who are so keen to include this provision in the Bill interview the heads of any financial institution and ask them if they are prepared to advance money on the basis of the proposal now before us. My entire sympathy is with the movement, but it must have some foundation. Comparison has been made between land settlement and the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca. While there is a Tisk of losing perhaps hundreds of thousands, or even millions, sterling in connection with land settlement, the risk under this proposition is ten times greater.",42
184,Mr HILL,FOWLER,No .,42
185,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FOWLER,I say it is. The land is there and cannot be removed. Land settlement is totally different from entering into businesses of various kinds and competing with commercial undertakings that have been established for years and are under highly-efficient control.,42
186,Mr JOWETT,FOWLER,"The Government will look after that. - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I am sure my honourable friend knows that in connection with our land settlement problem there are painful instances where [64] men who have gone on the land and have accepted advances from the Department have been all right while the money was coming in, but when that ceased they have walked off .their holdings and told the Department to take the land. I urge the Committee not to raise false hopes, by introducing into the Bill a scheme involving an expenditure of hundreds of thousands ofpounds, which is not on a sound basis.",42
187,Mr GIBSON,FOWLER,It will be the fault of the Commissioners if any mistake is made; they will have power to investigate every case.,42
188,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FOWLER,"Every thing will depend upon the class of Commissioners we secure. Surely honourable members are not going to behave like school children, and put forward a scheme that is not likely to be a credit to the Parliament.",42
189,Dr MALONEY,FOWLER,"Melbourne) [3.16] The attitude of the honourable member for in Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), who has just resumed his seat, reminds me of the old coupletPerhaps it was right to dissemble your love, But why did you kick me downstairs? The Minister has said that the average sustenance allowance extends over three weeks. That means that each individual receives £6 6s., and as 300,000 men have returned, a total of over £1,800,000 has been paid by way of sustenance. Can any one say that there is anything to show for the money thus expended?",42
190,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,Does the honourable gentleman agree with the payment of sustenance money ?,42
191,Dr MALONEY,FOWLER,"I do; but not in the miserable way that has been followed by the Department. I am glad that this amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Echuca. When a number of poor fellows, most of them - maimed, were earning a few paltry shillings a week at the ANZAC weaving school, the wonderful Department of Repatriation used to deduct from their sustenance allowance of £2 2s. a week the paltry 15s. a week that was accruing to the men by way of pension. That was not done in Sydney, where the industry is carried on under the auspices of the Red Cross. But for the Repatriation Department, and the influence of Flinderslane, there would be in Victoria today 1,000 men engaged in the ANZAC twped industry. Amendment of the amendment  That after the word ""shall,"" line 1, the words "" subject to the approval of the Minister "" be inserted]..",42
192,Mr ROBERT COOK,FOWLER,"Indi ) [3.22] I am not at all pleased with the way in which this question been discussed, since there has been pn' all sides a display' of bitterness, that we have no desire to arouse. am a staunch believer in . co-operation, and as the result of twenty years.' experience of it in Victoria, I am able to say that it has been attended with splendid results. I am. associated at the present time with six very successful cooperative enterprises, with, a turnover of £250,0.00 a year. I visited, the Repatriation. Trades. School,, Wirth's Park,, a few days ago, andsawwith - in terestwhat is being - donei n . the vocational training of returned, men.' The work is a distinct credit to 'the M in ister. Many of them, are rapidly becoming efficient, and, in the near future,, will be splendid tradesmen. A man who is learning the trade of a blacksmith, after four months' experience, was t u r ning out work equal to that, of an apprentice of two years' standing. The amendment simply proposes that these men 9hall go on earning for themselves instead of making profits for employers. We feel that there is ample room for a very wide extension of the principle of co-operation, and that, under the wise guidance of the Minister, there is no likelihood of waste and extravagance. If the Minister cannot supervise co-operative ventures such as we propose, then how will it be possible for him to supervise other enterprises involving a considerable expenditure for which provision is made in this Bill . I hope that the amendment' will not be dealt with in a party spirit, but that a united effort will be made to give these men real, sound, practical assistance through the channel of co-operation.",43
193,Mr GIBSON,FOWLER,"Corangamite) [3.24] The Minister has practically agreed to the amendment, subject to the - insertion of the words ""subject to the-approval of the Minister."" I am inclined, to think that the-word' ""Commissioners"" instead of "" Minister "" should be employed.",43
194,Mr TUDOR,FOWLER,"All of these projects will companies run by returned soldiers. involve an expenditure of over £5,000, (by and must therefore be referred to the Minister.",43
195,Mr GIBSON,FOWLER,"This - is> not a. Socialistic; movement. It is. simply a. scheme to enable returned soldiers in certain, districts, to combine so that they, will secure the same help that is given to those who go has on the land. Every man will then have a chance of entering into some concernthat will be of advantage to himself: I The honourable memberf or Indi (Mr . Robert Cook) referred to what is being done in the way of vocational training at Wfirthfs Park. Very fine work is being done there, simply to enable - these men to become servants of other men. We want to make them masters, not servants'. I am surprised at. the attitude' of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), who waxed very eloquent on behalf of vested interests . 1 If these menare givenan opportunity they will for m themselves' into little companies, which w i ll be an absolute success; The Government never had a better opportunity than-the present, to enter into this undertaking intheproper spirit. Little groups of men trained at Wirth's Park could be given contracts for some of the houses being buil t today. They are actually building those houses, but are only getting wagesout of them, while somebody else is reapingthe profits. There are scores of saw-mill hands working in forest areas who only need to be advanced about £250 each, instead of the £2,500 advanced in other cases, and then the Government can let them as many contracts as they like to cut timber for the housing scheme. That decidedly should be done. The men are absolutely efficient, and know the job of saw-milling quite as well as the men who run the mills. These are some of the small schemes which this measure should be passed to promote. We should give returned men facilities to establish manufacturing undertakings in some of the decadent mining towns, and by that - means the whole of the. existing housing problem could be solved. The houses I looked at the other day are costing about £700 each. The Government could obtain houses equal to them for half, or even a quarter, of the money in some of the mining districts. Those centres are admirably suited for small co-operative I hope. the Government will see to these things, which are necessary in the in terests of the men who cannot possibly go on the land. The honourable member for Wakefield spoke of the men on the land. The Government are placing £650 worth of improvements on 60 acres of ground. The result is to bring up the value of that ground by £10 per acre.. In some cases the land is not worth it when that £10 per acre improvement is placed upon it .  to.

In the first column of the schedule certain rates of pay per day of the member of the Forces are set out, and in the other columns are set out the corresponding pension rates.

In the case of a member who has been granted the Special Rate of Pension, the wife of such member s'hall not be entitled to receive a pension exceeding the rate specified in column five of the First Schedule opposite the rate of pay of the member. MT . .HECTOR .LAMOND (I l l a w a r r a ) ' [ 3 . 3 2 ] - I shall mot propose the amend; ment ^ h i c h I have circulated, but instead beg to move That after the first paragraph the following new. paragraph be inserted:"" The Commission may grant -* pension not exceeding the special rate of pension to any memher of 'the Forces who is suffering ' from tuberculosis and who has been for at least six months an 'inmate of an establishment for persons so suffering, and has been discharged from that estab-lishment. Provided that this paragraph shall not authorize the grant of a pension to such member of ""the Forces unless upon his discharge from the establishment the medical officer in charge of that establishment has certified that such discharge is not a menace to public health.""  ment.",44
197,Mr TUDOR,FOWLER,"Y a r r a ) [3.33] - The amendment provides that a person suffering from tubercular disease has to be discharged from the .establishment before he can receive the pension. He may be a married man, and the special .rate of pension would, of course, be for the benefit of his family. It would be dangerous to grant it only if the man was discharged. We should not encourage persons suffering f.Tom this disease to be discharged amongst the community. While I have as much sympathy with these .sufferers as has any other honourable member, I believe it is 'recognised by the medical authorities that they are a menace to the public health runless properly looked after. It is far better for them and for other people that they should be kept in a sanatorium.",44
198,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,The patient has to get a certificate from the medical officer that his discharge is not a menace to the public health.,45
199,Mr TUDOR,FOWLER,"The amendment is a rephrasing of the original one of which notice was given by the honourable member for Illawarra. It is dangerous to compel the men to be discharged from the pamatorium. I understand that if the pension is paid to men while they are inmates of an institution, the bulk of it is retained by the institution. In Victoria, the Department has adopted a very bad (policy by sending the men who were at Mont Park,, where tubercular cases were treated, to the Austin Hospital for Incurables, and placing them in the Kronheimer wing, which is the finest part of the institution. It is bad for the soldiers to be kept amongst incurables, and the policy is bad for the people, because it prevents other incurables from obtaining admission. The hardships experienced overseas caused many of our men to develop tubercular troubles, and I believe in doing everything possible to help them. I approve of paying the pension to them, but I do not like the provision that they shall not get it until they are discharged from the institution. It is better for them to be in a sanatorium, because they have a better chance of recovery, and are not so much a menace to the community.",45
200,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FOWLER,"Illawarra) [3.38] - The position as it has been explained to me is that any inmate of an institution who is able to obtain employment can leave at any time and mix with the general community without restraint,, whereas men who are unable to obtain employment must remain in the institution or starve. The object of the amendment is to give to them an opportunity of returning to their homes for the purpose of continuing the treatment. It is admitted that the institutions are conducted in the best possible way, but the inmates say that they are continually coming in contact with people similarly afflicted, and they can never forget that they are tubercular cases.",45
201,Mr TUDOR,FOWLER,That is why I object to their being put in the Austin Hospital.,45
202,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FOWLER,"That will be altered shortly; the Department will provide effectively for such cases being treated in the country under different conditions. The object I have in view is to enable tubercular patients who are not able to work to get the same attention as they would be able to get if they were living at home amongst their own people, if in the opinion of the medical officer of the institution there was no special danger to the community in allowing them to return to their homes. The reason for the provision that patients must remain in an institution for six months is that in that period they may learn how to avoid spreading contagion to others. I am assured by the Medical Superintendent that it is quite safe for these patients to mix with other people so long as they have been properly trained to look after themselves. At any rate, whether or not there is a danger in what is proposed, the present position is that the man who has money may go to his home, whilst the man dependent upon the low rate of pension at present paid has to remain in the institution, and in his own judgment has not the same chance to recover as he would have if he could join his own people in his home.",45
203,Dr MALONEY,FOWLER,"Melbourne) [3.40] 1 approve of the amendment, which is an improvement upon the present practice, but I do not understand why we should compel an invalid to remain in an institution for six months if , at the end of one month, he is fit to be discharged. However, I am willing to give the proposal a trial, and if we find that it tends to counteract the benefits conferred by the clause, we. ought to be able to amend it. Amendment agreed to.

The only reason which Percentage» ol the Minister has assigned in favour of rate in column 4 in First Schedule the creation of a new Department is that opposite Member's Rate of Pay. it will effect economy in the matter of Per centum time. From my stand-point, it will have 100 precisely the opposite result. It is pro100 posed to take from a Department - which has all the necessary machinery at its disposal work which it is now perform100 ing, and to give it to a Department which 100 - has no machinery whatever.

Now an opportunity will be given them to say whether they really stand for economy or not. The honourable member for Hume put the position very clearly when he said that in this Bill the Government propose to establish two Pensions Departments where only one existed previously. I hope that the amendment will be carried.",46
208,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,"Darling Downs-Minis ier for ""Works and Railways) [3.53] The Government will oppose this amendment, because the issue that is involved in it was definitely decided last evening in a full Committee. Upon that occasion the argument was advanced-jus t as it has been this afternoon-that the Bill provides for the creation of two Departments. It does nothing of the sort. The position is that there are. a number of officers of the Old-age Pensions Department who are charged with administrative work in connection with soldiers' pensions, and because of difficulties - which may arise in affording all kinds of relief to soldiers and their dependants, these officers are about to be placed .under the control of the Repatriation Commission.",47
209,Sir JOSEPH COOK,FOWLER,There is to be only one set of records and one correspondence branch.,47
210,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,"Exactly , and an i m portant aspect is the medical side of the question. The activities of the Defence Department in this connection are about to cease, and instead of creating a new Department, as has been alleged, we are merely transferring certain officers in order to insure efficient and economical administration. Those honourable members who have been taunted with failure to keep their pledges by insisting upon economy in our public Departments, have shown that they are the truest advocates of economy. That, however, is a policy which is entirely foreign to the honourable member for ""West Sydney (Mr Ryan). ""We have had constant complaints from outside.

215,Mr JAMES PAGE,FOWLER,".Maranoa). [4.2],Before the. Bill leaves the Chamber I desire to say a few words in reference to a particular class of returned soldiers. The newspapers tell us. every clay;- that men have returned from the war physically wrecked and mentally deficient. I cannot speak of other States, but in Queensland there is no place to which these men can be sent, in order that they may be restored to health and made the reputable citizens many of them were before they left for the Front. Many of them are drinking about the big cities, .and I should like the Repatriation Department to provide an asylum to which they can be committed, instead of permitting them, as at present, to be sqnt to gaol. It is the wish of. every honourable member^ and of all the people of Australia, to do the right thingby these men. It grieves me to think that soldiers, who. have, made this country safe for. us all--and but for whose services things might have been very different today^-should, in their broken state, he sent to gaol. The police magistrate in Brisbane was very pained when Impleaded for a man who, after four years' fighting, had been arrested as a vagrant. He said, "" There is nowhere else for me to sendthis, man but to gaol."" Of course, the man was down and out. He was .covered with vermin, and a complete human wreck. It behoves us to do what we can for .these men. I know that those at the head of the Repatriation administration, both in the States and in the Central Department, are - sympathetic, and I appeal to them to - get to work as early as they can, to save this human wreckage, and, if possible, bring it back to normal civil life. If these men could be sent to a military hostel, where they would enjoy a certain amount of freedom, but be kept from the cursed drink, some of them.would be reclaimed, and .if only 5 per cent, of them were thus saved, it would be a good thing for them and for the country.",48
216,Mr GROOM,FOWLER,"Darling Downs-Min ister for Works and Railways) [ 4 . 7 ] am sure that what has been said by the honourable member - for Maranoa, (Mr. James Page) makes an appeal to every one of us. The Department is taking action in each of the States on the lines that, he wishes to have followed, and at Mount Gravatt, in Queensland, an establishment is being created to meet, the cases to which he has referred. Instructions have been given that the man whom he has mentioned shall not be sent to gaol, and shall be properly cared for. MT . HECTOR LAMOND (Illawarra ) [4.8] - In my opinion, it is desirable that the Government should establish some sort of soldier force-no t policemen exactly, but welfare men-whos e business it would be to go about the cities, and get hold of soldiers before their state became, so. bad. as to bring them into the hands of the civil police. Nothing hurts me more than to see uniformed men being taken by civilian policemen to a lockup. A force such as I suggest would look after these men in the fraternal way that their mates would care for them, and, no doubt, prevent many of them from gettinginto trouble, brought about by the strain of war work, fro m which they have not yet recovered.. I suggest some voluntary or paid organization for the service of those who have done so much for us. Mr TUDOR. (Yarra) [4.11] - I am glad that .the honourable member for Maranoa has raised this question. Cases like that which he mentioned have occurred in all the States, and members on both sides must have come into contact with a great many of them. In some cases, Ithe men are mental as' weal as physical wrecks.",48
217,Mr FLEMING,FOWLER,That is nearly always so.,48
218,Mr TUDOR,FOWLER,"We should provide homes for these men, where they might be subjected to a certain amount of wholesome discipline, and protected from themselves. Even when the hotels of this city were closed during a large part of the day, or altogether, as during the in fluenza outbreak, those people whom the Prime Minister has designated harpies and sharks often got-hold of soldiers, and deliberately drugged some of them, I believe.
