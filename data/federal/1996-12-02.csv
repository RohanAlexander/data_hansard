2,Mr TRUSS,DELEGA TION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 17th ASEAN InterParliamentary Organisation General Assembly in Phuket, Thailand, held from 16 to 21 September 1996. I am delighted to present this report on behalf of the delegation which attended this very significant gathering of parliamentarians from the ASEAN countries and their dialogue countries held in September this year. The delegation, which was intended originally to include both senators and members, finally included only members of this House. I would like to thank the deputy leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who made up the delegation, which I think had a very enjoyable and very informative experience through its participation in the conference. At the outset, I also thank the secretary the delegation, Robert King, and acknowledge the very great assistance which the delegation received from the Australian Ambassador to Thailand, Mr Cavan Hogue, and James Larsen, the second secretary. I know, Mr Acting Speaker Jenkins, that you would be very familiar with this particular conference, having been the leader of the delegation to the 16th ASEAN conference. As a delegation, we were grateful for the benefit of your experience in briefing us prior to our departure. I would have to say that you warned us appropriately about what to expect, and the advice that you gave us about the quality of the conference and the capacity that we have through participation in such gatherings to cement our relationships with our neighbours of the near north was indeed very accurate and very helpful. There are 12 dialogue partners who participate in this particular conference. Australia was, in fact, the first dialogue partner and, as a country, we have attended this ASEAN conference on 16 consecutive occasions-a record not paralleled by any of the other dialogue countries. The members of ASEAN all had large delegations present-Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore-together with Brunei, which has special observer status. Cambodia and Laos are likely to become full members of AIPO in 1997 and there are discussions currently taking place about the role of Burma. When these countries get together, when they meet with Australia, it does provide us with a dialogue opportunity to deal with a number of issues of great significance. One of the features of the conference is the dialogue sessions held with each of the observer partners. In our case, we participated in a very active session which dealt with issues such as culture and technology transfer, a range of trading issues, including anti-dumping, investment policies both by Australia and within Australia and a range of environmental issues. If there is one issue that the delegation had brought home to it most strongly, it was the tremendous interest in Australia's capacity to provide environmental services in Asia. There of is certainly growing interest in environmental issues and an acknowledgment that our country has much to offer other parts of the world in that regard. That was one of the focuses of our dialogue session, and the committee has recommended in its report that Australia should place increasing emphasis on trade in environmental services and our capacity to contribute to countries in that part of the world. There is no doubt that Australia enjoys excellent relationships with the countries of ASEAN. The goodwill that was so apparent to our delegation while we were present at the conference reflects very well on the warmth of that relationship. From those countries where there was perhaps some strain in the past, there certainly was a desire to start off on a new foot and to work towards a cooperative relationship in the future. This report tells in pictures and text the story of a very successful conference. As observers, we were not involved in all of the sessions of the conference and it is our recommendation that we should pursue with the organisers of the next conference, in Jakarta, the possibility of observer delegations being involved in all of the sessions. There was some support for that view expressed to us and we believe that it is important that we build on that opening with a view towards building an even more successful participation in conferences in the future.",13
3,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DELEGA TION REPORTS,Order! The time allotted for this report has concluded. NA National Crime Authority Committee,14
4,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the committee, entitled Examination of the annual report for 1994-95 of the National Crime Authority. Ordered that the report be printed.",14
5,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"This is the first report by the committee since its establishment in the 38th parliament, but it certainly will not be the last. The National Crime Authority has been much in the news over the past months. Some of the news, such as that about its role in the major heroin seizure in Victoria in October, has been positive; some of the news, such as the publicity surrounding the failed prosecution of John Elliott and his co-accused Elders IXL executives in August, has not been so positive. The committee has been closely monitoring the situation. It met with the authority in October and with the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) in November before resolving that it is time to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the authority. The committee proposes to start this evaluation early in the new year. It will be the committee's first major review of the authority's operation since 1991. This report deals with an error, which came to the committee's notice only in September this year, contained in the NCA's 1994-95 annual report. As the committee's report describes, the error was not one of great significance, being more a case of looseness in terminology than an intention to mislead the parliament. However, it has been seized on by some who have a clear agenda to undermine public confidence in the NCA. No government instrumentality is above or should be above constructive criticism, but care should be taken to ensure that criticism is both warranted and constructive. Nonetheless, the annual report was tabled in the House in October 1995. It is a matter of concern to the committee that the NCA did not see fit to alert the parliamentary joint committee in the previous parliament to the existence of this problem, despite its being Report identified shortly after the report's tabling. The current committee was advised only once the matter received adverse publicity. In fairness to the current NCA chairperson, John Broome, he appears to have sought to ensure that the committee was properly advised once it was a matter within his direct responsibility. The committee notes that the annual report for 1995-96 has still not been tabled in the parliament. We are a little concerned about that. It is a statutory duty of the committee to examine these annual reports. For an annual report to be helpful as an accountability document, it needs to be timely. It is now five months after the end of the financial year under report. Some of the events to be reported could be 17 months old. The reason for the lateness in the report's tabling will be one matter which the committee will pursue.",14
6,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"I think the parliament has a responsibility to be vigilant with organisations like the National Crime Authority because the parliament has conferred very special and considerable powers on those organisations. There is a responsibility to ensure that balances continue to be achieved between fundamental issues, such as the civil liberties of citizens, and public interest in ensuring an effective organisation that can adequately deal with increasingly sophisticated and organised crime. That is not always an easy balance to achieve. When an inaccuracy in an annual report of an organisation like the NCA comes to the attention of the parliament, it really is a matter that ought to attract somewhat greater debate than the five minutes we have currently got. Albeit that the particular inaccuracy is not of great significance substantively, as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority indicated, nonetheless, the point underlines the importance of requiring high standards from organisations like the NCA in their reporting requirements to parliament. As the chairman indicated, it is of particular regret that this relatively minor inaccuracy in the report has been used in a somewhat more broad ranging and asinine attack on the National Crime Authority in recent times. The Premier of Victoria in particular has been making ill-informed and asinine comments with respect to the NCA in recent times and, regrettably, at least one member of this chamber, the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), has been joining him in those assaults upon the organisation's performance. I think those comments are regrettable. They are matters that require more than the very limited time that we have in this debate to deal with them. I look forward to this debate coming back to this chamber in a more leisurely way. I defer to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), who wishes to speak as well.",15
7,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"I would also like to add my comments to the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. If I can first comment on the error in the NCA's 1994-95 annual report. It is a matter of serious note and something that in my view should have been brought to our attention earlier. In my view there are some grounds for the House to take a dim view of this sort of problem-a problem where the House has been misinformed in relation to what is not necessarily an integral matter to the authority's performance but, nonetheless, is a matter of some concern. In the time outstanding I would like to talk about one of the things that still remains as the authority's great inquiries-that is, the unresolved matter of the bombing of the NCA office in Adelaide and the murder of Detective Sergeant Geoffrey Bowen.",15
8,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for MCPherson wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,15
9,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,15
10,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Procedure Committee Report",15
11,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled Review of reports of previous Procedure Committees which have not received a government response, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",15
12,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMITTEES,"The Procedure Committee has been established for nearly 12 years. In that time it has presented 25 reports, not including this one. Some of those reports have led to significant improvements in the way the House does its business-for example, the introduction of a dedicated time each week for private members business and, more recently, the institution of the Main Committee. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, a number of the committee's reports have not received any response by the House or the government of the day. Included in a schedule of parliamentary committee reports tabled by the Speaker on 9 May this year to which the previous government had not responded were 10 Procedure Committee reports which covered the period 1988 to 1995. In order of their tabling in this House, they were: The publication of tabled papers (1998) Committee procedures for dealing with witnesses (1989) The standing orders governing the conduct of committees of the House (1989) Responses to petitions (1990) A citizen's right of reply (1991) Disclosure of in camera evidence (1991) Seconding of private members' notices of motion (1992) The standing orders governing disorder and strangers (1992) Application of modern technology to committee proceedings (1994) Procedures for the opening of parliament (1995). When he responded on 27 June to the Speaker's schedule, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) requested that the new Procedure Committee review the findings of those reports with due regard to contemporary circumstances and in the light of changes that had been made since they were first presented. So far this year the Procedure Committee has tabled three further reports: The operation of standing order 143: questions to members other than ministers (presented 16 September 1996), Bills-Consideration in detail: review of the operation of standing order 226 (presented 28 October 1996), and The conduct of divisions (presented 18 November 1996)consideration of which it gave precedence Over the request by the Leader of the House. However, it has always been the committee's intention to take up his request before the of this session. The report I am tabling today constitutes the Procedure Committee's response to the government's request. The new Procedure Committee did not repeat the previous inquiries. It examined each report's recommendations primarily for relevance. However, in some cases the committee had reservations, and these are outlined in today's report. The committee requests that the new government respond to eight of the 10 reports, taking into account today's report's comments or suggested modifications. Specifically, the committee endorses, without qualification, the reports on The publication of tabled papers, Responses to petitions, A citizen's right of reply, Seconding of private members' notices of motion and the Application of modern technology to committee proceedings. The committee generally supports the reports on Disclosure of in camera evidence, The standing orders governing disorder and strangers and Procedures for the opening of Parliament, with some reservations or minor changes recommended for these reports. The recommendations of the two remaining reports (which deal with parliamentary committees) have been largely superseded, and a response to them would serve no useful purpose at this stage. It is the Procedure Committee's present intention to review the present operations of parliamentary committees in 1997. I should like to use this occasion to make a general comment about action on Procedure Committee reports. The reality of this House is that it looks to the government of the day to take the lead in initiating action to reform those procedures which require amendment to standing orders. Without the support of the government, attempts to improve procedures cannot succeed. Nevertheless, changes to the operations of this House affect all its members and are not just the concern of the government. We all have a responsibility to ensure that proposals get discussed so that private member's views are heard. It should also be mentioned that some Procedure Committee recommendations are matters to which the Speaker should respond, for examend ple, when they deal with the application of standing orders for which there exists procedural precedents. I commend the report to the House. In the few seconds that are left, I want to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of the committee and to other members of the House of Representatives Procedure Committee for the numerous meetings that the committee has entailed this year in order to get out four reports in a truncated year. I thank the committee for its hard work. I thank the secretariat-and, in particular, the secretary of the committee, Robyn Webber-for their willing and hard work. I hope that Procedure Committee reports receive a better response from the government in future. I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.",15

The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Delegation to the 96th InterParliamentary Union Conference, Beijing, and bilateral visits to Vietnam, Hong Kong and the Philippines",17
14,Mr HAWKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I would like to inform the House that, due to the unavoidable absence of the Speaker, the report will be presented at a later time. NA Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee",17
15,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Australia's relations with Southern Africa, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
16,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"I have pleasure today in tabling the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Australia's relations with Southern Africa. The inquiry commenced in April 1995 under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and had progressed to preliminary draft report stage when the election was called in January 1996. Following the re-establishment of the committee, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) formally re-referred the inquiry in August 1996 and the foreign affairs subcommittee, which I chair, then sought updated evidence. The inquiry focused on Australia's relations with those countries that make up the Southern African Development Community or SADC. There are 12 member states: Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland, Tanzania, South Africa and Mauritius. One of the difficulties facing the committee during the inquiry was that submissions largely focused on South Africa and, to a lesser extent, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. This may be due to the limited knowledge in Australia of many of the smaller African countries but is also a reflection of the dominant role of South Africa in the region. We took particular care, however, to stress in our hearings that we were not conducting an inquiry into just South Africa but that we wanted to examine Australia's contacts with the region more broadly. Clearly, there is enormous diversity among the SADC members. As we note in the report, unfortunately many Australians still perceive Africa in terms of stereotypes. When the media reports on Africa, it tends to show the ethnic conflicts, such as we have seen recently in Report Rwanda and Zaire, or humanitarian emergencies arising from civil war or drought. However, there are many success stories that are still to be told and southern Africa has more than its share, being described as a 'beacon of hope' in Africa, particularly in the last five years. Southern Africa is one of the most democratic regions in Africa, with successful multiparty elections having been held recently in Malawi, Mozambique and Namibia. Of course, there has also been South Africa's transition to a multi-racial democracy. While the successes to date have been encouraging, we must not be complacent. Much remains to be done, and the peace in both Mozambique and Angola remains very fragile indeed. Mr Acting Speaker, in the short time. I have today, it would be remiss of me not to say a few words about South Africa and the remarkable transformation that is occurring in that country. Few commentators a decade ago would have believed that the South Africa of today was possible. Much of the successful transition to a multi-party democracy can be attributed to President Nelson Mandela. While he did not do it alone, he was crucial to the whole process and remains a potent moral symbol for the new South Africa and throughout the African continent. While there are some concerns in the leadup to the 1999 elections in which President Mandela has indicated that he will not stand, there is a depth of talent among the various political parties in South Africa that augurs well for the future. Negotiations on the draft South African constitution have demonstrated a willingness by most participants to work within the system to achieve the best possible outcome. It is of concern, however, that the Inkatha Freedom Party under Chief Buthelezi, although still part of the Government of National Unity, did not participate in the constitutional reform process and is still seeking a high degree of autonomy for the Kwazulu-Natal province. South Africa's economic success is vital not only for its own population but for all of Africa. It produces 42 per cent of Africa's industrial output and generates 60 per cent of Africa's power. It produces 75 per cent of Africa's iron and steel. It mines 40 per cent of Africa's minerals. It carries 65 per cent Africa's total freight. It produces 40 per cent of Africa's food. Mr Acting Speaker, the figures speak for themselves. However, it has a narrow export base. Large sections of the population are unskilled and uneducated. Unemployment is about 45 per cent, and a significant number of highly skilled South Africans have emigrated during the past 20 years. It is clear that many challenges lie ahead. There is much that I could speak on today: the business opportunities for Australian companies in southern Africa; the educational links that are being established between Australian universities and those in the SADC countries; the involvement of a number of the SADC states in the Indian Ocean rim process; and the real needs that exist and will continue to exist for many years to come. However, time limitations simply allow me to refer honourable members to the report. Mr Acting Speaker, I thank everyone who assisted the committee in its work. I thank committee members who participated in the inquiry, and I commend the report to the House. I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.",17
17,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Treaties Committee Report",18
18,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Treaties tabled on 15 and 29 October 1996-4th report together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed. Mr TA YLORToday I table the committee's fourth report since September this year. It examines 17 non-controversial of treaties which were tabled on 15 and 29 October 1996. Two other treaties tabled on 15 October are not dealt with in this report: protocol IV, dealing with blinding laser weapons; and the amended protocol II, dealing with landmines, to the Inhumane Weapons Convention. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) was advised soon after tabling that the committee would undertake a short inquiry into these important documents and would report on them as early as practicable in 1997. The committee supports the ratification of all the treaties dealt with in this report. It makes only one formal recommendation, which is that Australia should press for the extension of the Convention on Nuclear Safety to include research reactors of the type at Lucas Heights in New South Wales. Today's tabling, however, provides an opportunity to review our first few months work, which I am sure all members would agree have been interesting and productive. In the four reports, we have covered a total of 50 treaties, commenting specifically on 28 of them. Productive as our first few months have been, we are still establishing our own processes, as we aim towards a consistent approach. We have found that certain types of treaties, such as investment protection agreements or air service agreements, are occurring in successive batches. Unless examples vary from model texts, we will not be commenting specifically on some of these in future reports. Although the treaties dealt with in this report were all non-controversial, they raised some issues which deserve comment. We continue to have concerns about both the quantity and quality of consultation with the states and territories. As this report reiterates, the revised treaty making process announced on 2 May by the Minister for Foreign Affairs was established in part to ensure the inclusion of the views of the states and territories on treaties proposed for ratification. They have legal responsibilities for some of the matters on which the Commonwealth enters into binding international obligations for Australia. We have not made a recommendation on this matter, but we believe that national interest analyses should in future include information on the actual responses received from the states and 'territories about the texts of the treaties proposed for accession. For example, an examination of one of the treaties in the group tabled on 15 October revealed that an important industry organisation had not been consulted. Although support was forthcoming from that organisation as a result of the committee's review process, this oversight was a matter of concern. Just as the committee has had to establish and adjust its own processes in a short time, so the coordinating activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade need a chance to settle down. This includes our suggestions for further administrative improvements to the revised treaty making process. However, we will be devoting some attention in future to ensuring that, as far as possible, appropriate consultation has taken place with all interested parties. In its short existence, the committee has dealt with a wide range and a large number of treaties. It might be said that we have not provided much time for input by the community. To some extent, that is true, Under the revised procedures, we aim to table reports on treaties as close as possible to the end of the 15 sitting day period specified in the resolution of both houses. So far, there have been six tablings of various numbers of treaties under the new arrangements. The 15 sitting day rule has made it difficult to seek and receive comments or submissions on these documents. In the case of our third report, Two international agreements on tuna, which was tabled two weeks ago, we were able to seek and receive substantial community comments. We then held public hearings and inspections in Canberra, Hobart, Perth, Port Lincoln and Adelaide. Many organisations and individuals with an interest in the tuna industry gave us their knowledge and experience. We believe as a result of this that the report has made a contribution not only to the treaty making process but also to the Australian tuna industry. We thank ordinary Australians for making that possible. The level of response to this relatively simple inquiry demonstrated the genuine interest in the treaty making process throughout Australia. It would be a mistake to assume that treaty making can now be conducted in isolation from the Australian community. Thus we believe that we are already fulfilling the purpose for which we were established: to provide parliamentary scrutiny of the treaties Australia proposes to enter before these documents are ratified. In particular, I would like to place on record the committee's appreciation for the cooperation and assistance it has received from all the ministers and their departments with whom and with which we have dealt. I particularly want to thank my deputy chair, the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), and all members of the committee for their interest and participation. The committee depends heavily on its secretariat, and I thank Peter Stephens and his team for their alacrity and professionalism under testing conditions. I commend the report to the House. I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.",18
19,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be an order of the day for the next sitting, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Delegation to India and Pakistan",20
20,Mr NUGENT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to India and Pakistan from 25 August to 6 September 1996. A delegation from this parliament went to India and Pakistan in August and September of this year, led by Senator Minchin, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, and comprised of Senator Tierney, the honourable gentleman from Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) and me. I would like to start by extending our thanks to the government of India, which hosted us most graciously. They gave us a very interesting time, showed us many interesting sights in India and afforded us every hospitality. I would also like to extend thanks to the government of Pakistan, which similarly treated us extremely well. I would also like to record our thanks to the staff of the Australian 'High Commissions in India and Pakistan for the work they did in arranging the trip, in accompanying us and in ensuring that we got full value from that trip. Finally, I would like to thank the secretary of the delegation, Mr Jim Pender, a clerk of this House, who gave us outstanding support. We have little time in this chamber to debate these reports, so I will keep things moving as the honourable gentleman for Maribyrnong wishes to say a few words, Let me say that in India we visited New Delhi, Bangalore, and Mumbai, which is the name by which Bombay is known these days. We saw many political, business and community leaders, including the Prime Minister. We held wide ranging talks on trade, human rights, Australian aid, defence, regional matters and, a topical issue at that time, the nuclear test ban treaty. Such discussions were about to be debated at the United Nations and were discussions on which we and India had substantially different views. We were also there just before the New Horizons promotion of Australia's products in India, so it was very timely from that point of view. In Pakistan we visited Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, the Khyber Pass and the commercial capital, Karachi. We met the president and many other ministers and leaders of the community, including Australian business people in that country. Again, we had talks in terms of trade, the human rights situationwhich I have to say is not good and on which I will elaborate on another occasion-aid and the concerns in that country that we have cut back much of our aid which is sorely needed. We had demonstrations of de-mining activities and we also talked about defence and regional issues. About one week after the delegation was there, the brother of Prime Minister Bhutto was assassinated and Prime Minister Bhutto was subsequently removed by the president. So that highlighted some of the volatility of activity in that particular country. I think it would be fair to say that it was an arduous trip; it was also interesting. The size of the population is staggering. India's population increases every 18 months by the total size of the Australian population. So the size and the poverty that hits you are quite beyond our normal comprehension and are something that we need to recognise. Security issues are a concern. There are major trade opportunities for Australian companies if they are prepared to persevere. Overall, I believe it was a worthwhile and beneficial trip for both Australia and the host governments. I look forward to being able to renew the opportunity of going there in the future.",20
21,Mr SERCOMBE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"It is a pleasure to associate myself with the remarks of the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in relation to the trip. Perhaps the only additional bit of information that I can add is that we have come to the conclusion that Liberal bellies are nowhere near as good as Labor bellies when it comes to travelling in the subcontinent. Pakistan, in particular, was an interesting leg of the trip for me and I think for other members of the delegation. I think that Pakistan tends in the Australian consciousness to be somewhat overshadowed by its larger neighbour, India, and that is pretty understandable. I would suggest that in the medium to longer term Pakistan is a country which this country would be well advised to pay particularly close attention to for a variety reasons, not the least being commercial reasons. Pakistan is a strategically located country, linking the subcontinent with the Middle East and with the emerging nations and economies of central Asia. From the point of view of the medium and longer term, I believe it is a most important country for Australia to pay attention to. I think some of the complexities of the issues there are illustrated by the fact that one of Australia's largest companies is very much involved in serious discussion and serious work in relation to developing a gas pipeline from Iran to Pakistan. That is an issue which, with the recent success we may have achieved with the United States, might present a new challenge for the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) to address. It is an area where a very large Australian corporation may very well be disadvantaged by the operation of US law. In India, the runs are rapidly coming on the board. India is already Australia's 19th largest trading partner. I was somewhat pleasantly surprised to learn that Australia is India's seventh largest source of foreign investment. The relationship is developing rapidly.",21
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Mr Nehl)Order! The time alloted for statements on this report has expired. Delegation to the OECD Roundtable and Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea",21
23,Mr BRADFORD,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the OECD round-table, Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea, 17 June to 5 July 1996. I must say what a privilege it was to have been asked by the Speaker to lead this particular delegation. In the limited time that is available, I would like to do a couple of things. Firstly, I thank the members of the delegation: the deputy leader, Senator Jim MCKiernan; and the members, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), Senator Brian Harradine and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). We had a very busy schedule and I appreciated the depth of cooperation I received from the members of the delegation and the commitof ment they had to the many tasks which we set ourselves. I would like to pay tribute and thank also the many staff we met of the various embassies in the countries that we visited. Particularly I would like to thank His Excellency Mr Ralph Hillman, our permanent delegate at the OECD; His Excellency Mr Alan Brown, who I think has recently returned to Australia or is about to, who is ambassador to France. The OECD visit was extremely beneficial. Of course, the OECD is important to Australia, and Australia is an important contributing member of the OECD. Perhaps one of the most important meetings we had while we were at the OECD was our meeting with the new secretary-general, Mr Donald Johnson; that was an extremely productive meeting. We made a couple of recommendations. One in particular is with respect to the OECD round-table. That deals particularly with the amount of preparation time that we had. I suppose delegations might like to leave earlier. Three weeks is a long time to be away from home and be as busy as we were. But we make the point there that, to do a good job of representing Australia at these sorts of conferences, there needs to be adequate time for preparation and, indeed, I think, some continuity in the constituents of the delegation. That is a point that has been made by previous delegations to the OECD. It is not an argument for more travel benefits for members of delegations; it is simply a pragmatic and, I think, worthwhile consideration being given to us making a serious and ongoing contribution to the OECD. I move very quickly on and pay particular tribute to, and thank, His Excellency John Trotter, who is High Commissioner to Kenya and Ambassador to Ethiopia and Eritrea. Mr Trotter and his staff, while the delegation was there, provided us with an enormous amount of support. They travelled with us. They were extremely helpful, and the briefings they gave us were extremely valuable. I thank them. I thank also Andrew Snedden, who came as secretary to the delegation. He was very committed, and I think most of our arrangements worked extremely smoothly. Our visit to the north of Africa was, of course, to a troubled part of the world. To the east of the countries we visited is Somalia, to the west is the Sudan and, of course, it is not too far from Rwanda-Burundi and where the latest troubled part is, in Zaire. We learned a lot about the area. 1 believe we represented Australia well in the context of foreign aid, which is controversial. We were proud to be Australian members of parliament visiting Australian aid projects in these countries and seeing the contribution that a wealthy nation can make to the welfare of those whom we found, of course, were very much poorer than ourselves.",21
24,Mr OCONNOR,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I would like to extend my thanks to the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and other members of the delegation for their cooperation and the professional way in which they approached the work of the delegation in the countries we visited. I would briefly like to confine my comments to the African leg of the delegation's visit to Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea. It was my first visit to the African continent and these countries, and I guess the overwhelming impression that came through to me was the different sets of problems and priorities that these countries have when compared with Australia. Their No. 1 problem is, of course, food security and a lack of infrastructure which precludes them from making the sorts of gains in an economic development sense that they should. I think the overwhelming impression that came through to us is that political stability in these countries is absolutely essential to their economic and social development. We met, particularly in Ethiopia and Eritrea, leaders of these countries, some of whom had been in the field 20 to 30 years engaged in civil war and who now had the most difficult task of economic and social reconstruction in their countries. I would particularly like to thank our host countries and the officials and politicians in Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea. It was a most memorable visit, I think, to these countries and one which was enjoyed by all members of the delegation. I would just place on record my thanks also to our secretary, Andrew Snedden, for his professional support during our time away from Australia. The quality of the staff that we have here in the confines of this parliament and indeed at our overseas posts never ceases to amaze me. So, to the other members of the delegation, to all the public servants who briefed us, to the embassy staff who made our stay a most memorable one and, of course, to our host countries, I thank you. QUARANTINE AMENDMENT lULL (No.2) 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Fitzgibbon.",22
25,Mr FITZGIBBON,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Hunter) (1.13 p.m.)The bill I am introducing into the parliament today proposes to amend the Quarantine Act 1908 only so far as is necessary to place in the hands of the minister responsible for the act the power to approve or deny applications from other nations to import products such as cooked chicken meat, salmon, apples and pears into this country. This bill is about quarantine and maximising the protection of our local product from disease. It seeks to do no more than what was unanimously recommended by the all-party Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee and deserves the support of every member of this parliament. Prior to the March election, the then shadow minister but now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) gave the chicken industry, in particular, certain commitments in writing. However, since then he has attempted to walk away from these commitments, using his apparent lack of power under the act as it now stands as an excuse. This bill, if supported, will give him that power. It will give him the opportunity to make good on his promises. What this bill is not about is trade. It does not suggest in any way that I or the parliamentary Labor Party are anything but absolutely committed to trade liberalisation and all the benefits that flow to this nation as a result. The bill is simply designed to provide our local industries with the greatest possible protection from diseases which hitherto have not existed on this continent. In recent weeks I have heard the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and other government members suggest that this move will seek to politicise the decision making process. To that I say good, because while we must be seen to be arriving at these decisions in such a way as to meet our international obligations and commitments, and while the final decision should be based on science alone, the question for the decision maker in this case is: what is an acceptable risk? The question is not: can we import these products without any risk at all? The question is: what is an acceptable risk? That decision should not be made by veterinarians, scientists or bureaucrats. This a question which should be determined by the minister of the day. For example, governments rely on Treasury advice when setting fiscal policy, but they do not, I hopealthough I am beginning to wonder-allow Treasury officials to make decisions about, for example, the balance between fiscal consolidation and the benefits that flow from it and its social ramifications. Likewise, the final decision about what is an acceptable quarantine risk should be made by those who are properly accountable to the parliament and answerable to the Australian people, because the consequences of a bad decision for our chicken, salmon and certain horticultural industries could be their total devastation. I note that in the Australian last week Minister Anderson referred to those in the chicken industry who have been expressing their concern as immature reactionaries. I know that honourable members on the backbench on the other side do not believe them to be immature reactionaries and I can assure you that no-one on this side considers them to be immature reactionaries. They are reasonable people with valid concerns about their industry and their industry's future. It is a $2 billion industry which employs tens of thousands of Australians directly and many more indirectly. It is a 100 per cent Australian owned industry. I am rather disappointed that those government regional and rural members are not in here to support this bill today-not one of them. This is an industry that just cannot come to grips with the contrast between the minister's present position and the position he held prior to the March election. I call upon the government to allow my private member's bill a second reading in order that this issue can be properly and thoroughly debated. Alternatively, I call upon it to introduce its own legislation to produce the same result. I do not care who sponsors the amendments. What is important is that those sitting on both sides of this chamber get the opportunity to express their views on this matter. There could be no more reasonable a proposition than to ask the parliament to is support a bill that does no more than empower the minister in order that such a huge slice of the Australian economy might be protected from disease. I ask honourable members to commit themselves to supporting my bill. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted. Bill read a first time.",22
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Mr Nehl)Order! In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Burma-Thailand Railway Debate resumed from 18 November, on motion by Mr Truss: That this House: (1) acknowledges the great heroism and sacrifice of Australia's prisoners of war, in particular those who worked on the Burma-Thailand railway; (2) commends the Government on its initiative to construct a museum and memorial to prisoners of war near Hellfire Pass in Thailand;. (3) commends Mr Rod Beattie and his associates for their work in clearing a 4km walking trail along the Burma-Thailand railway at Hellfire Pass; and (4) calls on Australian companies, ex-service organisations and other countries whose service personnel also worked on the railway to support the Prisoner of War Memorial Project.",24
27,Mr MCARTHUR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am delighted today to speak on the Burma-Thailand Railway Prisoner of War Memorial, as I, with other members of this House in a parliamentary delegation, visited that particular memorial. It was a very moving experience to be there in that jungle and experience the horrific monsoonal conditions. Although on that occasion it was just quite normal, one could understand what those prisoners went through during the hostilities. The death railway, as it is known, is well known to many Australians and touches almost all Australian families throughout the nation, because they know a friend or have a relation that had something to do with the death railway. The film, The Bridge on the River Kwai, made an internationally recognised statement of what actually happened on that railway and the horrific number of people that were killed. Likewise the ashes of Australian war hero Weary Dunlop are spread at Hellfire Pass. That adds further significance to this particular memorial. The reason I think that this parliament should acknowledge and recognise this memorial is that it will help us understand the inhuman treatment, by the Japanese, of the Australians, British, Dutch and the local Asian labourers that took place during this part of World War II. I do support the activities of Mr Rod Beattie whom the delegation met. He was working particularly hard to upgrade the memorial and keep it in good condition and was advocating the reinstatement of certain sections of the line and that a locomotive be placed on the line as a memorial to that whole struggle. The visit to the cemetery at Kanchanaburi is a very moving experience when you see the number of people buried there-particularly the Australians, the Dutch and the Englishand their ages, and when you think that some of them were young and some were a bit older. They died so tragically during this horrific time. The Burma-Thailand railway, by way of background, had 61,000 prisoners, basically British, Dutch and Australians-our own Australians numbered about 13,000. You can add that number to that of the Asian labourers, of whom there were about 100,000. Some 94,000 people died. A large proportion of these were, of course, of Asian background, but 13,000 of the allied prisoners died in this terrible incident. The rationale for building the railway was to ensure that goods could be moved to suit the Japanese army so that they would not be subjected to the difficulties of transport by sea. Basically, the idea was to build the railway from Bangkok to Moulmein in northern Burma. The fall of Singapore brought about a problem for the Japanese imperial forces. They had large numbers of prisoners and no compounds to deal with them. Therefore, the idea of building a railway solved two difficulties. One, it created an infrastructure to help them with their war effort and, two, it allowed them to give some of these prisoners something to do. The very poor health and food of the prisoners was, as the records indicated, quite horrific. Accommodation was basically non-existent. Malaria was rife. Dysentery was forever present. Vitamin deficiencies meant that those prisoners from Europe suffered greatly. So the Burma railway, and Hellfire Pass in particular, were a manifestation of this quite horrific section of the war in Asia. Hellfire Pass has got 60,000 feet of very difficult rock that was hewn out almost solely by human hand. The way in which some of the very crude machinery was used, running 24 hours a day under very strongly militaristic Japanese guards, really defies the imagination when you are actually there and get down into Hellfire Pass. It was constructed during the worse monsoon for many years. The plaque that is now there demonstrating the wonderful life of Weary Dunlop and the further upgrading of the pass is to be commended to the House. I commend the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) for bringing it to our attention. I hope the House will act on the motion.",24
28,Mr HOLLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Throsby) (1.24 p.m.)Certain names are synonymous with Australian history, especially Australian military history. ANZAC Cove, the Somme, El Alamein and the Kokoda Trail all record outstanding feats of endurance and battle which many argue helped formulate the concept of the Australian nation. Hellfire Pass is also immediately recognised as a symbol of endurance and valour, but it is different from the others in that it does not commemorate so much a battle as a feat of human endeavour and comradeship that is uniquely Australian. For it was the building of the Burma railway by the prisoners of war that is symbolised by the term Hellfire Pass, indeed the geographic location of Hellfire Pass. No-one can visit this spot without being moved by the experience and overwhelmed by the physical contribution that was required of those prisoners of war. One in five of the prisoners who worked on the railway perished, including 2,710 Australians. The death toll among the conscripted 200,000 Asian labourers was even worse. At least 80,000 were thought to have perished. Some 1,000 Japanese also died. In all, one life was lost every five metres of the track. Even most of those who returned were irrevocably changed. Is it any wonder, then, that this project, though of engineering significance, was named the death railway? The Hellfire Pass memorial project will help record some of the history and memorabilia from that time. The Australian government has taken the lead on this project, and the Thai government has also been a very active partner. This is not intended to be a memorial only for Australians; there were actually more British and Dutch paws working and lost on the railway than there were Australians. Hopefully, the British, Dutch, American, Malaysian and other governments, along with POW associations and other ex-service groups, will support the project and help bring it to fruition. The Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce has played a major role. I hope that Australian and other overseas companies working in Thailand will also lend their support to this important project. As has been reported, this memorial does provide an awareness for people who visit Hellfire Pass of the sacrifice that was made by Australians and, equally, by representatives and members of serving personnel of other countries. They, like the Australians, were captured, were prisoners of war and had to endure the sorts of conditions that some of us can only dream about in terms of their severity, in terms of the way in which humankind can subject other members of humankind to such things. In 1990, as part of a Foreign Affairs Committee delegation to Thailand I, along with that committee, visited Hellfire Pass. Indeed, the present Speaker led that part of the delegation. We all took part in a wreath laying ceremony on Hellfire Pass. It is important that Hellfire Pass as part of our history be remembered and, indeed, those who worked on the Burma railway be honoured. It is therefore fitting that this museum be constructed so that the sacrifice of those who worked on Hellfire Pass be permanently remembered. I want to particularly commend the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) for for bringing this motion to the House and for his very close involvement in it. I am pleased that both the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Scott) and the shadow minister are presently in the chamber for this debate. They have both very strongly supported this project, as I know all members of this chamber have. I look forward at some later time to visiting Hellfire Pass again and seeing the museum when it is completed.",25
29,Mr ANTHONY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I rise to speak on this motion put forward by the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I support it because of a recent visit that I had not to Hellfire Pass but to the prison of Changi in Singapore. I was most moved by the terrible horrors that Australians went through in that occupation. I now refer to Hellfire Pass and would like to quote from a publication by the Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce which says: ... to pay respect to those who gave so much (and to the many who gave everything) in those hellish times in such hellish circumstances, now over 50 years ago. No memorial can ever depict the horror of these places-to describe the debt owed to those valiant people. So many secrets will remain locked in the minds of those who were there and in the minds of those who remain-lost still in the ... at Kanchanaburi in war cemeteries. Or at Hellfire Pass. Naturally this is the only true memorial where we can say, 'Lest we forget,' to those 2,800 Australians who lost their lives in building this notorious railway, and indeed to the other 16,000 Allied POWs and the 90,000 Asian labourers-out of 200,000-who lost their lives on this 415 kilometre rail line that was built from Moulmein to Ban Pong. In this particular area the ashes of the legendary Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop now rest. He was a man who, in those terrible conditions, gave so much to our Australian prisoners of war. You have to ask yourself: why was this railway built? At the time it was built, during the Second World War, it was an important link to Burma for the Japanese. There was a fear at the time that the British occupational forces would attack from India. So this railway was a vital corridor that the Japanese Imperial Army needed to speed up the transportation of forces to that area. The railway was built in such horrendous circumstances. I would like to refer to some areas of Hellfire Pass. One section was over 500 yards long by about 25 feet high and another section was about 80 yards long by 80 feet high. At first the daily task was set at 1V2 metres per shift. That was increased within two days to two metres. By the end of the week it was three metres for each shift. The working hours there were up to 18 hours a day and many prisoners were beaten to death. Many prisoners were suffering from dysentery and other tropical diseases and died there. I congratulate the member for Wide Bay for bringing this motion to the House. I would like to visit that area, if I have the opportunity in the near future, because great gratitude must be given to Australians who, as prisoners of war, have died in theatres of war, as mentioned by the previous speakers. Certainly I am indebted to my grandfather, who was at Gallipoli, to all of those Australians who served in war, particularly those who lost their lives, and to a number of people who worked on the Burma railway who are living hills and forest in my electorate. There is a need to improve our commemorative memorial at Changi Prison. I do not think enough emphasis has been placed there. There has I10w been due recognition of Hellfire Pass and of that particular theatre of war. There also needs to be due recognition by this government, in cooperation with the Singapore government, of those prisoners of war who began their incarceration in Singapore as well as recognition of what happened on the Burma railway. I commend the member for Wide Bay for bringing this motion to the House. I commend those who have been involved with the Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce, the Snowy Mountain electric scheme and the original engineers who defined the Hellfire Pass. I also commend the recent visit by those members of this parliament to that memorial in Thailand.",26
30,Mr JENKINS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I have pleasure in rising in support of the motion moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). If we look at the motion and at what it says, we see that it is an attempt to acknowledge the great heroism and sacrifice of Australia's prisoners of war, in particular those who worked on the Burma-Thailand railway. So it talks not only about those who were working on the Burma-Thailand railway but prisoners of war in general. The thing that strikes me about the story of the BurmaThailand railway is that it encapsulates the types of heroic sacrifices that were made by prisoners of war especially during the Second World War. It was my fortune to be the leader of a delegation to Thailand in September of last year. We were able to visit Hellfire Pass. To say that this was a moving occasion is an understatement, because it crystallises the many stories that people have heard about that railway. As we walked down the stairways that had been built and along the cutting, a gentleman abseiled down the side of a cutting. He was a fairly rugged-looking Australian type who introduced himself as Rod Beattie. I was interested in an article in the Age on 26 November. Rod Beattie is quoted as saying: There are some people who think I'm crazy ... But I don't care what they think. I care what men think. Of course, those men that he is talking about are the 12,000 American, Australian, British, Dutch and other prisoners of war who died as labourers along the railway. As the motion moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay states, Rod and other volunteers have worked to clear the walking trail near Hellfire Pass. Because of the tropical regeneration, this is an ongoing task which Rod continues almost single-handedly. He is in charge of the two war cemeteries nearby, at Kanchanaburi and Chungkai. We were able to visit one of those and we had a wreath laying ceremony there. They are very fine memorials to those who lost their lives during the Second World War. The motion also calls on Australian companies, ex-service organisations and those from other countries that were involved to support the prisoner of war memorial project. That is quite appropriate. But, in talking about the prisoner of war project and commending not only this government but also the previous government for the support of the project, I would like to make this plea: that we involve to the greatest extent not only the Thai government, which has given support for the project, but also the local community. I have made observations before that, whether it be aid projects or memorial projects such as this one, Australia has always demonstrated an ability to include those people who live locally and involve them in ensuring that the types of efforts that we are trying to achieve are achieved properly. This debate is not about commemorating in some warped way a sense of war; it is very much to commemorate the sufferings that were endured by the prisoners in the construction of the railway. Hellfire Pass, for those who visit it, is very much, we hope, a memorial of lasting peace. I can remember in the run-up to the bicentennial, when the Australian government's involvement in this project was first suggested, that there was some criticism. The then minister for local government and administrative services, the former member for Reid, Tom Uren, was called upon to make some comments in response to these those criticisms of Australia being involved. The project was seen as in some way glorifying the efforts of the Japanese. He said on that occasion: There is no progress in hate. As he said in his book, when people asked him after he returned from the war whether he hated the Japanese, he would reply, 'No, I don't hate the Japanese. I just hate fascism and militarism.' That is really what this memorial is about. The plaque commemorating Weary Dunlop's life has these words: When you go home tell them of us and say we gave our tomorrow for your today. There can be no greater lasting tribute to those who died on the Hellfire Pass. (Time expired)",26
31,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Boothby) (1.38 p.m.)I would like to support the motion of the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and address it from a very personal perspective. My grandfather was a prisoner of war on the Burma-Thailand railway. Like many of the Australian, British and Dutch POWs of that time, he faced debilitating bouts of malaria, periodic diseases of malnutrition, like beriberi, and tropical ulcers. I would not be alone in this chamber in having a close relative who was on the Burma-Thailand railway. Of course, former minister Tom Uren was there and the father of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) spent World War II in Changi. I believe that the uncle of former Prime Minister Paul Keating did not survive the Bataan death march. There were 9,500 Australian POWs who worked on the Burma-Thailand railway along with 51,000 British, Dutch and American POWs and 270,000 conscripted Asian civilians. The conditions were appalling, the treatment brutal. Food and medicine were in short supply and, as a consequence, tropical diseases and malnutrition were common. But suffering a bout of malaria could sometimes be fortuitous. My grandfather was selected to go on a transport back to Japan and, as some members who have a keen knowledge of military history will be aware, many prisoners of war died on those transports back to Japan when they were sunk by the allies. It took the allies some time to realise that they were actually sinking POWs. My grandfather was very fortunate; he had a bout of malaria, which probably saved his life. Around 2,800 Australians died in the construction of the railway. Many of them are buried at Kanchanaburi lawn cemetery, not far from Hellfire Pass. The death rate for Australian servicemen ranged from 12 per cent for Weary Dunlop's forces to the appalling rate of 29 per cent for F Force, which left Singapore in April 1943. But, surprisingly, the death rate for Australians was significantly lower than the death rates for the English and Dutch POWs. This has been put down to the greater cooperation that existed between the Australian POWs. How did my grandfather end up there? He was serving in Malaya for over a year before the outbreak of war with the Japanese. He was at Kota Bharu when the Japanese task force first attacked the British and Australian forces. Of course, they attacked all over the Pacific. It was actually an Australian in a Hudson bomber who first encountered the Japanese task force. He was able to let the United States and others know that British and Australian forces were under attack on the Malayan peninsula two hours before Pearl Harbour was bombed and six to eight hours before the Philippines were bombed. As people would remember, it was one of the great mysteries that General Douglas MACArthur, who was in the Philippines at the time, was aware that Pearl Harbour had been bombed but did nothing. As a result, the losses he faced in the Philippines were quite devastating. After that attack, many Australians died in the retreat along the Malayan peninsula, in the battle for Singapore and in the turmoil that occurred in the Dutch East Indies. Those who survived became POWs for the duration of the war. It is incredible to think now, in the 1990s, that my grandmother did not see her husband for five years and my father did not see his own father until he was five years old. But they were very fortunate: my grandfather turned 80 last month. I commend the government for building this memorial. I also agree with this motion, which acknowledges the great heroism and sacrifice of Australia's prisoners of war, especially those who worked on the railway. The value o(the memorial will be that future generations will have some realisation of what happened there and why war should be avoided in the future.",27
32,Mr TRUSS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"by leave-I thank all members who have contributed so far to this debate. I am grateful for the contributions they have made. In view of the interest that has been expressed in this motion, perhaps additional time could be allocated to the debate to continue it at some stage in the future. This subject has touched the hearts of many members on both sides of the chamber. As the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) so accurately pointed out just a moment ago, so many of us are close to someone who was there. In my case, the visit to Hellfire Pass was especially moving because my father-in-law was amongst the people who worked on the railway line. He received an honour for his contribution in building radios to keep the prisoners of war aware of what was happening in the world while they were prisoners. I have visited the Great Wall of China and I have been to the Mexican pyramids, Lake Eyre and the Great Barrier Reef, but no place has really moved me like Hellfire Pass. I visited it with the knowledge that so many of my fellow Australians of an earlier generation had suffered and contributed so much so that we and future generations of Australians, could enjoy the great country and great freedom and liberty we have today. Many people have made sacrifices and contributions, and it is so appropriate that they are being recognised through this memorial project at present.",28
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 1.45 p.m. the debate is interrupted, in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Paralympian of the Year Awards",29
34,Mr MARTIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Wednesday evening, 27 November, it was my great pleasure as the shadow minister for sport to attend the Paralympian of the Year awards dinner at the Wentworth Hotel. It is interesting to note that the Australian paralympic team at the Atlanta Paralympic Games did exceptionally well in finishing second in the overall medal tally, having won 42 gold, 37 silver and 27 bronze medals. Those medals were won in athletics, boccia, men's basketball, cycling, lawn bowls, judo, powerlifting, swimming, tennis and shooting. On this particular night, the opportunity was taken to pay homage to all of those paralympic athletes that represented this great country and, in particular, to single out one of them for the accolade of being judged the paralympian of the year. The major contenders were Kingsley Bugarin, Gemma Dashwood and Priya Cooper for swimming, Anthony Clarke for judo, Louise Sauvage for athletics, and Terri Poole and Sandra Smith for cycling. I do not think it came as a surprise to anyone that Louise Sauvage was again adjudged the paralympian of the year. Those who saw her compete in the 800 metre demonstration race during the able bodied Olympics in Atlanta saw the power this woman possesses. She is a great role model for athletes-not only able bodied but certainly also those that in some way are disabled. As Alan Jones said on the night, she is an outstanding athlete in her own right. (Time expired) South Australian Labor Party",29
35,Ms WORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to inform the House of yet another Labor stunt in South Australia. They have been running a 'Labor has been listening' theme, involving meetings and questionnaires. One state Labor member said on radio that now that Labor was in opposition it was listening. There have been reports of meetings where only one or two people have turned up, and so few people have responded to surveys that we are now having a stunt whereby those who fill in a survey will be rewarded by being in a draw for a Myer voucher worth $450. The incentive to give the ALP one's full name, address and phone number is to be in the draw for extra Christmas shopping money at Myer. The draw is to be performed by the opposition leader, Mr Rann, on Friday 20 December. I am reliably informed that Myer is outraged and is considering taking legal action. They were not consulted before being drawn into this little stunt. At some stage, Labor will no doubt attempt to make use of the information gained in such a shabby way. People should treat any results with the contempt they deserve. No poll results will have any credibility or sincerity. Labor is not truly listening but once again just playing silly games. Second Sydney Airport",29
36,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Blacktown Association Against Aircraft Noise has presented me with a petition, signed by 2,600 residents of western Sydney, opposing the construction of an airport at Badgerys Creek. I intend to submit that petition to both the minister for Transport (Mr Sharp) and the shadow minister for transport. Opposition to a 24-hour international airport at Badgerys Creek has also been expressed by Pam Allen, the New South Wales Minister for the Environment; Gabrielle Harrison, the New South Wales Minister for Sport and Recreation; John Aquilina, the New South Wales Minister for Education; Faye Lo Po, the New South Wales Minister for Women; Carl Scully, the New South Wales Minister for Public Works; Kim Yeaden, the New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation; Jim Anderson, the member for St Marys; Diane Beamer, the member for Badgerys Creek; and Paul Gibson, the member for Londonderry. The petition, signed by residents of western Sydney, expresses concern about the safety, health and financial security of residents of western Sydney as well as about noise, air and water pollution should this airport be built at Badgerys Creek. The two new proposals for Badgerys Creek announced by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) make provision for a much larger airport than was originally considered in 1983. This brings to the fore the coalition's pre-election statement that Badgerys Creek could become Sydney's major international airport. This is a concept that will be strongly opposed by the residents of western Sydney. (Time expired) Western Australian State Election",29
37,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Yesterday I was pleased to be able to attend the launch of the coalition campaign for this year's state election in Western Australia. In 1993, the West Australian coalition went to the people with the banner 'Good government, better management'. They have given Western Australia good government, unlike the corruption which came from WA Inc. under the previous Labor government. Currently, a former Labor premier has done time in gaol, a former Labor deputy premier is in gaol and a former Labor premier has lied to a royal commission. We are going to offer good government. With respect to better management, this state is now in surplus, having been heavily in debt before. It now is enjoying a far better credit rating, and youth unemployment is the lowest in this country. In fact, the level of unemployment in Western Australia is the lowest in the country. That is the better management that has been given to Western Australians. The Western Australian coalition is also innovative. The groundbreaking Pilbara to Kalgoorlie pipeline provides cheap energy to the outback and to the goldfields. This is a government that is also in the processing of sewering the unsewered 30 per cent of the metropolitan area which the previous government paid lip service to but would not do. The alternative is a return to deficit. (Time expired) Second Sydney Airport",30
38,Mr LATHAM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last month the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) released two options for Sydney'S second international airport at Holsworthy. Obviously the minister has not spoken to people who actually worked on the Holsworthy firing range, people like Ned Falconer in my electorate. Mr Falconer worked on the Holsworthy range between 1968 and 1984. Nobody knows the area better. He knows that the government's main problem in clearing unexploded ordnance from the site will be to actually locate all of the bombs. The official records held at Holsworthy are wildly inaccurate and incomplete. The E range, site of the government's southern airport option, has thousands of unexploded bombs which were simply not recorded at the time. After 50 years of shelling they are laid five and six deep, often having skipped across the ground more than a kilometre from the target site. Not only that, the terrain at E range features some ravines 50 to 100 metres in depth. Mr Falconer has described the site for the northern airport option-the D Range at Eckersley-as 'looking like the end of World War III'. It was the main demolition site at Holsworthy, with thousands of unexploded pieces of heavy artillery. The Holsworthy EIS should be abandoned. The study consultants will not be able to provide an accurate assessment of the unexploded ordnance problem as the army's records themselves are not accurate. There is simply no way by which the EIS can adequately deal with the huge volume of unrecorded, unexploded bombs at the D and E ranges at Holsworthy. Why doesn't the government just ask someone who worked there for 16 years- Mr Ned Falconer. Newhouse, Mr Harry",30
39,Mr LLOYD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is with great sadness that I wish to inform the House of the passing of Mr Harry Newhouse last week at the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home, which has been his home for many years. Mr Newhouse was the last surviving Gallipoli veteran on the Central Coast of New South Wales and one of only a handful of Gallipoli veterans still surviving in Australia. I wish to pass on my condolences to Mr Newhouse's family and note that with his passing another part of the ANZAC tradition has unfortunately now gone forever. A memorial service for Harry Newhouse was held today in Gosford and I believe that, whilst obviously I could not be in attendance because parliament is sitting, over 100 people attended that memorial service. I was very pleased to arrange messages of condolence which were read out from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and also from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), whom I had the privilege of introducing to Harry Newhouse only recently when he was in my electorate of Robertson. Harry, with his brother George, were part of the gallant ANZACs, who took part in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 and actually landed at Gallipoli on 26 April, the second day of the campaign. Mr Newhouse survived until the grand old age of 101 and certainly lived through many momentous events that shaped not only Australia but also the world. With the passing of Mr Newhouse it is vital that the memory of the ANZACs and the tradition for which they fought are kept alive and are never forgotten by future generations. Wallis Inquiry",31
40,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Batman)The Wallis inquiry into the financial system handed down an interim report last week. All Australians should carefully read the fine print and assess what effect the report will have on jobs. Four groups should be particularly wary: the young, the rural and regional work force, women, and part-time or casual workers. In the last five years we have seen 40,000 jobs disappear from the banking and financial sector thanks largely to new technology. In the next two to three years another 40,000 jobs will disappear-I know some members of the government think this is a joke-if the Wallis inquiry opens the gate to big bank mergers. The decision to allow bank mergers will be one of public policy. This parliament can make the decision not to allow bank mergers, not to allow further rationalisation of the top four banks, and in that way can save thousands upon thousands of jobs for Australians. I suggest that young people should be especially concerned. Traditionally many school leavers were given their first job opportunity through the banking system and, more particularly, in regional Australia. To my way of thinking, the public hearing process suggested by the Wallis inquiry is a mockery-one week of consultations, which excludes both territories and the state of Tasmania from that consultative process. Now is the time for this parliament to plan for the future of the finance sector, to recreate job opportunities for our young people and for the people in rural and regional Australia. (Time expired) Second Sydney Airport",31
41,Mr TUCKEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"1 had cause to rush up here after I heard scaremongering from the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) a moment ago when he was rabbiting on about the Holsworthy Range. He wants to be reminded about the electorate of Brand, the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), which has right in its middle a very large one-time military shelling range called the Warnbro Range, which is now covered with houses and business premises. In fact, the Tuckey family interests are there. Not even the heavy footfalls of the Leader of the Opposition have set off one explosion as he walked that area knocking on doors, begging for people to vote for him. As the record shows, nearly most of them failed to do so. The Leader of the Opposition should tell the member for Werriwa that it is possible to clean up a military range. I am not buying into the Holsworthy airport debate. I just do not want members coming in here showing that they are both physically and mentally deficient by not knowing what modern technology can do in this regard. That whole range was cleaned up and a beautiful beach was opened up. Admittedly we all signed a bit of paper that said if we dug a hole we might worry about it, but I can tell you that there is nothing left. The citizens are safe. Working class people are building houses there and factories are going up on top of this dreadful range. (Time expired) GretIey Colliery",31
42,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Wednesday I, with a very large group of people, attended a memorial service in the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Newcastle. The memorial service was dedicated to four coalminers who, on 14 November, lost their lives at the Gretley Colliery at Wallsend when a wall of water broke through the mine face at which they were working and caused them to drown. The memorial service was presided over by Bishop Malone of the Catholic church and by Bishop Herft of the Anglican church. Those four additional names will now be added to a wall of remembrance consisting of the names of over 1,500 coal miners who have lost their lives in the Hunter region since coal mining commenced. That wall was unveiled by the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, at the beginning of this year at the northern head office of the miners union at Cessnock in the electorate of my colleague Joel Fitzgibbon. The youngest man was 19 years of age, Damon Murray. The oldest man was 48 years of age, Eddie Batterham. The other two were John (Harry) Hunter and Mark (Kenny) Kaiser. In the process of those four lives being lost, mothers and fathers lost their sons, sons and daughters lost their fathers, and wives lost their spouses. It indicates that coal mining continues to be the most dangerous occupation anywhere in the world. (Time expired) Kahlua Bandido",32
43,Dr NELSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to express my concern about the availability of a new alcoholic drink called Kahlua Bandido. It is a combination of Tequila and Kahlua. It is sold in a SOml shot cup. Whilst I do not doubt there is a demand in the community for products such as this, these products are clearly marketed to young people, are attractive to underage drinkers and further glamorise the abuse of alcohol by a section of society that we know, from national drug strategy figures, are engaged in binge drinkmg. I note from the Sydney Morning Herald that the director of Swift and Moore that distributes and markets Bandido, Mr John Livingstone, is reported as saying that his company is trying to educate teenagers about the dangers of excessive drinking. All I can say is that if this is the case a SOml cocktail containing 33 per cent alcohol selling for $4 is hardly conducive to meeting that objective. (Time expired)",32
44,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with sessional order 106A the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Banking Mr GARETH EV ANS-My question is to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen last week's warning from Mr Brian Gray, the chief manager of the Reserve Bank's supervision department, that a free market model of banking, based on greater disclosure but without deposit protection or like arrangements, could threaten the stability of the financial system? In light of this warning, does the Treasurer support his own department's submission to the Wallis inquiry calling for a removal of the deposit protection provision of the banking act?",32
45,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government views with some considerable pride the fact that it has set up the Wallis inquiry into the financial system and, as we have always made clear, the inquiry will be considering numbers of submissions. I suppose, if the Labor Party had something to say, it would consider that too. The outcome of the inquiry's deliberations will not be put in place by the government. It is an independent inquiry. It has people of exceptional talent and it will consider all the arguments for and against. To be frank, Mr Speaker, I think it is a good thing that we have diversity in the presentations to the committee-I think it is a very good thing indeed. In fact, I would be much more concerned if we got a unanimity of opinion. I think this does give the opportunity for a lot of different ideas to be looked at and to be argued out. In relation to the report of the inquiry, the inquiry will be reporting early next year and the government will consider its report. When Stan Wallis was appointed to chair this inquiry, he was probably one of the most respected people in Australia. Nobody made any criticism of Stan Wallis. He is eminently able to consider differing viewpoints, eminently able to sift the pros and cons and eminently able to make recommendations. As far as the government is concerned, we welcome the fact that this will be a meaty inquiry with stimulating submissions to consider. Centenary of Federation Council",32
46,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and it relates to the Centenary of Federation Council. Has the government decided which Australians will be appointed to the Centenary of Federation Council? What role will the council have in the celebration of 100 years of nationhood?,33
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am able to inform the House that the Opposition member-Tony Abbott.,33
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very tempted; he is a very fine member. I am able to inform the House that the government has decided upon the eight Commonwealth members who will join the members already nominated by the various states to form the Centenary of Federation Council. This body will be responsible for advising not only the federal government but also state governments regarding the appropriate events that will attend the celebration of Australia's centenary as a federation in January of the year 200 1. The Commonwealth has decided that the chairman of the council will be Mr Dick Smith, who is one of Australia's great entrepreneurs and businessmen. Opposition members-Oh!",33
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very interested. I am fascinated that somebody who has been an absolute trailblazer in Australian icons, a man who has given more than $2 million for charityOpposition members-To the Liberal Party!",33
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Members on my left, contain your enthusiasm. The""member for Kingsford-Smith!",33
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is one of Australia's best known entrepreneurs and businessmen who also is a very well-known philanthropist. So a man who gave $1 million to the Smith Family two Christmases ago, a man who has been responsible for funding the Life Education Centre, which has done more to fight drug addiction in this country than any other organisation-that is apparently a source of amusement. I think the Australian community will note with some astonishment the reaction of those who sit opposite. The other members of the council nominated by the Commonwealth are as follows: Professor Trang Thomas, who is the Chairman of the Victorian Ethnic Affairs Commission and is a professor of psychology; Archbishop Peter Hollingworth, the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane and a great advocate of the welfare of underprivileged Australians; Mrs Yvonne Cawley, one of Australia's great sports ambassadors and a member of the board of the Australian Sports Commission; Professor Geoffrey Blainey, a distinguished Australian historianOpposition member-You are kidding!",33

56,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,34
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, you don't like that either! You object to the fact that she is related to a former Liberal Prime Minister, do you? She has had a very distinguished time working amongst some of the most underprivileged people in the world as a member of CARE International. Apparently, that is a source of merriment and ridicule by those who sit opposite. Finally, Mr Speaker, the other two members are Mr Angry Anderson",34
58,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,34
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is funny too, is it? Mr Lee-He is okay.",34
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Angry is okay! The member for Dobell says Angry Anderson is okay. Aren't I lucky? Angry Anderson is well known as a singer, a youth worker and an occasional actor. Finally, the government will be appointing retired Major General Ken Taylor from Western Australia as the executive member and a full member of the council. He has very extensive sporting and organisational skills as a member of America's Cup challenges and has a very significant background in the organisation of different government and nongovernment activities. I believe this group, contrary to the reaction of those who sit opposite, will be seen by the Australian community as an extremely representative group of people who will bring skills to what I hope will be a magnificent celebration, not in any negative sense, of the 100 years of Australian federation. These people, in consultation with their state colleagues on the committee chaired by Mr Smith and with the assistance of these other people, will be responsible for organising what I believe will be an utterly memorable and utterly appropriate celebration of 100 years of Australia as a nation. Banking",34
61,Mr HATTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen estimates by MCIntosh Baring which show that a bank amalgamation process creating only two major banks could eliminate 35,000 jobs from the banking industry? Given the significance the Wallis inquiry's findings will have for employees, consumers and regional Australia, will the Treasurer agree to extend the committee's deadline by a few additional weeks to enable it to extend its proposed public consultation process beyond just five days in five capital cities?",34
62,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Wallis inquiry terms of reference were announced on 30 May 1996 and this inquiry was given nine months to report. I notice the Labor Party has suddenly worked itself up into a lather because it is only going nine months. From my discussions with the committee, the committee considers that quite a feasible timetable to report and the committee is working towards reporting by that time. If the committee changes its mind and requests an extension, we would have a look at that, but we want to get a report in by March of next year. The reason why the Labor Party is suddenly getting worked up about this is that, like on most things, it has no policy in relation to the banking industry so it would like the inquiry to be extended-probably by five years-so it could work out where it stands on the issue. Let me make it clear that the financial system inquiry discussion paper demonstrates how timely this inquiry is. It notes the extent of change which has taken place within the financial system over recent years. It notes the application of new technology and the extent to which regulatory flexibility is to be required. It notes the need to pursue world best practice in our regulatory framework. This government's policy has been clear in relation to the financial industry right throughout the term of its government. We believe in increased competition in the financial sector. That is the way you get benefits for consumers. We have already seen the benefits of new competition on variable mortgages-three-quarters of a per cent. We have seen the benefits in relation to credit cards as a result of new competition. Why would you be against new competition in the financial industry? Why would you be against further competition in the financial industry?",34
63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,None at all.,35
64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did you hear the interjection from the Leader of the Opposition? 'None at all'. I do not know why the member for Blaxland is asking his question when the Leader of the Opposition says he is not against further competition in the financial industry. What has obviously got the opposition leader worked into a lather was a headline in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday morning. It had a headline which a tabloid would have been ashamed of--'Alarm at Costello bank plan'. A tabloid would have been ashamed of a headline like that. I see all the tabloid journalists nodding vigorously up in the gallery. They like to see the Sydney Morning Herald fall into that kind of trap. They probably had a very good Saturday morning as a result. That headline bore no relationship whatsoever to the facts of the inquiry. As I said earlier, this is an inquiry which has people with enormous skill considering very detailed submissions. These people have the ability to make independent judgments and verdicts. I welcome the fact that they have a diversity of submissions put to them. What would be the point of having an inquiry which had wheeled up to it one single view? We are standing at the threshold of new products, convergence and technological change. We have the opportunity to have a modem regulatory system. We can make Australia a great financial centre. We are a government that is looking forward to the future and we want to make sure that we take that opportunity. We are a government that wants to look down the road at future opportunities and that wants to make sure we get these things right. We will get these things right. We will get them right by having the courage to face change, having the courage to anticipate it and having the courage to make sure we get these decisions in the right order. This is an exciting inquiry. This is an opportunity for Australia. If we do this in the right way, it will give benefits to consumers, home buyers and business, and it will put the finance industry on a sure footing for the next two decades. Schools",35
65,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Mr Beazley interjecting",35
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is not helping us.,35
67,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the minister detail to the House the educational benefits that will be provided to low income families following the passage last week of legislation that abolished Labor's unfair, inequitable and discriminatory new schools policy?",35
68,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. She has a very strong interest in educational opportunities for young people in her electorate. She rightly draws attention to the fact that one of the consequences of the passage by the Senate on Friday of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill was that it abolished Labor's inequitable new schools policy. That is a matter which we on this side of the House take a great deal of pride in, because this decision will greatly extend educational choice for low income families in this country. No policy highlights more the misguided and failed character of the education policies of the previous government than the new schools policy. This was a policy designed to deprive parents of educational choice. It was designed to lock students into government schools, and it was a policy which on this account clearly failed. Of course, that did not stop the Labor Party trying to resurrect it through amendments in the Senate-and I am pleased to say the Senate rejected all these amendments-but it was a policy which completely failed. From 1986, nongovernment enrolments rose, in fact, from 26.4 per cent of total enrolments to 29.4 per cent of total enrolments. The most inequitable and unfair aspect of this policy was that it predominantly took effective choice away from low income parents seeking a low fee option for their children. It did this because Labor simply refused to fund these schools at their real level of need. An immediate consequence of the passage of this legislation will be that more than 68 schools receiving some funding will, at last, become entitled to receive their proper funding as a result of their actual of need. Mr Tanner-Government schools get cut.",35
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Melbourne.,36
70,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A further 52 schools currently registered by their state governments but completely unfunded by the Labor Party will now be entitled to funding under this legislation. Next month, all schools whose category has been arbitrarily limited by the previous government will receive their first increased justified payments from the Commonwealth. From March next year, all other schools disadvantaged by Labor's policy will begin to receive funding. Let me give an example of this, because some very extreme and inappropriate comments were made in the debate in the Senate. An example of this would be the Emmaus Christian School in Canberra, which enrols children from many single-parent families on pensions. It offers scholarships to students whose families cannot afford fees, and the fees are around $1,000 a year. These are schools offering high quality education to low income families. The people who will be the beneficiaries of the government's legislation will be, in particular, families in many traditional Labor seats and in many low income areas who have been deliberately victimised by the previous government in their effort to pursue the policies of the Australian Education Union. This legislation opens the doors to the establishment of many more low fee schools. It will expand educational opportunity in this country. Those who claim that government schools will be disadvantaged by a policy of choice are doing an enormous disservice to government schools. I have no doubt whatever that many government schools will also be able to compete very effectively when parents are provided with the appropriate information about their performance. NA",36
71,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I advise members that we have in our gallery this afternoon a delegation from Cambodia, headed by the Deputy Prime level Minister and Minister of the Interior of Cambodia, His Excellency Mr Sar Kheng. We welcome you to our parliament and hope you enjoy your visit with us. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Nursing Homes",36
72,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. I refer to a report today which says that the federal Department of Health and Family Services has advised that, 'Sale of the family home is the best option for pensioners forced to pay substantial up-front fees to enter nursing home care.' Is it the intention of the government to accept that advice?",36
73,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have seen that article in the Australian today and the claims made in it attributed to the departmental report. Ms Macklin-Have you read the report?,36
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Jagajaga has asked her question.,36
75,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that, when we introduced the aged care reform package, we did give a commitment to the Australian people that we would set up a working party to look at the implementation details. That working party has been set up and it involves people out of industry-the industry representatives. It involves representatives from the consumer groups, the Council on the Ageing and the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation. It involves health professionals and it also involves the unions. That working party is due to report to me, and that report will come some time before Christmas. I can say, without question, that I will honour my commitment that I made in this place and in other places that no-one will be forced to sell their home in order to pay an entry contribution fee. I stand by that commitment absolutely. We have said that there will be entry contributions and there will be real protection for those who are financially disadvantaged. I do not resile from the need to address the parlous state of nursing homes in this country. The draft report from the working group is expected to be completed, as I said, before Christmas. I have given that group clear instructions that it is to contain options to allow older people choice and flexibility while ensuring strong protections. For example, one option would be to allow people to pay a higher monthly fee in lieu of a capital entry deposit. Some people may find such an option preferable. It would be another way of financing a contribution that does not involve the sale of an asset. There will also be regulations, in terms of prudential arrangements, for the protection of the deposit. Regardless of what that entry deposit is, the owner of the establishment can only draw down $2,600 per annum to a maximum of $13,000. The balance is returned either to the person when they leave the establishment or to their estate, as the case may be. Mr Speaker, I have to say that it is absolutely scurrilous to suggest that the prudential protections will not be introduced. I am told by my officials that there is no dispute between consumers and providers on the working group that prudential arrangements need to be put into place. There is, however, a debate on the best mechanism to achieve that. In relation to the claims that 75 per cent people will pay an entry contribution, I acknowledge that that is the estimate of older people who have sufficient assets to afford a contribution. However, not all nursing homes will be able to charge a contribution and not everyone will stay in care long enough to pay one. All up, I expect that the proportion of people who do pay will be very similar to the one we experience in hostels today. Mr Allan Morris-The mInister was reading from a document. I ask that it be tabled.",36
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister reading from a confidential document?,37
77,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes.,37
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister was reading from a confidential document. Schools,37
79,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer the minister to the fact that Australia's 10,000 schools will receive an additional $1,500 million over the next four years following the passage last week of legislation that guarantees schools funding for the next four years. Can the minister inform the House of the benefits to students and teachers in Australia's government schools following the passage of the states grants bill.",37
80,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parkes for his continuing interest in providing excellent education to all Australian school students. Students in government schools are going to be very substantial beneficiaries of the schools legislation passed by the Senate last Friday. During the debate, members of this House will be aware, there has been a massive campaign of misrepresentation by the Labor Party in their campaign against this legislation, attempting to suggest that the measures in the bill will disadvantage students in government schools. Nothing could be further from the truth. This legislation will be one of the best things to happen for students in government schools in the last 14 years. Let us look at what happened under the previous governof ment and the bottom line in what they did for government schools. They sought to present themselves throughout this debate as the great defenders of government schools. The exodus from government schools speeded up during the policies that you had in place, which you tried to reinstate through amendments in the Senate. What was your response? What did you attempt to do to protect the position of students in government schools? First of all, you sought to deprive the parents of choice, because you thought that choice would disadvantage the government schools. You sought to hide from parents information about the literacy and numeracy skills of students in government schools. But that did not stop parents forming their own judgments about that. You sought to give the impression that simply by spending money you were doing something, even though you never bothered to check whether or not disadvantaged students were improving their learning outcomes.",37
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,World's best standards in maths and science.,38
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,38
83,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition interjects that Australian students have the best performance in maths and science. I suggest that he go back and look at the results of the third international maths and science survey. What that survey showed was that Australian schools were substantially behind the results of our major Asian trading partners and that schools in quite a number of parts of Australia were amongst the worse performers in the world.,38
84,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Best in the industrialised world. Be proud of it.,38
85,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course the students were doing reasonably well when measured against other Western countries, but the fact is that the West has fallen a long way behind under your policies.",38
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume his seat. I have constantly reminded the Leader of the Opposition today that he is interjecting too vigorously. I remind him of the very special position and role he plays in this chamber. I ask you to reflect on the very warm advice I am giving you.,38
87,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The other very serious negative effect that the policies of the former government had on government schools was their downgrading of vocational education. As a result of the reforms put in place from the Dawkins years on, many government school students were given the message that if they were not going to university, they were not going anywhere. Technical schools were abolished, and no clear pathway was put. Mr Crean-What!",38
88,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Technical schools were wound hack. In my own state of Victoria, they were aholished and replaced by essentially models of the English secondary modem. The 65 per cent of students who were not going on to university and full-time TAFE were dramatically disadvantaged by your policies. The policies that this government is putting in place are a very major contrast to those of the previous government. Firstly, let me make it quite clear that the government's decisions on school funding mean that funding on a per capita basis for students in government schools from Commonwealth sources over the next four years will increase by 17.9 per cent, which is a more substantial increase than funding on a per capita basis for students in non-government schools. Secondly, the enrolment benchmark adjustment means that the financial incentive for states to move and encourage students to move from government to non-government schools is halved under this legislation. Probably the fact that that incentive was so substantial during your period in government is one of the reasons why your new schools policy failed. Thirdly, the government is setting in place a national literacy and numeracy strategy which will lift standards in government schools and renew the confidence of parents in the quality of education that their children will be receiving in those schools. Finally, the government is putting some $187 million over the next four years into expanding vocational education in schools. I am very pleased to inform the House that last week state and Commonwealth officials agreed on guidelines to provide $80 million from appropriations for vocational education and training to expand school programs in this area. This will help the government to establish school based apprenticeships and traineeships, and provide a secure pathway from school into employment for all those students who were disadvantaged by the policies of the previous government. The contrast between this government and the former Labor Party government could not be more simple. They put systems first, and they failed. We put children first, and that will rebuild confidence in government and non-government schools. Republic",38
89,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the Bathurst Centenary Convention held in my electorate the weekend before last which made many recommendations on reforms to our constitution, including one that Australia become a republic? These were presented personally to the Attorney-General. Can the Prime Minister inform the House what action he is taking to honour his pre-election commitment to hold a national convention next year? Will the formula of half the delegates appointed and half elected still apply? How will this formula be achieved?",39
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cal are for his question. The answer is yes, I am aware of the convention that was held at Bathurst. But the honourable gentleman's question gives me the opportunity to say something about this issue. It is true that in the lead-up to the election we promised that we would hold a convention. We said that the Australian people would be fully involved in the process-the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. We also said that there would be an opportunity for the Australian people to express their view on this issue before the turn of the century. There are divided views on whether or not Australia should become a republic. It is fair to say that there are divided views not only in the community but also frequently across the political divide. The situation remains that, from the point of view of the unity of the Australian community, which ought to be the principal concern of not only the government but also all members of the parliament, it is important that, if this country is to become a republic, it occur in circumstances that unify the Australian people and not in circumstances that cause division. I have said before and I will repeat again that I think the worse possible situation on this issue would be to have a referendum held which produced, say, a 51 per cent vote in favour of a republic and 49 per cent against or indeed one that produced an alternative result of 51 against and 49 per cent in favour. The government is currently considering the form that the convention should take. I believe that when the government's plans are unveiled the criticisms made by some of the self-appointed spokesmen on this issue will have been demonstrated to have been absolutely false. It is a debate which belongs to all of the Australian people. It is not a debate which belongs to a group of self-appointed cultural dietitians-domestic or expatriate. It is very important that we have a process that involves the Australian people. I want to make one point very clear to the member for Cal are, and that is that the government promised the Australian people that they would have, as they should, the ultimate right to decide this issue. They will. Whatever may be the personal views of individual members of the government, whether it is my personal view or the personal view of other members of the government, through this parliament I can assure all of the Australian people that we will facilitate a full and complete discussion. We will enable the Australian people before the turn of the century to express a view on this subject. I urge those who are genuinely interested in a proper ventilation of this issue to await the announcement of the government's processes before jumping to conclusions that will be demonstrated to have been very false. Native Title Claim",39
91,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to press reports concerning the native title claim lodged by the Larrakia people in the Darwin and Palmerston regions.,39
92,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If you are black you can't even put a claim in now.,39
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Banks will have a claim elsewhere.,39
94,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is the government's view on the claim and its impact on the reconciliation process?,39
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am advised that it was announced on 1 December by the Northern Land Council that the Larrakia people would lodge a native title claim over all undeveloped Crown land in the Darwin and Palmers ton regions, including beaches, public reserves, mangroves, creeks and nature reserves. Exclusive possession of public areas is not claimed. The Larrakia people emphasise that they are seeking co-existing rights in these public areas. The Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Mr Yunupingu, stressed this particular point on ABC radio on 2 December: the Larrakia state that there would be no restriction of public access to beaches and reserves. In the NLC press release it is stated that under native title law their claim could have no effect on homes, business premises, public buildings or public works. This is a very significant claim. Obviously, there are rights available to people under the existing legislation, and there are certain things that I do not propose to say about the particular claim. However, I do have to say that whenever claims are made having an apparent ambit character, particularly when they are made over areas which are part of large cities and large population concentrations, I am concerned that there is a danger that such claims can have the effect of undermining, rather than enforcing, the reconciliation process. These are the sorts of claims that can have the impact of encouraging those in the community who would denigrate and destroy the native title process. I hope that claims of this character are properly based on the continuity of association with land, which is contemplated under the native title legislation because if they are notMr MCMullan-They will be rejected.",39
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course they will be rejected. But I would also say that there will be more than just rejection that will occur; there will be an undermining of public confidence in the native title process. I think it very important that you do not just take a simple legalistic view. Anybody who imagines that there is universal support for the native title procedure in Australia is under a delusion; there is not. If people are really concerned about preserving the native title process in Australia, they will do is to encourage a very responsible and very restrained approach to native title claims. They will understand the legitiInate concerns that are expressed by many people when claims of this character are made. Instead of, in some kind of knee-jerk reaction, jumping on any kind of criticism at all when claims like this are made, they will understand that the level of community acceptance of the native title process is undermined whenever any extravagant ambit claims are made. Members opposite can shake their heads, but they obviously have no understanding of the feelings of many people in the community on these issues. I would say two other things, Mr Speaker. The first of those is that I hope that the amendments to the native title legislation which are now before the parliament will receive the sympathetic support of those who sit opposite in another place. They are amendments which are not designed to undermine the essential principles of the Native Title Act. The amendments respect fully the pre-election commitments we made about respecting native title. They do not in any way breach the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. They will eliminate, to some degree, capricious claims-and properly so. They will give a degree of certainty to the pastoral industry and to the mining industry. In relation to that I note, of course, that the community keenly awaits the apparently imminent decision of the High Court of Australia in relation to pastoral leases without conditionality which are involved in the Wik claim. That particular decision from the High Court of Australia, which we do await with keen interest, will be very important in the future interpretation of the Native Title Act. So I would say that those who care about long-term community acceptance of the native is title procedure will do all they can to discourage the making of capricious ambit claims which have the effect of unnecessarily unsettling large sections of the Australian population. It is one thing to seek refuge behind strict legalism; it is entirely another thing to understand that, if you act in a way that what undermines public acceptance of the procedure or in a way that undermines reconciliation, you do damage, you do not confer benefit on, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Nursing Homes",40
97,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. I refer again to the report from the Department of Health and Family Services which estimates that 'up to 75 per cent of people entering nursing homes will pay an average $26,000 from next July under the new arrangements'. How will these people be able to pay the $26,000 without selling their family homes?",41
98,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said before, I am awaiting the report from the task force, which is made up of a number of people.",41
99,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Have you seen a draft?,41
100,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The draft of that report contains no such information-not the report from my task force. The department may well put forward a number of options in the deliberation of these matters. But I have given my assurance to this House that no-one will be forced to sell their home in order to pay an entry contribution fee. There will be the necessary prudential arrangements put in place to protect the investment of people in nursing home entry contribution fees.,41
101,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question of the Minister for Family Services. Has the minister or her office in fact seen the draft that has been presented to the public?",41
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. It bears no relationship to the question already asked. World Trade Organisation,41
103,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Can the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the outcome of discussions with the United States on World Trade Organisation action against an Australian leather exporter? What is the significance of this outcome for the automotive industry, a major employer in my electorate, and for our textiles, clothing and footwear industry?",41
104,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for the question. I am pleased to confirm that a satisfactory settlement has been reached on the matter relating to Howe Leather. This settlement involves agreement to excise automotive leather from the TCF and PMV schemes from 1 April next year, in return for undertakings by the United States, in writing, to terminate its section 301 investigation and to withdraw its petition and to take no further action on this matter in the World Trade Organisation. Let me say very clearly that this was the best possible outcome for Australia in the situation we faced. The alternative was a WTO adjudicated outcome, which could have created uncertainty for investment and employment right across the passenger motor vehicle industries and the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The genesis of this goes back for many years and indeed involves the previous government. I have moved quickly and comprehensively with my colleagues over the last few months in respect of this matter. Indeed, we have been in there batting for Australian jobs and to maximise the outcome for Australian jobs. This is about, as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have also said, eliminating as much as possible the uncertainty faced by these critically important industries in a very competitive circumstance. It is good news that the spirit of APEC permitted additional negotiations to take place at some length on this matter between myself and US trade representative Charlene Barshevsky in Manila, as well as previously in Christchurch in July and in Washington last May. Let me say that we have not forgotten the firm which lies at the heart of this dispute, Howe Leather. This firm has done some great things in building export markets for Australian leather, which it can be very proud of. My colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is working closely with Howe Leather on arrangements with the automotive leather industry. The problem, in part, was created by the previous government. It has been solved by this government and we are in there batting successfully for Australian jobs. Nursing Homes",41
105,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is the minister aware of advice given to the government by the Department of Health and Family Services which states that the best option for many people, including veterans, to enter a nursing home would be to pay the entry fee by selling the family home? Does the minister accept that the Minister for Family Services has misled the Australian people on this issue? And will the Minister for Veterans' Affairs give a guarantee that no veteran or war widow will be forced to sell the family home to gain access to a nursing home?",41
106,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs has not been listening to the Minister for Family Services. I endorse the statements of the Minister for Family Services. We are working together on this issue. Newspaper Deliveries",42
107,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What action is the government taking to fulfil its election commitment to defend the home delivery system for newspapers throughout Australia?,42
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"During the election campaign, the coalition did give an assurance to news agents that it would do all it could defend the current home delivery system for newsagents. I can confirm to the House that, since the election, the Commonwealth government has made a submission to the ACCC. The government believes that the maintenance of an efficient low cost home delivery system for newspapers does generate a lot of public benefits and that these offset any anticompetitive effects that may flow from any arrangements that are necessary to protect and support the system. The home delivery of newspapers provides significant opportunities for small business. Indeed, if you wanted to get a quintessential example of the Australian small business, you could go no further than the local news agent. I have interjections from the Labor Party. Don't you want to support these small businesses? Mr Latham-For four years only.",42
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You object to this, do you? The member for Werriwa objects. He wants to send all the Liverpool news agencies to the wall. You will lose your seat at the next election if you carryon with that. We believe in the maintenance of this low cost home delivery system. It is a system that is almost unique around the world. It is particularly important to the more vulnerable consumer groups, such as pensioners and the disabled. The low cost, widespread dissemination of newspapers is important in a democratic society. That is why we have made the submission we have, and it fully honours the promise made to these small businesses during the election campaign. I know you do not like it. I know you wish it would be otherwise, but we have delivered in full on this promise to the small business men and women of Australia. Nursing Homes",42
110,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. In answer to my previous question, the minister stated that, instead of paying an up-front fee, residents could choose to pay an additional monthly fee. Are you aware, Minister, that 87Y2 per cent of a person's pension already pays for care in a nursing home? Where will to the extra monthly contribution come from?",42
111,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are well aware of the comment that the shadow minister has made. But, as I said in my first answer, this was one of the options put forward with regard to the payment of an up-front entry contributionthe same as they are now paid in the hostel sector. We said we would extend that measure to the nursing home sector. That is one of the options that have been put forward by a working party which comprises industry groups, consumer groups, the union and health professionals. It is one of the options that are under consideration. Investment",42
112,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What are the recent developments for capital expenditure in Australia? What prospects are there for further increases in investment?,42
113,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Private business investment expectations for 1996-97, as revealed by the September quarter capital expenditure survey, clearly support budget forecasts of 14 per cent growth. Despite market expectations of a three per cent fall, the quarter showed growth of 0.9 per cent, lifting investment to its highest level since the September quarter in 1988. These capital expenditure survey intentions support the budget forecast of continuing strong investment in 1996-97. Investment expectations for capital expenditure in 1996-97 have risen by around 37 per cent between the December quarter of 1995 and the survey out for the September quarter of 1996. Investment is expected to be particularly strong in mining and other selected industries, whilst growth in manufacturing is expected to remain modest. We can also report that, as a result of the government's fiscal plan and the easing of interest rates, investment for 1996-97 should continue in accordance with these expectations and the quarterly survey. The strong investment shown in the Australian economy will be welcomed by all in the Australian economy apart from the Australian Labor Party. When we saw the predictions from the Australian Labor Party that investment would be weak, we knew the quarter's results would be strong. It is an infallible sign that you get a prediction from the shadow Treasurer a couple of days before, inevitably wrong, inevitably contradicted by the actual results as they come out. Good news for the Australian economy and good news for investment mean good news for jobs. It is only the opposition that is worried about good prospects in the Australian economy. As far as the government is concerned-with our determined efforts to put in place a budget against the sabotage of the opposition, with the easing of pressures in relation to interest rates-the ment for 1996-97 is welcome. It is good news for the Australian public and for the development of jobs. Health Insurance",42
114,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by the Minister for Health's claim in this House on 21 November that the latest MBF premium increase was only 6.5 per cent? When the Prime Minister gave his approval to this MBF increase, was he aware that this claim assumes that 300,000 contributors will downgrade their health insurance? When the Prime Minister gave his personal approval for this MBF increase, was he also aware that, for the 75 per cent of MBF contributors who do not have an excess policy, premiums will rise by 15 per cent? Prime Minister, if you were not aware of this information, how could you have properly assessed the impact of this rise on contributors before giving your personal approval for increased MBF premiums?",43
115,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will have a look at the answer, and then I will give you a response. Workplace Relations Legislation",43
116,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Small businesses in my electorate certainly want to know this. Can you inform the House when the benefits of the new Workplace Relations Act will be available to employers and employees? Given the government's No.1 interest--creating jobs for the Australian economy-can you inform the House of the likely effect on employment growth of the ACTU's living wage claim, which is subject to hearings next year in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission?",43
117,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased to advise the honourable member that we are moving apace to implement the Workplace Relations Act. In fact, one of the first provisions to be proclaimed will be the Office of the Employment Advocate. We would like to make an appointment of the Employment Advocate before Christmas so that that person can be in on the ground floor of the establishment of forecast invest- that office. By 31 December and by 1 January 1997, as a result of the Senate amendment, we should be able to bring into effect the vast majority of the legislative prescriptions in the Workplace Relations Act. So the industrial action provisions, sections 45D and 45E and the freedom of association provisions-all the principal elements, by and large-will come into effect on 1 January. So, when you wake up on 1 January, you will have your family tax benefits in your pocket and a new workplace relations system. It could not be better. What a great start to the year. We will also be setting up the Australian workplace agreements. That will take a little bit longer because we have to get the office in place, but we are aiming for about 1 March. Then you will be able to have tralian workplace agreements, individual collective. By and large that will see the whole system up. That basically means that from go to whoa, in 10 months, we have brought about perhaps the most significant change to the industrial relations framework in Australia since World War II.",43
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,World War I.,44
119,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Since World War I. It has been a fantastic effort by so many. The interesting thing is that, whilst we are getting on with the job, making the system better for employees, those opposite are going back into the 1960s and 1970s, arguing for a centralised system and basically supporting the ACTU recall claim. We have had the ACTU claim analysed. It is basically a disaster. When it comes to the employment effects of the ACTU's claim, the whole thing were adopted-with a bit luck it will not be-there would be 400,000 fewer jobs in 1999-2000 than would otherwise he the case. Around 200,000 people would actually give up looking for work. The unemand ployment rate would be about two percentage points higher, and you would have a wage claim that the economy clearly could not afford. In response to the ACTU's claim, what do we get from the Leader of the Opposition? is hasically going along with the ACTU. So, Indonesia. when you wake up on 1 January, you will have the new system in place and you will have the tax benefits coming through. If you think about the opposition leader, you will probahly think, 'He is a nice, happy, rotund ICllow but a weak leader because he will not stand up to the ACTU.' Indonesia",44
120,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We all believe those statistics implicitly, along with the elves at the bottom of the garden!",44
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Address yourself to the question.,44
122,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed Austo the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime or Minister to his recent statement that Australia's bilateral relationship with Indonesia is surpassed by relations with one or two other countries. The Prime Minister would be well aware that the former Labor government devoted a great deal of energy to elevating the bilateral relationship with Indonesia to a status equivalent to that of our relationships with Japan and the United States, culminating in last year's historic security agreement. I therefore ask: does the Prime Minister's statement signal a shift in Australian foreign policy? Could he explain to this House the reasons behind the shift?",44
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. The answer that I gave was not precisely in that form, as I it, but I nonetheless accept the thrust of the question that was asked. I subsequently made the point in answer to a question when I was overseas that I did not see any particular merit in the future, and it will not be my if practice in the future, to seek to grade of Australia's bilateral relationships. Mr Gareth Evans-You already have.",44
124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am saying as from then, I repeat it today: I do not think there is merit in grading our bilateral relationships. Australia has a number of very significant bilateral relationships in its region. I want to say to the Leader of the Opposition that we have sought to maintain what was fundamentally a good bilateral relationship nurtured by He the former government between Australia and I take the opportunity of reminding the Leader of the Opposition that, in all of the discussions I have had with President Suharto since becoming Prime Minister, I have in fact complimented the former government on the work that it did to huild the bilateral relationship with Indonesia. I have also made the point of saying to the President of China that the bilateral relationship between Australia and China owes a lot to Australian Prime Ministers from both sides of politics-I had particularly in mind Gough Whitlam from the Australian Labor Party and Malcolm Fraser from the Liberal Party. It does not really profit any of us to make unnecessary political points when it comes to Australia's bilateral relationships. I will do everything I can to maintain a very close association with Indonesia. I have a very high regard for President Suharto. I believe that President Suharto has worked extremely well over a long period to hold together a nation which under another leader would have, in my opinion, broken apart. He has done it with very great skill and he has properly earned himself the respect of many people throughout the Asia-Pacific region. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, under my government, the bilateral relationship between Australia and Indonesia will receive every bit of the care and attention that it received under the former Labor government and also under the former coalition government led by Malcolm Fraser. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: by all means try to confront the government and by all means try to attack and take the government apart on foreign policy issues where there are substantive differences. But I say to the Leader of the Opposition: there are no serious differences. Our commitment to the Indonesian relationship is a very deep commitment. Finally, I say to the House that I do not think it serves the national interest of Australia is for the Prime Minister of this country to be engaged in some kind of one to 10 grading exercise so far as our relations with other countries are concerned. Mr Gareth Evans-But you have downgraded them and now you won't fix it up.",44
125,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The former foreign minister can get as cerebral and as excited as he likes. Nothing can gainsay the fact that we have a good relationship with Indonesia. This government will continue that good relationship with Indonesia. The ultimate test is that it does not help Australia to grade relationships, because when you grade relationships you run the risk of giving offence to people who otherwise want to be your good friends. Australian National",45
126,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is the minister aware of comments made by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for transport arguing that the taxpayers of Australia should continue to subsidise the operations of Australian National? Can the minister advise the parliament of the steps taken by the government to overcome the previous Labor government's appalling mismanagement and the consequent huge debt of Australian National? Can the minister further advise of the steps taken to provide for a brighter future and more secure jobs for rail employees?,45
127,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for her question. She has been very interested in carving out a future for employees of the Australian National Railways Commission. Indeed she, like so many other people who are involved and interested in AN's future, has been very worried about the previous government's mismanagement of the Australian National Railways Commission. The honourable member for Adelaide's question goes to the heart of the mismanagement of AN and the Australian economy. When you look at the response given to the government's rail reform initiatives, which I announced Sunday week ago, you can see within that response why Australinherited, after 13 years of a Labor government, an enormous national debt and this government inherited a $10 billion deficit-a $10 billion black hole given to us by the former Minister for Finance and now opposition leader. The Leader of the Opposition, in response to the government's railway reform initiatives, said that the taxpayers can continue to wear this sort of loss. What is this sort of loss? The loss amounts to some $2 billion if you take into account all debts and liabilities that the government of Australia and the taxpayers of Australia have and are responsible for in order to tidy up the problems of the Australian National Railways Commission. If you look, for example, at AN's loss in the last financial year, 1995-96, you will see that AN is going to have a loss of around $250 million, when its budgeted loss for the year was supposed to be $26 million. This opposition leader says that taxpayers can continue to wear that sort of loss. We believe that that is not an appropriate response. That is an inadequate response. Indeed, I would suggest that the people who work for AN would also consider that to be an inadequate response because, ever since the former Labor government established the National Rail Corporation and took two-thirds of AN's business away from it and handed it to the National Rail Corporation, leaving AN with its debt still in place, the future of AN has indeed been very grim. If we were to do nothing, as was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition in his remarks, then the taxpayers of Australia would be obliged by the year 2000 to subsidise every job at AN to the tune of $220,000 per employee per year. Is that an appropriate use of taxpayers' funds? I doubt it is. Even at the current loss level, the taxpayers of Australia were having to wear a cost of $100,000 per employee per year unless we were prepared to do something. This government is prepared to do something: to build a firm foundation for future rail in Australia, particularly for those people who work for AN. It was in that light that we made our announcement Sunday week ago to completely reform Australia's rail system, including the ownership of AN, and indeed National Rail. The Labor government's approach was death by a thousand cuts. Some 7,000 jobs went out of AN during the Labor Party's 13 years in office. At the end of last year the Leader of the Opposition, when Minister for Finance, signed off on a business plan which would have seen another 972 jobs go in AN. That was their answer to the problems of AN: death by a thousand cuts. This initiative will build a firm foundation for rail in Australia. We will absorb all of the debts of AN and ensure that a new owner for AN is unencumbered by any of the debts, any of the liabilities, that AN has suffered from in the past, giving it a new and fresh start. Indeed we will ensure, through setting up a rail access regime that will connect all of Australia's capital cities with a rail network, that Australia's rail system will have a solid future that will benefit not only those people who work for AN but the transport system and its users around Australia.

152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right and left!,47
153,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it is a matter for you to determine what happens to people who cast aspersions on people who have given gallant service. Four Australians were awarded this morning. These were the first gallantry awards to be made since the Vietnam War. They were also the first Australian awards to be made. I think it is most appropriate that we note that Her Majesty the Queen gave consent to the amending of the regulations concerning the awarding of medals for gallantry so that they may be given in circumstances similar to armed combat and actual operations as distinct from 'in action', as in the previous regulation. I think I might like to read to you from the citation made to one of the four recipients this morning. All four relate to what occurred on 22 April 1995, when over 4,000 refugees were massacred in Rwanda at camp Kibeho. Several soldiers who took part in the Australian contingent carried out acts of gallantry while under fire which resulted in the saving of many lives. In recognition of this service, the medal of gallantry was awarded. J will read part of the citation for Warrant Officer Class Two, Rodrick Malcolm Scott. It said: On one occasion on the morning of 23 April a man was observed to be running away from two Rwandan Patriotic Army soldiers. The man was shot twice in the leg and unable to escape. At great personal risk, Warrant Officer Scott moved to the injured man and positioned himself between the soldiers and the wounded man, thereby preventing the soldiers from firing again. The soldiers eventually departed and Warrant Officer Scott was able to evacuate the man for treatment. This act of selfless courage and inspirational behaviour was observed by many of the Australian Medical Support Force. Equally gallant was Major Carol Louise Vaughan-Evans, the first woman to receive a gallantry medal. The citation states: In the afternoon the security situation deteriorated and intense firing erupted around them. Nevertheless, Major Vaughan-Evans continued to treat casualties despite the risk of personal injury. On numerous occasions Major Vaughan-Evans accompanied casualties to the helicopter landing zone whilst firing was still occurring in and around the camp. Throughout the entire crisis Major VaughanEvans displayed acts of gallantry ... This morning, in the awarding of these medals of gallantry-as I said, the first since Vietnam and the first Australians to be awarded-we have indeed seen our Australian Defence Force produce remarkable Australians. I would simply like to congratulate the Defence Force and all those who received awards this morning, including commendations and including other awards.",47
154,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I understand what the minister was trying to do, but it was most inappropriate that that be dealt with in answer to a question during question time.",48
155,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why?,48
156,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because it is the first awarding of gaIlantry medals under the Australian awards system, as was indicated by the minister. This, above all, ought to have been dealt with in a brief ministerial statement in the parliament, to which we could have responded and to which all other members of the House could have contributed. I wonder if you would raise it with the minister concerned. AIl citations should have been read on this particular occasion-not just two of them-and a proper according given the events which led to them.",48
157,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order. I share the view of the Leader of the Opposition that anything related to gallantry under fire should never be politicised andMr Leo MCLeay-Tell your minister that.",48

159,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure you: it is not selective. I misunderstood the interjection. I apologise to the person for misunderstanding the interjection, but I can assure you that it was not deliberate. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I do not want to see things like that politicised either, but I gently remind him that there have been many occasions in the past, particularly during the Australia Remembers year, when questions were asked of the former Minister for Veteran's Affairs quite regularly and they were always the subject of completely respectful silence from those opposite, which was not the case on this occasion. I thought the attempt made by some of your colleagues to ridicule the minister was quite out of place and utterly inappropriate. I will do everything I can to ensure that in no way are things of this kind politicised, but you have an obligation to bring a bit of order to your own ranks.",48
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I am going to make a comment on this issue as well. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Chifley is not with me, but I am sure he would join me in this, as one of the very few members of this place who visited Rwanda during those very difficult and sorry times. I think today's debate on this issue is a little unfortunate because we were recognising enormous bravery, which the Australian armed forces are historically noted for. I have been to Kibeho. There were something like 400,000 unbelievably deprived people there when we visited. I have a cousin who participated amongst those forces in defending those poor, wretched souls. The fact that four very brave members of the Australian armed forces have been recognised in this way is a salute to the enormOllS efforts and goodwill that these people inspired, not only in Rwanda but around the world. That army hospital and the company of infantry that accompanied them to provide that essential defence in order for the hospital to continue its enormously challenging task, reflected great credit on their training, the esprit de corps and camaraderie that have always existed in the Australian armed forces. I know that the honourable member for Chifley would join with me-as do, I am sure, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition-in extending to those four very brave people our warmest congratulations and good wishes for their exemplary service in reflecting the highest traditions of this parliamore ment. That is the end of the issue.",48

163,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,The minister may proceed.,49
164,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,On 7 November the member for Curtin asked me a question in two parts. The first part was: was I aware of billions of dollars raised in Australia by Australians being diverted to pharmaceutical research in Sweden? I said that I was not but I undertook to get back to him. I can inform him that my department informs me that it is not aware of substantial money being diverted for pharmaceutical research in Sweden. The second part was: could the TGA become more user friendly? I assume this relates to the first part of the question and trials done in Sweden. I can inform the honourable member that work on clinical trials done in Australia can be exchanged with other countries. There is a mechanism in place and in the past this has involved Sweden. NA,49

NA Rwanda: Gallantry Medals,49
170,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. In light of remarks that you have made and the remarks of the Prime Minister, I wonder if you could now approach the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel to invite her to make a parliamentary statement so that an appropriate view can be put by all members of this House and the full citations can be read and a full account given of the circumstances which occurred to produce that situation. It is a different set of circumstances, would you not agree, Mr Speaker, from that which prevailed in relation to events associated with the 50th anniversary commemorations and in the circumstances is well worth a discussion in this House?",49
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I shall reflect on it and advise the House further. Fitzgerald, Ms Christine Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Speaker, are you aware that Christine Fitzgerald, the manager of the Qantas centre here in Canberra, who has been very helpful to many members over the years and was the first manager of the Qantas centre when this building opened, retired last Friday? If you are aware, will you write to Ms Fitzgerald on behalf of all members and thank her for the assistance she has given to members in this building since 1988 when she took over the running of that centre?",49
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Watson for his question. I am sure all members join me personally in wishing Christine Fitzgerald our very best wishes for a job unbelievably well done under those quite extraordinary circumstances that prevailed certainly in those early years of 1988 and thereafter. She has provided the sorts of service that one would expect from people out of the training schools of a premier airline around the world. I shall certainly take your question on notice and be more than happy to write a letter to her on behalf of all members. NA,50

177,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have been grossly misrepresented in a very serious way in an article which appeared in yesterday's Sunday Age entitled 'MP in secret tape row'. Rather than go through the details of the article, let me now say that it is written in such a way as to create the clear impression that of some wrongdoing in relation to the Chinese students issue three years ago. I wish to again deny any wrongdoing with respect to the allegations that appeared in a Chinese newspaper in 1993. I wish to remind the House that there was no person found to make any allegation against me, that the person alleged to have done so signed a statutory declaration denying this and that an exhaustive investigation done by the Federal Police found that there was not a scrap of evidence to support the original newspaper story of 1993. Nevertheless, the Sunday Age sought to create its false impression by using documents and confidential tapes of interviews conducted between me and the Federal Police at the time. These items have been stolen from my office, a matter which is itself being investigated by the police at the moment. I want to tell the House that there was a deliberate exercise to smear me carried out by certain persons who have been attempting a vicious form of blackmail on me in the last few weeks. I will be explaining this matter to the House during the grievance debate. From the five hours of taped interviews with the police and the analysis of the aforementioned stolen documents, those involved in this exercise have only been able to establish one apparent contradiction. This apparent contradiction does not refer to the substance of the matter at all but rather to the circumstances surrounding the production of a statement by the Chinese Student Association after the event. Rather than take up the time of the House on this matter now, I will be making a comprehensive statement on this apparent contradiction and explaining what has occurred during the grievance debate. However, let me say here that as soon as the matter of inconsistency was raised with me by the editor of the Sunday Age I told the paper that I was not the sort of person who would not admit a mistake. If I made a mistake then I would deal with it through the proper processes. The article also states that 'Dr Theophanous said that if he had made a mistake he would write to the Federal Police I was guilty asking them to investigate'. I have today spoken to Mr Raizer and Mr Allen of the Federal Police apologising for what appears to be an inadvertent mistake at one small point in the evidence and explaining the apparent contradiction referred to in the newspaper article. I will be providing further material to the police to support my statement. I also stated that I will be happy to cooperate with the police in any reexamination of this matter. Mr Speaker, I have nothing to hide on this issue, but I have many matters to reveal during the grievance debate.",50

NA Rwanda: Gallantry Medals  Speaker, and I do concur in the remarks that you made. As you know, a number of members and senators were privileged to VISIt Rwanda and Kibeho, the camp where the massacre subsequently occurred.

192,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question and I shall look into it further. NA Dobie, Hon. James Donald Mathieson",51
193,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Monday, 25 November 1996 of the Hon. James Donald (Don) Mathieson Dobie, a member of this House for the division of Hughes from 1966 to 1969, and for the division of Cook from 1969 to 1972 and 1975 to 1996, Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister from 1971 to 1972, Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1970 to 1971, 1979 to 1983 and 1987 to 1994 and member of the Speaker's Panel from 1994 to 1996 and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service and its profound sadness at his passing. Mr Speaker, Don Dobie was born on 28 July 1927 at Glasgow in Scotland. He was educated at Brisbane Grammar School and went on to complete a Bachelor of Commerce degree at Melbourne University and a Master of Business Administration degree at Columbia University in New York. Before entering federal politics, Don worked for the old Bank of New South Wales from 1943 to 1966. He also served with the 2nd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery (Citizen Military Forces) with the rank of gunner between 1951 and 1952. He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1966. I recall having served on his preselection committee, and I can honestly say that I voted for him in the preselection ballot.",51
194,Mr MELHAM,CONDOLENCES,Did you show it to anyone?,51
195,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"No, there were no deals involved. He won the New South Wales seat of Hughes, defeating the former member for that seat, Les Johnson, who subsequently, I think, returned to parliament. In his maiden speech in this House in February 1967, he placed on record his total commitment to the welfare of his constituents and spoke on a range of issues, including housing finance for young Australians, education and the need to ensure quality of teaching, services for the disabled, and the importance of international trade for Australia's economic future. Don Dobie was Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Mr Bill MCMahon, from 1971 to 1972. He was Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1970 to 1971 and 1979 to 1983, Chief Opposition Whip from 1983 to 1985 and a member of the Speaker's Panel from 1994 to 1996. During his long service in this parliament, Don also contributed greatly to the work of House of Representatives committees, including the Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the House Committee, the Privileges Committee, the Long Term Strategies Committee, the Community Affairs Committee and the Members' Interests Committee. He also served on a number of joint committees, including Foreign Affairs and Defence, the Australian Capital Territory, the New Parliament House, the Parliamentary Zone, and Public Accounts. When a member dies who has recently been with us and therefore was personally known to a large number of people in this House, it is always a little bit different from when one dies who left the parliament a long time ago and may not be personally known to many people. I knew Don for a very long period. As I say, I sat on his preselection committee as the then Liberal Party state executive member representing the St George and Cronulla area of Sydney. I went to his original campaign launch in 1966, which, of Course, was the election when Harold Holt led the coalition parties to victory over the Labor Party led for the last time by Arthur Calwell. Don was a great local member. He had a special affinity with the surf lifesaving ment. He had a very deep connection with the Cronulla Leagues Club. I know many people in that part of Sydney who were very respecting of his work as a local member. He was one of the most unfailingly conscientious local members that you could ever find. No matter what was happening in the electorate of Cook, which he was later to represent, Don would know about it and he would be there. He became a legend so far as local representation was concerned. I think it is fair to say that, although some of the demographic changes in that part of Sydney would have aided the Liberal Party side of politics, it is also fair to say that Don did build up a significant personal following. All of us are prone to exaggerate the extent of our personal followings and we can all produce some statistics to prove that somehow or other, if it had not been for our outstandingly stunning personalities, there would have been a 10 per cent swing in favour of the other side and the seat would have been lost years ago and, if it was not for a brilliant understanding of the electorate, then it would have been a Labor Party stronghold. Many of those stories, of course, are entirely without any merit and completely fallacious on both sides of politics. When a huge swing comes along, it sweeps out the good with the bad and the indifferent. Many people on our side of politics discovered that in 1983 and many on the other side discovered that only seven or eight months ago. Don Dobie did have a following. He had a following because he identified himself with the electorate. Cronulla causes were Dobie causes, and I think he was in that sense a quintessential local member. I know there are many people in the Liberal Party who will want to say something about Don's contribution not only to the Liberal Party but also to the parliament. Don was one of those characters who lost their seats in 1972 when Gough Whitlam was elected. He was defeated by Ray Thorburn in 1972. I scrutineered the very close count and watched with dismay as Don's tenuous overnight lead of about 45 slipped away and Ray moveended up having a win which, if not huge, was comfortable enough. Don then came back in 1975 and remained a member right through. He survived the swing against the Liberal Party in 1983 which elected the Hawke government and he continued to hold his seat with significantly increased majorities in 1987 and 1990. The result he achieved in 1990 was probably, in relative terms, the best result achieved by any Liberal member in New South Wales in what was for us not a particularly good electionwe lost; those elections are never particularly good. Don had many friends, not only in the parliamentary party. In different guises, he and I shared membership of the New South Wales executive of the party over a very long period of time-Don as a parliamentary representative, me as a regional president before I entered parliament in 1974; he as an elected member from the convention of the New South Wales party subsequently and me as party leader and, ultimately, as Prime Minister. Together we attended a couple of meetings of the New South Wales executive subsequent to the election. I will miss Don. I regret very much that, because of the government's program this morning, I was not able to attend his state funeral at the Cronulla Presbyterian Church. I was represented by my colleague Philip Ruddock. I know that many of Don's former colleagues were there. He was a cheerful soul. He was a good parliamentarian. He was a good Presbyterian. He retained a lot of that stoicism of his Scottish birthplace. I know he was very devoted to his late mother, whom I had the pleasure of meeting on many occasions. I remember very vividly greeting Don by accident at Sydney airport during the 1984 election campaign. He was hurrying off to, I think, the Gold Coast where his mother lived at the time. He had just received news of her death. Not surprisingly, he was very greatly distressed. His mother was a very active member of the Liberal Party in Queensland. So for all of those reasons and many others, he will be very greatly missed. I thank him for his service to the people of Hughes and Cook, his service to the Liberal Party and, most importantly, his service to Australia as a member of the national parliament.",51
196,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"The opposition join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in expressing condolence on the death of Don Dobie. It seems only a very short time ago that Don Dobie was featuring in the valedictories in this place where both sides of the House said kind things of him as he left this place. It is so close that I suppose in many ways the valedictories will also stand as his obituary and add to the remarks made by members here. We all-probably Don most of allanticipate a lengthier retirement before confronting the Pearly Gates than Don has experienced. It is a very sad thing. I think he would have enjoyed his retirement enormously and he undoubtedly deserved to do so. It is a very unfortunate thing that he cannot. Don Dobie was, as we on this side of the House would acknowledge, one of those members of parliament who are very good parliamentarians. They do not necessarily spend a great deal of time on their front bench, if at all. Nevertheless, they establish a substantial reputation as people who both love the forms of the House and use them well, and assist in the processes of this place in a way that enhances the nature of the institution and the character of the people in it. That type of characterisation certainly applies to Don Dobie. He was trusted in that regard by his own party and, I would say, both sides of the House. He had an extraordinarily lengthy service on committees and in other forms in this place. He was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, the Arts Advisory Committee for the New Parliament House, the Privileges Committee, the Members' Interests Committee, the Joint Standing Committee on the Parliamentary Zone and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. He was also active in the CPA and IPU. If you take a look at that list of committees, you can see why I would describe him as a quintessential parliamentary man because those committees go to the forms and procedures of this House and the very structure and nature of it in so far as they were involved in developing the new Parliament House itself and the unique character that this Parliament House has. He said in his farewell speech: I have never had a seat on the front bench on either side of the parliament, but I am still retiring happy. I do recollect a conversation with him about the time when he got nearest to the front bench and that was a service of about some 18 months as an assistant minister when such a position was put forward before some constitutional doubts were expressed about it. He was the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister. I asked him what his duties entailed. He said he was not sure exactly, but he did see a lot of Sonia MCMahon at the time. He seemed to have substantial obligations in the absence of the Prime Minister to be with Sonia at Liberal Party functions. Other than that he signed a deal of letters. I am sure that he was given more extensive duties by the Prime Minister at the time, but he was, nevertheless, delighted with those that he had. He was one of those characters who accept their lot in life cheerfully. Don was a travelling man. When we sit down and take a look at his record, Don was out of the country almost as often as he was in it, which speaks well for the quality of his service to the people of Cook on the occasiems when he was in the country. We once chivvied him about that subject as well. Don was never backward in coming forward on how he viewed the political life and the essentially phlegmatic attitude that he had towards it. He said, 'Well, when you represent a seat like Cook, you know your parliamentary life is going to be short anyway, so you might as well enjoy it while you are there.' His experience was that, no matter how hard he worked for his constituents, when the electoral grim reaper approached he was always likely to be missing. He would not want to look back on his parliamentary career and say to himself that there was an opportunity that went missed. Therefore, irrespective of the marginal nature of his constituency, he was going to be a travelling man. It is always possible that, the less your constituents see you, the more likely you are to get a good set of votes. I do not think that necessarily applied in Don Dobie's case but, if it did, he certainly tested that theory to its limits. This view of his was inspired by his initial defeat. He did lose one election-despite his 10 wins-and that gave him, he said, his totally phlegmatic attitude. I certainly appreciate his electoral experiences. I think the closest he came to defeat, after the initial defeat that he experienced, was in 1983. I think some of the character of Don Dobie is brought out in an article entitled 'The thoughts of the Liberals' great survivor', which appeared in the Australian on 9 April 1983: A meagre 200 votes has left Don Dobie, Liberal MHR for Cook, clinging to his seat, traditionally Labor since its establishment in 1906. He's been defeated only once (1972-75) in the 16 years since he entered parliament. He attributes helping people and ""sheer job-interest"" to his success. It was a rout for Liberal MPs. They tumbled off the scoreboard in handfuls. But one that stayed and stayed was Don Dobie, the member for Cook, the electorate south of Sydney which includes Botany Bay, the nation's birthplace. Last week Dobie was on show at the Liberals' stand at the Royal Easter Show-somewhat quaintly housed in the Energy Pavilion. Why Dobie won-by less than 200 votes, mind you, in an electorate that should be Labor-is perplexing ... until you see the man in action. Then there is a wonderful set of descriptions of Don Dobie's electoral manner. Indeed, no doubt his cons'tituents-certainly those at the Royal Easter Show-would have found him most engaging and concerned about their affairs. The Liberal Party did trust him with a few things. The Liberal Party nominated him three times for the position of Speaker in this place-albeit at times when he was unlikely to win the ballot; nevertheless, when parties decide to nominate a person for Speaker, they are making a judgment about that person, whether or not they expect him to win. The judgment is that this is a person who can handle the affairs of the parliament with dignity and with accuracy as far as the standing orders are concerned. No party places its reputation behind a person that it does not think could do both of those jobs extremely well. The fact that he was nominated three times, albeit unsuccessfully, for your job, Mr Speaker, I think adequately characterises the man as a parliamentarian. He did secure the positions of temporary Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairman of Committees. We on this side of the House appreciated the knowledge that he had of standing orders when he took those positions-temporarily acting for the Speakerand the degree of effectiveness that he had in exercising his authority. He was described by an observer as 'a good footslogging servant of the people', and I think most of us would probably be happy to settle with that.",53
197,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"Nancy Wake was a candidate in those same suburbs that Don Dobie represented for many years on and off. It reflects the volatility of that area, requiring a great deal of marginal campaign skill and electorate skill. That is why it is a privilege to rise in support of the condolence motion for the late Don Dobie. Just last week at Port Macquarie I was with Nancy Wake-a French underground heroine and a great Australian citizen-discussing the difficulties of campaigning in those southern suburbs of Sydney and also the condition of Don Dobie. I salute the service that Don Dobie has given. I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in saluting the outstanding service given by Don Dobie over the years. I want to quote from just one part of his maiden speech in respect of some thoughts he had of great vision with regard to trade. He said: We are one of the great international traders of the world. We enjoy a reputation not often accorded to a country with a small population such as ours. It has been my experience when overseas to find difficulty in convincing otherwise informed people that we have in fact a populationat that time in Australiaof less than 12 million. Economically our small domestic market makes us depend on our trade to a far greater extent than do most of the other leading world traders. We must trade to survive. We must be constantly aware that our national interests are based on international events. We call never isolate ourselves. These were the words of Don Dobie in his maiden speech to the parliament all those years ago. They were proud words and words which laid down an approach relevant to this day. He gave that speech on 28 February 1967. I salute the work of Don Dobie. I was very pleased that a number of members from both sides of the House-including the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and others-were present at the well attended state funeral service which took place in Sydney this morning. There was a certain genial spirit about Don Dobie. It was a privilege to know him. He had his own way of going about things, but he could get the task done with regard to the electorate he represented, get on with people as part of that approach, pursue international interests and travel a great deal-that is true. Perhaps you have the key to that, in part, in respect of his maiden speech and his focus on trade and the need for Australia not to be an insular nation. I convey deep sympathy to his many friends and to his distant relatives in Scotland and elsewhere. They can be proud in the knowledge that Don Dobie gave great service to the nation, to the parliament and to the community at large.",55
198,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"I knew Don Dobie well from my election here in 1977. He had a great gift for friendship. My first office was very small and remote in the Siberia of the Senate side of Old Parliament House. When Don Dobie came to visit me, it was hard for both of us to wedge in. As a comparatively senior Liberal, he had a far better office with a view on the first floor. He soon moved to an even better one when some Liberals retired. He ensured that I succeeded him on the first floor. Greater love hath no member than this, that he hands over . a good office to somebody from another party. He was very proud of his Scottish lineage, his family, his work as a banker, his Columbia MBA, the Liberal Party and having been a minister assisting William MCMahon as Prime Minister. He never said a critical word about Billy MCMahon, which is something that put him in a very small, almost exclusive, group inside his own party. Graham Chase's excellent film Democracy was an account of the 1984 election campaign in Cook. In this poll, Cook was one of the most marginal seats in the country, but Don Dobie, who appears in a cameo role in the film, substantially increased his majority. Shot and cut in the cinema verite style, the film was an unsparing account of Labor's unsuccessful campaign-not one of the ALP's finest hours-in which the candidate belonged to one faction and most branch supporters to another. The film, which was distributed by Film Australia, had a cult statusMr Lee-It still has.",55
199,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"It still has, says the honourable member for Dobell. The film had a cult status in NSW in the 1980s but it was not seen on television until February 1996, when the ABC showed it in prime time. I cannot think why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) always thinks of the ABC as having been politically hostile because, though I do not say that the showing of the film Democracy was the major cause for Labor's defeat in 1996, it certainly would not have done us any good. The timing of the film was unfortunate. During the six years of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, Don Dobie was the deputy chairman. I worked very closely with him and welcomed his encouragement and support. I admired his very wide range of interests. He was, of course, a very traditional campaigner. He was an assiduous door-knocker, with a mastery of the small platoons that make up the rich complexity of society. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of individual families, and their pets. He used his gifts as a singer in campaigning in old people's homes and hospitals. Bennelong is not all that marginal, but I have often wondered whether the Prime Minister would contemplate following in his footsteps. He probably would not.",56
200,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"Are you trying to give me a message, Barry?",56
201,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"Certainly. Don Dobie and I shared a keen interest in art. He was very knowledgeable about Australian painting and had been on the committee which recommended the choice of artworks for the public area of this building. The paintings in his office demonstrated his superior judgment. To an extraordinary degree, his life was his work. The death of his 40-year partner in 1995 was a very heavy blow. Retirement, although he said he welcomed it, in March 1996 took him away from the parliamentary life which he loved. I suspected that he might not survive all that long. It proved to be less than nine months. He contributed to the extraordinary richness and diversity of parliamentary life. He was a thoroughly good citizen and a strong supporter of his own party but also a person of considerable breadth who had a degree of empathy, who was able to see other points of view. Together with other members of the Labor Party, I was very glad to attend his memorial service at Cronulla this morning. He would have enjoyed every word of it.",56
202,Mrs BISHOP,CONDOLENCES,"Mackellar-Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel) (3.57 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, Don Dobie was a friend. It seems only a little time has passed since he was sitting in the very chair that you occupy. The stories of the past that Don could share with party colleagues were ones that truly make up part of the richness of the Liberal Party. Don served on the executive of the Liberal Party for many years. He had left the executive by the time. I joined it. The tales he told and passed on meant that you got an understanding of the workings of the party in a way that simply reading a chronicle could never give you. Don managed to bring around him a galaxy of friends that were diverse and which you might have thought from time to time had little in common. But they had one thing in common, and that was the friendship they enjoyed with Don. I remember one friend in particular, who was the president of the Cronulla Women's Liberal Group. Cronulla Women's was almost the strength and backbone of electoral support for Don. I remember that I used to attend its Christmas parties regularly. On one occasion, the president, who was just entering her 80th year, made the following statement: 'We are strong here, but we need some more young people. Give me some members in their 50s and 60s. They've got a good 20 years work in them.' Don shared that vision of longevity of service-of being able to go on contributing for a long time-whereby age was not a barrier to the service you could give. I agree with the sentiment just expressed, which is that Don did dearly love this place. Don did feel that here he had given work and a life which had made a difference to his country. In his early life, he had a great career mapped out for him as a banker with Westpac. He was doing well, but he chose instead the life of public service in the parliaconsiderable ment. It is one that each of us finds is often denigrated or shown in a light that perhaps suggests that service is not what it is all about. But Don Dobie was a man who truly believed that service through the parliament was an honourable life. I personally will miss him very much.",56
203,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I too would like to say a few words about the Hon. Don Dobie. I knew Don throughout his parliamentary career and before. I knew him in the days when he worked with the Bank of New South Wales. Indeed, he was the boss of my wife, Rosemary, at the time that he was elected to parliament. So I had an association with him both outside and inside the chamber. Don was a remarkable man, and I wanted to rise for several reasons. One was to say that I thought Chris Puplick, who spoke this morning in his memory, spoke very eloquently and very effectively about the man that we know. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, it is so different when somebody whom we know well dies. Don has been so much a part of this place that I find his passing probably far more relevant than some of those who have passed having been here and left long since. Chris made the point that Don was an economist with a heart. Knowing Don as we all do, I think that describes the man very well. He was a very well qualified, very remarkable economist and bank official. In his transition to this place, I think he showed that, even though the profession of bankers is not always admired around the world, many of them do have an understanding of the world in which they live. Don Dobie was certainly one of those. The second thing I wanted to say about Don has already been said, and I do not wish to repeat the degree to which he had this rapport with his electorate. He was a remarkable listener. Unlike many of us who, I guess, prefer the sound of our own voices to those of others, Don was certainly remarkable in the way in which he would sit and listen and talk to people. As has just been mentioned, he even sang to them on occasions with some distinction. But he was a very good listener. Having listened, he always had a great capacity to analyse, digest and then make a report on whatever those events might be. Don Dobie was, I think, a remarkable Australian. He showed the diversity of this parliament. He was a very good member of the Liberal Party. He was a very effective environmentalist and one who, in his arguments in this place, showed that there is a wider face to the environmental debate than would sometimes be suggested. I regarded Don very highly as an individual and as a parliamentarian. To the people of Cook, who were his real family, all of us today would say that we too miss your very fine representative of so many years.",57
204,Mr LEE,CONDOLENCES,"I first heard Don Dobie speak in 1967 in one of those corridors in the old Parliament House outside the dining room. I grew up in the electorate of Cook, and Don was my local member for a long time. On that occasion he not only welcomed our class from de la Salle Cronulla but also arranged for the then Minister for the Navy, one Don Chipp, to speak to the class, giving the fifth class students a very detailed explanation of the latest uses of sea cat missiles. I can still remember it. By 1972 Don Dobie had become the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Billy MCMahon, or, as his local supporters used inadvertently to call him, the Assistant Prime Minister. One of my teachers, Dennis Porter, was involved in Don Dobie's campaign team. Some of my classmates and I joined the ALP at about that time, and we worked very hard for the late Ray Thorburn, who went on to defeat Don at the 1972 and 1974 elections and was in turn beaten by Don in the Fraser government's victory in 1975. I met Don Dobie on several occasions in the seventies, usually during those election campaigns. He was always courteous and friendly and, while my friends and I worked very hard to defeat him, he was a very tough opponent who was held in high regard in the local community. As I think both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others have mentioned, he was a regular attender at the Cronulla Sutherland Sharks rugby league matches. He was involved with many of the local surf clubs, and, as several people have also mentioned, we in the Labor Party always heard that his secret weapon for any internal preselection ballots was that singing voice of his at either the Presbyterian functions or at the Cronulla Women's Liberal Group and others. No doubt his three years in the wilderness during the Whitlam years were tough but, after regaining his seat in 1975, he served on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence during the Fraser years. My recollection is that he was one of those few Australian MPs who was asked to be one of the international observers at the first elections in Zimbabwe. In opposition Don loyally supported Andrew Peacock as the opposition whip. As I am sure the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) remembers, he also took a keen interest in the Joint Parliamentary Committee on New Parliament House. He served many hours on the Arts Advisory Committee for New Parliament House. So, in some ways, the artworks that he helped select will surround us for many years to come. The Prime Minister mentioned in passing that perhaps he in part contributed to the former member for Cook's increased vote in the 1987 election. After he perhaps has a chance to see the video that the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) referred to, he will realise that the Labor Party also played no small part in assisting Don Dobie's increasing majority. As a member of parliament arriving here in 1984, I always found Don Dobie maintained that courteous and friendly manner which I first encountered all those years ago. He always sought to represent his electorate well, and he defended the right of backbench members of parliament to serve their constituents and their party in the House of Representatives even after they ceased to seek promotion to the front bench. He enjoyed being a member of parliament, and it is sad that, having served so many years, his untimely death has robbed him of the lengthy retirement which he deserved.",57
205,Mr JULL,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, like you, I was privileged to be at the Presbyterian Church at Cronulla this morning for the state funeral of the Hon. Don Dobie, who was a very good friend. I support everything that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other speakers have said, and today I wish to speak from a personal point of view. I did not meet Don Dobie until after my election to this place in 1975. However, I knew a great deal about him because, as the Prime Minister has said, his mother, the late Nan Dobie, was one of the stalwarts of the Liberal Party ·in Queensland. In my early days free in the Liberal Party she was of very great help to me personally. I think she probably made sure that Don Dobie looked after me or looked me up after my election in 1975. That was probably true, but I think one of the great contributions that Don Dobie made to this place was that he did have a genuine interest in new members of parliament, and gave a great deal of support and advice to them as they settled into this place. He certainly did for me. I remember the very first party meeting that we had. It is quite a strange experience, after the euphoria of an election, to move into the party room. I eventually found a chair in the left-hand corner of the Liberal Party room in the old Parliament House, but Don Dobie was not too far away from there, as were some of the other members. That particular corner was ultimately christened, I think by Don, as integrity comer. Integrity comer exists to this day, and it is quite interesting the number of people who still sit in the same spot, including my good self. But that was the nature of Don. He certainly took new members under his wing and gave them a great deal of help. I suppose I really came to regard him most highly during the time he was serving as the opposition whip. Some years ago now, in 1985, I had a serious illness and was away from this place for some three months. For one month I was in hospital, and for a great deal of that time. I was in intensive care. Don Dobie came to visit me on a number of occasions and stayed in touch daily with my wife and my officeand it was tremendous. He was also very friendly with my wife, and that friendship has gone on for a number of years. I think it came about as a result of that very difficult time. They had an agreement: my wife would make Don Dobie rumballs and homemade jam in return for his collection of plastic shower caps from the hotels he visited around the world. Whenever she was here visiting, there was this exchange of the home cooking and great plastic bags full of shower caps that Don had pinched. I think it is probably fair to say that, to this day, my wife still has a couple of thousand shower caps to go through before she forgets the very great contribution that Don Dobie made. Don was a great traveller and I was privileged on two occasions to go overseas with him-once on a delegation to Israel and again as part of a subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. That subcommittee, of which there were five of us, went to the Lebanon; that trip was in 1983. Of course, the tragedy that was the Lebanon at that time was well and truly under way. It was a dangerous trip and it was a time of some tension. The members on that trip included the present Government Whip, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs and member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), Senator Kerry Sibraa, Don and I Mr Lee-The Opposition Whip?",58
206,Mr JULL,CONDOLENCES,"No, I do not think he was on that one; it might have been another one he was on. Was Leo on that one?",59
207,Mr CADMAN,CONDOLENCES,Yes.,59
208,Mr JULL,CONDOLENCES,"Good heavens! One of the most magnificent stories, because we were trying to get some sense of balance as to what was happening in the Lebanon at this time, resulted from the decision that we should speak to most of the major parties who were involved in that tragic conflict. After a great deal of negotiation by the Australian authorities in Beirut at that time, an appointment had been made with Walid Jumblatt, who was head of the Druze. Arrangements were made for us to cross the green line in Beirut to go through the tragedy that was West Beirut to Walid Jumblatt's headquarters. We were split into two distinct teams. I was placed with Ben Humphreys and Kerry Sibraa in a backup car; and Don and the others, I think, went in the official Australian government vehicle at that time, which was an amazing vehicle-it was a huge black Mercedes Benz that I think could probably withstand a rocket attack, and it was a very slow vehicle. We led the way, went through the green line, passed through security checks all over the place and duly arrived at headquarters. The three of us got out to be greeted by rounds of gun fire just at the end of the street. I think we cross all political boundaries when we find ourselves in situations like that, because Sibraa and I were over the fence at 100 miles an hour, as was Ben Humphreys, and we kept our heads down until the firing had stopped. Of course, it was some 40 minutes or so before this huge lumbering black Mercedes Benz pulled around the comer and there was Don Dobie, sitting in the back of it, smiling and waving almost as though he was on a world tour. He got out of the vehicle and wanted to know what the trouble was. The three of us were in a state of complete and utter shock. We were shaking. We had never been through anything like it in our lives. But Don took it quite calmly and duly led this delegation into have this discussion with Walid Iumblatt. That is one of my favourite Don Dobie stories. Don played a great part in the development of the new Parliament House and the facilities that we have here, and that has been mentioned. I think it was one of the great privileges to be taken around the new Parliament House with Don Dobie as your tour guide. He certainly knew everything that was involved in this very complex place. He had a very great love of the parliament. He had a very great love of the institution. I think former speakers have been right in saying that Don saw the job of a parliamentarian as a real vocation and an honourable vocation-and I would always respect him for that. For his many kindnesses over the years, I certainly give thanks for the life of Don Dobie. He was a great Australian.",59
209,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"Mr Speaker, could I ask the House to excuse me. I have to return to Sydney for a dinner engagement. I would not normally leave before the end of this motion, and I would not want my departure to be seen as disrespectful.",60
210,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"We thank the Prime Minister.  wish to speak long or go over much of the ground that has already been gone over today. But I do want to say that, when I think of Don Dobie, the words that come to mind are of someone who was courteous, kindly and gentle, and someone who always had a smile for you when you met him in the corridors. It was my privilege to go away on a tripand perhaps that is the way most members get to know members from the other side-with Don in 1986. It was a trip to India and Sri Lanka. It was being led on this occasion by a woman member from our side of the House, and I have to confess that Don was less than impressed by the obsession with the order of cars and the formality and protocol of the meetings. He dubbed the whole exercise 'gladioli diplomacy'. That is something that has always stuck with me, and I am not sure that it was meant as a compliment. I think it is ironic that, having had a marginal seat, lost it, contested it and won it 10 occasions, Don would have always, I think, aspired and hoped to have served this House as Speaker. In the one election where he announced his retirement, of course, the coalition had a magnificent victory. I think it is a sadness that someone who served this parliament so long should have enjoyed such a little retirement. I am pleased to say that it was my privilege to befriend Don and I am sorry to have seen him pass on.",60
211,Mr MUTCH,CONDOLENCES,"It is my privilege to be the successor to Don Dobie in the federal electorate of Cook. As I have encountered people both in Canberra and in Cook over the last few months, they have often asked about Don Dobie and they invariably referred to him, in an old-fashioned way, as a gentleman. The passing of Don Dobie marks in some ways the end of an era. It is an era in which parliament moved from the intimate Old Parliament House to this grand edifice. Although Don lamented the growing isolation of members here, he also did his very best to make this place a friendly place. He absolutely loved his time on the New Parliament House Arts Advisory Committee. He had a love of paintings which he pursued vigorously by collecting a great many of them. I can verify this from the number of hooks that he left on the electorate office walls, hooks which I will never cover. He had an expectation of enjoying these paintings in his retirement. Unfortunately, this was not to be and that is very sad. In the end, Don was taken away from us very prematurely. He will be sadly missed by a great many people. Courteous to all, Don made friends all over the place, including very much those on the other side of the house, but of course never to the detriment of his strong faith in the Liberal Party and his strong loyalty to his own party and its philosophy. He was a natural politician because he loved people. He was also a great parliamentarian because he loved the forms and the traditions that we inherited from Westminster. But, essentially, his legacy will be in the hearts of the people he knew personally and, in particular, his constituents in Cook. On Sunday, I attended the annual surf life on saving carnival of Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club. The flag over the clubhouse was flying at half mast and all who gathered there, including members from North Cronulla, Elouera and Wanda-clubs which Don referred to as his wonderful surf life saving clubs-saluted Don with a moment's silence, gazing out to sea across Bate Bay, a view that Don Dobie was able to enjoy every day of his life when he was at home in his electorate. He was very much at home in his electorate. Don Dobie, with his white hair and stately manner, was seen as a fatherly figure to many of his constituents. Indeed, many of them knew Don Dobie from the day they were in kindergarten. They remembered him because he took the time to be nice to them and to take an interest in them as individuals. Born a Scot, he took his clan responsibilities very seriously indeed. Recently he gave me a piece of sage advice when he said, 'If they live in the electorate, look after them your own family; if they don't, forget them.' He was equally parochial concerning his football club, the Sharks, and also the Southern Districts Rugby Union Club. He also was the Woolooware branch representative in the Cook electorate and he never missed a Woolooware branch meeting. He instinctively understood the essence of politics. He devoted all his attention, his considerable skill and great intellect to the service of his people. He had a particular affection for young people and was a familiar face at scouting and guiding movement activities and at youth clubs such as that organised by the Miranda RSL sub-branch. He was always there and they always expected him to be there. There would hardly be a person in the Sutherland shire without a fond memory of Don Dobie. He will be remembered with the greatest affection.",60
212,Mrs GALLUS,CONDOLENCES,"Hindmarsh) (4.19 p.m.)When I first came to this place in 1990, my room was opposite Don's. I sat on the opposition benches, although not on the same seat, just across the aisle from Don, and he was deputy chair of the environment committee which I was also on. So I had many opportunities to get to know Don. He was very kind to me as a new member-as other members, including the member for Fadden (Mr lull), have mentioned-in telling me about the rules of this place, which were basically you were on your own and you made the best of it you could but he was there to give any help if he could. I can still clearly remember the day I gave my maiden speech. I was not nervous at the time but Don Dobie was. I can remember standing there giving my speech and having Don nervously, as I got towards the 20 minutes, look at his watch as if to remind me that I really did have to finish on the 20 minutes. I think I finished two seconds before the 20 minutes were up, and by that time Don was an absolute nervous wreck, having watched me through the speech. This says something about Don. He really did care for other people and he empathised with them. In instructing me about this place, he informed me of the first time he missed a like division after the first time. I missed a division. His was much more spectacular than mine. In fact, everybody had been invited to the Lodge and Don had arrived at the Lodge to find that he was the only person there. It turned out the rest of the House was sitting here in a division. But Don, at that time as a new member, said he had not been made aware of the importance of divisions and had thought that an invitation to the Lodge was far more important than attending a division. As a reward for this understanding of what was proper, he got to have a long private conversation with the Prime Minister's wife. All who knew Don would know how much he did enjoy it. We will miss the type of person Don was. It w,luld have been with great regret that he did not make it to the position of Speaker because he would really have loved to have held that position, and I think he would have held it very well. He had three great loves in his life. They were the parliament, the electors of Cook and, of course, his partner George. He was without them all this year, and so I think it was not surprising that he did pass away this year.",61
213,Mrs SULLIVAN,CONDOLENCES,"Moncrieff) (4.22 p.m.)I am aware that this condolence motion has been quite lengthy. I shall therefore not attempt to canvass at length the intricacies of my friendship and assocIatIon with Don Dobie, but I do want to say a few things. I met him after he was re-e1ected in 1975, his having been out of the parliament from 1972 until 1975. I knew nothing of him in advance until I found him to be my party room companion. We sat next to one another in the party room for nearly 20 years from there on, and jolly company he was too. I was going to refer to the fact that Don was an ex-Queens lander, but I am reminded of the fact that, similar to the United States Marine Corps where there is no such thing as an ex-marine, there is no such thing as an Queenslander. Don was certainly never an exQueenslander. Whilst he was wholeheartedly a New South Welshman and represented his New South Wales electorate with some gusto, he was also always a very proud Queenslander and a very frequent visitor. That was not least because of his mother, who lived in Brisbane and who was very active in the Liberal Party. I think his mother had three great loves, probably four-I never knew Don's father, but I assume Don's father was one of them. The other three were Don, the Liberal Party and the Order of the Eastern Star. It was probably appropriate that she very suddenly, without warning-a way that all of us would like to die; quickly, without warning and without illness-when returning from a meeting of the Order of the Eastern Star, during the 1990 election campaign. Don went to Queensland for her funeral, of course, which I attended. I think as much as anything he grieved for the fact that his mother was missing an election campaign. She was a great stalwart of the Liberal Party. Don used to campaign in Queensland elections, whether they were Brisbane City Council elections, state elections, federal elections-whatever. He would be out there door-knocking and helping new, young candidates. He brought to the job a wealth of experience and knowledge, not just of federal politics but also of Queensland politics and Brisbane politics. He always knew what he was doing. The two great loves that Don shared with his mother were the love of the Liberal Party and of the Presbyterian Church. He was always a very determined member of the Presbyterian Church and always made sure that people knew that it was the Presbyterian Church, not the Uniting Church, of which he was a member. We served on a number of committees over the years-the New Parliament House Committee, which has been mentioned today, and the Joint House Committee. I also served on a number of party policy committees with Don, not least of which was our party's environment committee, of which he was chairman for a good number of the years that ex- he was here. He had a passionate interest in the subject of the environment and was always very anxious to be chairman of that committee so that the coalition's environment policy was pointed in the right direction. In the early 1980s he attended the United Nations as one of the parliamentary delegates to the General Assembly. In the course of that, I contacted a friend of mine in the United States and suggested to Don that if he was in San Francisco he might look up a fellow called Bob Sullivan, who could show him San Francisco the best way. They became very close friends. When Bob Sullivan and I died subsequently married in 1983, Don was master of ceremonies at our wedding. So Don's life has interwoven with my life for a very long time. Then in 1984 I made the move from the Senate to the House of Representatives. Like other members of the House of Representatives who have spoken today, when I came newly elected to the House he decided that he would take me under his wing and teach me what he thought I needed to know about being a member of the House of Representatives. I was in a marginal Liberal seat, and he was of enormous assistance to me. He had a sense of politics. He had a keen knowledge of the importance of attention to detail in electoral matters. He conveyed that great enthusiasm to anybody who took the time to listen to him. I am not surprised Don Dobie did not have a long retirement. I expected when he announced that he would not be contesting the last election that he would not live long. I talked to him prior to his retirement and asked him what he was going to do. He said that he was going to do many things, that he had many plans, but it seemed to me he was simply putting on a very brave face. In a sense, I think he had a little bit of a broken heart. I cannot imagine Don Dobie living outside politics. He was so much the total political animal that I do not think he would have wanted to live for very long outside politics, no longer a participant. He himself would say that he had a good life and a rich life. He was grateful for all the benefits he had had. In recent years he had some health worries, and they were serious worries. He had some serious setbacks. He certainly would not have wanted to just fade away. Vale Don Dobie. You made a very significant contribution to the party and the parliament you loved, and you will be remembered.",61
214,Mr RUDDOCK,CONDOLENCES,"I do wish to be associated with this condolence motion. I was gratified today that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) invited me to represent him personally at the state funeral for Don. Don was a long standing friend. You have heard many comments today about the way in which Don Dobie could befriend you and assist you. Let me say that, from a politician to a politician, the most sincere comment is to say that when a colleague appears as Don did for me on three occasions on a preselection committee, if you are glad that they were there, you know that you are a friend. Don was a friend to me. He supported and encouraged me as a younger person in the New South Wales division. He did so as a Liberal. That is something about which he was proud, something about which I am proud. Today Chris Puplick spoke of him in a much more comprehensive way than I propose to now. If one would like to read the eulogy written comprehensively about the life of an individual, Chris Puplick's eulogy today is a very fine tribute and one which I very much endorse. I am glad to have known Don and glad today to have been at his farewell. I am sorry that we did not have an opportunity to farewell him on many more occasions when he left the parliament.",63
215,Mr NEHL,CONDOLENCES,"I would much rather not be speaking in a condolence motion to Don at all; but the fact is that it is inevitable and inescapable, and so I am glad that I can make a brief contribution. I was very pleased indeed to be able to accompany you, Mr Speaker, to Don's funeral this morning. While there has been quite a lot of mention in this motion about his association with the youth organisations, the surf clubs and various other organisations in his electorate, it is also appropriate to record that members of those organisations turned out in large numbers this morning to farewell Don and maintain a guard of honour as his coffin left the church. There were scouts, cubs and people from the surf clubs and it was a very moving tribute that they took the trouble to do that. I first met Don in the early 1960s. He and I were both attending a conference in Grafton on politics and the media arranged by the University of New England Adult Education Department, the department of university extension as it then was. Don was representing the Liberal Party and, at that time, I was the secretary and executive officer of the New England new state movement. We naturally got together and I can recall Don, my wife and I sitting up until three o'clock or four o'clock in the morning talking endlessly with great enthusiasm about politics. That is the epitome of Don Dobie. He had enormous enthusiasm, an enthusiasm that he was very pleased to share with everybody. The only other point I want to make, because I do not want to repeat what other people have said, is that he of course did occupy the Speaker's chair on many occasions as a Deputy Chairman of Committees and as a member of the Speaker's Panel. I would like to put on the record that when he was in the chair he occupied it with the total fairness that everyone of us who has the privilege of sitting there wants to emulate. He did that job remarkably well, with great fairness, great patience and great tolerance. Like my other colleagues, I regret that he is no longer with us.",63
216,Mr ANDREW,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to briefly be associated with this tribute to the late Don Dobie. Much has been said in these speeches of recognition of Don Dobie's life. But I would like to pick up on a remark made particularly by the member for Fadden and Minister for Administrative Services (Mr lull), who made so much of the association and affinity that Don had for training new members to help them to gain a greater appreciation of this place. I rise because in 1983, when Don Dobie became the Opposition Whip, I entered this parliament as the only new Liberal. So, in a sense, I had Don's undivided attention. It was Don who gave me a great deal of sage advice about the way to best serve the electorate. He gave me the same advice as he gave the incoming member for Cook. He said, 'Neil, if they live in Wakefield, treat them as if are part of the family; and if they don't, ignore them.' It is advice that I have followed religiously ever since. But it was not the only wise advice he gave me. Along with the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), I must reflect on the way in which he, as the whip, had an open door. As a new member, I was always made to feel welcome in the whip's office and always made to feel that any question, far from being a hindrance to the whip's program, was something that he was pleased to hear and then offer me some counsel over. The other thing he did-which some members may find quite extraordinary; here I was, a new member with very little understanding of the place in the Old Parliament House, in which the offices were very confined-was to arrange for me to share my first office with the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). There will be some who will say that perhaps the member for O'Connor may not be the sort of influence you would instantly put a new member under and that they do not understand the member for O'Connor. The wise Don Dobie could not have treated me better. I discovered a new friendship in the member for O'Connor and a great deal of very worthwhile advice about how best to service an electorate and how best to be identified with an electorate, particularly a rural electorate such as O'Connor or, in this case, Wakefield. So I, too-who, as a new member for a time, until the arrival of the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in a by-election and the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) in a by-election, had Whip Dobie's undivided attention-pay my tribute to a man who made my entry into this place so much easier than would otherwise have been and recognise, as the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) has, his real concern for the environment. I also pay a tribute, as all other members will know, to his stoicism, particularly over the last two parliaments and most particularly ever the last parliament, when Don had some difficulty in getting around this building but never complained and maintained that cheerful approach to life that we all came to regard they as characterising him. He said that I should treat the people in Wakefield as if they were a part of the family. He certainly treated the people in Cook as if they were part of his family. They and we will miss him sorely.",64
217,Mr CADMAN,CONDOLENCES,"I wish to pay tribute to our departed colleague, the former member for Cook, Don Dobie. Don Dobie was a gracious man. He had broad political and general knowledge and he was a fount of wisdom to anybody that wished to consult him. His knowledge of parliamentary affairs and the history of the processes of parliament was something that all members should be exposed to. I believe that his major contribution to the parliament was, drawing on his banking experience, his time as a member and Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. It was an outstanding contribution that he made to this parliament, to the management and accountability of public affairs. Indeed, he continued the great traditions of the Public Accounts Committee, which were later continued by another former colleague, David Connolly. I had the privilege of scrutineering in Don's election in 1983. There I learnt the strength of his local organisation and his capacity to winkle out every vote from every polling booth and those people who were avid in their support of him. I regret that I was not at the Presbyterian church in Cronulla this morning, but I wish to use this opportunity to pay tribute to a fine departed colleague.",64
218,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"Don was a compassionate and concerned man, caring and sensitive; a man with a real sense of history and the past, with unfailing confidence about and faith in the future; a man of great dignity, courtesy and charm; a gentleman in the truest and fullest meaning of the term. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote: That man is a success who has lived well; laughed often and loved much, who has gained the respect of intelligent men and the love of children; who has filled his niche and accomplished his task; who leaves the world better than he found it; who never lacked appreciation of the earth's beauty or failed to express it, who looked for the best in others and gave the best he had.

219,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in parliament assembled, the families and friends of Bathurst Community Child Care-Scallywags, NSW, Katoomba Children's Cottage, NSW, North Richmond Child Care Centre Inc., NSW, and Gumnut Cottage, Macquarie University, NSW, respectfully bring to your attention the adverse effects to the quality, availability and equity of child care should changes proposed in the recently tabled budget go ahead. Namely that: removal of operational subsidies to community based (not for profit) long day care centres will increase fees, adding a greater financial burden to working parents. removal of operational subsidy to community based (not for profit) long day care centres in order to place them in competition with privately owned centres (operating for profit) is unfair, iniquitous and may result in a lesser quality of care for our children. We request the House support the retention of operational subsidies to community based (not for profit) long day care centres and that community based (not for profit) child care continue to be valued and supported as a lower cost, high quality child care alternative for working parents. by Mr Andren (from 132 citizens), Mr Bartlett (from 73 citizens), Mr Bartlett (from 38 citizens) and Mr Howard (from 115 citizens). Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the certain residents of the State of NSW draws to the attention of the House that: I. The Coalition's decision to means test the Childcare Cash Rebate discriminates against working parents and is a breach of a pre-election promise, where the Coalition's policy clearly stated 'We are committed to maintaining a non means tested Childcare Cash Rebate'; 2. The Coalition's decision to abolish operational subsidies for community based long day care centres will result in these centres having to charge higher fees, which will again discriminate against working parents; and 3. The Coalition's changes to the income test for Childcare Assistance will mean that the majority of parents pay far more in increased child care costs than provided through the Family Tax Initiative. Your Petitioners request that the House: I. exert pressure on Members of the Coalition to Child Care reverse the outcomes of the 1996 Federal Budget in relation to child care; 2. hold Members of the Coalition to their pre-election commitments to retain the former system of child care; and 3. vote against legislation given effect to these changes which are to the detriment of Australian families. by Mr Bevis (from 10 citizens) and Mr MCClelland (from 132 citizens). Commonwealth Dental Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of electors draws to the attention of the House the issue of the cessation of the Commonwealth Dental Program. The Program has successfully provided accessible quality dental care resulting in decreasing numbers of tooth extractions, increasing simple tooth restoration work and decreasing waiting list times for people on pensions, the unemployed and people on health care cards. The loss of this service would condemn many people to long waiting Iists and substantially increase the probability 01 pensioners and unemployed people having their teeth extracted rather than having simple cost effective fillings. Your petitioners request the House to reinstate the funding of the Commonwealth Dental Program and ensure there is no decrease in funding in real terms for public dental service. by Ms Macklin (from seven citizens) and Mr Vaile (from 25 citizens). Small Businesses: Sydenham To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia draws attention of the House the plight of small businesses in the suburh of Sydenham whose income has been substantially cut as a result of the acquisition of more than ISO houses in that community. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: provide immediate compensation for businesses in Sydenham as a result of lost income provide real financial assistance for those wishing to relocate their business consult those businesses who wish to remain about the best possible arrangements for their future. by Mr Albanese (from 149 citizens). Sydney Airport To the Honourahle the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996 to be debated and passed as a matter of urgency. We believe there must be a maximum of 80 movements in anyone hour and that this figure be reduced once a second airport is operating. Your petitioners therefore request the House to pass this Bill as a matter of urgency. by Mr Albanese (from 125 citizens). Sydney Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the sustained detrimental effect on the quality of life for people living under the flight path of Kingsford Smith Airport, Sydney. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: take immediate action to construct a second airport for Sydney at the Badgerys Creek site make the second airport the main airport for Sydney in the interim, ensure all departures and arrivals are directed over Botany Bay whenever possible. by Mr Albanese (from 47 citizens). Home and Community Care Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: The petition of certain residents of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that: (a) funding cuts to the Home and Community Care Program, which covers services such as Meals on Wheels, Community Transport, Home Mainteto the nance programs and home help services, will severely disadvantage elderly and disabled people; (b) these funding cuts will result in poorer quality of life for these disadvantaged people; (e) and is in breach of an election promise by the Coalition Government that the poor and needy would not be adversely affected by a Coalition Government. Your petitioners therefore request the House that these funding cuts be immediately reversed and assurances given to the Home and Community Care Program providers that their future funding is guaranteed. by Mr Albanese (from 22 citizens). Gun Laws To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned, protest against the new gun laws as proposed by the Prime Minister, John Howard. We firmly believe that these laws will not reduce the incidence of mass shootings or other illegal activities involving firearms, and consider the new laws to be an unfair attack on law-abiding gun owners. We therefore pray that the House reconsider its aetions against firearms and firearm owners in Australia. by Mr Andren (from 422 citizens). Circus Animals To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that under the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations of the Quarantine Act 1908, approval is given for the importation of free ranging exotic animals such as lions, tigers, bears, elephants and non-human primates to be used for entertainment purposes in circuses and mobile displays. The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus on environmental awareness for people, especially children to learn that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses. We ask this based upon the inhumane conditions that the animals are kept in, the conditions under which the animals are transported, the often cruel training procedures, and the inappropriate messages conveyed to children by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. by Mrs Bailey (from two citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland expresses concern at the Federal Government's recent decision to cut funding to the ABC by $65 million over two years. This decision will severely compromise the role of the ABC as an independent, non-commercial source of news, sport, information and entertainment. The ABC is a widely respected Australian institution, recognised as a service committed to quality and excellence in broadcasting. The funding cuts which have been announced are the largest ever to the ABC since it was formed in 1932. The decision contrasts completely with a commitment given by Prime Minister, John Howard, and Communications and the Arts Minister, Senator Richard Alston, prior to the election in March 1996. It was then promised that ""The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC."" We request the House to calion the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to stand by their pre-election commitment, and rescind its recent decision to slash funding to the ABC. by Mr Bevis (from 12 citizens). Abortion Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House the procedures of D&X (partial birth-skull decompression) abortions. We further point out to the House that such procedures cause death by dislocation of the vertebrae or by removal by suction of the brain. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House opposes any appropriation to Medicare to fund D&X abortions, and calls on the National Health and Medical Research Council to oppose D&X abortions. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 115 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the Northern Rivers Region of the State of New South Wales, draws the attention of the House to our opposition to the Budgetary cuts to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. We, the undersigned, believe that the announced $65 Million cut to the funding of the ABC and the Government Inquiry into our national public broadcaster will irreparably damage the basic services that we, as rural Australian citizens, rely upon. As international experiences have shown, the introduction of advertising can compromise the impartiality and independence of a public broadcaster and lead to a decline in its charter. Therefore, we request the House not decrease the funding to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and do not introduce advertising. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 23 citizens). Mulgrave Freeway extension To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of Victoria draws to the attention of the House their support for the VicRoads submission for the extension to the Mulgrave Freeway known as the Narre Warren By-Pass. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House take the appropriate action to allow this project to commence in 1998. by Mr Charles (from 1,081 citizens). Consumer Price Index To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, Canberra: We the undersigned petitioners do show that: I. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), of necessity, covers all prices including luxuries and; 2. Pensioners spend their income on the necessities of life, which rise by greater amounts and more frequently than other items, and the pension, adjusted twice yearly according to the CPI, is losing its value and has become inadequate to our needs. We therefore call on Parliament to grant an immediate $10 (Ten Dollar) increase in the weekly pension over and above the CPI, and this we humbly pray. by Mr Hardgrave (from 20 citizens). Dale Cottages Complex, Armadale WA To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of citizens of Australia draws attention of the House the need for at least 40 nursing home beds as part of the Dale Cottages Complex in the City of Armadale. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: (a) affirm the need for additional nursing home beds in light of Australia's rapidly ageing population; and (b) ask the Ministers for Health and Family Services to investigate funding for these 40 additional nursing home beds. by Mrs Johnston (from 1,379 citizens). Sri Lanka To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia expresses our grave concerns about the conflict in Sri Lanka as arguably the most significant crisis in the Commonwealth of Nations of which Australia IS a member. We understand that both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have expressed their concerns about the conflict and have advocated sending a fact-finding parliamentary delegation to Sri Lanka. They have also emphasised the need for an internationally mediated peaceful resolution to the connict that would bring greater autonomy tor the Tamils in Sri Lanka. . We therefore pray that the House of Representatives call on the government: to persuade the United Nations to authorise a delegation to carry out a fact finding mission to Sri Lanka. to appeal to the Sri Lankan government to lift the economic embargo and allow non-government organisations to carry out emergency relief works without any government interference in the Tamil areas. to appeal to the parties to the conflict to stop the war and negotiate a political solution that recognises the right of self-determination of Tamils. to persuade the parties to the conflict to accept the role of an independent ""Envoy"" to facilitate a negotiated peaceful resolution to the conflict under international observation. by Mr Jull (from 719 citizens). Medicare Rebates: Psychiatric Patients To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of Australia draw to the attention of the House that the proposed Medicare Rebate Reductions for Psychiatric patients who have already received fifty consultations in any twelve month period, are discriminato the tory, dangerous and not cost effective. Your petitioners therefore request the House that these funding cuts be immediately reversed and assurance given to Psychiatric patients and their families that future Medicare funding be guaranteed. by Mr Lee (from 1,362 citizens). Gun Laws To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned requestsThat the Federal and State Governments act swiftly to enact all the proposed new gun laws recommended by the Police Ministers' meeting of 10 May 1996, including: a complete ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and national registration for all firearms. by Mr Lee (from 42 citizens). Child Support To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for reforms in the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to introduce and implement the following reforms: 1. That child support payments be calculated on the non-custodial parent's (payer) net basic rate of pay, exclusive of all allowances, overtime and loading. Not on gross income as it is at present and the lowering of percentages. 2. Lowering of ""the cut off points"" as an incentive to continue in the workplace. 3. Child Support payments be calculated from the net income on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. 4. The non-custodial parent receives a reduction in the child support payment while he or she has the children for periods of time e.g. holidays. by Mr Marek (from 152 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House to the significant benefits which would accrue to the Central Queensland region by the establishment of a hemp growing industry for industrial, medicinal, ecological, economical, and construction purposes. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to support the efforts of the Cannabis and Hemp Growers, Graders and Traders Association in their efforts to establish this industry for such purposes. by Mr Marek (from 100 citizens). University of New South Wales: Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to the attention of the House that the Commonwealth of Australia has provided significant funding to the University of New South Wales including the funding for the University's St George campus. A reduction in that funding has resulted in the University of New South Wales proposing to restructure its operations including abolishing the current schools at the St George campus of the University. Your petitioners therefore petition that the House moves to support the continuing funding and operation of the St George campus of the University of New South Wales including the schools of applied and performing arts, teacher education and sport and leisure studies. by Mr MCClelland (from 5,465 citizens). Child Care To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament We, the undersigned, have recorded below our opposition to the cuts to community based child care. We encourage your support to ensure that this does not happen. by Mr MCClelland (from 68 citizens). Unions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the intimidatory tactics of some unions towards both employers and employees, and specifically: union harassment of intervention in a workplace, even where employees have indicated no desire to join or be represented by the union; demands by some unions to be party to Hemp agreements in the workplace even where the employer and employees have indicated an express wish that the union not be involved; and attempts by some unions to force a company out of a State industrial system into a Federal award despite objections from the employer and employees. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to support legislation which upholds freedom of association and protects workers and their employers from the above forms of intimidation. And your humble petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr MCLachlan (from 735 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of Friends of the ABC-Eurobodalla Branch, Australia, brings to the attention of the House that: The Honourable the Minister for Communications has foreshadowed presenting to the House, Appropriation Bills which will substantially reduce funding appropriated by Parliament to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This funding reduction will greatly damage the nature and operations of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Your petitioners therefore request that the House resolves to maintain the funding appropriated to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at the current real level. by Mr Nairn (from 10 citizens). Medicare Offices, Regional Queensland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain electors of the Division of Hinkler draws to the attention of the House That the Petitioners are concerned with the reports of a number of Medicare offices to be closed, in particular, Regional offices in Queensland and especially (I) the subsequent possible job losses in the region and the flow on effect to the local economy. (2) The long term damage sustained to regional centres throughout Queensland which will impact on future growth in our region. (3) The impact of the planned office closures on: (a) The working family who obtain their childcare rebate from their local Medicare Office. (b) The people who will no longer have access to an office to obtain an immediate reimbursement of their scheduled benefits which will cause severe financial hardship. (4) That access to Medicare by mail will result in delays of payments up to several weeks and involves the filling out of time consuming forms not required at present. Your Petitioners therefore request the House to, Maintain the existing Medicare Offices in Regional Queensland and oppose public sector cuts being implemented now or those planned for the future which affect our region or Regional Queensland. by Mr Neville (from 175 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The Petition of the undersigned showsthat the overwhelming majority of Australians support uniform, national gun laws and the associated compensation measures as agreed between the Prime Minister, State Premiers and the Chief Ministers of the ACT and NT. Your petitioners ask that the Housecontinue to demonstrate its firm support for these measures; take all possible action to expedite their mentation; and resist all calls for the control measures to be watered down or abandoned. by Mr Williams (from 68 citizens). Petitions received. NA",65
220,Mr QUICK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (I) notes that the United Nations has declared 1996 to be the International Year of Eradication of Poverty; (2) notes that, in spite of significant economic progress in many countries over the last 50 years, more than one billion people continue to live in absolute poverty; and (3) urges the Government to increase the budget allocation for aid and to take all possible measures to work toward the elimination of poverty. In spite of significant economic progress in many countries over the past 50 years, more than one billion people continue to live in absolute poverty throughout our world. I urge all in this parliament to work to increase the budget allocation for aid and to take all possible measures to work towards the elimination of poverty. Our country is prosperous, and the levels of poverty experienced overseas are unknown to us. Nearly 200 million children in the developing world are malnourished, 30 per cent do not even complete four years of schooling and an estimated 20 per cent do not have access to basic medical care. Gun Laws Development assistance aid is now at its lowest level for 20 years despite the fact that the industrialised nations have made commitments to help solve problems of poverty in the developing world. They have agreed that at least 0.7 per cent of gross national product should be given in aid. In 1994 only four countries-Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands-reached this aid target figure. The effort that began in the 1950s to defeat malnutrition, ill-health and illiteracy has seen imple- great global successes. Somewhere someone with a vision and concern for the world decided that the eradication of smallpox was attainable-and it was. The 20 million children's lives saved since 1980 because of immunisation, oral rehydration therapy and other simple measures are bargains at almost any price. If past successes tell us anything, it is that we cannot afford complacency as we Poverty work towards achieving better lives for the world's poor. New estimates show that almost 600,000 women die each year in pregnancy and childbirth. For every woman who dies, approximately 30 more incur injuries, infections and disabilities which are usually untreated. For the most part, these are deaths of women in the prime of their lives, upon whom both young and old may depend. Maternal death is both a tragedy for individual families and an indicator of the wider tragedy of neglect for women's lives. How can such a heavy burden of death, disease and disability have continued for so long with so little outcry? The great challenge of reducing deaths and injuries among child-bearing women in developing countries still lies ahead of us. The myth prevails that the region of the world with the most malnutrition is Africa, but the percentage of children who are malnourished is significantly higher in south Asia. Half of the world's malnourished children are to be found in just three countries-Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Bangladesh and India, for example, have malnutrition rates that are higher than even the poorest countri-s in Africa. Low birth weight babies are more common in Asia than Africa. Just over 30 per cent of Africa's children are underweight, but the corresponding figure for Asia is over 50 per cent. Food availability is not usually the issue. Good nutrition in the early months of life is more usually determined by feeding practices-whether the right food is given at the right time and in the right way. Frequency of disease is dependent on many factors but especially on safe water and sanitation. It is clear to those who have worked in both south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa that the differences in standards of hygiene between the two regions are very pronounced. Hygiene tends to improve with income. For the poor anywhere, maintaining high standards is difficult. For the overcrowded poor, it is virtually impossible. It is when we look at population densities that we see one of the most dramatic differences between the two regions. On average, south Asia has 10 times as many people per square kilometre as sub-Saharan Africa, many of them crowded into urban slums on a scale not yet seen anywhere else in the world. There is no doubt that overcrowding contributes to a less healthy environment for the children of south Asia. Children in rich countries do not die from the common preventable diseases of childhood. Children in poor countries do. Measles, diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia and malnutrition kill more than eight million children a year and account for two-thirds of all deaths of those under five years. As the 20th century draws to a close, it ought to be a source of profound international shame that over eight million children are allowed to die each year from problems that have long ago been overcome in other parts of the world. The deaths of almost 25,000 children every day from five causes for which we long ago discovered inexpensive means of prevention or cure are allowed to pass with barely a murmur. The inexcusable lack of protest can be put down to two principal factors. The first is that these eight million deaths do not happen in one place at one particular time. They do not meet the criteria of the news media. Secondly, they are almost always the deaths of children from the least regarded families in the world-families on the margins of life and families without political influence, economic power or media access. Despite the progress made since the 1990 world summit for children, the job of preventing ordinary illnesses from killing, disabling and malnourishing so many millions of children is less than half done. Over the next decade, the priority must be to finish what has been started. Recent years have shown that, with the essential support from the international community, almost all governments can now command the knowledge, the technology and the outreach capacity to enable most families to protect the lives and the normal growth of their children. If there was little excuse for the death of millions caused by ordinary diseases in the 1980s, there is none at all now. As in so many other areas of the possible, the weak link is still the relatively low level of political commitment in many countries, including Australia, to doing what can be done now. Within a decade, any clinical health centre should be providing a basic service of diagnosis, advice and referral to an adequately resourced hospital. That is the right of all children and the responsibility of all governments. For the foreseeable future, hundreds of millions of children Will continue to fall ill and will continue to be brought to clinics and health centres throughout the developing world. It is how those clinics and health workers respond that will largely determine whether childhood illnesses will continue to decimate the poorer communities in this world. The task ahead is one of putting the necessary training programs into practice to ensure that skills, support and supervision are in place on the necessary scales. According to the World Health Organisation, training as many as 850,000 health workers and equipping them with enough drugs would cost approximately $200 million. To put that figure in perspective, it is about 0.2 per cent of the amount that the developing world's governments are already spending on health services. The average cost for a full course of treatment is approximately 15c, so if every single child under five in the developing world had to be given a course of drugs twice a year every year, the total cost would stilI be considerably less than $200 miIIion per annum. Controlling the ordinary diseases of childhood is, therefore, financially feasible. The idea that national governments and the international community do not have the resources is not to be taken seriously. Within a decade, any clinic or health centre worthy of the name should be providing basic, competent treatment for all the most common health problems of childhood. That is now the right of all children and the responsibility of all governments, including the Australian government. Much detailed evidence has been amassed in recent years to the effect that increases in nutrition and health status are associated with increases in productivity. Similarly, primary education has repeatedly been shown to be one of the most productive investments that a poor nation can make. Research over the last decade has shown that the guaranteeing of positive rights for girls and women is one of the most powerful of all mechanisms for promoting social and economic development. As mentioned earlier, development assistance from the world's richest countries is about 0.3 per cent, its lowest point in 20 years. While worldwide military budgets have dropped by a quarter since the end of the Cold War, saving over $250 billion a year, this money has not gone into aid, which has risen by only $1 billion a year in real terms. Official aid works out at $73 per head per year for each person in the industrialised countries. Australia gives only $61 per head. Small European countries donate more than twice the amount that Australia does, yet we supposedly have a vested interest in the well-being of our Asian neighbours. We are far short of the 0.7 per cent of gross national product called for by the Pearson commission in 1969. One year of the United Nations decade for the eradication of poverty has already passed and so far very little has been accomplished. Australia has very proudly taken a leadership role in the nuclear disarmament debate and in the elimination of landmines throughout the world. Let us as a nation and as parliamentarians take such a role in the elimination of world poverty over the next nine years.",70
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! Is the motion seconded?,72
222,Mr CHARLES,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I second the motion. I rise to support the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) in this motion. The motion is in three parts. I would like to briefly address each of those parts. The first part is that the United Nations has declared 1996 to be the International Year of Eradication of Poverty. I am not convinced that United Nations international years have necessarily achieved the outcomes that they have been set out to achieve. I recall 1990 was the International Year of Literacy and I remain unconvinced that we have substantially attacked the problem of illiteracy in the world generally and specifically in Australia. Nonetheless, I welcome the ideal, the expression, of the United Nations that we need to do everything we practically can to help eradicate poverty around the world. I support strongly the international organisaic. tion Results, particularly its Australia's component. Results is an international non-party network of volunteers committed to educating people and governments to create the political will to end hunger and poverty throughout the world. Those are indeed admirable sentiments. I think Results has been particularly effective both in Australia and internationally in getting governments and members of parliaments to recognise this need and in trying to do something to direct our aid more specifically to real eradication of poverty rather than simply dealing with trying to increase government's industrial agenda overseas. I have to say that the definition of 'poverty' requires some absolute definition. I recall a month or so ago the member for Franklin and I participated in a joint symposium here in Parliament House. At the same time a so called international expert was saying that Australia, of all the westernised countries in the world, had the greatest poverty of any. It was a joke. That expert's definition of 'poverty' was that if a family did not have a second television set or their car did not run or a kid went to school in the morning without eating his breakfast then the people were declared to be in poverty. That is a joke when you consider the hundreds of millions of people around the world who live in abject, dire poverty without proper health, sanitation or food and where so many children die malnourished and of diseases that are preventable. The second part of the motion states that, despite economic progress, there are still more than one billion people who continue to live in a state of absolute, abject poverty. That is made up of people who are hungry, people who are diseased, people who are exploited, people who live in political systems or in countries where there is not the political will to ensure that children do not go to work when they are three, four, five or six and that they are allowed and encouraged to go to school to receive a basic decent primary and hopefully secondary education. The proportion of people living in poverty has declined from 32 per cent in 1985 to 25 per cent in 1995. That is an admirable statistI think we should be pleased that the world is gradually coming to grips with this issue, but we are a long way from eliminating poverty. That 25 per cent of the world's people live in abject, dire poverty is an absolute disgrace. We should be ashamed and so should the rest of the westernised and developed world. Those who have the means and capability to help those who are less fortunate ought to show a bit of moral fibre and backbone and get on with the job. The third issue raised by the member for Franklin is that this motion 'urges the government to increase the budget allocation for aid and to take all possible measures to work toward the elimination of poverty'. I, too, would encourage the government, when it is possible, to increase our overseas aid. I have believed for a very long time that the quality of provision is much more important than necessarily the absolute level of aid that we make available. In that context I think it is important that we make poverty reduction a central core of our financial institutions and our financial assistance to other countries. Absolute poverty fuels political instability, environmental destruction and population growth which poor countries can ill afford. We have a need to focus on increasing access by poor people to productive resources that allow them to take some responsibility themselves for ending their own poverty. I think that is a very important key to what my contribution is all about today. If we can empower people to take charge of their own lives, if we give them the means to become educated, if we give women the ability to help their families rise above poverty, if we give them the means to live well enough and have enough food, if we help them to understand basic birth control measures so that they do not keep feeding the numbers of the absolutely poor all over the world, if we help them to help themselves, then we will have done a great service. I really think that is what it is all about. I have said that I think Australia has a great responsibility in the South Pacific and in south Asia too. But when you look at the South Pacific we are the largest player in the region. We are the wealthiest nation. We have a responsibility to all those small island states out there of which there are hundreds. We have a responsibility to help them look after themselves, to help them find mechanisms whereby their economies can become sustainable so they do not have to overfish their stocks, they do not have to allow the Japanese or indeed the Australians to come in and take their livelihood away and they do not cut down their trees for a pittance in order to feed the national coffers or the political machines of the countries in which that degradation occurs. It is important that we direct our aid to those small island states to help them lift themselves so that their children get a proper primary education. If the kids learn how to read, to write and to count properly, that education will feed upon itself to make the people grow and democracy will thrive, the people will thrive and they will lift themselves from their abject situation. Basic education and primary health care are the absolute keys to poverty reduction. I note that Rotary International in 1985 commenced a program called Polio Plus which had a target to raise $US 120 million in order to help eradicate polio around the world. To date, they have raised over $247 million. It was a huge international coordinated effort. As a result of the spending of that program, 144 nations around the world are polio free-up from 85 nations when Polio Plus began. UNICEF has estimated that, if it were not for the immunisation efforts over the last 10 years, two million to three million children playing and walking normally today would have contracted polio. I have to say that Rotary International, a voluntary business organisation of businessmen, deserves the greatest commendation for that effort to help eliminate a disease worldwide. It just shows what can be done with the will and the effort. It did not take government funding. It used voluntary funds raised from people like you and me, people from all walks of life, all over the world. That is the kind of thing that we can do. I also note that in Bangladesh the Grameen Bank-and other micro-credit enterprises which have allowed people who are really poor to borrow money at reasonable interest rates and pay it back gradually as they improve their own circumstances in their local situation-has proved highly successful. Early next year there will be a summit on microcredit in Washington, which our Results agency and the Australian government will attend. Hopefully the world will start directing more credit to people at the bottom of the ladder who can really use the aid. (Time expired)",72
223,Mr SA WFORD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I congratulate the members for Franklin (Mr Quick) and La Trobe (Mr Charles) for bringing this debate on poverty before the House. Albeit the United Nations has declared this year to be the International Year of Eradication of Poverty with over one billion in the world living in absolute poverty, I, for one, am not confident that the developed world will respond adequately to this most fundamental of challenges. For it is to the developed world that this challenge falls. But the developed world in the 1990s is turning around the basic principles of democracy that gave it the wherewithal to assist the world's people in poverty and the last 20 years, as the member for Franklin has explained, points that out. All nations in the developed world have created for themselves millions of poor. Many citizens in those nation states are resentful of the notion of foreign aid. It is therefore worthwhile to look back over the last 60 years and look to the reasons why this may be the case. The generations who lived through the chaos and mess of the Great Depression through the 1930s and the Second World War knew first hand the haplessness of the world's financial markets and the evils of totalitarianism. In the postwar period, governments in the developed world had a concept of democracy and employment that was a moral contract between the government and its citizens. The fundamentals of full employment and a fair distribution of income were paramount. At that time, if you looked at graphs of a nation's GNP and employment as a member of the OECD, the gap was minimal. If you look at them now and compare with 20 years ago-1978-79-the gap is huge and it is widening. That is despite the fact that, over the last 50 years, capital investment has quadrupled, energy consumption has trebled, manufacturing output has trebled and-here is the real catch-employment has grown by one-third. The developed world has created a chronic and endemic unemployment problem of around 10 per cent. If we were honest, it is about 15 per cent right throughout the world, including in the United States. This seriously undermines both the capability and the willingness of developed nations to assist the world's poor. The very notion that democracy is a moral contract is being subsumed by the idea that the contract is purely economic. The very notion that democracy is a public good is being replaced by the benefits of the private domain. 'Let the market rip' and 'user pays' have become the mantra of so much of the free world, including Australia and this current government. There is a black hole in Australia, but not the economic one offered by the government. It is the growing absence of moral good, public good, social ethics and responsibility of government and the many institutions in our nation with which so many people have lost faith. It is no wonder that the electorate at large is confused. Basic principles of a free democracy are being turned upside down: up is down; down is up. The moral contract governments have with their citizens for employment and a fair distribution of income is being replaced by the market and so-called economic good. Public good in transport, water, communications, power, education, health and the Public Service is being replaced by the good of the private domain through user pays which has no responsibility-and why should it?-to families and children. That is the role of governments. Casualisation of labour and lesser incomes are replacing permanent labour with very high incomes for the privileged few. Chief executive officers of Australian and international companies are remunerated and rewarded for sacking workers. In the 1950s and 1960s, they were remunerated for the number of people they employed. Downsizing, rightsizing and outsourcing are put up as productivity theories. Of course, what happens is that, after a relatively short period of time, fewer people work longer to produce the same or less. Productivity does not rise. The very terms are meaningless and exclude people from rational debate. No wonder the electorate is confused. No wonder doubts about foreign aid are now vigorously raised. Universal access to health care and education are threatened. Apparatchiks in political parties and the media continuously poll the electorate on the lowest possible common denominator. This feeds into governments around the world. They are unable to lift their visions above the very lowest of expectations. Anyone who thinks that the present difficult foreign aid debate will improve in the future once the so-called economic fundamentals are corrected is in for a rude shock. The social imperatives for developed nations to lift their it is game in foreign aid have gone missing. Without them, the future of foreign aid and of peace in the world looks bleak. As someone much more famous than me said, these are the best of times, these are the worse of times for public good to return to its rightful place on the agenda of the developed world's governments. If public good does not return to the agenda, the continuing tragedy of the world's poor will simply get worse, until the peace of the whole world and the apathy of our current situation are threatened.

224,Mr HARDGRAVE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I certainly have a great deal of empathy for the motion put forward by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick). So many people in our world still living in abject poverty is indeed a sad and telling indictment on our modem and supposedly enlightened times. We here in Australia have our own poor and needy, it is true. They rightly deserve every assistance we can provide. In relative terms and in global terms ours is a very rich country, particularly when compared with countries like those in Africa. The television news coverage of the current cnsls in Zaire demonstrates this: not just sections of the community live in poverty, but the entire country lives in poverty. Many people in my own electorate of Moreton, through churches and other groups, contribute money on a voluntary basis to help people who live in abject poverty around the world. As I think the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) said, empowerment and providing for some basic needs and some seed credit to these people goes a long way. It is quite important for responsible governments to make their contributions to the international good. Sadly, a lot of what the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) had to say was more of a reflection on the previous government's activities and the way it ground down our national economy than a reflection on the current government. For a country to afford to be charitable in other far-flung countries, it is important to have some economic basis on which to make its contribution. This government is certainly trying to do this. We are not just throwing money at the problem and hoping it will go away; we are carefully targeting and positioning money in places of greatest need to ensure the greatest results. Maslow's hierarchy of needs dictates that food and shelter are among those basic needs. Matters such as democracy, which we all aspire to and always defend, are very difficult concepts to explain if you do not have a crust of bread or something else on your plate. Let us have a look at what this government is doing as far as Australia's aid program objectives are concerned. Poverty reduction must be at the heart of our national aid program, as the government has made clear. This is a particularly important fact to emphasise in the midst of this debate towards the end of this International Year for the Eradicait tion of World Poverty. The aid program is driven by humanitarian concerns. Its purpose is simple: to assist developing countries reduce poverty and improve the living standards of their people through some sustainable development, and to assist in achieving a more secure and equitable international order. Good order is maintained across the world when the pressure to find food and shelter-a product of povertyis removed. The phenomenon of globalisation has provided aid agencies with an expanded agenda of problems to deal with. It has brought into sharper focus the essential interdependence of rich and poor countries. Aid is not simply charity. Giving money away may have been the previous government's approach to things in the domestic sense, but aid must be much more targeted to help people with specific problems. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) recently said in parliament, the provision of foreign aid not only is an overriding humanitarian imperative but also is in Australia's national interest. By helping to improve the lives of people in developing countries, the aid program of this government helps to overcome the conditions-such as famine, disease, inequality, refugee flows and environmental degradation-which have threatened peace. Sadly, whatever aid we do put forward does not instantly stop some of the problems existing in the world today but, nevertheless, the aid program of this government is an investment in Australia's future security and well-being. We have committed $1.45 billion to official development assistance in 1996-1997. The aid program will have a sharper humanitarian focus and it includes a new policy on education and training, with continued assistance for women's health programs and the maintenance of over $100 million in total aid flows in 1996-1997 to Africa. In relation to Africa, the government recently announced a $2.6 million package of assistance in response to the crisis in Zaire. This is immediate action from this government, this is all about people, this is all about helping them in crisis, but in the longer term is all about targeting some real assistance to empower people for their future well-being.

225,Mr HOLLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I commend the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) for bringing this motion to the House. Although the United Nations has declared 1996 to be the International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty, I suspect that, as 1996 draws to a close, there is more poverty today than there was at the beginning of 1996. As the motion rightly says, more than one billion people continue to live in absolute poverty. It is not as if poverty is impossible to eliminate. What is impossible is to get the political will of governments to work in a cooperative way in eliminating poverty. If one-tenth of what is spent on arms internationally was devoted to the elimination of poverty, poverty would be eliminated. If a quarter of what is spent on arms was spent on poverty, not only would poverty be eliminated but the world could be guaranteed clean water. But, without the political will, nothing will be achieved. We continue to live in a world in which the richest 20 per cent of people have 85 per cent of the income and the poorest 20 per cent have only 1.4 per cent of world income. Poverty, I suspect, will be with us for some time yet. A contributing factor to poverty is overpopUlation. As the world refuses to come to terms with this problem because of religious bigotry or social or cultural traditions, not only will overpopulation continue to be a problem but poverty will continue to be a problem. The two problems are related. In this regard, I think the Catholic Church has much to answer for. I could not believe it when I read that the present Pope, at the World Food Summit held in Rome two weeks ago, said that there was not a link between overpopulation and poverty. One wonders, for all his jet setting, whether he has really seen anything. Does he really understand-as in glorious drag he goes through shanty towns and slums of Africa and Asia, blessing the poor from the Popemobile-the total despair and hopelessness of so many of those people who continue to live in absolute poverty, who see no opportunity out of the poverty that for many of them the teachings and beliefs of the Catholic Church impose on them? Until we come to terms with the population question, we will be able to do nothing. We will not be able to start on the elimination of poverty, because it is also interlinked. So many countries have to increase their GNP by three, five or seven per cent each year-not to improve the living standards of their people but to keep pace each year with the increased population. That is a real tragedy. As we hear about the economic progress that is being made, poverty is not really being eliminated. That increase is just to keep pace with the ever-increasing population. Of course, the current government has hardly given a lead to the world by the cut in the last budget allocation of aid, especially the savage cuts to population programs. I do not think that throwing money at a problem is the absolute answer. It is basically a question of education, and I think it was the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) who said it is about 'empowering people'. Naturally we cannot impose our will on people, but I do firmly believe that access to information on family planning must be a basic human right. Nothing will go further to eliminate poverty than the ability of people to access information to control their fertility. Every study has shown that, where population has been stabilised, living standards have increased. Those who argue any other way, frankly, will not accept the reality of the current situation. Population is a problem-as indeed is poverty-but too often we ignore the fact that they are so interlinked. We come in here and say pious words and congratulate Rotary. These are all dips in the bucket. Rotary deserves to be congratulated for what it has done, but until the world itself starts to take this problem seriously and until we start to really look on a global nature at the elimination of poverty nothing will be achieved. I am afraid that for too many governments of the world, including this one, it is too great a problem. It does not matter which side occupies the treasury bench, we will put it into the too-hard basket. Poverty will continue with us, and I think it will be there for a long time to come yet.  arrives in this place in the same manner: we are sent here by the voters in our electorate. We are all here for the same reason: to serve the people of our electorate and to work on behalf of all citizens for a stronger, a richer and a more equitable nation. We can argue-and we do very oftenenough. about the way to achieve a more bountiful life for Australians. When our time comes leave this place, I am sure each of us hopes to leave it with the knowledge that our deavours have contributed to the achievement of that goal. Life, however, whatever the of our work here, will be perfect for very But for some, the poorest in our society, life could be a lot better. It is our solemn duty see that it becomes so. Australia is not accustomed to seeing poverty. In some countries-those ravaged war, famine, disease, greed or corruption-the poor are indeed in the majority. While we Australians can count our blessings every day, we cannot tum a blind eye to the human tions to problems. degradation caused by poverty, whether it be in a far-off land or here at home. The International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty is recognition of a problem from which no nation is exempt. Eradication of poverty is truly a tall order, but that does not mean we should not attempt it. It is a noble idea-some might call it a dream-but that does not mean we should not chase it. The 20th century, more than any other, has seen government and society attempt to deal with the problem. The rise of socialism and communism were a reflection of the mood of the time-a hope that all people would live free of poverty. Of course, these ideologies were discredited because they failed in that regard-in effect, they doomed everyone to poverty. In many countries, free enterprise flourishes today, but it appears as if the table of plenty is not big enough to seat everyone. In Australia, time, technology and changing social mores have claimed many victims. break-up of the family and high unemploybers ment have forced many people below the poverty line. We cannot tum back the clock, and we cannot tum our backs on those who have suffered. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke promthey ised that by 1990 no child would live poverty. It was a statement with admirable intent, though we know only too well that more children today live in poverty than ever before. In Australia that simply is not good I am sure many of my colleagues-in fact, to all of them-receive phone calls from the neediest of their constituents in their electorenate. Just this morning my office took two phone calls-one from a woman who had no fruit refrigerator in which to keep her food and few. another from a person who had no food and had run out of money to buy it. It may be that to we can help these constituents today with their specific problems, but too often our intervention only papers over the cracks of by their problems. Longer term solutions are much harder to find and, as the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said earlier, we must try to find the longer term and the larger soluOur charitable organisations-and I will not mention Rotary-who do so much to help the less fortunate are crying out for help. Sadly, in my state of South Australia, the introduction of poker machines has severely impacted on their coffers. Yet demand for their services increases every day. Franklin Roosevelt once remarked that the measure of a society was not how much it added to the abundance of those who had much but how much it provided to those who had the least. In Australia, we should, and must, do more. We must seek systemic change to cure the root problem that brings about poverty. As we approach the Christmas season, we should be mindful of the many who will not fully share in the joy. As the United Nations International Year for the Eradication of Poverty draws to a close, we should not forget its intent but rather recommit ourselves to the task at hand. It will be a long fight, but victory will be mankind's The greatest and noblest achievement. As memof a society-bear in mind that Australians on the average wage are among the wealthiest people in the world-we need to be ever conscious of the plight of the needy and ever ready to help them overcome the odds face. As representatives of the people, it in is our responsibility to lead the way.",76
226,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"There are, of course, a variety of lamentable figures with regard to the state of the world. However, we have to put them in context. I will repeat a few statistics from Trevor Kanaley, the Director-General of AusAID. The reality is that, since the 1950s, life expectancy in the world has risen from 41 to 62 years. Access to clean water for the world's population has risen from 35 to 70 per cent. Adult literacy has increased from less than half the world's population to two-thirds. I put those figures on the record not to diminish the grave crisis that we face but to indicate that foreign aid, and the need for it internationally, can solve problems. A variety of international organisations have been fighting for these improvements over those decades. The honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has recently been calling for the end of foreign aid. I think that ignores a few realities in the world. Firstly, it ignores contribution of the developed countries to the degradation of the developing world. It is worth noting an article in the Manchester Guardian of 16 June which talks about the United Kingdom's efforts to move the International Monetary Fund with regard to its funding. It is worth noting that, every year, Africa transfers to its creditors-principally northern governments, the World Bank and the IMF-around $10 billion. That is more than the region spends on health and education. Furthermore, interest and capital arrears have doubled since 1990 alone. They have doubled within six years. It is worth noting that the article points out that two of the countries in particular, Uganda and Zambia, have faced very stringent measures by the IMF. In Uganda now, one in five children does not live to their first birthday. Most of these people could be saved by low-cost medical intervention. For each dollar that is spent on health, $5 is spent on debt. In Zambia, they spend $10 in debt reduction to overseas creditors for every dollar that they spend on primary education. So one of the first urgent needs facing the world is that of tackling debt in the Third World and, more particularly, Africa. I think we all know we can spend our time whingeing about a variety of fairly bestial leaders in Africa, such as Bokassa and Mobutu-the whole lot of them-but, quite frankly, the people of the area are the ones in which we are interested. What these loans were for has been disregarded. We all know that there has to be a greater connection between loans and good governance. As I say, the first point that people critical of foreign aid ignore is the fact that there is a clear correlation between the debt they face and their poverty. Similarly, there is the reality of international corporations moving towards standardised crops and standardised products with regard to cereals, et cetera. They are gradually destroying the diversity of their crops. Since the 19th century, people have been basically forced to go over to cash crops from the sustenance crops that they had previously utilised. The second point relates to the reality of the what foreign aid can do to international population pressures. These are not just amorphous, irrelevant facts existing apart from Australia; they impose on our migration problems. One factor that the honourable member for Oxley and others need to understand is that we are facing the greatest era of population movement that the world has ever seen. This issue is relevant. For instance, in Nigeria, 83 per cent of women with fewer than seven years of schooling marry before they are 20, whereas only one-third do if they have had seven years or more in school. In Kenya, 15 per cent of women with no schooling, 28 per cent of women with primary schooling and 40 per cent of women with some secondary education practice family planning. The average number of children Kenyan women have is also strongly linked to their educational level. They have seven children if they have no schooling, but fewer than five if they have 10 years or more of education. When we start saying that foreign aid is a waste of time, we should bear two things in mind. Aid costs the Australian taxpayer less than one schooner of New per week, and that is on our current level of spending. Spending decreased under the previous government from 0.5 to 0.3 per cent. These things very much impact upon the migration pressures that this country faces. Unless we solve world population and provide people with primary education, these problems that some people are so concerned about will only become more serious for this country.",78
227,Dr NELSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Bradfield) (5.28 p.m.)Women comprise 70 per cent of the world's poor. I will paint a picture for members of House. Imagine Maria, a girl of 17 living in abject poverty in the slums of Nairobi. She has no running water or sanitation. Maria looks after her brothers and sisters while her mother can just scavenge enough to prevent starvation. Her only chance of escape is to marry someone with a job. Her mother had originally come to Nairobi from the rural areas of Kenya in search of work. If she finds a man for marriage, he will probably blackmail her into having sex before marriage. She will agree out of a fear of losing him. There are a dozen other girls who see him as an escape vehicle from terminal poverty. Thus, he acts as a transport medium for gonorrhoea, syphilis and AIDS between them. The end result is that his girlfriend's experience of fertility is that of ectopic pregnancies, street abortions and AIDS. If she ever gives birth, the baby may die of AIDS or become an orphan. Maria refuses to have an abortion, although she has not yet been chosen as a wife. To provide for her child, she has to give sexual favours to a dozen men. Five years later, she will die of AIDS without any dignity and her son will be shot as a street urchin. In other parts of Nairobi, people have access to education, contraception and things that we take granted. In considering poverty, though, let us not forget that it has numerous causes. Jesus Christ said that there will always be poor people. Also, despite some of the deeply disturbing and moving things I saw when I Was in Kenya and Tanzania visiting development programs for World Vision last year, with the exception of AIDS I saw nothing to match the deprivation, existential despair and impoverishment that I have seen in Aboriginal Australia. Many women in the developing world face misery, illness and death in bearing 99 per cent of the five children that are born every second as two people in the world die. Onethird of the world's children are undernourished, yet we keep populating the globe well beyond any reasonable expectation of sustaining them. A woman dies every minute from the complications of unwanted pregnancy and the abortion and, of the 200 million pregnancies every year, 23 million will be associated with severe complications and 15 million with long-term morbidity. Only one in 1,000 of those pregnancies occurs in the developed world. The relationship between gross domestic product and poverty is very much related to fertility rates, as previous speakers have said. For example, it is projected that Ethiopia's population will increase from 50 million to 300 million over the next 30 years. In the past 10 years the number of children per woman has increased from 5.8 to 7.5. Their gross domestic product has declined by 16 per cent. In contrast, in South Korea, the population will increase from 48 million to 56 million backover the next 30 years. In the past decade, though, the number of children per woman has declined from 4.3 to 1.8, and their GDP has increased by 150 per cent. There are 300 million women worldwide that have no access to contraception. In many parts of the world they are sold as sex slaves, they are subject to dreadful practices, they suffer and die in pregnancy, they are neglected as children, conceived too young, are kept poor and illiterate, underfed, overworked and denied equal, legal, social and economic for status. Women in many parts of the world need to be considered for their own worth, as equal members of society, rather than as mothers, potential mothers or carers. One of the most important things that any government, including our own, ought to be supporting is population and family planning programs in the developing world, because it is the failure of women to have access to fertility control-an aspiration that most women in this country want-and the failure of us to address it that create the problems for which we largely have to send foreign aid. Opinion pollsters seldom take their clipboards to the slums, shacks and shanty towns of the developing world, but if they did they would find that women there are no different from our own in their aspirations and desire to control fertility. The difference, though, is that they die, whilst we vote for governments here in Australia neither understanding nor experiencing the deprivation and the depth of their despair. To the member for Oxley (Mrs Hanson) in particular, who has said that we should stop sending all foreign aid, I remind her, members of this House and all Australians: if you want to measure the strength of individuals and of governments, you can do so by the care, concern and compassion that they show for those in greatest need.

228,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Members who have spoken on this motion have identified what amounts to horror stories about world poverty. It has become a sick joke that this year has been identified as the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty and this decade, from the point of view of the United Nations, as the decade to eradicate poverty. It is a sick joke. I thank the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) for bringing forward this motion at this time. I also congratulate him for the initiative that he has taken in bringing together members of the parliament who wish to dedicate themselves to making some contribution to the eradication of poverty on a world scale. This year Australia reduced its foreign aid commitment from 0.34 per cent of its GDP to 0.29 per cent of its GDP. The United Nations target is 0.7 per cent of GDP, and we hear it suggested that Australia reduced it because Australia can no longer afford that level of support. There are 5V2 billion people on this globe, and I1h billion live in abject povertyabsolute abject poverty. That was estimated in 1990 by the World Bank to be the equivalent of about $A450 per head per year. So 1.5 billion of our fellow humans on this globe have an average income of about $450 per year. The average income in Australia is $20,000. With our average income in Australia of $20,000 per capita, the claim is that we cannot afford to maintain an adequate level of assistance for other people around the world, including those 1.5 billion people who live in abject poverty. In 1960 the richest 20 per cent of the world's people had incomes which were 30 times greater than the poorest 20 per cent. Today they have incomes which are 60 times greater than the poorest 20 per cent. There is one bright point in all of the detail. In 1960, 73 per cent of the world's people were identified as very poor. That has improved now to only 25 per cent of the world's people being identified as very poor. But the margin between the poorest and the richest continues to increase. On the earth there is estimated to be 360 billionaires. Those people own more and receive more income than almost half of the world's people. Forty-five per cent of the world's people own and receive less income than 360 individual people. That is grotesque. Twenty per cent of the world's people receive 83 per cent of its income. Over 20 per cent of the African states have national debts which exceed their gross domestic product. Interest payments on world debt exceed the gross flow of new financial assistance, new aid to the underdeveloped parts of the world and the people who occupy those areas. Most of those countries now use new assistance to service past debts. If the world were to impose a tax of only 0.5 per cent on all international currency transactions, it would raise an amount of $150 billion which could be contributed towards the alleviation of world poverty. Every day 35,000 to 40,000 children die as a result of preventable diseases; 200 million children work in mines, factories and as prostitutes; 130 million children have no schooling. That is an indication of the dimension of this challenge. If the world is a humane place and if people are sensitive and charitable and prepared to share and make a commitment, then there can be some significant improvements-those improvements which escape us at the moment. (Time expired)",81
229,Mr TONY SMITH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Figures indicating that 20 per cent of people in the affluent world have 85 per cent of the world's income while the poorest 20 per cent have only 1.4 per cent of the world's income ought to cause a re-examination of our values and consciences. Well may it be asked why billions of dollars are spent almost without demur on space research, cable TV, grossly overpaid entertainers and sporting personalities, yet no real commitment is given to ending hunger, which is surely the ultimate in child abuse. It is clear that, in terms of aid, Australia can do only so much at a government level while the prevailing political culture obtains. When I use those words, I refer to the increasing demands, some quite unrealistic, upon the resources of government domestically. Expectations, unfortunately, have been created that the government will do a wide range of things in areas where, arguably, there is no warrant to so act. The increasing notion of middle-class welfare I find particularly disturbing. I must say that this notion has been a growing one, especially by the previous government, and is particularly targeted at the swinging voter. This demonstrates a worrying trend which creates generally a far more selfish environment that is receptive to some of the recent preposterous notions being floated, such as the elimination of foreign aid. I am pleased to remind the House of the recent words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the provision of foreign aid is not only an overriding humanitarian imperative but also in Australia's national interest. To assist our neighbours not only is a reasonable duty but also serves to forestall and perhaps even eliminate conditions which threaten to imperil the peace, order and good government in those areas of the globe where conditions such as famine, disease, refugee flow and environmental degradation are a way of life. Thus, the aid program is an investment in Australia's future security and well-being. I compliment the aid agencies who form an integral part of our foreign aid environment. I also compliment the many thousands of Australians who have sponsored children over the years, particularly through World Vision. This is a practical way that all Australians become part of the program, and it is a way of seeing the development of children who might otherwise struggle to exist in a malnourished and very deprived environment. In a budgetary sense, where spending is necessarily extremely tight, it is important to recognise that we in the affluent world, whilst experiencing the difficulties of having to stretch the dollar further, also acknowledge that there are so many millions of people far worse off than ourselves. We have little problems; they have monumental problems. It is important always to bring the debate back to this, for our complaints pale into insignificance compared with those experienced by our neighbours in the Third and Fourth Worlds. The Australian aid program has a sharp humanitarian focus. I am pleased to say that this includes a new policy on education and training on continued assistance for women's health programs. I am also pleased to say, given the current tragic situation in Africa, that the government has announced a $2.6 million package of assistance in response to the crisis in Zaire. Furthermore, the Simons review of the Australian aid program currently under way is a vital element in the government's strategy to ensure that Australian aid works for the benefit of the poor. The review will present a report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) on overall priorities and objectives and focus on the aid program. It will examine how the aid program can best contribute to lasting poverty reduction whilst also serving Australia's best interests. This will be the first such review since the Jackson committee review, which was completed over 10 years ago. Given the very different international climate in which we are now operating, the Simons review is particularly timely. The government expects the review findings to be handed down in the first quarter of 1997. The chronic problems that the world is suffering from at the moment in relation to the disparity between rich and poor, in my submission, must be always to the forefront of the minds of members of this House. We must remind not only ourselves about these can but also our constituents when from time to time those constituents criticise the aid program in this country. We must and, indeed, do have a duty to present the picture that has been presented by the speeches on the other side of the House. I am particularly indebted to all of the speakers who have spoken. I will not mention any individually, but they all made very good contributions, as did those on my side also. I thank the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) for bringing this debate to the fore and I support it wholeheartedly.",81

231,Dr THEOPHANOUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Earlier today in the House I gave a personal explanation of the circumstances surrounding an article entitled 'MP in secret tape row' which appeared in yesterday's Sunday Age. In the course of that explanation, I pointed out that this matter had arisen as a result of attempts by certain individuals to blackmail me. I wish to now inform the House of these matters in order to place in context why the Sunday Age article appeared and what my response has been. In the last three weeks, I have been subjectissued ed to vicious attempts to blackmail and intimidate me in the most outrageous way. This blackmail has been carried out by a former member of my staff, Mr Bill Albon, following the termination of his employment in my office. These matters are being investigated by the Victoria and Federal Police. Let me explain to the House some of the events that have occurred. On 22 October this year, I terminated the employment of Mr Albon as electoral officer for reasons connected with gross disloyalty and other matters. When doing so, I provided Mr Albon with a three-page statement of reasons for his dismissal. Several days later, Mr Albon initiated unfair dismissal proceedings. I was happy for this matter to proceed with due process. The Commonwealth solicitor indicated to Mr Albon's solicitor that, given the reasons that I had provided for his dismissal, the matter would be vigorously defended. However, there was a more serious development. Within a week of Mr Albon's termination, I was made aware of serious irregularities in Mr Albon' s overtime claims and his misuse of government resources. At the time, I referred the matter to DAS, which viewed the matter with such seriousness that they referred it to their Fraud Investigation Squad. I understand that these matters are now before the Federal Police. Soon after this investigation began, I started to receive telephone calls from Mr Albon culminating in an attempted confrontation with me at my home. On 13 November, Mr Albon rang me, threatening that, unless I met him that night, he would destroy my parliamentary career. I told him I could not return to Melbourne until later that week and that I would not be intimidated into such a meeting. On that same night, as reported in the media, Mr Albon confronted my brother, Theo Theophanous MLC, on the steps of the Victorian state parliament and made a series of outrageous demands and threatened that, unless these demands were met, he would initiate a campaign against me based on documents which he had unlawfully removed from my office. He also indicated he would perjure himself if necessary. My brother a statement to the Victorian state police on this confrontation in which he said, amongst other things: I asked Mr Albon what precisely he wanted from me and he replied, that I should tell my brother that he should settle the unfair dismissal case by agreeing to a payment to Mr Albon of $30,000 which he indicated was the maximum amount the Department of Administrative Services could pay without Court action. Further, that Dr Theophanous should take immediate action to stop fraud investigations by the Department in relation to Mr Albon's activities. I pointed out to Mr Albon that what he was suggesting was grossly improper and was effectively a demand that Dr Theophanous break the law ... Mr Albon then said that I had not quite understood what he was saying and that he (Mr Albon) was prepared to say anything to the court that he had to, including perjuring himself. Specifically, Mr Albon said, ""1 will give whatever evidence it takes to the Court to ensure that your brother is convicted of offences and that he loses his Parliamentary seat."" As a result of this intimidatory behaviour towards Theo Theophanous, Mr Albon was subsequently banned from entering the state parliament by the President of the Legislative Council. I believe that the story in yesterday's Sunday Age constitutes one of the major blows which Mr Albon intended to deliver to me for refusing to meet his outrageous demands. As I stated to the newspaper, the whole story was based on confidential documents and confidential interviews between me and the Federal Police, both of which were stolen from my office and were distorted in such a way as to imply impropriety on my part. I believe that Mr Albon was behind the theft of those documents and tapes and was involved in the sourcing of the newspaper story to the Sunday Age. However, the matter does not end there. I regret to say that I now firmly believe that Mr Albon has not been acting alone, but has been involved in a conspiracy with other people, politically powerful people, designed to defeat me-not via the proper democratic processes but via a campaign based on false allegations and illegal actions. This campaign involves stolen documents and is based on lies and distortions. These actions of Mr Albon and others are under investigation by the state and Federal Police. I have received advice that these matters may give rise to a question of privilege. Section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act refers to 'improper interferences with the free performance by a Member or the Member's duties as a Member'. It seems to me that there are strong indications that actions taken against me have indeed been intended to interfere improperly in the free performance of my duties as a member. In view of the fact that police investigations are continuing, I have not asked that this matter be dealt with as a matter of privilege, but should my suspicions be confirmed, I may raise the matter formally as a matter of privilege at a later date. I now tum to the alleged contradiction raised in the article in the Sunday Age. As I indicated in my personal explanation earlier today, this matter concerns not the substantive issues which have been raised in the original Chinese newspaper article but on the question of a public statement issued by the Chinese human rights organisation, one of a number of statements which were made about this issue, all of which denied the allegations that have been made about me. I should point out that this statement is not the most important document in relation to this matter; what is most important are the statutory declarations signed by each of the members of the executive committee of the organisation which deny any impropriety on my part. The alleged contradiction appears to tum around the fact that there is a document written in my handwriting and with some matters crossed out and changed which can be read to be the same as the published document. Of course I was aware of this document since it had been in my confidential files and was one of those that had been stolen. When asked questions about the document by the Sunday Age, I gave an explanation of the matter to them. Although what was published is not complete or accurate, nevertheless, the gist of that account is in the published article. On Friday evening, 29 November, I spoke with the journalist Paul Robinson and he informed me that he had secured a copy of the tape of the police interview three years ago and that there was an alleged contradiction about what I had said about the statement at the interview and what I had said to him. He refused to confirm that in fact what he had heard was from the stolen tape. I immediately contacted the Federal Police, who have been investigating the Albon matter, and expressed my concern at the fact of the theft of the tapes and their misuse in this way. I also asked for a fresh copy so that I could check what I had said at the time. I received a copy of these tapes at my office today and have checked them. I now want to elaborate on the explanation which I gave to the Sunday Age on this matter. In the article there is reference to the fact that the draft from the Chinese students had been dictated by a female staff member to me when I was very sick at home recovering from throat surgery. Because the investigation was taking place I did not want, and did not have, any direct contacts with the students association at that time. As the paper says, the intermediary in this exercise was a female staff member of mine. The paper also stated that 'Dr Theophanous would not identify the woman'. Following the publication of this article, this staff member has issued a statutory declaration signed before the Victorian police in which an explanation of this matter is provided. In that statement she makes it clear that the text of the draft came from the students association, that they contacted me indirectly through her and that I made only some cosmetic suggestions, which were adopted. Furthermore, she says: ""I was shocked to see in the Sunday Age what appears to be the confidential minute and quotes from the part of the confidential police tapes interviews with Dr Theophanous. The gist of what I take to be alleged by the article is that Dr Theophanous did not refer in his comments to the Police that the above contact had been made to his office through me. If it is confirmed that Dr Theophanous did not mention the contact I had with a member of the Chinese Students Human Rights Organisation to the police, then I believe that he may have not done so, for two reasons. First, in order to protect me from needing to appear as a witness. This is consistent with Dr Theophanous' refusal to identify me in the interview for the article. Secondly, it is clear that the contact was of such an indirect nature, and the charges were so minor, that effectively the statement was the initiative of the Chinese Students and represented their view. I believe that any issues concerning suggested impropriety in relation to Dr Theophanous, implied in the Sunday Age article are addressed by my comments above. In particular I want to emphasise that no pressure was brought to bear on the Chinese Students by Dr Theophanous, that the views expressed in their statement are their own and that our office did not even know whether the suggestions made by Dr Theophanous would be accepted until the statement was released."" (Extension of time granted) Today the Federal Police has delivered to me a copy of the tape. I have reviewed the relevant sections of the tape, and it is clear that at the end of what constituted a four-hour interview with the Federal Police, in which we had dealt with all the issues concerning the allegations, I inadvertently misled the Federal Police on a single point relating to the preparation of the statement. I have today spoken to Mr Terry Allen and Mr Raizen about this matter, referring to the statutory declaration from my female staff member and apologising for any mistake which I may have made. Earlier today I indicated that I would cooperate with the police in any further inquiries into this matter. I am very concerned about the series of events which have led to this whole sorry saga. A whole range of fundamental questions are raised in this matter, including the importance of members of parliament being able to count on the loyalty of their staff and not be subjected to blackmail. There is also the question of the limits to political conflict. I am perfectly relaxed about anyone wishing to of the challenge me through the proper political processes, but the idea of being involved in a conspiracy to destroy someone's reputation through the tactics I have explained is absolutely outrageous and unacceptable in a democratic society. Howard Government Business Transport Air Force: Williamtown",83
232,Mr BOB BALDWIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The great US President Benjamin Franklin once succinctly said, 'Success is one per cent inspiration and 99 per cent perspiration.' I would like to put it another way: success is allowing the individual to progress and providing jobs for young people. Success is presenting local families with a more secure platform. Success for the wider community is encompassing and supporting the Hunter region to become a hub of commercial activity. Success is giving local small businesses a fair go. This requires stickability. Success, in my language, is stickability. 'Stickability' is what I have adopted since my election to this House last March-stickability to try to give the people of the Paterson electorate and, indirectly, the people of the lower Hunter region a federal government which once and for all gets a few runs on the board. It is a term I use regularly during doing the rounds of my local schools, and I can tell you that they are very quick at picking up the phrase. It has a cool sound, and the word sits coolly within their persona. It applies to year 12 students when they give it their all for the high school certificate exams, which have now reached their conclusion. For the rest of the high school students and those in primary education, it presents a platform from which to build. Stickability is what the Howard government is all about in its commitment to regional and rural Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has a vision for regional and rural Australia, and it is a vision that very much differs from that of expatriate Robert Hughes. Hughes claims in today's Telegraph Mirror that the Prime Minister is a 'visionary with eyes in the back of his head'. Perhaps, Robert, you are having trouble in keeping up with John Howard. The vision is clearly there. It is written all over this government. Slowly hut surely, like the fable of the tortoise and the hare, it will be put into place. My vision for the people of Paterson, and indeed the people of the Hunter, is a vision about sustaining and building on existing industries-timber, poultry, beef and dairy, fi sheries, education and manufacturing-and providing them with an existence into the next ones. It is of opening the avenue for high-tech, 21 st century businesses. Most importantly, it is about getting the monkey well and truly off the back of local small businesses and providing an even better environment in which to grow. All in all, it is a vision about jobs. Clearly, nobody ever said it was going to be easyfollowing the calling card the people of regional Australia delivered to the Keating government back in March, where the face of the ALP was all but wiped off the map of regional and rural Australia. It is a vision with many strands. It is a vision for transport. I am proud to be part of a government so determined to rebuild and reform the foundations of our transport in the way of road and rail. Last Thursday, I was proud to be at the launch at A. Goninan and Co., undertaken by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), of the first two of National Rail's $360 million fleet of new locos when they rolled off the line. Goninans will playa huge part in the construction of these 120 locos. This big ticket investment has been acknowledged by the Howard government, which has thrown its weight behind the renaissance to rail with its $2 billion reform package for the Australian rail system, with the sale of Australian National Rail and its interest in the National Rail Corporation. The government will back the NR loco series project at Goninans, where local jobs are fed into the Hunter Valley, where the underframes for the new loco fleet are being fabricated at Hexham-the assembly location remains at Broadmeadow. Most importantly, it feeds to a lot of subcontract small businesses in my electorate. The results will be a more reliable and cost-efficient loco fleet replacing a very ageing fleet, incorporated in a rejuvenation of the nation's railways on the back of private sector investment. When we talk about a vision for roads in my electorate we talk about a big ticket investment, and we need to look no further than the bitumen for the answers. The election of the Howard government saw some logic return to the local road funding system. The Commonwealth is again funding a black spot road program-$148 million over four years, of which the lion's share is targeted for regional roads-illogically bypassed by the former Keating administration. To see this, you only need to look at roads in my electorate such as Nelson Bay Road, Raymond Terrace Road, The Bucketts Way and Dungog Road, which are in line to qualify as one of 400 sites nationwide for funding. We will work together with the councils to apply for black spot funding. But then there is the biggest black spot of them all: the Bulahdelah to Coolongolook stretch. From O'Sullivan's Gap to Coolongolook, incorporating the Wootton bends, there have been 355 accidents, 94 involving heavy vehicles, in the seven years leading up to 1995 and 32 tragic deaths and 85 serious injuries-not a record to be proud of by the former government. Black spots do not come any blacker than that. The price tag is $193 million, with construction for the much vaunted 22 kilometre deviation beginning at any time. This bitumen vision is all about saving lives and improving the transport link along the nation's busiest highway. The impact will be best felt by the people of Patterson. An additional $98 million will also fund the link from Coolongolook to Possums Brush. It is a vision that finally incorporates federal dollars to kick-start the Raymond Terrace bypassthe federal government kicked the tin for an additional $5 million to see the road completed by 1998. I urge the state government and the RTA to keep these projects as a No. 1 priority to make sure that there are no longer any delays that perhaps will cause further deaths of fellow Australians. The vision also carries forward to Williamtown. When British Aerospace was pronounced as the successful tenderer for the Howard government's $1 billion lead-in fighter project, the vote of confidence carried forward to Williamtown RAAF and to the Hunter. My vision for Williamtown is for our region to become the best of the best in aeronautics. I know it is a big ask, but I believe we have the resources and the capabilities to achieve it. British Aerospace are committed to constructing the Hawk 100 trainer aircraft at Williamtown and Williamtown will be the base not only for the main support facility for the entire project but also for other projects. Talks I have held with British Aerospace Australia Group CEO, Robin Southwell, culminated at the drop of a hat with them coming to Paterson last week where his working party were hosted to a civic reception by Mayor John Bartlett of Port Stephens council. British Aerospace are a company that fork out dollars for vision like it was milk money. The way I see it, their loose change is an investment in traineeships and apprenticeships for the people of Paterson and the Hunter. British Aerospace have made an initial commitment, but we want much more. The people of the Hunter are relatively greedy, in a kind way. We want more and more and more. There is the possibility of the cold frame testing for the FIll s, apparently carried out offshore, being brought to the Hunter. There is avionics, something not seen as being based in the area but which can be brought to Williamtown-high technology industry with high technology jobs and, more importantly, high technology training, apprenticeships and traineeships. Also, we could expand the manufacturing and engineering base in military construction. I am sure there are a lot of subcontractors and support industries that will be required to service these new aircraft, and the people up there look forward to being able to work on them. But that is only a small part of Williamtown. Williamtown is now also in the final stages of being considered for the headquarters of Australian theatre of command, if indeed it is to go ahead. But prior to 2 March Williamtown was not even in consideration. It was left off the map by the former government and indeed by the former members of the Hunter. Through the work of the Newcastle Regional Chamber of Commerce, Senator John Tierney and I were able to get it included for consideration in the project. The bottom line is that, if British Aerospace want to play ball in the Hunter, I will do my upmost to ensure that we have united political, industrial and community forces to invite them out on to our playing field. John F. Kennedy once said, 'Victory has a hundred fathers; defeat is an orphan.' Sometimes to achieve that success and to fulfil that vision we all need to look outside the square. Member for Oxley: Right to Free Speech Multiculturalism",85
233,Ms HANSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Ever since I made my maiden speech in this House there has been a vicious, non-stop campaign of abuse and insults against me organised by some sections of the print and electronic media, academic snobs, backroom editors hiding behind their reporters, some loud mouthed taxpayer funded minority groups and of course the Liberal and Labor parties. I have been accused of being a bigot, a racist, a bad wife and mother and an evil person. There are many other hurtful things said about me that I will not bother to repeat, because will only give these cowards-all anonymous, I might add-the opportunity to gloat. Apart from these things, I have been hounded by letters from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and its Race Discrimination Commissioner. They have demanded explanations of statements attributed to me by the media, most statements of which have been distorted and taken out of context. Some talk show hosts have attributed statements to me I have never made and put words in my mouth, even though I have sent them copies of my speeches to set the record straight. Even my staff have been publicly abused in this House, with false accusations that the member concerned would not dare repeat outside this chamber. The national solicitor for the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service Secretariat even wanted to start a challenge to my right to take the oath as a properly elected member of this House. All this has been designed to shut me up. The professional multiculturalists have abused me and tried to intimidate me. That campaign will fail. I would like to make two comments about this campaign to silence me. First, these professional exploiters of taxpayers' money ignored the thousands of people who have made literally thousands of phone calls and sent thousands of letters and faxes to me supporting what I say and what I stand for. These people have come from every imaginable walk of Iife-old Australians, new Australians, indigenous Australians and, yes, many Asian Australians. These ordinary people rarely speak out in public and, when they do speak out, governments ignore them and what they say. I will continue to speak for these ordinary Australians whom all the major parties ignore-good people who deserve to be heard. Second, this campaign has been designed to shut me up-to stop me, as a member of parliament, saying the things I said during the election campaign and which helped me win the seat of Oxley, which has been neglected by every Labor government because they took the people of Oxley for granted, just like they it took the working men and women of Australia for granted. Let me make one thing clear: I am not a racist by any definition of that word. None of my remarks in their proper context could be fairly regarded as racist. I am not opposed to any person or group because of their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. I do not think that anyone is superior or inferior to anyone else because of their origin or background. But I am opposed to, and so are the vast majority of Australians, discrimination in favour as well as against any person or group. I want equal treatment for all Australians. I will say again what I said in my maiden speech: I do not think any Australian is better or worse than any other Australian because of their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. All I ask is that any Australian, regardless of their origin, should give Australia their full and undivided loyalty. I am opposed to the policy of multiculturalism because history and the rest of the world show us that multiculturalism never works. It stops new citizens from giving this country, their new home, their full and undivided loyalty. I am not a racist; I am a realist. A truly multicultural society can never be strong and united. United States President Bill Clinton pointed out when he was in Australia that the world is littered with the bodies of people killed in failed and tragic attempts at multiculturalism. As far as I am concerned, all I am doing is representing fairly the views of the great majority of my constituents. This is part of my responsibility to the people of Oxley. In June 1955 this House gaoled the journalists Fitzpatrick and Browne for their publications concerning a parliamentarian which this House said were a serious breach of its privileges. I would venture to say that the content of those publications in 1955 was far less intimidating of the parliamentarian concerned then than the persistent, wicked and unprincipled campaign waged against me by a vocal, self-interested minority. Let me say this: I am not and I will not be intimidated by this campaign. It is my duty-I repeat, my duty-as a member of this House to speak my mind inside and outside the parliament and to represent the people of Oxley who voted for me. My views are no secret. I have made my views crystal clear to the people of Oxley and the whole of Australia. I am speaking for everyone who is supporting me. Thousands of people have rung - e, spoken to me and rallied to support my vIews. As a citizen, the right of free speech under the law is fundamental to our nation and way of life. As a democratically elected parliamentarian, it is vital. Stopping free speech will lead in the end to a totalitarian society, by dictators, where no-one will have the right to disagree. This is why a lot of Asians are supporting me: because they have left countries ruled by authoritarian governments and have come to Australia to enjoy democracy at its best. This campaign of intimidation is nothing more than an attempt to shut me up. Well, I won't shut up. I will speak out both as a citizen and as a parliamentarian. The worse recent slander against me was by Mr Cousins, the Chief Executive Officer of Optus Vision, who said my remarks were evil and who tried to draw a parallel between Hitler and me. As Mr Cousins announced his resignation soon after he attacked me, I can only wonder at his motives. For someone seeking public and government support for the erection of ugly cables which have been extremely unpopular with many people and many communities, I find it strange that he would use a public forum to attack me and misrepresent my views. I will do my duty to the people of Oxley and the people of Australia without fear or favour. I will not be silenced by intimidation and threats from a small minority. I will not be deterred by the cheap insults made of me by the Malaysian Prime Minister, a man who presides over a country in which Indian and Chinese minorities are systemically discriminated against, where the judiciary fears for its independence and where the democratic process is very fragile. I respect the right of people to disagree with me, and I will not abuse people because they disagree with me. As a parliamentarian doing my duty for the people of Oxley and the people of Australia, not only are these attacks on me; they are attacks on parliament itself, the guardian and protector of our freedom. Instead of attacking me-as a few of my colleagues have done-they should consider the end result of this attempt to silence me, because in time they, as will I, be answerable to the people at the polls. If someone cannot speak freely in this House, where can they speak freely? Leighland Christian School",87
234,Mr MILES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Braddon-Parliamentary ruled Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.15 p.m.)-I rise today to put the record straight in relation to a speech given by Mr Brenton Best MHA in the Tasmanian House of Assembly on the evening of 28 November 1996. At the beginning, let me make some things quite clear. Firstly, I am a strong supporter of both government and nongovernment schools. Parents demand choice of schooling and I believe government should enable that choice to be made where possible within the resources available. Secondly, the commitment of me and my wife, Mrs Miles, to schooling as provided by Leighland Christian School is for the long term. We have both been association members since 1982. Each of our children attended the school for 10 years and, although we have had no children at the school for three years, we have continued in membership of the association. We strongly support the concept of Christian education in its fullest sense and believe that with wise, prudent administration and good management Leighland will continue to be a major provider of education on the north-west coast of Tasmania. Thirdly, Leighland Christian School has my full support, but the management approach that has led to a trend drop in enrolments and a budget deficit in 1995 of $254,195 does not. Fourthly, upholding the right of women to be dealt with fairly and without intimidation is fundamental to our community. Fifthly, the belief that people such as members of parliament should arbitrarily use their power to intervene in legal proceedings should be rejected by any right-minded person. In the speech given by Mr Best, he made many claims, allegations and inferences including that: firstly, Leighland Christian School is being threatened by a financial claim for unfair dismissal by my wife, Mrs Ros Miles; secondly, 'together the Mileses are holding Leighland to ransom'; thirdly, ' Mr Miles had the responsibility of putting a submission to the minister's office but Mr Miles would only state verbally that the application of funding had been denied'; and, fourthly, 'the board members of Leighland school put their trust and faith in Mr Miles but he did not return that trust and faith by proving that he had indeed made the submission to the minister. In fact, doubts in the minds of the board members about whether Mr Miles took any action at all' . These are totally false claims and I reject them completely. This is an attempt by Mr Best to use me and my wife as the scapegoats for the poor personnel and financial management of the school in the last few years and to exonerate the principal of discrimination before the case has been heard. Mr Best is trying to make out, for his own cheap political ends and before the evidence is heard, that the complainant is the powerful and the accused the powerless. Is Mr Best going to put down everyone who claims discrimination by accusing them of demanding a ransom or is he only attacking Ros Miles because she is the wife of one of his political opponents? I will now respond to Mr Best's allegations under the following general headings: Mrs Miles's legal claim against the school; the school's financial difficulties, any bearing of my wife's legal claim on those, and my involvement with the school's financial affairs over the past three years; suggestions of disloyalty; and allegations relating to Mr Bas deHaan. As to the allegation that Leighland Christian School is being threatened by a financial claim for unfair dismissal as stated by Mr Best, there is no unfair dismissal claim. What is pending is a claim by Mrs Miles, the previous vice-principal for five years, of sex discrimination by the school principal, Mr Millard. With respect to a pending hearing for sex discrimination, it is totally inappropriate for an MP to infer that the claim is a ransom demand. The case has been reviewed by the chairman of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Mr Ronald Wilson, a former High Court judge and a former president of the Uniting Church of Australia, and he has ordered that a hearing should be held. Once legal proceedings have begun, it is totally unacceptable that the privilege of parliament be used by Mr Best to place pressure on people to withdraw. If he has any courage, he will repeat in public the speech he gave to the Tasmanian parliament, and I there are serious ask him to do so. This attempt to strongarm a woman from proceeding with a sex discrimination claim indicates Mr Best's lack of concern for women, who are often subjected to insults, put-downs, intimidation, discrimination and injustice in the workplace. As I have supported other north-west coast women who have provided prima facie evidence of discrimination, I will do the same for my wife. She has my full support in using the appropriate mechanisms that she wishes to pursue in order to achieve justice. It is her right to do so as an Australian citizen. No person should be prevented from pursuing justice because they happen to be married to a member of parliament. Mr Best's claim of full employment about my wife is also incorrect. He said: She now works full time and has done so ever since her employment at Leighland was terminated. Since leaving Leighland, Mrs Miles has had fuIl-time employment only since early this year. I now turn to the subject of the school's financial difficulties. Unwisely, Mr Best has relied on some recent newspaper statements, such as the claims by Dr Alfonso Messiah that 40 per cent of the Leighland deficit in 1995 was 'a result of a payout and legal fees for a wrongful dismissal case brought against Leighland by Mrs Miles'. To place on record details of this, I now quote the relevant figures obtained from the audited financial report of Leighland school for the year 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1995. The operating loss was $254,195. Legal expenses for the solicitor were $6,657 and staff compensation was zero. Forty per cent of $254,195 is $101,678, not $6,657. Mr Best has taken the inaccurate newspaper reports without checking his facts-a clear case of not letting the truth stop what at the time seemed a good political story. Mr Best, since you accepted the newspaper reports as the basis of your innuendo and smear campaign, then please explain where the remaining $95,021 went, to whom it was paid and why it was not recorded in the school's financial report, because it was not paid to Mrs Miles as reported and did not go to associated legal costs. With respect to the accusation that as the federal member for Braddon I am holding the school to ransom, I again state that I reject it completely and place on record my involvement in financial matters involving Leighland in the last three years. There are three matters that are pertinent. First is the purchase of a car for the school chaplain wholesale tax free, second is comments made by me at the AGM and subsequent special meetings, and third is a request to forward a school submission for an emergency grant to the federal government on 1 July 1996. In late 1993 the board, along with its chairman, who was also the school chaplain, approved the purchase of a car for the school chaplain wholesale sales tax exempt. The car was used mainly for parish work, not for the school, for a period of approximately four months. In March 1994 I was contacted as the federal member by a member of the public who believed it was not legal and that it amounted to fraud on the Commonwealth. I agreed. On the evening of 21 March 1994 I spoke to the new chairman of the board about the matter and he assured me it had been thoroughly investigated and the arrangements were okay. My deep concern remained and I wrote to the board on 23 March 1994 asking for further clarification as I firmly believed that sales tax exemption had been wrongly claimed and that, if so, the school was defrauding the Commonwealth and this could, if proven, lead to a withdrawal of wholesale sales tax exempt status for the school. Such a situation would have severe financial ramifications for the school. On 26 April I wrote again to the board expressing my concern. On 27 April the board informed me that the transaction should not have been tax exempt and that the honorary chaplain had been advised that sales tax was payable on the vehicle he had purchased. The second financial matter relates to the AGM of the Leighland School Association on 18 March 1996. The meeting was informed that the expected budget surplus, as stated at the AGM in 1995 of $33,691, had become a deficit of $254,195-a turnaround in the negative of $287,886. This massive debt was a deep concern to other members and me at the meeting. At the same time, the budget proposed for 1996 showed an expected deficit of $85,462. On examination of the basis of this figure I asked if the board could guarantee that the deficit at the next AGM 1997 would not be $300,000 or more. Neither the treasurer nor any member of the board, including the chairman, could guarantee the deficit would not reach $300,000. The board was clearly upset at being questioned about the budget and several in the association gave the impression they did not want to know about the financial problems and resented the fact that I had expressed my concern. The treasurer was unable to answer questions and other members of the board who tried could offer few details which made sense. (Time expired) Howard Government: Ministerial Conduct",89
235,Mr LATHAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I grieve for the standards of ministerial conduct in the Howard government. While the government's propaganda seeks to build a facade of an administration comprised of battlers acting for battlers, the reality is very different. Most federal ministers have acquired private wealth and privilege well beyond the aspirations of the average Australian. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has said that anyone who has not done likewise should be labelled a 'public sector bludger'. He is typical of a government more interested in family trusts than family values. The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is just like the rest of them-never known for his attention to high standards of financial probity. As Premier of New South Wales, he is remembered for claiming travel allowance while also having the taxpayer construct a luxury unit for his use in the Sydney CBD. He later sought to rationalise the travel allowance by explaining how it funded his daughter's fees at Sydney's most exclusive private school. Now as the federal Minister for Finance he has made three incorrect declarations on his pecuniary interest return to the parliament and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-first TriCity, then his continuing directorship of Tunboa and, most recently, his family company Lochreagh Investments. The Australian people are entitled to ask: if the Minister for Finance cannot run his own finances, how can he run the $130 billion finances of the Commonwealth? The Lochreagh loans affair is indeed bizarre. Lochreagh was established in May 1978 with John and Colleen Fahey as co-owners and directors. For a number of years it was in active trade, earning management fees, employing Colleen Fahey, each year declaring a substantial amount of assets and liabilities. This contradicts the statement by the Minister for Finance in question time on 21 November that the company has not earned income and has only ever held a property share in a home occupied by his parents. Indeed, it is worth asking: why would anyone ever need a company structure just to facilitate ownership of a one-third share in a residential property occupied by the parents of the property owner? This defies belief, as does the minister's excuse that all is okay because his parents are somehow involved. Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, all is not okay. Lochreagh failed to submit annual returns to the ASC after March 1986, leaving it in direct breach of section 335(1A) of the Corporations Law. Even worse, Lochreagh in February 1985 acquired a one-third share in a property at 19 View Street, Camden, yet when it filed its annual return in March 1986 no mention whatsoever was made of this asset holding. The property was acquired just prior to the commencement date for the introduction of the assets test on age pensions. In 1992 the ASC deregistered Lochreagh for failure to file six annual returns since 1986. Normally the ASC commissioner would then have vested each of the company's assets as per section 576(1) of the Corporations Law. Obviously this could not happen given that Mr and Mrs Fahey had not at any time declared Lochreagh' s ownership share in 19 View Street, Camden. This alone is worthy of investigation by the ASC. Perhaps even more bizarre, the new member for Macarthur, Mr Fahey, lodged his parliamentary pecuniary interest return on 23 May 1996 listing under his shareholdings Lochreagh Investments PL. Under directorships of companies he also listed Lochreagh. It is extraordinary that a full four years after the company's deregistration-IO years after the company's last annual return-the member for Macarthur would list it as a going investment concern both in returns to the parliament and, one assumes, to the Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, given these unorthodox arrangements, the ALP has been keen to find out more about Lochreagh. In the Senate on 7 November Senator Forshaw asked the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) in part: ... can the minister seek advice as to whether, at the time of deregistration, there were any outstanding loans to the directors of Lochreagh, of which Mr Fahey was one? On 19 November Senator Kemp replied as follows: I am informed by the Minister that all relevant documentation in respect of the company has now been lodged with the Australian Securities Commission. The company generates no income. There was a loan to the Directors which is being repaid in a normal manner and the Minister has been advised by his accountant that there are no tax implications. In question time two days later, the Minister for Finance repeated this advice stating that 'there was a loan to myself and my wife and it is being repaid in a normal manner'. He also indicated that 'it is paid for by myself and it is paid for by my sister each single month'. This information now before the parliament raises the following discrepancies and questions. If the directors loan, principal and interest, is being paid back to Lochreagh, how can the company also be described as 'generating no income'? If the directors loan is paid 'each single month', who is receiving the repayment, given that Lochreagh was deregistered by the ASC four years ago? If the company has no income and just a single fixed asset, how could it have issued a loan in the first place? How can the loan be described as 'being repaid in a normal manner' if there is no company to repay it to? If, as is likely, Lochreagh has been engaging in negative gearing for tax purposes on 19 View Street, Camden, on what basis has it lodged tax returns given its deregistered status for the past four years? Also in question time on 21 November the minister refused to answer my question on the size and issue date for the loan. The only reliable guide left to the parliament is the $8,000 unsecured directors loan issued in 1985 by Lochreagh, as recorded in its annual report of that year. It is extraordinary to think that the loan is still outstanding 11 years later. Under section 108 of the tax act, it should have been declared as income and taxed accordingly. Section 108 states in part: If a private company pays an amount to an associated person by way of an advance or loan ... so much (if any) of the amount paid or credited as, in the opinion of the Commission, represents a distribution of profits shall ... be deemed to be a dividend paid by the company. How can someone have a loan for 11 years, not pay it back by 1996, yet also not declare it as income? These matters need to be investigated by the Prime Minister and the Australian Tax Office as soon as possible. Under the terms of Income Tax Ruling No. 2637, the minister has a lot to answer. That ruling states in part: Where the terms and conditions used in the advance or loan are comparable with the commercial terms and conditions ordinarily used in advances or loans bctween parties dealing at arms length, that would, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, support the view that the transaction was not intended to be a ""distribution of profits"". Conversely, a loan granted on interest-free terms and repayable on demand might warrant closer examination. This was particularly so where money is put in the hands or bank account of a shareholder and may be drawn on as and when the shareholder wishes. The Lochreagh loan could hardly have been on commercial terms, given the lengthy period in which the Finance Minister has made no attempt to repay it. If, as is most likely, the loan was on interest free terms and repayable on demand, it should have been declared as income and taxed under section 108. It is also interesting to note a report in the Australian newspaper in April this year. It said: The Australian Tax Office is poised to begin an audit sweep of small and mid-sized private companies, targeting undeclared directors loans ... The ATO suspects many private company directors 'lend' themselves funds at non-commercial rates, without intending to repay the amount to the company. A typical case (according to the Tax Office) involved a company borrowing from an external financier, claiming the borrowings as a tax deduction, and on-lending the money to a director or shareholder in lieu of a salary. In other cases, the proprietors simply treat the company's money as their' )wn. Such arrangements fall foul of the ATO on two accounts. Firstly, the borrowings are not tax deductible if used for other than income-producing purposes. Secondly, the loan should be assessable in the hands of the director/shareholder if the loan is not struck on commercially realistic terms. Given this information, I urge the ATO to audit the activities of Lochreagh as soon as possible. If other small businesses have been faced with the auditing process under section 108, surely the same standard must be applied to the Minister for Finance. Despite his actions and wishes, he is not above the law. The minister needs to answer whether or not he simply pocketed the loan at the time of Lochreagh's deregistration, and since then only ever made an attempt to repay it when Senator Forshaw raised the matter in the Senate. If it is true, as Senator Kemp told the Senate two weeks ago, that all relevant documents have now been lodged with the ASC, then the truth will out. The truth, however, John Fahey style is slow in materialising. As of this morningtwo weeks after Minister Kemp told the Senate that all documents had been lodgedthe ASC still has no record of such lodgement. Hence, the Minister for Finance has caused Senator Kemp to provide misleading information to the Senate. If, as Mr Fahey has told others, he is trying to reinstate Lochreagh as a going concern with the ASC, sections 574(2) and (3) of the Corporations Law make this improbable. As the ASC itself has made no error and an appeal process is not in order, Lochreagh in effect is dead and buried. So too are any claims by the Minister for Finance to sound bookkeeping, administrative efficiency and financial probity. What has the minister got to hide by refusing to give the House a full explanation? Most of all, this sets an appalling standard for ministerial behaviour in the Howard government. The minister has made false pecuniary interest returns not once, not twice, but now three times. The minister has still to correct his return with regard to the true status, assets and liabilities, of Lochreagh. The minister has held a directors loan with no attempt to repay it or pay tax on it. The parliament can now rightly question the integrity and credibility of the Minister for Finance, especially with regard to his handling of the Lochreagh affair and the possibility of tax evasion which now hangs over his head. Talk about battlers having to carry people on their backs: the ordinary Australian taxpayers have had to carry the Minister for Finance on their backs for up to 11 years. I look forward to the minister's response to the serious questions of financial probity raised in this House and in the Senate, plus the minister's explanation to the Australian people as to how he has got away with so many shonky business and tax practices for so long.

236,Unknown,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Sitting suspended from 6.35 p.m. to 8.02 p.m. Trade,94
237,Mr BARRESI,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to convey the thoughts of a number of people from the Deakin electorate. In speaking tonight, I would like to confirm my support of the policies adopted and pursued by the coalition government. Last week's APEC meeting in the Philippines was important for a number of reasons. At the meeting, the leaders of the Asia-Pacific nations vowed to press ahead with efforts to cut trade barriers. Policies that promote the free trade of goods and services around the world are recognised and implemented as the key to economic growth and wealth creation. The nations of the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, have correctly identified the benefits of trade liberalisation and economic globalism. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said last week, 'One of the things that I am certainly going to do as a result of this meeting is to step up the explanation to the Australian public of the benefits of trade liberalisation and globalisation because there are great benefits.' In making this statement, the Prime Minister has recognised the task at hand, as there are still many Australians who do not - hare the Commonwealth's free trade emphasIS. A number of constituents and Deakin based businesses have, in recent days, lamented the decline of Australia's manufacturing industries. Many of these businesses are employing fewer than 50 people. These comments are particularly relevant given the importance of manufacturing to the Victorian and, for that matter, the national economy. Not all hard working Australians have faith in economic jargon. Instead, they see a declining skilled manufacturing work force, the loss over time of Australian manufacturing and, importantly, the difficulties of doing business-surviving day to day, competing on both price and quality against the Asian tiger economies to our north. Their frustrations arise, in many cases, from years of competitive business experience. At the end of the day, they say, 'Why go to all the bother of manufacturing when it is so easy to import?' It has also been suggested to me that it is easier to set up a lean and efficient sales office reliant on fully imported products rather than a fully fledged manufacturing operation. I admire these Australians for their years of perseverance and commitment to our country. They have, over the years, pursued a policy of 'Buy Australian first', 'Loyalty to Australia first' and 'Save and invest in Australia first'. They correctly identify the loss of our economic sovereignty via a huge increase in foreign debt-a debt that now stands at $187 billion. They also correctly identify declining technical and engineering skills as being a major problem. Despite their frustration, many have said, 'We do not want a return to the old ways and ineffective policies.' Almost all agree that high tariff and other trade barriers will not work to Australia's advantage in the 21 st century. The challenge to all Australians is obvious. Our nation is at the economic crossroads. The Prime Minister's reported comments that we will not go it alone, that the days of a unilateral trade policy must be assessed and that reciprocal trade agreements must be given greater importance have been warmly received by industry in my electorate. After all, industry often ask: why has Australia moved so far and so fast? Do we honestly expect that other countries will be drawn to our pace setting standards? The government has taken on the challenge to fix the economic problems before our nation. These difficulties were not of our making but, importantly, we have taken on the responsibility to fix them. The former Labor government did not draw Australians into their confidence. Labor failed Australia. They concentrated on the big picture, forgetting about the impact of government policy on individuals. The challenge for us parliamentarians as we are confronted by those who question trade liberalisation and our involvement in APEC is not to make the same mistake as the former Labor government. Under Prime Minister John Howard, this problem is well recognised. In fact, the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated the need to bring the public into our confidence. I welcome such a declaration. The answers to Australia's trade and debt difficulties are found by focusing on both international and domestic policies. There are many factors that influence the manufacturing sector's ability to be competitive on the world stage. First and foremost is the price of doing business. Direct costs, such as transportation and labour, are as important as the indirect costs of production. Federal and state governments have a large say in determining these costs on local business. The challenge to reduce business costs is there. I am glad to say the government is responding to these challenges. We have responded by addressing employers' concerns through changes to the industrial relations laws-a law which is much needed and warmly anticipated by industry and a law that ensures that international productivity and efficiency levels can be achieved. Employer concerns can also be addressed by slashing business red tape by 50 per cent, resulting in the reduction of compliance cost, a measure introduced last week through the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. Of course, that can also be achieved through taxation reform, which is often demanded by industry. We can also attack the problems that the manufacturing sector faces by having efficient transport and port handling facilities. These facilities are instrumental factors in minimising business on-costs. In this regard, I look forward to our industrial relations reforms being accepted by the Maritime Union. The changes will ensure that the union, together with companies such as Patricks and Conaust, provide more competitive container handling turnover. A recent report on stevedoring performance indicates that Australia has an average container handling rate of 20.1 standard 20-foot containers per hour. At only half the productivity rate of efficient ports in other countries, this figure is well below world's best practice. A vital component of transport costs is the provision of an adequate road system. The latest additions to Melbourne's road systemthe City Link project and the western ring road-will mean cost benefits from improved and efficient road transportation. However, this benefit will not be maximised in the eastern suburbs, unless the proposed Scoresby freeway is constructed. The eastern suburbs are one of Australia's fastest growing regional business centres, containing 46 per cent of Melbourne's commercial and industrial businesses. Local government, along with thousands of companies, look forward to the cooperation of the Commonwealth and the states to ensure the transport corridor is developed. Last but not least is the industry's expectamore. tion of strong government representation against the Goliaths of the world economy. Australia is strongly represented internationalwith ly by the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). The government must continue this approach by aggressively pursuing further trade opportunities and breaking down overseas trade barriers. The United States has recently pursued four countries for unfair trade practices. Australia was one of those. The Howe Leather case has highlighted the need for ensuring equal and full access to overseas markets. Through section 301, the United States has adopted a strategic enforcement strategy aimed not only at challenging existing trade barriers but also at preventing the future adoption of similar barriers around the world. This enforcement has brought about significant and successful results. In addition, Canada and the European Community have also successfully invoked enforcement provisions. In a competitive world, Australia also needs to aggressively promote its interests. Australia's future decisions in trade policy must always have regard for the national interest as distinct from economic theory. The recent decision to review the level of tariffs after the year 2000 was recognition of the work already done by Australia. The government acknowledges the need for policies which provide coherence and stability to enable business to invest with confidence. Australia's manufacturing industries need policies that will help them. As we ponder the sentiment expressed by these Australian businesses, let us also recognise the achievements of those who achieved on their own. A good example is found in the Deakin electorate. Mr Vince Peluso, the Managing Director of Gamut Engineering, has, over 20 years, built up what is now a very successful business. Gamut is a manufacturing business which earns millions of dollars in revenue from overseas sales without any formal assistance from government. It is not surprising that Gamut has won the National Ethnic Small Business Award. Vince is over the moon with his recognition and wants to do In conclusion, the next few years are a crucial time for Australia. We must continue policies that promote free trade and industry development. As a nation, we must continue to act positively and in an assertive fashion against the Goliaths of the world. Industrial Relations",94
238,Mr MCCLELLAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Barton) (8.12 p.m.)I congratulate the former speaker, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Barresi), on his statement calling upon the government to place national interest ahead of economic theory. I think that is, unquestionably, a call which should well and truly be heeded. However, I note with some concern the rather simplistic approach on the part of many government members when analysing industrial relations. In particular, the former speaker spoke of a comparison of Australia's average waterfront operations with ports adopting world's best practice for waterfront operations. The analogy answers the question. It is unfair and quite inappropriate to compare the Australian average with ports adopting world's best practice. Certainly in some ports-for instance, Port Botany-we would ourselves be adopting world's best practice. It is unfair to compare Australia's overall figures for containers handled with the figures for one particular overseas port adopting world's best practice, because many ports throughout Australia lack infrastructure and attention to management practices. What is concerning is that this inappropriate comparison made by government members leads them to condemn Australian workers. For instance, I note that today, in answer to a question without notice, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said that, at 1 January, Australia would be entering a new era and experiencing perhaps the most significant change to the industrial relations framework since the First World War. He indicated in particular that, as at 1 January, the more significant aspects, as he saw them, of the workplace relations bill would come into force. He specifically mentioned two items that I am concerned with-tighter controls of industrial action and the reintroduction of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. I think the government are short-sighted in their approach to industrial relations in that their emphasis is very much on using the sledgehammer or even a Sherman tank when a bit of reasoned debate will suffice, if not achieve better results. It is inevitable in industrial relations that there will be disagreethe ment. Indeed, I would argue that disagreement is essential if industry is to progress. If there were no disagreement, it would mean that there were no changes. If there were no changes, Australia simply would not be in the game of competing with other nations which are progressing all the time. So what causes intense disagreement in the industry is the very fact that those significant changes have taken place and are continuing to take place. There is a lot at stake from the point of view of the employers. Literally millions of dollars are at stake. From the point of view of workers, it is the standard of living of not only themselves as individuals but their families-whether they are able to afford school fees, whether they are able to afford school excursions down to Canberra. My point is that, when there is a lot at stake and when there are complex issues, there is going to be difference and there will, inevitably, be conflict. There is no doubt that the standard of living of the great majority of Australia's wage and salary earners is what it is because of the efforts of a great number of very decent, committed Australians involved in the trade union movement. My grandfather, for instance, was an organiser with the Australian Workers Union between the years of 1912 and 1917. I have his diary of that time, written in very neat copybook handwriting. His diary gives a good account of his efforts in trying to organise union representation in the rural industry of that time. His diary gives an account of workers being paid extremely low wages and then being charged for the rent of their accommodation. Living in such isolated areas, they had no alternative other than to accept the accommodation provided. He gives examples of the farmer charging the rural worker for the rent of a cow to produce milk for himself and his family. He describes innumerable instances of the state of the run-down accommodation for which they were charged very hefty rent, which substantially ate into their weekly salary. I recall him giving a graphic account of a woman holding an umbrella over her baby's cot, which was located in the driest part of house, and speaking of her great concern of the baby becoming ill in the damp conditions of the family's only available accommodation. Those conditions which he recordsalthough coming some little time after the Harvester decision, which was the commencement, I suppose, of the concept of a Ii ving wage-were still only some 70 years ago. It is no doubt that Australian families today on the whole are significantly better off as a result of the efforts of trade unions. In my immediate past working life as an industrial law practitioner I had the honour of appearing for trade unions involved in three of our prime industries: the metal manufacturing industry, the mining industry and the waterfront industry. I was very impressed, almost without exception, with the calibre of not only the industrial representation by the trade unions but also, usually, the representation of the employer interests. While I was involved over the years in many vigorous and bitter disputes, almost always, with the right will, they were resolved cooperatively. They were resolved in the interests of not only the business establishment but the workers. Workers' motivation was kept intact, problems of absenteeism were avoided and workers' productivity dramatically improved. I will give an example. Since the days of the Button plan, productivity in the vehicle building industry has increased from 40 per cent to 45 per cent, and quality has improved hy at least 50 per cent. That has all been done not only with the cooperation of the trade union movement but, in many instances, at the instigation of the trade union movement. I feel, with great regret, that this governwomen ment is turning its back on some really spectacular achievements in Australian productivity improvements in Australia's cooperative industrial relations environment, which has developed particularly during the last 10 years. The government's obsession with speaking of union busting tactics and espousing the virtues of individual contract the expense of collectivism are all consistent with the language of denigrating the tremendous work and successes that have been obtained by the trade union movement. I would hate to see-I regret it will occur, however-the sledgehammer, Sherman tank tactics of this government turn on its head a decade of extremely successful cooperation and be a significant retardation of Australia's overall productivity. I ask only one thing of this minister: that he goes and attends an industrial rally where they are contemplating serious industrial issues. He will see for himself the tremendous role of constructive leadership that trade unions have amongst their members. (Time expired) Coffs Harbour: Flooding",96
239,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in this grievance debate to talk about the situation obtaining in Coffs Harbour following the devastating, disastrous flooding of a week ago. Coffs Harbour received 459 millimetres of rain-that is more than 18 inches in the old measurement-over 48 hours from noon on Friday, 22 November. This was a quarter of the average annual rainfall in 48 hours. The wind started at 11 a.m. on Saturday, with a speed of 56 kilometres per hour, and by 5.30 p.m. had reached maximum gusts of 94 kilometres per hour. The average wind speed was 75 kilometres per hour right through that period. What we have got is a situation of absolute devastation. I must say that I was delighted and very pleased indeed that my friend and colleague the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) was able to visit Coffs Harbour last Tuesday afternoon to see for himself some of the devastation and meet some of the people whose lives have been absolutely disrupted by this. I have never seen so many men and crying, because the storm water-I use the word 'stormwater' very carefully-had gone through the whole of the town centre. It had absolutely destroyed it. The state government has declared it a natural disaster area. Sadly, we lost one life. Mrs Kathleen Amanda was swept away. The council's library has sustained hundreds at of thousands of dollars worth of damage. The historical museum, run by volunteers, is ruined. Some bridge approaches have been washed right out. The Coffs Village Caravan Park has been devastated. I was around in the flooded areas on the Saturday night. At 10.30 on that night, I saw furniture floating down Moonee Street. Houses were washed off their foundations and vehicles were swept away. It has had a major impact on the city centre of Coffs Harbour. Not just the city centre has been affected. The residential areas also have a problem, which, I am afraid, means that I will have to be quite serious in my reproach of some insurance companies. We have this fiddly definition of what is a flood, as opposed to what is storm water. Some of the insurance companies are saying that this was a flood and that therefore the people are not covered. What the hell do you take out insurance for, if it is not to be covered? They are saying that this was a flood. What I would like to do-and I must say that the Insurance Council of Australia has been very fair about this-is quote this definition of 'flood' which it has provided me: Flood means the inundation of normally dry land by water escaping or released from the normal confines of any natural watercourse or lake, whether or not altered or modified, or any reservoir, channel, canal, or dam. What we had was not water escaping or released from natural watercourses; we had the whole of the hillsides awash with water, all of it pouring down. The insurance companies are trying to escape their responsibilities by saying that this was a flood. The water did not come out of the creek and go into the people's houses and shops; it came from the hillsides down to them. Very definitely, as far as I am concerned, this was stormwater. I have to place on record my absolute disgust with GIO for refusing claims. I do not have time to go through all the names of the affected people. The GIO insurance company is not doing the right thing. I also have two letters from the NRMA knocking back damage claims. The area where they are knocking them back is above the 100 years flood zone. I do not think it is right, but we will have to pursue this further. As well as having the Deputy Prime Minister visit the electorate, I am delighted that tomorrow morning I and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) are flying to Coffs Harbour so that he can see for himself some of the damage and talk with representatives of the Banana Growers Federation. Banana growers throughout the area from Moonee in the north to the Bellinger River in the south have been very severely affected by the storm. Areas at Sapphire, Korora, Bruxner Park, Coffs Valley, North Boambee, Middle Boambee and South Boambee are affected. While mentioning South Boambee, I am aware that my friend Paul Khun Khun has lost an area of bananas from the top of his plantation right down to the bottom. Two acres have literally disappeared. Two acres may not seem much to people involved in broadacre farming, but these are small family farms. These are areas where you might have a farm of 12 acres or less. If you lose two acres of that and it washes away altogether, it makes it very difficult indeed. Paul and most others have roads that are impassable or washed away completely. They have fruit to harvest, but they cannot harvest it because the roads and bridges are washed away. There is a desperate need for assistance. One of the things that I really must make clear is that the estimates of loss prepared by Mr Greg Ireland, who is the district horticulturalist and who has done a marvellous job, show that the losses of banana land due to slippage in roadways, farms, dams, houses, packing sheds and equipment will exceed $15 million. This is all from small family farms. The actual loss of bananas due to the direct blowdown of banana plants is about $3 million. It does not seem much, I suppose, by some people's standards, but by the standards of small banana plantations it is a massive loss. For many growers, what is needed is a oneoff grant from the government to enable them to repair the roadways, clean out and rebuild the dams and repair and rebuild their packing sheds. Without this, the growers will be unable to access their properties. They will not be able to harvest the fruit, which will further add to their losses and greatly reduce their income, because we are now in the peak harvest period. There was also damage in the Nambucca district to banana, fruit, vegetable, nursery and flower growers. They need assistance too. It is absolutely important that this government does everything in its power to enable growers to access their policies so that they can earn an income to further make repairs to the properties. I must say that this would be far more beneficial and realistic than growers having to take out further loans. I know that loans are available, but you have to pay them back. They do not have the money. What has happened is that the production is there but they cannot harvest. If they cannot harvest, they cannot sell their product. So they are going to go further down the drain. This has been a disaster of unprecedented size in terms of the area.",98

In this particular case, as I understand it, the amendments in question affect eligibility for certain benefits. The effect of the amendments is that expenditure under a standing appropriation would be greater than it would be if the amendments were not made. Nevertheless, it appears that if the amendments are made the expenditure will not be any greater than it would have been under the existing law for which appropriations have been made-that is, the burden on the people would not be any greater than it is under the status quo; it is just that the sum of the 'savings' originally proposed in the bill will be reduced. I think it is reasonable for the House to take the view that these particular Senate alterations can indeed be made as amendments and do not need to take the form of requests. This view is consistent with the view taken by members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its major report on these provisions, which was presented in November 1995. This point may also be relevant to some Senate amendments to other bills, including the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996, which has been listed as the next item of business. Unless other factors are involved, I would not propose to comment on each such instance. For the information of members, I present a copy of the notes prepared by the Clerk of the House on the recent report of the Senate's Procedure Committee on these matters. The notes also, where relevant, comment on conclusions of the House's committee on the constitutional provisions. Ordered that the requested amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendment(I) Schedule I, item 2, page 3 (after line 23), at the end of subsection (6AA), add: ; or (c) holds or was the former holder of a subclass 826 visa-Interdependency; or (d) holds or was the former holder of a subclass 832 visa-Close ties; or (e) holds or was the former holder of a subclass 833 visa--certain unlawful or (f) holds or was the former holder of a visa that is in a class of visas determined Minister for the purposes of this paragraph.",100
245,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the requested amendment be made. This request implements an amendment instigated by the government. It follows the government's decision to accept recommendations, made by both the majority and minority reports of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee when it considered the bill, that innocent illegals should be exempt from the operation of the bill and that subclass 826 visa holders-that is, the interdependent relationship-should be treated in the same way as subclass 820 visa holders-that is, the extended eligibility spouse category. The underlying rationale for the recommendations was that, by the time a person in either of these categories received their permanent visa, they would have been in Australia for at least two years and so it would be unfair to make them wait a further two years before certain social security payments might be payable. If a person has a qualifying resident's exemption for certain social security payments, the person will not be subject to a newly arrived resident's waiting period. The request amends the proposed subsection 7(6AA) which sets out those categories of persons who have a qualifying resident's exemption for those payments by adding those visa classes that deal with innocent illegals-namely, subclasses 832 and 833 visas, as well as subclass 826 visa. Provision is also made to allow the minister to add other visa classes in the future. It is implicit from what I said earlier that the government, having instigated these amendments, supports the request.",101
246,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The opposition, of course, supports this requested amendment. It is a matter which ought to have been part of the legislation when first drafted but was subject to special comment in both the majority and minority reports of the Senate committee which considered this citizens; legislation-and I am pleased that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has taken the initiative by the and ensured that the government moved these amendments. We have no objections to the course that has been proceeded with. It seems somewhat unusual that this particular amendment will be addressed before a larger debate in relation to the amendments which have been the subject of some recent controversy. But I understand that that is in accordance with the necessary parliamentary practices so that matters which do come forward in this way and which are non-controversial can be dealt with so that the Senate can complete the third reading of the bill. Might I use this occasion, however, to say that the opposition is particularly disturbed at some of the language that has been used in the public debate in relation to the discussion in the Senate. There is no doubt that the language has been such as to fuel the fires of intolerance that are too readily community. And some of the extraordinarily misleading statements in relation to the impact of these changes, which the Senate has discussed, and the very misleading costing figures which have been so widely and publicly contended for by Senator Newman as Minister for Social Security and then adopted, contrary to his own initial statements, by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), I think, deserve the most profound condemnation. What we are dealing with in this area are measures that have been put forward by the government, following their election, which went in part to meet pre-electionMr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not wish to be unreasonable about this, but the debate is generating matters that will be the subject of a separate debate on these issues tomorrow. I am not prepared to allow the matters to go without being contested. I would just simply encourage the member to constrain himself to the matters that are being discussed, knowing there is a debate to come. I will not take the matter further. If he wants to have a debate now on these broader issues, I am happy to have it because I am not prepared to let the issues go without contest.",101
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The Minister has made his point. I ask the honourable member for Denison to stay within the meaning of the requested amendment.,102
248,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I certainly do not intend to unleash the barrage that will come forward tomorrow when we address these matters in somewhat more detail. Let me content myself by at least concluding with respect to these financial matters that the reason these matters come forward from the Senate in this form is because they were thought-and I think perhaps correctly thought-to be such as to require them to be done by the form of a request in that they would increase parliamentary appropriations, whereas the other matters, as the Speaker has addressed himself to earlier this evening, are matters which simply do not extend any additional impost to the Australian community, as the Speaker has indicated, but rather are such as to reduce set afire in this proposed savings. Might I say in relation to that matter of proposed savings-and I just address this briefly-that Senator Newman today was forced to admit that the savings that are forgone by reason of the Senate changes are nowhere near the $400 million that were claimed by her and the Treasurer. What we have found in relation to those matters is that, in fact, the actual savings are in the order of $200 million, the figure contended for by the opposition when we made the statements on that day and subsequently. The government has simply doubled the-(Extension of time granted) I think I am entitled to speak as many times as I wish. Mr Ruddock-On a point of order: the issue in relation to the total expenditure is a matter that should be raised in the debate dealing with substantive issues. In relation to the matters that we are considering, the amounts involved are so infinitesimal that they do not bear any relationship to the matters that the shadow minister is trying to raise. As I made the point earlier, if we are going to have a substantive debate on these issues, we will have it now. I am quite happy to do that, but I am not prepared to allow it to be a one-sided debate.",102
249,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The minister makes his point. I ask the honourable member for Denison to speak to the amendment that is before the House.,102
250,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am simply making the point that these matters are matters which come back here because, at least at a theoretical level, they do increase government expenditures-albeit, as the minister says, by a very small amount. They are proposals put forward by the government itself, but there has been a most disgraceful misrepresentation of the overall savings that are said to be effected by these measures. These are matters of public record. It is important, now this matter now comes forward in an environment where we are being asked to increase expenditure in relation to these matters, by reason of amendments moved and supported by the government, to make the obvious point that, contrary to statements made quite implausibly but irresponsibly and in a climate of engendering hatred and fear of those who come to this community to make it their home, the savings that are actually being reduced by the government have been reduced in the order of $50 million per annum-not the sum that has been contested in public for some days now by the minister and the Treasurer. I regard the whole way in which this government have dealt with these matters as completely and grossly irresponsible. The manner in which they have expressed themselves is much more in keeping with the rhetoric and language of people such as Pauline Hanson. The fact that government ministers are stooping so irresponsibly, distorting facts and acting in such a contemptible manner ought to be addressed at the first opportunity that this House has.",102
251,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The shadow minister took latitudes that perhaps one might have expected, but I was of the view that it was better to deal with these issues in the context of the wider debate that will be had tomorrow. In relation to the specific questions that he has raised, let me make it abundantly clear that the sort of rhetoric that we have heard from the opposition on this issue suggests that they are more inclined, in the context of some of this ugly debate that we have had recently, to want to argue that the government ought to be put off our mark in pressing for reasonable reforms. They want to suggest that in some ways these matters are discriminatory. The fact of the matter is that the measures that we have proposed are in no way discriminatory in terms of race, country of origin, ethnic background or religion of the people that are involved. The issues are essentially matters that were the subject of very clear commitment. I know the nature of the commitments that were made because I was the shadow minister who had to articulate the government's approach on this matter before the last election. It was clear that we had proposals that would deal with access to benefits. The measures would exclude people who were refugees or humanitarian entrants and also those who were the subject of changed circumstances after arrival. There was no ambiguity about that matter in the public mind and there ought not to be any ambiguity about those matters in the minds of the opposition. But they seem to be of the view that they can tell us what our policies were and then reconstruct them, and that is quite beyond an approach that is acceptable to the government. As far as the government is concerned, we will press these other issues tomorrow. But to suggest that there are not substantive questions involved in the costings of these matters when the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, in another place, spelled out in detail the way in which the co stings were developed, also, I think, suggests on the shadow minister's part that he does not understand the totality of the issues involved. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendment(1) Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 27), at the end of the Schedule, add: 4 Continued application of Act (1) If, before 1 May 1996: (a) an agreement for the construction, or purchase, of a ship was made by a shipowner; and (b) the shipowner was an Australian national; then, despite the amendment of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 made by item 3, that Act, as in force immediately before the commencement of item 3, continues to apply to the shipowner in respect of that ship. (2) In this item: Australian citizen has the same meaning as in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. Australian national means: (a) an Australian citizen; or (b) a body corporate established by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory.",103
252,Mr SHARP,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill fulfils the government's election commitment to repeal the International Shipping (Australianresident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995 with effect from 1 July 1996 and amends the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 to bring forward the existing sunset provision from 30 June 1997 to 30 June 1996. The amendment to the bill restores the entitlement to a grant under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 to those Australian shipowners which already had ships on order when the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill was introduced into parliament on 1 May 1996. This entitlement is subject to the ships concerned meeting the eligibility criteria of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act and being commissioned and registered in Australia before I July 1997. The existing sunset proVISIOn in the act would have terminated access to the scheme on 30 June next year anyway. In proposing this amendment, the government recognised the concerns raised in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee over the effect of the legislation on the three ships under construction and scheduled to be commissioned before 30 June 1997. I commend the amendment to the House.",104
253,Mr TANNER,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"It is pleasing to see that the government has seen reason on one aspect of the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill, namely, the aspect which effectively would have had a retrospective impact with respect to three rather large vessels that were in the process of construction, and which the companies having those ships constructed were relying on the amounts of money provided under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act. However, the net effect of the legislation now still is that the grant is being prematurely removed. The capacity for other potential claimants to lodge claims is still being removed. Of course, the government naturally is not proceeding to renew the legislation for a further five years, as had previously occurred in 1992. It is also important to recognise that the legislation still abolishes the PA YE tax rebate for international seafarers, which was an important part of the former government's initiatives in 1994 to improve the competitiveness of the Australian maritime industry and, in particular, to place it on an equal footing with its major competitors. Shipping throughout the world is subsidised and protected by host nations in a variety of ways. Twelve OECD nations have an equivalent of our PAYE scheme where tax is rebated for international seafarers. There is a wide range of fiscal supports provided to ship owners in order to assist the indigenous shipping industries of many countries. It is simply ridiculous to suggest that Australia and the Australian maritime industry can compete internationally without such supports. Fiscal support is necessary in this country in order to maintain some form of level playing field for those other countries. Effectively, the government's position is that it does not want an Australian shipping industry, largely because of its long standing detestation of the Maritime Union of Australia. It is therefore withdrawing these relatively modest but important fiscal supports that the previous government put in place. The net effect of these initiatives and some of the other things that the government is proposing to do-for example, the repeal of the accelerated depreciation provision that is provided for ships-will be that the relative competitiveness of flag of convenience ships and other OECD competitors, as against Australian shipping, will be increased. The existing gap which exists will increase significantly. Also, there will be less incentive for domestic ships to be put on international routes and therefore earn export income for Australia. Our current account deficit will worsen for shipping. Of course, it is important to note-it is something that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will be aware of-that there has been raised in other debates, such as the woodchipping debate, the issue of reduction of current account deficits relating to particular categories of product, and I refer specifically to timber based products. For some reason-it escapes me-nobody in Australia ever debates our shipping deficit. We export very little and we import a huge amount of shipping services. In spite of the fact that Australia is, weight shipped over distance, the fifth largest shipping market in the world, we are almost a total net importer of shipping services. These proposals will also damage our defence preparedness and threaten our marine environment because of the greater use of ships of shame and flag of convenience ships by traders because of the increased cost that will inevitably flow for Australian vessels. It means that the significant improvements that have been made through the reform programs of the previous Labor government will now come to a halt. In spite of the rhetoric of the current government, the clear results, the clear outcomes, and the improvements are there for all to see as a result of those former reform efforts. Average crew sizes have been reduced from 31 to 18. Over $2 billion has been invested by Australian shippers since 1989. There have been 1,000 voluntary retirements and over 1,500 seamen retrained since 1987. The average vessel age in Australia is now 9.6 years, whereas the world average is 16.6 years. There has been major improvement. There still is need for further improvement in our maritime industry. By cooperation, by fiscal support to make us competitive relative to the other fiscal supporting nations and by a strategic approach there is some prospect that this will occur. The current government's attitude is simply the attitude of users of the industry who see transport as nothing other than costs on their business, who have no interest in Australia's shipping industry, no interest in our capacity to export shipping services and no interest in replacing our current enormous import bill in shipping services. Our Australian shipping industry will be substantially disadvantaged and ultimately decimated as a result of this legislation and other government actions.",104
254,Mr HOLLIS,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"One should be thankful for small mercies, or small victories, and it is a small mercy indeed that the three vessels that were under construction will still get their grant. But this is only one aspect of the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill, and the government was forced into this amendment screaming and kicking. The other by issues remain. In short, it means that this government will continue on its path of decimating Australian shipping. The PAYE tax rebate scheme remains abolished. This is nothing more than spite on behalf of the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), who has always displayed a pathological hatred of the maritime industry in Australia, especially of the maritime unions. The government will do everything they can to destroy the Australian shipping industry. They want to open the Australian coast to the rust buckets of the world. They want to put our coastal environment at risk-and they are putting it at risk. What they are doing is nothing short of reintroducing slavery to Australia. One hundred years ago we got rid of the shameless slavery when we stopped the trade of Kanakas coming into the sugar industry in Queensland. That was a stain on Australia and that was Australia's involvement in slavery. This government and this minister want to reintroduce slavery into Australia through the Australian shipping industry. They are going to open the coast of Australia to rust buckets of the world. They are going to have Third World crews paid Third World wages. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about Third World crews being paid Third World wages-seafarers from Burma being paid Burmese wages and trading along just to satisfy the government's mates in the rural industries of Australia. It is a great disgrace that we should be doing that. If it is good enough to bring Third World crews into the Australian shipping industry and to pay them Third World wages, when are we going to introduce Third World crews onto Qantas and have them rattling down the aisle with drink trolleys and being paid Third World wages? If it is good enough for the shipping industry, it is good enough for the airline industry. When are we going to have the Australian railways run with Third World crews being paid Third World wages? That is what we are talking about. I do not see how you can isolate the shipping industry and say, 'The shipping industry is different. It is all right for the shipping industry to bring the rust buckets of the world to Australia, to take these ships through our most pristine tourist environment-the Great Barrier Reef-to have them trundling up and down there in a disgraceful condition with untrained crews paid Third World wages.' That is what we are talking about. If Australia is going to have any voice in the international maritime councils of the world, such as the IMO, we have to have a shipping industry. God only knows that we carry little enough of our trade in our own flagged and crewed ships-less than four per cent. But this crowd opposite do not even want that. They want it open slather on the Australian coastline. I cannot believe that the mInIster has actually seen one of those rust buckets. There is one in Port Kembla at this very moment. Because of the rust in that ship, the hull gave way, the front hull was flooded and a maritime worker lost his life. This is what we are opening the Australian coastline up to. That is going to continue, all because of present minister's pathological hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia. He has always displayed that pathological hatred. I do not know why he has this fixation on the Maritime Union of Australia; but he has been determined to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia and, in doing so, because of his pathological hatred, he is going to destroy the Australian shipping industry. Shame on him.",105
255,Mr WILTON,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the sentiments of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who opened his speech by being thankful for small mercies. To that end we must take some consolation whenever the government accepts, or is at least forced to accept by the Senate, amendments to a bill of this nature. Those of us on this side would find it somewhat difficult to treat the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill and the amendments to it with any great deal of enthusiasm. As much as we support the amendment, those on this side fear that it will do little, if anything, to preserve and protect the Australian shipping industry in the face of both massive and disastrous changes being foisted upon it by this government. When the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill first came before the House, I made comments similar to those made by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and the member for Throsby that it was driven by vindictiveness and spite, given the pathological hatred by those opposite of the Maritime Union of Australia-a degree of hatred perhaps unparalleled by any government against a union in recent times. The hatred of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) of this particular union and his rabid dislike of the shipping industry per se are well known through the minister's and the government's inane rantings on these very topics. We are not debating this bill because in any sense of the word the government believes that the bill is a foundation of a policy which will build on the effective reforms already put in place by the former Labor government, reforms by now well established in the restructuring of the shipping industry. Rather, we are debating this bill due to what can be the best described as the indecent haste with which the minister and this government wish to vent their collective spleen on the Maritime Union of Australia, a union that has been participating actively in waterfront reform for a number of years. Of course this bill will no doubt undermine the viability of the Australian shipping industry. As BHP Transport put it in its April 1996 edition of its magazine BHPT Ironships: BHPT does have concerns that the government's stated policies do not necessarily support the attainment of a vibrant Australian shipping try. As an example, its stated intentions to remove the capital grants and the PA YE grants would have a dramatic effect on the ability of the Australiana flagged fleet to compete internationally. The inclusion of fiscal measures such as these is important in ensuring that vessels do indeed share a competitive base similar to those of international vessels against which they compete. As I, other speakers before me and industry in general have already pointed out, this bill will have a wide range of very detrimental effects. Australian crews are highly trained. This legislation will result in the crewing of older, less well maintained vessels by poorer trained, substandard foreign crews. This will result not only in increased potential for environmental disaster but also in increased insurance costs paid by users, given the fact that, as the member for Melbourne has put it, Australia is the fifth largest shipping nation in the world in terms of tonnes shipped per kilometre. Australian ships undertake long voyages, often in very severe conditions, and of course there will be great potential for enhanced environmental damage. It is unfair and perhaps unjust to attack an industry that is making such progress halfway through its restructuring merely to satisfy the government's disdain of the Maritime Union of Australia and, perhaps to a lesser degree, shipping companies. The previous Labor government had a fine record in the development and implementation of a sector-specific industry policy. I know the current government and Minister for Transport and Regional Development could learn much from the example of their predecessors. I accept the amendment to drop the abolition of capital grants but the fact is that this piece of legislation, combined with the abolition of the shipping bounty, is likely to decimate what has become a remarkably successful Australian industry. (Time expired)",106
256,Mr CREAN,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"Hotham) (9.08 p.m.)Together with others on this side of the House who have spoken, I indicate that we are thankful for this amendment but that it goes nowhere near far enough. It recognises the impact of a retrospective application of the decision as was announced-something, quite frankly, that we pointed out in opposition. It indus- was only under pressure from the National Party that we have this reversal today. Indeed, the government even ignored evidence before Senate committee which showed the adverse impact of this decision on the companies involved. This highlights the broader point of where we are going so far as shipping policy in this country is concerned. There has been recognition with this small amendment that the government got the package wrong. We say they have it wrong in many respects. I will give an example of what this amendment involves. It will allow a $12 million adjustment to what the government had previously budgeted for in savings-in other words, $12 million in savings will now not come through-yet companies such as Shell, BHP and Mackay Sugar will benefit from this amendment. They will be able to, through a subsidy, purchase vessels built overseas. In other words, Shell will be able to import ships made in Holland. The government are prepared to make a concession in this amendment that will cost their budget $12 million, but they still resist an amendment that will enable ships built in Australia to be exported overseas-an amendment which would cost the budget $9 million. I hope the perversity of the position they have adopted in this regard will start to sink into the minister. Shipbuilders have carved a niche market in relation to fast moving, wave piercing catamaran vessels, have export orders from all over the world, have started from scratch in an industry that had nothing to do withMr Sharp- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Members on the other side of the House have ranged widely over the nature of the amendment before the House at the moment, but I point out to you that what the honourable member for Hotham is talking about is absolutely and utterly unrelated to this legislation and the amendment. Therefore, I draw your attention to the need to be relevant to the bill before the House rather than refer to ..: bill not before the House.",107
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"Mr Truss)Certainly the debate needs to be related to the amendment, but it occurred to me that the honourable member for Hotham was dealing with the amendment. I will monitor closely what he has to say, but it seems to me that his statements are in order.",108
258,Mr CREAN,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for that very wise ruling. We can see why the minister is rattled by this: we have been able to convince him of the merit of changing the original decision, but he has to change the original decisions with respect to other changes they have made to the shipbuilding industry. It is perverse to have a situation where they are prepared to support by way of subsidies companies buying vessels from overseas but not support Australian companies producing here vessels which we export overseas. That is the point I am trying to makeMr Sharp-It is irrelevant to the bill.",108
259,Mr CREAN,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"It is totally relevant to the matter before this House. The amendment before this House is an admission by the government that they got it wrong in relation to shipping policy and is an example of us taking the opportunity to demonstrate to them that they have it wrong in a number of different areas and the way they should change the situation. Not proceeding with the shipping bounty will result in 100 more jobs going from the Tasmanian economy, as was demonstrated the other day by Bob Clifford of Incat Tasmania. This is from a government that set up an unemployment committee to review the impact on jobs of all budget decisions. We have here a classic case of jobs disappearing as a result of the government's abolition of the shipping bounty, yet they will not even reconsider this matter in the unemployment committee. They should, and they should come back to the House with an amendment. (Time expired)  p.m.)-The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is sitting on the front bench with a pleasant smile on his face. We need to examine why he has developed this myopic hatred of seafarers and Australian shipping. I had better tell, out of school, this little tale about the minister. I think it is as simple as thisMr Martin Ferguson-Out of King's School?  school. The minister did a trip across the Tasman and came back a different person. I do not know what was promised to him or happened to him on that trip, but maritime matters do occur from time to time and, subsequent to that trip, he developed this attitude of animosity towards the Australian flagship industry and all matters Australian maritime. The minister knows as well as I do that the view he expresses now is not well founded. Other countries have a wide range of measures to assist their shipbuilding industry. I want to get into Hansard the benefits that are provided by the Cypriot government to ships that register in their country. I will quote from a speech made by John Lyras, the chairman of the Australia European Shipowners Association, in Europe last year. That speech summarises our attitude, why we argue the way do. This is in contrast with this myopic animosity of the minister. Mr Lyras said: Shipping provides a wealth of business in the domestic market and a wealth of highly trained professionals for onshore employment. In particular, it is estimated that, in addition to some 120,000 EU seafarers and 23,000 non EU nationals employed directly, over a million people are employed ashore in maritime related activities. Therefore, shipping is rightfully characterised as a ""real job creator"". He goes on: In light of the above, I would like to take the opportunity to repeat that shipping is particularly important to the economic welfare of the European union, both in underpinning the security of the Community's trading capability and the sizeable contribution made to invisible earnings in many Community countries. There is the contrast with nations much older than us, the largest market in the world, with varying kinds of shipping performance and certainly not the opportunities we have as one nation under one flag. Cyprus is now the seventh largest flag register in the world. Cyprus attracts shipping to its flag because of the onshore professional employment generated in the financial sector, the administration sector and all the other activities, not because of the seafarers to whom the minister broke a promise, it seems to me-whatever that experience that he had. All of those other activities are so valuable to a country like Australia and to another little island nation, a tiny nation like Cyprus. They do not have any tax on profits from the operation of a Cypriot registered vessel or on dividends received from a shipowning company. There is no capital gains tax on",108
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"Order! I would remind the honourable member for Shortland that he needs to deal with the subject matter of the amendment before the House, and a general discourse on shipping is more appropriate for a speech at the second reading stage.  er, with the wide tolerance and understanding that you have, and given that this bill is about the withdrawal of measures that benefit shipping, what I am doing is contrasting the action of this government with what is available in other countries. I thought it was wholly relevant. I am just contrasting the actions of this government and the actions of other countries with which we compete. Their ships come into our ports, carry our cargoes and we incur an enormous cost. It cost this country $2.9 billion in shipping related invisibles in 1994-95. I am drawing that comparison. I would have thought in those circumstances it is utterly relevant.",109
261,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"You need to be dealing with the matter before the House, which is the amendment.  views already expressed by the shadow minister and in doing that draw the comparison between what that amendment contains and, in the case of Cyprus, no estate duty on the inheritance of shares in a shipowning company. Something that is absolutely relevant to this amendment is that Cyprus has no income tax on the emoluments of officers and crew. There is no stamp duty on ship mortgage deeds or other security documents. They have competitive ship registration costs and annual tonnage taxes, full protection for financiers and mortgagees, excellent telecommunications, highly qualified managerial, clerical and technical staff available, and a favourable tax regime for ship management and other offshore enterprises. The issue for this country is: do we want those jobs ashore in this nation? That is what the amendment is about. (Time expired)",109
262,Mr MCCLELLAND,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"Barton) (9.18 p.m.)This amendment is to have an effect in respect of three ships that are already in construction. After the original bill was passed it was found that it discriminated against three ships that were already on order-one by BHP, one by Shell and one by Mackay Sugar. The government has seen fit in respect of those three vessels under construction to repeal its legislative measures. However, it has left in place a regime which discriminates against the entire shipping industry because it puts on a vastly more difficult playing field the shipping industry that our industry has to face. Effectively, it is government by vacuum. It is the 'no action' plan-no action other than to attack workers engaged in the industry. That is the rationale used by the government for these legislative measures. Essentially, the government claims that the industry has been less than diligent in introducing reforms. The record is certainly against that. Australian ships have reduced their crews from 33 in 1983 to about 18 today-about a 45 per cent reduction in crew levels. There is now a fully integrated career structure and classification structure on these ships. There is little, if any, demarcation, other than perhaps at the very sophisticated marine engineer level. Australian seafarers have all undergone internationally recognised training, and crew levels are unquestionably as good as, if not better than, other OECD countries. For instance, between 1989 and 1996, to pick one example, BHP's ship crew costs were reduced from $2.78 million to $1.85 million to assist in making that industry viable. It is of fundamental importance, not only to these three ships in question but to our industry as a whole and indeed our nation as a whole, that we retain a viable and competitive shipping industry. It is an outrage to learn with these measures less than four per centthat percentage is probably declining-of Australian produce will be carried by vessels under the Australian flag. The consequence for Australia of companies registered in other nations, realising that our industry is being crippled, is potentially devastating. They will have us by the proverbials so that they can squeeze us at any time with higher prices because we have nothing to fight back with. We will not have our own industry. They are replacing, as has been indicated earlier in the debate, a modem and increasingly sophisticated fleet with ships of shame, which were the subject of a report by one of the committees of this parliament late last year. Because of our uniquely federal status, our shipowners face payroll tax, which is a tax implemented by state governments. Other countries do not face those taxes. Hence, when we are competing against them, it made sense to the industry, to the unions and indeed to the government to adjust our industry so it could compete with other shipping industries of other nations. Unfortunately, government by vacuum will not work. It is not being pursued by other countries. We are going to be left right out of the action. It is a real tragedy for this tremenhave dous island state of ours to lose our supply lines, as will occur from the long-term consequences of this legislation.",109
263,Mr HOLLIS,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"The government has seen fit to change its mind on one aspect of the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill-a fairly narrow aspect, the payment as it applies to three ships. One would have thought the government would have gone much further in looking at the whole industry in Australia but, as has been said before, you cannot expect them to do that because of the pathological hatred that is being displayed towards the maritime industry, especially the Maritime Union. I am delighted, if it is true, that it was the power of the National Party in their caucus room that brought this change about. Maybe the Minister for Transport and Regional that Development (Mr Sharp) should take more note of his National Party colleagues. The National Party has suddenly gone up in my estimation. As this bill applies and as this narrow amendment applies to the payment of three ships that were already under construction, I want to put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, and the House, as I have on many other occasions, that I do not know why with modem technology we cannot have a shipbuilding industry in Australia. Two years ago I was in Denmark and I looked at the shipbuilding industry there. They have a wage cost higher than Australia and they have a very successful shipbuilding industry there, so I do not see why we cannot have one here. I am particularly disappointed that the minister-maybe he needs to do more work with his National Party colleagues-is going to pursue with abolishing the PA YE scheme. Australian maritime crews are highly trained. They are highly trained because they are dealing with very valuable cargo and, as other people have said, crewing levels have been significantly reduced. There has been multi skilling. I remember when I first started talking about shipping when I came into this parliament. At that time ships had crews of 40 and everyone was doing their narrow job. We now multi skilling and crew sizes have been significantly reduced. They are now, on average, about 18, and that is very important. Yet the minister will not see fit to retain this system that we have which has made us competitive with the rest of the world. I make no apology for the wages paid to Australian crews. If you have highly trained crews, you do not need massive numbers. What we are going to find, though, is that the Australian coast is going to be opened up, as others have said and I have said many times, to the rust buckets of the world. What we are going to have sailing around the Australian coast-from Melbourne to Kembla, to Newcastle, to Brisbane, to Mackay, to Cairns-are rust buckets with crews from Third World countries. I have no argument at all with crews from the Third World provided they are working under Australian conditions and paid Australian wages, but we are not going to have that. We are going to have Third World crews paid Third World wages. That is what we are going to have. We are reintroducing slavery to Australia, which was abolished 100 years ago when we stopped bringing Kanakas into this country.",110
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,Mr Truss)Order! I remind the honourable member that he needs to address his remarks to the subject of the amendment that is before the House.,111
265,Mr HOLLIS,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"It is the subject of the amendment. We are talking about the change of mind by the minister and the government on the payment of the three ships that were under construction. We are saying that there should be many more ships under construction, crewed by Australians who are paid Australian wages and working under Australian conditions.  p.m.)-These amendments that have come back from the Senate are to the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996. It is interesting to track the role of National Party ministers for shipping and National Party ministers for transport. To put everything in perspective, is fascinating to go back to 1969. The then leader of the then Country Party, Sir John MCEwen, told the then chair of the Australia Europe shipping conference that the priority for Australia was simply to get our goods to market as cheaply as possible. That is all there was to it. That approach utterly discarded any value adding that comes from transport, from shipping-the whole approach, be it the actual carriage of the product or of those other services and opportunities that I mentioned earlier in the financial, administrative and insurance sector, the spin-off the operation of sea freight services. That was followed later by another National Party minister for transport. He was the member for Gippsland. He had this utterly confrontationist approach towards the maritime unions and towards the shipping industry generally. Beating up on wharfies is easy. Beating up on seafarers is cheap. It is cheap thrills back in the sticks",111
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING GRANTS LEGISLATION,"Mr Truss)Order! I hope the honourable member is soon going to demonstrate the relevance of his remarks to the amendment.  er, absolutely. That approach goes to the role of shipping. That approach was utterly destructive and extremely costly to shippers. He was followed by another National Party Minister for Transport, the member for Gwydir. He started the first positive approach towards developing a policy that would create opportunities for more efficient, more competitive Australian flag shipping. Out of that, I, as the initial minister, brought forward the shipping grants legislation, the very essence of that which we are talking about here in this amendment. That was brought forward as a tripartite package from the unions, the industry and the government. That system was brought into encourage a greater presence of Australian shipping in world shipping fleets. It is absolutely relevant. That is what it is about. We now see another National Party Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) harking back to the 1970s when the it member for Gippsland was the Minister for Transport-a confrontationalist approach to Australian shipping that is utterly destructive to shippers and utterly destructive of the industry. If we go to the other matters related to this-the bounties related to the Australian shipbuilding industry-it was the National Party Minister for Transport who discarded the then Australian shipbuilding industry. On all 4 and 5 November in Fremantle was held a highly successful exhibition, the Ausmarine exhibition. That was a wonderful exhibition from of Australian shipbuilding and ship related services. No member of the government attended that. The minister responsible for the shipbuilding industry did not see fit to appear at the exhibition or to have a representative there. There is an industry related to this. The cash grants from the shipping grants legislation is part of the picture. The other part of is the bounty. There are two things in the objective: one is to grow the fleet and the other is to grow the construction and export of high speed wave-piercing catamaran ferries and container carrying vessels. They all come together. I think it is an absolute disgrace to this nation that at that very important conference to which people came from Norway, Sweden, Germany-major suppliers of components to that industryMr Tanner-And Asia.  one member of government appeared. We went over. The conference was opened by the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). I played a role in it. We did not have VIPs; we did not have all the resources available to government. But we got there because that industry is so important. Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, you and I are from regional Australia. We want these industries. The minister comes from a landlocked region. He has the great inland port of Junee. It is a terrific job that he has got. He could not care less. But you and I need it and North Queensland, Western Australia and Kembla need it. This legislation was about growing the Australian shipping industry and manufacturing industry. Having explained that, I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you can now see the wisdom of bringing all these matters together. I am trying to put it in perspective. I am asking this National Party Minister for Transport and Regional Development to have another look and to recognise the value of this legislation. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Accounts Committee",111
267,Mr SOMLYA Y,COMMITTEES,On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I present the following report: Report 347-Annual report 1995-96. Ordered that the report be printed.,112
268,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report it has been prepared as a means of reporting to the parliament on the activities and performance of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts during 1995-96. The report covers work done by the current JCPA, which was appointed on 29 May 1996 at the commencement of the 38th Parliament, and the work done by the JCPA which operated during the 37th Parliament, under the chairmanship of Mr Les Scott. The period July 1995 to January 1996 was extremely busy for the former JCPA: inquiries were undertaken and reports prepared on accrual accounting, cash management, the administration of specific purpose payments, whole of government reporting and fiscal reporting legislation. In addition, the JCPA examined the reports presented by the Commonwealth Auditor General in the financial years 1993-94 and 1994-95, monitored the work of the tax law improvement project, commenced a review of legislation to replace the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and held hearings on the draft taxpayers' charter prepared by the Australian Taxation Office. In the period since its reappointment the JCPA has presented a report on its review of audit reports presented in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 financial years, prepared a report on the new income tax assessment legislation and commenced a review of the audit reports presented in 1995-96. In my view, the committee's reports have made constructive contributions to a range of significant matters in public administration. In particular, the committee's work has resulted in renewed efforts to introduce commercial accounting principles and practices throughout the Commonwealth public sector, the preparation of whole of government accrual based financial reports and agreement by the government to reform the Commonwealth's Report budgetary and fiscal reporting systems. In addition, reports from the JCPA have led to many less visible changes in accounting policies and procedures both within individual agencies which have been the subject of JCPA inquiry and across the Public Service. These are significant achievements, and I would like to thank my colleagues, past and present, and the secretariat staff for their contributions to the work of the committee. I commend the report to the House. NA Cognate bills: BANKRUPTCY (ESTATE CHARGES) BILL 1996 BANKRUPTCY (REGISTRATION CHARGES) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 November, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time.",112
269,Mr MAREK,BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL,"Capricornia) (9.37 p.m.)These changes to the Bankruptcy Act 1996 have been a long time coming for Australian business. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) on having the initiative and the foresight to introduce these bankruptcy bills in an effort to make bankruptcy legislation in this country fairer and more equitable for all. I have heard the statements from the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I find his statements quite laughable and absurd, particularly in relation to Mr Skase. I must remind the member for Banks that the whole Skase issue transpired under the previous Labor government, of which he was a member. This government cannot be held responsible for Labor's poor handling of the Skase saga, although we will work to achieve the best result for those Australians who missed out so badly. I was going to explain the new bill in great detail, but my colleagues, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and the most honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), have stolen my thunder in fine style. Therefore, I see fit to talk to the chamber from the point of view of a small businessman. Small business is still doing it tough. People are only just holding their heads above water. People are sweating on the coalition government putting its policies into force as soon as possible because many of these people are very close to bankruptcy. I hold the obstructive parties and the Independents in the Senate clearly accountable for the problems that this country is continuing to experience. They are blocking reforms de1996 signed to remove the burden of taxation and bureaucratic red tape from small business. The town of Rockhampton is the business, commercial and educational centre of my electorate of Capricornia. It is made up of a considerable number of small businesses that are still hurting from the recession. On top of 'the recession that we had to have', one of the worse droughts in history has seriously affected the rural sector in the whole region. Because of the drought, the people on the land have not had the disposable income to buy local goods and services as they normally would. Most of them are still working in the same clothes they wore some years ago. Unfortunately, unlike those in the rural sector, small business people do not get any financial help from the government to assist them through these tough times. People in the rural sector have received millions of dollars in drought exceptional circumstances payments over the past few years, and justifiably so. Yet the small business people who rely on the spending power of the rural sector have received absolutely nothing-not even tax relief. It is not surprising to see so many of them facing bankruptcy. Added to this scenario is a high ratio of unemployed people. They also do not have the money to spend on anything but essential commodities. None of this is helping small business people who are also trying to compete with the giants of industry on an uneven playing field. The small business community needs the same support already provided to the rural community from all levels of government. Both communities are the backbone of this nation and should be given equal opportunity and support to survive and grow. If they are not, we will have neither a farming sector nor a small business sector-both will be bankrupt. Now that this coalition government's policies have created an environment where interest rates are the lowest we have seen in 20 years, we need to put confidence into the community, so that people will loosen their pockets and spend locally on Australian products and services. However, business practices implemented by the former Labor government continue to stifle small business. I call on the Senate to allow the passage of these most necessary legislative changes to assist small businesses to get back on track and operate with the least amount of government intervention. Small businesses should then be left to make the profits which will give them the ability to grow, expand and increase their staffing levels as they see fit. Those who own a business should have the right to run their business as they see fit-it is their business and no one else's. I urge the Senate to become part of the solution rather than ing to be part of the problem. As a former small business operator, I believe that, before coming into this most significant place-the parliament of Australia-it is important to have had first-hand experience in small or big business. I am proud to say I had my own small business-a panel beating and spray painting shop-which I operated successfully for nine years before selling it to run for office. I know what it like to be in an economic climate that forces you back against the wall. I thank God that I kept focused on where I wanted my small business to go. I made it, but with no help from the former Labor government. My business success was not aided by the former Labor government, particularly during the perilous, antiquated and repressive days of Keating government. That Keating government gave us 'the recession we had to have'. I could have throttled Keating when he made that cop-out statement a couple of years ago, especially as businesses were looking to government for leadership of this country. We were all crying out for some sort of relief from high interest rates, taxation burdens, masses of red tape and the like. I might sound as if I am pretty upset about what the government has been doing to small business from that time until now-I say 'until now' because this business-oriented government is being held to ransom by the Senate. Maybe Keating got it right when he referred to the Senate as nothing but 'unrepresentative swill'-now I can see what he was the restrictive alluding to. I would love to know how many opposition members have had the gut-wrenching feeling of wondering where their next buck was going to come from to the point of thinking, 'If I write out that cheque, will the funds be in from the last job I just completed for that insurance company or customer in time to cover that cheque?' or, 'If I borrow more money from the bank on an overdraft, will the interest rates jump again? As a little fish in a big sea, will they jump so high that I will never be able to pay the moneys required to cover that debt? Will I once again be included in the bankruptcy statistics that have become continu- an icon of the Labor government?' I hope the Labor Party is proud of its history, because I would be embarrassed if I were you. Further, I hope you are listening because I tell you right here and now that small business had no confidence under your government. All we employers had were dayto-day decisions or maybe, as I like to call it, the businessman's casino, to the point where is it was a question of: which gamble will I take today? I would say not. I question the Labor Party members on their personal experience in small business. Therefore, I say that no previous statements from Labor Party members hold any water and should be treated with the contempt their remarks deserve. They have the always had the welfare state mentality, where everyone is on social security benefits and there are no small businesses operating throughout the country and people are members of the bureaucracy club. Then they can control the country. We can see what happens when you apply this type of philosophy to the country: it drives the country broke. This philosophy is so wrong. The only saviours of this great nation are those in the small business sector-the backbone of this countryand the sooner they get a free run, the better. It is a well-known fact that under the Keating government to get into small business first you had to buy a big pig operation, apply the Labor Party legislation of taxation and business practices to that operation and then watch it reduce to a small business. It should be a pre-requisite before entering parliament as a member of the House of Representatives that you have been to the school of hard knocks. Small business is that school. The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 will create many significant changes. We will see creditors and small business operators benefit from the insolvency system changes. These changes will streamline the way things are done. It will make the operation so much simpler and will reduce the red tape forced on to business operators by the previous Labor government. That is what is wrong with this country. Today the government plays too great a role in the personal operations of the day-today lives of individuals in this country. On behalf of small business, I say to governments of the past, present and future, 'Leave us alone.' We are dying under the old practices of the Labor government, and enough is enough. We want an industrial relations system that removes the square peg in the round hole unfair dismissal law. We want an industrial relations system that provides flexibility and gives me, Mr Joe Worker, the owner of a small business, the right to manage my business in the way I see fit. I do not want some activist being cast onto me from the Commonwealth Employment Service, because to receive assistance I would be compelled to take that individual. We want an economic structure that will provide the financial climate for business operators in Capricornia. We want a structure that focuses on the commercial and industry sectors that will provide a positive direction to produce profitable outcomes. This legislation will improve the way business operates in this country. I thank the Howard-Fischer government for giving business a shining light and a direction that will make business in this great nation more profitable and productive for all. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Clauses 1 to 3 and schedules 1 and 2-by leave-taken together.",113
270,Mr MELHAM,BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 1 to 3: (1) Clause 2, page 1 (line 9) to page 2 (line 12), omit subcIauses (2), (3) and (4). (2) Schedule I, page 4 (line 18) to page 5 (line 11), omit item 13. (3) Schedule 1, page 6 (line 6) to page 11 (line 17), omit item 20. This will facilitate a debate on all of the amendments. I also indicate that the opposition intends to oppose schedule 3 but we will only divide on the one occasion, in relation to these amendments. The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 seeks to make consequential amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966, resulting from the proposed enactment of the related Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996. The amendments that I have moved are all really to do with taking out those provisions that facilitate the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996. I remind members of the House that the purpose of that bill is to allow the imposition of increased charges made under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and that the charges relate to the administration of bankrupt estates by the official trustee and registered trustees. As I said in the second reading debate, the people who are ultimately likely to bear the costs of these increased fees will not be the people who, either through their own financial mismanagement or through circumstances beyond their control, have gone bankrupt; rather, it is creditors-the innocent parties in insolvency cases-who wilJ be left to carry the burden of these increased fees. On 11 November 1996 someone from within the accountancy profession wrote to the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus. Whilst retaining the anonymity of the person who wrote the letter, I think it is worthwhile extracting one or two sentences that encapsulate our opposition and the reason we have moved these amendments. The letter states: ... the increases sought are completely unjustifiable, oppressive and fiscally detrimental to creditors, trustees, bankrupts and debtors. Then he goes on to point out: It is proposed to introduce a flat realisations of 8% to replace the current fee ... The fee is calculated on a sliding scale, basically starting from three per cent. He then goes on to say in relation to the interest charge that, under the proposed amendment, a registered trustee of an estate will be required to pay the amount of interest received from estate bank accounts, less bank fees, to consolidated revenue. He says: These two proposed charges far exceed what can be termed reasonable increases in fees. Further down, he states: Effectively the Bill proposes to ""double-dip"" by abolishing the sliding scale whilst at the same time imposing a substantially higher flat rate charge. He finishes his letter, in effect, by saying: Whilst an increase in realisations charges may be justifiable to an extent, the proposed increase and double-dipping is unjustifiable and in no way addresses the underlying inefficiencies which have necessitated the introduction of the Bill. For those reasons, I move these amendments on behalf of the opposition.",115
271,Mr WILLIAMS,BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) usually makes a very conscientious and well-considered contribution to debate. His contribution to this debate on 21 November, I think, fell far short of the standards he normally sets for himself. The amendments he now proposes go far wider than are necessary to give effect to the concerns that he raises. He speaks against the imposition of the realisations charge and the payment of interest on trustees' trust accounts into consolidated revenue. As these are his concerns, the amendments to give effect to them can be quite limited. In fact, the amendments he is proposing are quite extensive. They are unnecessary and undesirable as they prevent the introduction of reforms to record-keeping by trustees and the inspection and audit of trustees' accounts. They are designed on the one hand to reduce the paperwork burden on trustees and, on the other, to strengthen the Inspector-General's powers to investigate trustees. These powers follow from the transfer of functions from the Federal Court to Insolvency and Trustee charge Service Australia since the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996. The honourable member for Banks considers that greater cost recovery is bad policy as it has an impact upon creditors, whom he describes as the innocent parties in insolvency cases. He apparently considers that the impact should fall upon bankrupts. While it is true that the increase in the charges does have an impact on creditors, they are also the parties who are among the principal beneficiaries of the system. Creditors who benefit from a credible and effective personal insolvency system will thus meet a more appropriate share of the cost of maintaining and administering that system. That cost is related to a wide range of statutory and administrative responsibilities undertaken by Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. The amendments moved, as I have mentioned, relate only to the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill, although their effect is intended to relate to the other legislation. In the course of his address, the member for Banks referred to bankruptcy numbers. It is difficult to see how the amendments he is proposing are going to have any positive effect in relation to the bankruptcy numbers. The member described by the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) as the most honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) in his speech gave a much more accurate picture of bankruptcy numbers. The member for Wide Bay mentioned that when the Labor government came to office there had been about 5,000 bankruptcies between 1982 and 1995. By 1991 to 1992, the number of bankruptcies had risen to 16,000. Since that time, in each financial year, there have been around 14,000 bankruptcies in a year. The fact is, as the member for Wide Bay described, that the number of bankruptcies jumped from 1990 to 1991 and again between 1991 and 1992. Only then did they plateau out at the higher level at the end of 1992. By using the last quarter of 1992 as his reference, the honourable member for Banks distorted the picture that preceded this period, when bankruptcies jumped by far more than they have done since March 1996. The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996 introduces a new form of insolvency process to be known as debt agreements. Under these, low income debtors will be able to attempt to negotiate payment arrangements with their creditors and obtain the protection from debt enforcement action afforded by bankruptcy without the need to go bankrupt. In his speech on the second reading debate, the member for Banks referred to the so called Skase chase. It could not be suggested that that is relevant to the amendments he is now proposing. I will say nothing more than to indicate that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and the honourable member for Capricornia have dealt with his outrageous suggestions. The government opposes the amendments proposed by the opposition. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Melham's) be agreed to. The House divided. [10.02 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr W.E.

However, the transitional provisions as drafted apply only to fees payable under rule 179 on estates administered by registered trustees. They do not extend to fees presently payable by the Official Trustee under rule 181. For consistency of treatment and to safeguard against a possible loss of government revenue in Official Trustee estates, minor amendments to schedule 3 are needed. The proposed amendments will extend the transitional arrangements so that they apply also regarding rule 181 fees payable by the Official Trustee on estates administered by the Official Trustee. Consistent treatment as between fees payable and estates administered by the Official Trustee and those administered by registered trustees is a feature of the package of the bills, and the amendment extends this to the transitional provisions.

274,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,I have a corrigendum to the explanatory memorandum which I wish to table to the bill.,118
275,Mr KERR,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"Some days ago, members of this House and the public would have read of the case of baby Samuel, a child who was unable to come to Australia because of difficulties his parents were experiencing in immigration to this country brought about by the now disallowed regulations before the Senate. Those circumstances, the circumstances in which families would be kept separate, would be repeated many times over if the government were able to succeed in the legislation brought before this parliament. This government has distinguished itself as the first government in this country in living memory to seek to embark on a social engineering program of a kind never contemplated previously by any Australian government, one more fitting totalitarian societies. It does so under the guise of calling for its sovereign right to decide the total level of immigration to Australia. This migration bill is not about total levels of migration. The opposition has made it clear on many occasions that we have no argument with the government about the size of the program it announced for 1996-97. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), in his press release at the time he announced that program, made it plain that the size of the program was about the average size of that of the last four years of the Labor government. This fact also makes a lie of the cries that Labor allowed the program to go out of control. With the exception of a one-off rise in the preferential family category in 1995-96, almost all of the numbers of the components of the migration program for the last five years look similar to those planned by this government for this program year. It is important to note that there was no hint of the coalition's cry about Labor allowing the program to go out of control during the election campaign. In fact, the coalition committed itself specifically to giving priority to family reunion within a program of a similar size to that which we had managed. Given the current sentiments in the community regarding immigration, you have to begin to wonder about the sincerity of some members of the government in calling for a reasoned and rational approach to this debate. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is busily publishing fact sheets and distributing them widely in an effort to counter the myths perpetrated by the less responsible participants in this debate. Yet I am entirely of the view that some members of this government are themselves making a contribution to the stock of misinformation, perpetrating myths for shortterm political gains. One has only to refer to the remarks of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), in which she described new arrivals as 'riding on the backs of battling Australian taxpayers', and the remarks of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs when he described the measures contained in this bill as 'having the purpose of controlling sham marriages'. Both those sets of remarks are code for appealing to the sentiments in the community without regard to fact. As one commentator on the broader racism debate put it quite aptly, 'This is what they would call dog whistling,' meaning that you are providing a coded message pitched at a certain frequency and to a certain audience to which that listener is expected to be tuned but which can be plausibly denied whenever necessary. It is regrettable that any member of this parliament should indulge in such a practice. It is despicable that some members of the government have. However, I am certain that, even within this parliament, there are many members of the government who silently would join with us in rejecting these measures. There may well be some short-term political gain to be had from this, but it will be at the long-term expense of this nation's well-being and, to the extent that it has occurred, it is time for it to stop. Let me make it clear that no-one on this side of the House, no-one in the Labor Party, is prepared to indulge in this kind of reckless political activity. We are not going to be tempted to be distracted from the main game. Nothing is appropriate to persuade us to sacrifice the rights and freedoms of Australians just so we fit in with some passing phase or craze whipped up irresponsibly by people who ought to know better. Labor will not shift its fundamental markers with the wind. One of the changes this bill would have is to aIlow the minister to limit or cap the number of spouse, aged, parent and dependent child visas that can be granted in anyone year. Let there be no mistake that the issue of capping the spouse visa is not one about immigration per se. It is to do with the violation of the right of every red-blooded Australian, whether that Australian has been a citizen for a day or six generations or whether that person is of Chinese, Greek, Vietnamese, Lebanese, African or English descent. If this legislation is passed by the parliament, it will mean that the right of any Australian to choose to marry the love of his or her life will be restricted. The government intends to set a number for spouse visas that can be issued in any year. That will mean that, if you are traveIling or working overseas-it is increasingly common for tens of thousands of Australians to find themselves in such circumstances-and you meet a person whom you decide to marry and return to Australia with that person to start a family, you will have to be lucky and make that decision early in the life of the program when there are still some visas to be granted. Too bad if you meet that person or make that decision later in the year. The answer will be, 'Sorry, no more visas for husbands or wives this year. Apply again. Better luck next year.' It is a fact that at the moment approximately one in six marriages contracted in this country is between an Australian resident in this country and somebody from overseas. There is nothing improper about that. We are some of the most well-traveIled citizens of any country in the world. We allow our citizens to travel. Indeed, we encourage them to do so with reciprocal programs such as the working holiday scheme and a whole range of programs that have been endorsed across political boundaries for many generations. It is not surprising that many Australians do find their partners either whilst they themselves are overseas or whilst their spouse is visiting this country under one of those schemes-as a tourist, as someone on a working holiday program, as somebody working who is here temporarily or as somebody who is here as a student. We have literally hundreds of thousands of people visiting this country every year. I know the tourism industry is looking to increase beyond the miIlion mark-I think it may already be beyond the million mark-the number of overseas visitors to this country. It is seeking to encourage them to arrive. Mr Ruddock-Three million.",119
276,Mr KERR,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"The minister says it is weIl beyond that-three million. So we have three million visitors coming here as tourists. We have some 50,000 who are working holidaymakers. Many tens of thousands are brought over here as students and are spending considerable time here. It is little wonder that many Australians are making marriage choices with people from countries other than their own. This is an increasingly internationalised world. With so many people coming to this country, Australians will be making life choices where they will wish to marry others and take up life opportunities with them. These are not sham marriages. These are genuine marriages contracted by Australians with people with whom they wish to make their life, with whom they wish to live, with whom they wish to bring up families and with whom they wish to form part of the Australian community. It is entirely fraudulent to say that this measure has anything to do with sham marriages. We have supported the measures the government has put forward of tightening the program and pre-checking marriages, and all the issues that have been put forward relating to probationary visas, so that the validity of a marriage of anyone who comes to this country on such a scheme can be tested and, if it fails within the first two years, the partner can be sent home. It is simply the worse kind of political rhetoric to suggest that this measure is in any way connected to a crackdown on sham marriages. It is a measure directed at the right of Australians in their own country to marry a partner of their choice. I have been given a note-I was getting quite passionate at this time; I was just getting into my work-that it would suit the convenience of the House if I sought leave to continue my remarks at a future time. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Delegation to the 96th InterParliamentary Union Conference, Beijing, and bilateral visit to Vietnam, Hong Kong and the Philippines.",120
277,Mr SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 1996 Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Beijing and bilateral visits to Vietnam, the Philippines and Hong Kong from 13 September to 4 October 1996. I wish to acknowledge the contributions made to the success of the visit by my colleagues the Hon. Mr Clyde Holding, the deputy leader of the delegation, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, Senator Kay Denman and Mr David Hawker. The  Keele and Mr Richard Coventry. The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is to be congratulated on the arrangements and the organisation for the 1996 conference. During the conference, I had the opportunity to hold private discussions with Mr Qiao Shi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. During this meeting, I formally invited the chairman to visit Australia as a guest of this parliament. I also delivered a keynote address on China's new role in the region and the world to the economic forum's 1996 China Business Summit. Whilst in Beijing, the delegation met with the Law Committee of the National People's Conference to discuss how the rule of law will operate in Hong Kong from 1 July 1997. Members of the committee were very much aware of the need to ensure that Chinese laws, in particular those relating to foreign investment and joint ventures, were in step with internationally accepted practice and convention. Later, during our visit to Hong Kong, the delegation was briefed by the Legislative Council members on their perspectives of the transfer of the colony to Chinese sovereignty next year and were able to follow up some of the issues raised with the law committee in Beijing. The delegation recognised the decisive role being played by Governor Patten on behalf of the people of Hong Kong in regard to the transfer of sovereignty to China. The programs arranged for the three bilateral visits were extremely demanding and challenging. However, they did allow the delegation the opportunity to meet with a wide range of people at all levels and enabled us to see at first hand a number of Australian sponsored aid projects. Many of our interlocutors reminded the delegation of Australia's contribution to the development in the region and the importance of sustaining this commitment. Finally, I wish to record my appreciation for the excellent programs and general hospitality extended by our hosts and thank the heads of missions and other staff of Australian embassies and consulates in the countries we visited. I commend the report to the House. Motion (by Mr Ruddock)-by leaveproposed: That the House take note of the statement. Debate (on motion by Mr Sinclair) adjourned. NA",121
278,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Steel Industry",121
279,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to draw the House's attention yet again to the situation faced by the steel industry in this country. In doing that, I would like to refer to a paper produced by a federal department under the current government earlier this year. It states: The Australian steel industry has been through a dramatic change since the early eighties when Australia's sole integrated producer, BHP, was considering discontinuing steelmaking at Newcastle. The Federal Government introduced the Steel Plan which ran from 1984 to 1988. It goes on to say that over that period the industry was modernised, production for 1995 was at 8.5 million tonnes and BHP productivity increased by seven per cent in that year. It also points out that productivity has increased from 197 tonnes per employee in 1982 to about 620 tonnes per employee now. That is about a 300 per cent increase in productivity across that 14-year period. One reads in BHP's own publications of record production in various parts of their production capacity on a regular basis. It would have been reasonable, therefore, for BHP employees to have felt confident that they had a very secure future. In 1982-83 they were faced with a challenge by the company to shape up or ship out. Effectively, unless they were able to modernise and become more efficient, they would not stay in the industry. The work force responded superbly, as those figures indicate, and they could have felt reasonably confident. The fact is now that they do not feel confident at all, and one has to ask what is happening. We have an industry which is dominated by one company, and that company has had some complications. It is also a major ore exporter. For the record, Australia exports something like 126 million tonnes of iron ore per year. If that iron ore was converted to steel and exported, we would not have a balance of payment problem but a substantial balance of payment surplus. One area alone could convert and change this country's total international profile, and that area is the changing of iron ore to steel and selling it. Despite that, up to 1995 we have been exporting about three million tonnes and in 1995 that three million tonnes earned $1 V2 billion in export earnings. What is occurring at the moment, in the current review by BHP, is the possible reduction of production by 20 to 35 per cent in an industry that employs four per cent of the manufacturing work force or 20,000 or so people. If any other major industry in Australia were talking about that kind of reduction, it would be seen as a national problem and dealt with at a national level. We are being told by the government that this is simply a matter for BHP, that it is a domestic matter and the government has neither a role nor much of an interest. However, we have seen some light in recent days when-in some discussions a few weeks back with BHP, some of my colleagues, the shadow minister and me-there was an approach from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to link up and perhaps form some bipartisan approach. He had previously denied a request for an inquiry by a parliamentary standing committee of this House which would have been chaired and managed by the government members, but he seemed to be agreeing to some bipartisan approach. However, his colleague Senator John Tierney says that that is not possible. One wonders who is the minister-Senator Tierney or Mr Moore. That is of some interest. More importantly, every week that goes by, things get worse. The undermining of confidence, the undermining of investment and the uncertainty that happens is bad not just for areas like Newcastle but for the whole country. This minister needs to get off his seat and do something. He has made some comments. He has sought bipartisan support, which we have agreed to. It is about time he realised that he has at stake an industry capable of turning around our balance of payments and changing our economy if he has the will and the capacity to mobilise it. This is a major national matter. It is about time the minister responsible dealt with it. American Council of Young Political Leaders",121
280,Mr HARDGRAVE,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I would like to take some time of the House to record the 15th visit of the American Council of Young Political Leaders to this country.' They have been in Australia for most of the past two weeks, travelling firstly to my city of Brisbane, then to Sydney, on to Adelaide and now to Canberra. They have been in this place this evening and will be here again tomorrow when I am sure you, Mr Speaker, will acknowledge them during question time, as they are visiting delegates from a number of state legislatures in the United States. The American Council of Young Political Leaders has had a political exchange relationship with Australia since 1982, when the Australian Political Exchange Council was established by the Fraser government. Each year since then an Australian delegation has visited the United States, with a return visit each year by an American delegation. I was fortunate in 1994 to be a member of the l3th delegation to the United States, visiting Alaska, Ohio, California, New York and Washington. I can certainly vouch for what is definitely a very strong mutual exchange of ideas and views between young potential and in some cases realised politicians in both countries. There have been many notable delegates from all parties in this country which pated in the program to the United States, including the Hon. Peter Costello, the Hon. Alexander Downer, the Hon. John Anderson, Senator the Hon. Amanda Vanstone, the Hon. Michael Ronaldson, Senator Cheryl Kernot, Senator Sue West and myself. I think it is quite right that in the few moments available to me tonight we register a welcome to Stan Barnes, state Senator from Arizona; to Jim Brulte, state Senator-elect from California; to Daniel Fessenden, assembly member, a state representative from New York state; to Leslie Goodman, the Deputy Chief of Staff in Governor Pete Wilson's office in California; and to Ron Thornburgh, the Secretary of State in Kansas. From the Democratic Party I welcome Kate Brown, state representative from Oregon; Kumar Barve, state delegate, a state representative from Maryland; LeeAnn Inadomi, Senior Adviser to the Chief of Staff, US Department of Commerce; Bennet Ratcliff, political consultant from Washington; and Julie Winn, a state representative from Maine. As well I welcome Neil Ivey, who is a program officer with the ACYPL. All honourable members here on both sides would join me in welcoming these fine Americans to our country. I hope honourable members get an opportunity to meet with them as I have on several occasions over the last couple of weeks during their time in Australia. Whilst we had the privilege of a visit of the American President to this country a couple of weeks ago, visits on these sorts of levels will continue and are very important to the strong relationship Australia and the United States enjoy. Euthanasia",122
281,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to complete my comments on the euthanasia debate, which were limited by the time given to debate it in the Main Committeeparticularly unfortunate because so many people have concerns about and interests in it. I had just finished quoting a story of Dr Newell's experience written up in the Mercury and the experience of hope shown to us in the film Shine. Both these were stories of hope. As I said before, hope is a very have participowerful tool in survival. Euthanasia does not allow you to make a mistake. There is no second chance, no going back on the final act. Look at a person like Stephen Hawkins-would he have had his chance to contribute what he has if he had despaired at ever being heard? I agree with David Roy and Charles-Henri Rapin, who state in an article entitled 'Regarding Euthanasia' : Euthanasia, even when motivated by compassion, is not a socially acceptable substitute for the establishment of effective programs of palliative medicine and palliative care. They say it is: . . . essential to distinguish between euthanasia, control of pain and other symptoms and withholding or discontinuing life prolonging treatment. I quote a letter that I received from a constituent at Scamander in my electorate who said: Every person is unique and should be respected. Giving one section of the community power of killing another section of the community is a very dangerous course of action. Modem medicine has the necessary knowledge and available drugs to make life comfortable for most if not all cases. Death by injection might be cheaper, but it adds nothing to human dignity. Many writers quote the Dutch experience and are disturbed by the findings. A constituent from Sorell writes: In this enlightened age, we have done away with capital punishment for hardened criminals, so why should our sick and elderly-often those we love the most-be condemned to death at the whim of others? Yet another says: By supporting Euthanasia we take another step towards disadvantaging the already disadvantaged, the elderly, the disabled, the mentally ill and people with terminal illnesses. The pressure that will be applied to all of these people in the future if we adopt euthanasia, will be great and will come from all those in society who support this horrific bill. It will lead to their lives being terminated before their time. Also where will it stop? Ten years time as populations grow, maybe we will limit people's lives to 75 years and give them a pill? There is a lack of trust that those who make these decisions will do the right thing for the individual. This is where choice is taken-not because of the legislation but because of its implementation. Do you blame them? So much has been taken away over the years in the name of balancing the books, managing the economy. I found it interesting that most of those who supported the Northern Territory bill just wrote and said they supported the bill but very few actually said why. There were one or two, but their stories were very personal and I can understand why they sought help in their particular circumstances. Despite these, I still believe they do have some option within palliative care to make life more comfortable for their dying relatives and friends. We must ensure that there are always sufficient funds for those people to die with dignity and in a caring situation. This debate is important. It is too important to be put into the second chamber. It should be heard across Australia so that everybody is aware of the complexities and the reasoning behind all those who speak for and against the bill. But whoever debates it or wherever or however it is debated, I stand to be counted and my vote will be against euthanasia. It is not a decision I have come to lightly. I have listened to people in Lyons and it is their lives and deaths we are discussing. Legislation for euthanasia should be opposed as both dangerous and unnecessary and we should rigorously promote programs of education in palliative medicine and care not as an alternative but as a right that everyone can have access to. We, the parliamentarians, have to get it right and we must also be able to provide hope for those whose suffering has caused them to search for alternative solutions. Thank you to all those Tasmanians who have written to me and given their points of view both for and against euthanasia. Without their help I may have had to put this in the too-hard basket. They made me consider the issue deeply and come to an answer. Pear Industry",123
282,Mrs STONE,ADJOURNMENT,"In 1991 the Anti-Dumping Authority chose to take the recommendations of the industry and impose anti-dumping measures against canned pears from China. They chose to do that because the market had been flooded by a very cheap product and after their investigations they were quite satisfied that the product's wholesale price was below its value. Some five years later, on 20 November, that five-year period of anti-dumping measures was up. So the pear industry, represented by the Australian Canned Fruits Industry Council, made a new application that those same anti-dumping measures be reimposed for a further five-year period. The pear industry is under great stress at the moment with the possibility of apple and pear fire blight coming in if a quarantine measure protecting it from that disease is removed. So a new five-year measure to protect this industry from any dumped Chinese pears is of enormous importance to it. In May this year, the industry Council submitted their proposal to the Anti-Dumping Authority. Under our anti-dumping authority conditions they had to use a surrogate market because China at the time was designated a planned economy. They chose to look at Germany and Canada. In those anti-dumping authority markets, Chinese tinned or canned pears sell for some $9 per case compared with Australia's wholesale price of $27 to $30-a difference of two-thirds in market value. Australian canned pears quite obviously cannot compete. The Anti-Dumping Authority has chosen not to take the recommendation of the canned fruit council. The authority says that the council has not demonstrated that that product is dumped but says that the product is just very low priced. Therefore, as of 20 November this year canned pears from China may enter Australia at a price that is approximately one-third the wholesale price of the Australian same sized product. That is of enormous concern to the industry. Also of concern to them is the changed market status of China. We now designate it a free enterprise market. That means that if the canned pear product comes into this country, the apple and pear industry has to go off to China and get the data to prove that the product is in fact being sold below its value. Can you imagine a small industry the size of Australia's pear industry being able to get that data from Chinese manufacturers, who are only too aware of the use to which that data will be put? Quite clearly, it is almost beyond their ability. In fact, they say to me that it is well beyond their means to collect that data. As would be the case in many other small agribusiness sectors, it is unreal to expect that they do that. I am putting to our ministers that in the future we reverse the onus of proof when an Australian domestic manufacturer believes dumping is occurring, when product is coming to this country below its value. Instead of that small manufacturer going off to Chile or Brazil, if it is orange juice, or China to try to prove the value of those products in those markets, the exporters from those countries should be required to supply their data-the cost of their labour, the cost of transport, the cost of the various ingredients. The AntiDumping Authority would then review those costs and make a judgment as to whether or not they believe those costs are accurate. That is quite consistent with the world trade order, the GAIT. It is what happens in other countries. I believe that is the fairest way to make sure that our agribusiness continues to thrive in the future and is not made to compete with product from other countries sold well below its value. It is too much to ask one small industry to take up the fight in the way they are presently required to by the Anti-Dumping Authority. Hospitals",124
283,Ms MACKLIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Jagajaga) (10.49 p.m.)Tonight I want to talk about the appalling situation of public hospitals in your state and mine, Mr Speaker, but with particular reference to the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, which is the main public hospital relied on by my constituents in Jagajaga. The shocking state of hospitals in Victoria is no secret. The story has practically become serialised in the Melbourne media. At the Austin and Repatriation Hospital, the situation can be most graphically presented by looking at the increase in the number of patients waiting for admission over the last 12 months. In July 1995 it was 1,502 and by July 1996 it was 2,768-an increase of eighty per cent in just one year. While all these people are waiting, we are about to see the closure of the Austin hospital and a halving of the beds at the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre over the next 10 years. Not surprisingly, the waiting list for orthopaedic patients, many of them older Australians needing hip replacements, for examplepeople who are often immobilised until they can have an operation-has blown out from 494 to 778 over the year to July 1996. To these stark statistics we have to add an absolute avalanche of anecdotal evidence-the experience of local people who have tried to gain admission to the hospital or, worse, who have gained admission and then spent hours or even days on trolleys in casualty. One extreme case that was reported recently was of a teenaged liver transplant patient for whom not even a trolley could be found and who ended up having to lie on the back seat of a car. It used to be the case that people were on waiting lists for beds; now they are on waiting lists for trolleys. The Austin and Repatriation Hospital is more than the local public hospital for the people of Jagajaga. It is the major hospital for the treatment of veterans in Victoria. Their right to first-class medical treatment, guaranteed under the terms of the transfer of the repatriation hospital to the state, has, I am afraid to say, been breached time and time again. The Minister for Veteran's Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), in a reply to concerns expressed by my colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) about the treatment of veterans at the Repatriation Hospital has said: . . . my Department has an arrangement with the ARMC to reduce veteran waiting times in casualty. If the hospital administrators are made aware of a veteran waiting in casualty for an extended period of time, the patient is redirected to a private contracted hospital rather than remaining unadmitted in a casualty ward. But it is not the case that veterans are transferred. They can wait for 15 hours and then be transferred to another public hospital some distance away, This has been the experience of my constituents. Why should it be the case that veterans are transferred? The repatriation hospital is their hospital. Generations of diggers in our area have received first-class treatment at the repatriation hospital and, under the terms of the transfer of the hospital to the state, they have every right to expect that this must continue. In fact, the minister acknowledges this preference in his letter when he says: However, having said that, some veterans prefer to be treated at a public hospital, such as ARMC, and therefore refuse to be transferred to a private contracted hospital. In situations such as these, veterans sometimes encounter longer waiting times in a casualty ward before being formally admitted. In other words, a more accurate way of putting it would be-and this is the experience of my constituents-if you want to be treated at the repatriation hospital you can, but you have to wait. That is not what our veterans deserve. The minister also alludes to the problem of infection control in his letter and claims that it is under control. I have further news for the minister. There have been further outbreaks at the hospital of bacteria that is even more difficult to eradicate than golden staph and, what is particularly chilling, a bacteria that is even more deadly. Now it is a case of prolonged times in hospitals but the patients are actually dying. The infection control specialists are now saying that it is the result of staff cuts and budget cuts. The only way to meet the problems of waiting times and infection control is to address the problems of staff cuts and budget cuts. These must be addressed by this federal government if they are serious about caring for veterans, and they certainly must if they care about my local residents. (Time expired) Leighland Christian School",125
284,Mr MILES,ADJOURNMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (10.54 p.m.)-I would like to continue some comments which I was making in rebuttal to a member of the House of Assembly in Tasmania which were made last Thursday night. Because of the concern about the size of the possible debt, a further meeting of the association was held on 1 April 1996. The treasurer said that the debt for 1996 could be as high as $411,000 but that $100,000 had been pruned off expenditure, leaving a budgeted deficit of $311 ,OOO-an increase of $225,538 in two weeks. After this meeting a number of measures were taken in an attempt to improve the financial situation-one of which was to apply for short-term emergency assistance from the federal government. This brings me to the final matter of financial relevance. In regard to the submission, it was drafted by the Leighland board and on 1 July 1996, I was given a copy and asked to forward it to Dr David Kemp, Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, and provide personal support. The submission was forwarded to Dr Kemp on 15 July. On 2 August a letter signed by me was sent to the board stating that the submission had been forwarded but that I was concerned that it may not meet all criteria needed for funding. I offered to meet with the board to discuss my concerns. That offer was not taken up. I also stated that the final decision about funding was a matter for the minister. On or about 24 September my office received information from the department and minister and informed the school by phone that the grant had not been successful because it failed to meet two of the four criteria for emergency assistance. On 25 September 1996 the principal was informed by DEETY A that the emergency grant could not be made. The minister also stated 'that if the school finds it necessary to meet the award provisions for staff redundancies a further application for funding to meet such specific costs may receive favourable consideration subject to sufficient funds being available under the program'. On 30 September a letter was sent from my office confirming earlier phone advice. Leighland school is now a significant provider of education for many students and where it meets the criteria for funding from the Commonwealth it should be supported. I am a strong supporter of parental choice in schooling and where possible I will give strong support to either government or nongovernment schools that are well managed. When schools have good personnel and financial management and administration is undertaken effectively and efficiently, community support in increased enrolments is usually forthcoming. At present government and non-government schools in the drawing area for Leighland school are proving competitive for parents seeking a school for their children to attend. Leighland's track record for prudent financial management and good people skills has been excellent up until the last few years, as the following audited balances illustrate: 1992, $125,924; 1993, $104,470; 1994, minus $44,231; 1995, minus $254,195. Mr Best, rather than seeking scapegoats and trying to lay the blame on particular political opponents, should acquaint himself first with the facts and then give support to those school administrations that are managing their resources wisely. His unwillingness to do background research is illustrated already and not to run a critical eye over poorly managed school financial records shows an amateurish and unprofessional approach to his work. Why, in this particular case, should parents who choose government education or other non-government schools in the region be expected to pick up the tab for imprudent management at Leighland in the last few years? Leighland's financial difficulties can be legitimately traced to a number of factors: firstly, poor financial and personnel management in recent years; secondly, a lack of quality information for forecasting school enrolments; and, thirdly, an unawareness of the need for gathering strategic information in an increasingly competitive market of providing non-government and government schooling in north-west Tasmania. I am a strong supporter of the parents and children who want the style of education provided at Leighland but I cannot give support to the recent management and administrative practices that gave the school a $254,195 debt in 1995, a current debt in 1996 of approximately $300,000 with $150,000 of 1996 fees still uncollected according to their newsletter of 20 November 1996, page 2. If Mr Best believes these figures are without foundation, inaccurate or misleading, then I request that Mr Best provide me with audited accounts showing otherwise. Regarding allegations of disloyalty, Mr Best states in his speech, ' Mr and Mrs Miles contacted the Devonport school and put pressure on it to discontinue its relationship with Leighland school.' This is a total fabrication on Mr Best's part. He should produce the evidence. (Time expired) Midland Westrail Workshops",126
285,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Four years ago in the run-up to the Western Australian state election, the Liberal and National parties in Western Australia promised that the Midland Westrail railway workshops in my electorate would be enhanced and become the site of a world-class, major engineering facility. As a consequence of that state election, the Liberal and National parties formed a government and shortly after the election closed the Midland Westrail railway workshops in flagrant breach of an express promise. Four years on, the local community, including the shire of Swan and local members of parliament, including myself as the local federal member and Michelle Roberts as a member of the state parliament, are now urging that the site of the former Westrail railway workshops become a university. To achieve this it is necessary that the Commonwealth make available capital development funds for university purposes. The starting point for successful application of funds is that the state government make that site a priority. Recently, Premier Court attended upon the scene of the crime, the Westrail workshops, and released a series of glossy pictures indicative of a university at the Westrail workshop sites. What he refused to do, and he will not do, is say to the people of Western Australia that Commonwealth development funding is a priority for Western Australia. He ranks it well below Kalgoorlie and Rockingham, therefore ensuring that no funds will be made available from the Commonwealth. There will be no university under Richard Court. The people of Midland should give him that message on 14 December. (Time expired)",127

(2) Is there a common word processing system used by the parliamentary departments. (3) What word processing system is used by the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. (4) Is the word processing system used by the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff standard; if not, why not; and when will it be changed. (5) Is the word processing system used by the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff capable of using tables and graphs; if not, when will a new system be implemented.",128
287,Mr SPEAKER,DETAILED INFORMATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are 68 databases in the Parliamentary DataBase Service (PDBS). Notice Papers and Daily Programs are updated once a day during sitting periods. All other databases are updated as new information is made available. (2) Yes. Microsoft Word version 6.0 is the standard word processing system used by all parliamentary departments. (3) Microsoft Word version 6.0 is the standard word processor used throughout the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. The Hansard system, a computer application developed to assist in the production of Proof and Official Hansards and committee transcripts, uses the word processing system WordPerfect for DOS version 5.1. (4) Yes, Microsoft Word and WordPerfect for DOS are standard word processing systems. In 1997, a project to design and develop a new Hansard system is planned. It is expected that a new standard word processing system will form part of the final solution for the new Hansard system. (5) Yes. Both Microsoft Word version 6.0 and WordPerfect for DOS version 5.1 are capable of using tables and graphs. However, STATUS, the software used to store and display PDBS data, is not capable of displaying tables or graphs. ParlInfo, a project to replace the PDBS system, has commenced and, once implemented, will provide functionality which will allow the inclusion and displaying of tables and graphs.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Brisbane Airport Farewell: Vietnam Visit (Question No. 610) Mr Allan Morris asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) How many persons were originally invited to Brisbane Airport to farewell the contingent travelling to Vietnam to commemorate the battIe of Long Tan. (2) What was the cost of preparing and distributing these invitations. (3) Why was the event cancelled. (4) What was the cost of advising persons of the cancellation of the event. (5) What was the total cost of this exercise, including the time expended by departmental staff.",128
288,Mr SCOTT,NOTICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Thirty persons, principally from ex-service organisations, were invited to attend the farewell Brisbane Airport for 13 participants who departed on 11 August 1996 on the Vietnam revisited tour. (2) The invitations were prepared in the department at minimal cost together with the cost of postage. (3) At the time that a decision had to be made on whether the public farewell functions should take place, the Vietnamese Embassy had not yet completed visa processing for the veteran group travelling to Vietnam. It was therefore decided not to proceed with the farewell functions. but to plan a welcome home event. In the event the visas were issued on time and most of the veterans were welcomed on their return to Sydney Airport. (4) People were contacted by telephone and notified that the event would not proceed. Approximately 15 local telephone calls were necessary. Minimal labour costs were involved. (5) Please refer to answers provided to parts (2) and (4) above. NA Korean Airlines Incident: Essendon Airport (Question No. 631) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) Is it a fact that, one evening in 1983 or thereabouts. a Korean Airlines 747 mistook Essendon airport for Tullamarine airport and attempted a landing, resulting in a punctured tyre and damage to a landing light and airport fencing. (2) What air safety incidents have occurred, or been reported. involving air traffic at or over Essendon airport between 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1989. (3) In any of the cases referred to in part (2). have pilots mistaken Essendon airport for Tullamarine airport. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) has advised that it has no record of an occurrence whereby a Korean Airlines B747 at aircraft mistook Essendon Airport for Tullamarine Airport during the period 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1984. Airservices Australia has confirmed that Korean Airlines first commenced operations into Sydney Airport in 1989 and has never operated into Melbourne. (2) During the period 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1989. there were eight serious (ie category one to three) incidents and twenty three accidents. There were also a large number (approximately 2,100) of minor occurrences over the 19 year period. A synopsis of each accident is set out below: (1) 2 March 1971. A Piaggio P.166 aircraft landed with the landing gear in the retracted position. There were no injuries. (2) 22 March 1973. A Piper PA-28-180 aircraft made a hard landing and suffered substantial damage to the landing gear. There were no injuries. (3) 24 November 1973. A Piper PA-32-300 aircraft collided with concrete curbing while taxiing which collapsed the right main landing gear. There were no injuries. (4) 21 May 1974. The left main landing gear of a Cessna 310D aircraft retracted during landing roll. There were no injuries. (5) 1 August 1975. A Piper PA-28-235 aircraft made a heavy landing. There were no injuries. (6) 21 December 1975. The wingtip and propeller of a Cessna 172M aircraft hit the runway while landing. There were no injuries. (7) 15 February 1976. A Beech 58 aircraft was being hand started when it suddenly moved forward and collided with a fence. There were no injuries. (8) 18 September 1976. A Piper PA-24 aircraft landed with the landing gear in the retracted position. There were no injuries. (9) 5 April 1977. A Cessna 172G aircraft, while taxiing in strong winds, tipped onto its right wing and flipped over. There were no injuries. (10) 30 December 1977.

A Cessna 172N aircraft flipped over onto its back while taxiing in strong wind conditions. There were no injuries. (17) 19 December 1980. A Maule M-5-235C aircraft made a hard landing. While taxiing, the left main landing gear collapsed. There were no injuries. (18) 29 September 1982. A Cessna 402 aircraft suffered substantial damage when the left main landing gear collapsed during landing roll. There were no injuries. (19) 22 March 1984. A Beech 35-C33 aircraft landed with the left main landing gear in the retracted position. There were no injuries. (20) 29 May 1986. A Piper PA-23-250 aircraft suffered substantial damage when the landing gear was inadvertently selected up while the aircraft was stationary. There were no injuries. (21) 3 September 1986.

(23) 23 November 1989. A Cessna 172N aircraft, while landing, bounced heavily on the runway and suffered substantial damage to the nosewheel landing gear. There were no injuries. (3) There were ten cases reported where pilots mistook Essendon Airport for Tullamarine Airport. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Foreign Trade (Question No. 648) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: (1) What income from foreign trade is earned by Australia through the operations of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA) through (a) export earnings and (b) income from tourism. (2) Is he able to say what percentage of the New with South Wales economy is represented by income generated by the operations of KSA. (3) How many jobs are directly related to operations at KSA. (4) Would a reduction in the capacity of KSA reduce the figures provided in answer to parts (1), (2) and (3). (5) By how many movements per hour is the operating capacity of KSA reduced during those hours in which the East-West runway is operational. (6) Is it a function of the Sydney Air Traffic Management Task Force to consider the effect on the Australian economy of the long term operating plan for KSA; if not, why not. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The responses to (I) to (3) are based on the Study on the Economic Significance of Sydney Airport undertaken by Dr Paul Hooper of the Institute of Transport Studies, University of Sydney. (I )(a) In 1994-95, Australian exports valued at $6 billion left through Sydney Airport. This is 35% of the value of Australia's airfreight exports. (b) The income generated from tourism through the operations of Sydney Airport was $13 billion in 1995. (2) The operations of Sydney Airport generate 8% of Sydney's total workforce. $3.9 billion is directly generated by Sydney Airport to the NSW economy. This leads to a $7.7 billion flow-on to the airport region and the rest of Sydney. (3) There are 33,500 jobs directly related to operations at Sydney Airport, with a further 33,000 jobs attributed to flow-on from the airport. (4) There will, of course, be a relationship between an airport's capacity and that airport's contribution to the regional and national economy. The nature of that relationship will depend on many factors including the precise nature of the economy at the time. Any estimates of the relationship need, therefore, to be treated with caution. (5) The operational capacity of the Airport is not reduced by operating the East-West runway. The East-West runway is only used during periods when it is capable, either by itself or in combination with other runways, of handling the amount of traffic wanting to use the Airport. If the demand cannot be met when the East-West runway is in operation then other runways are brought into use. (6) No. The Task Force was set up to implement the Government's election commitment to address the noise impacts of Sydney Airport. Its primary objective is therefore to provide relief from aircraft noise for the residents of Sydney. However, against this background, the terms of reference for the long term operating plan do specify that the capacity of the Airport is to be maintained to the maximum practicable extent but the programmed movement rate is not to exceed 80 movements per hour. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: (Question No. 649) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: (1) What was the average delay experienced by aircraft (a) landing at and (b) taking off from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport for each hour of operation between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. for each day of operation from I December 1995 to 9 September 1996. (2) Which instances referred to in part (1) occurred when the East-West runway was operational. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Airservices Australia has advised that it is unable to provide the detailed statistics sought by the Member for Barton. Airservices Australia does not collect aircraft landing and take off delay data, but information on average delays may be available from individual airlines, subject to commercial considerations. Canberra Airport Upgrade (Question No. 821) Mr MCMullan asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 16 October 1996: (I) Did he undertake to have a study of the feasibility of upgrading Canberra Airport to international standard for both passenger and freight operations carried out; if so, (a) when will the study (i) commence and (ii) be completed and (b) will the results of the study be released for public comment. (2) Will the study include an Environmental Impact Statement of proposals and will it consider the possible noise and pollution consequences on areas near the airport and its flight paths. (3) What provision will be made for consultations with residents and others affected by a proposal. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In response to a number of calls over recent years to upgrade Canberra Airport to international status, on 25 September 1996 I announced that I had asked the Federal Airports Corporation to investigate the feasibility of upgrading Canberra Airport to international standard for both passenger and freight operations. The study has already commenced and is expected to be completed by the end of the 1996-97 Delays financial year, the final report of which will be provided to me for public release. The feasibility study will focus on two primary considerations: the additional facilities needed to enable Canberra Airport to operate as an international airport; and, the potential demand for international operations at Canberra Airport, including passenger and freight operations. The study will not include a detailed Environmental Impact Statement or possible noise and pollution consequences on areas near the airport and its flight paths. However, should the study recommend any upgrade of Canberra Airport to international standard, no decision will be taken without consideration of the necessity to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment including potential noise and pollution consequences, as provided for under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Under the provisions of the Impact of Proposals Act, any proposal to significantly upgrade Canberra Airport that warrants an Environmental Impact Assessment, would also include consultation with residents and others affected by the proposal, and among the wider community, as part of that assessment. Unidentified Flying Objects: Reports (Question No. 835) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Science, Industry, and Technology, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) How many reports of unidentified flying objects have been received by the Minister's Department and agencies under the Minister's control in each year since 1994. (2) Are the reports investigated; if so, (a) how and (b) by whom. (3) How many of the reports have not been explained by natural or human activity. Mr MCGauran-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Fiscal Year 1993-1994 1994-1995 1995-1996 (b) Live sheep: Fiscal Year 1993-1994 1994-1995 1995-1996 (1) There have been no reports of unidentified flying objects (UFO) received by the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST) in the years since 1994. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) receives approximately 30 UFO reports per year. (2) Neither CSIRO or any other agency in my portfolio undertakes any investigation of UFO reports. (3) Many of the CSIRO UFO reports received lack sufficient detail upon which to base a definitive scientific investigation; nevertheless, the great majority could be reasonably interpreted as being consistent with observations of natural phenomena or human activity. Meat Products and Live Animals: Exports (Question No. 877) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 29 October 1996: What are the details of export of (a) frozen and chilled meat products, and (b) live animals in (i) 1993-94, (ii) 1994-95 and (iii) 1995-96. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised the honourable member has since qualified his question to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy so that it only relates to sheepmeat and the live sheep trade. The answer is compiled from trade figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. (a) Frozen and chilled mutton and lamb: Quantity Value (tonnes) $A(million) 224,669 506.36 221,603 497.39 198,465 505.83 Quantity Value (head) $A(million) 5,437,092 159.68 5,693,291 184.80 5,871,035 226.66 Sydney West Orbital Link Construction (Question No. 885) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 30 October 1996: (I) What sums were allocated in the (a) 1995-96 and (b) 1996-97 Budgets for the construction of the Sydney West orbital link from Hornsby to Liverpool. (2) What is the construction timetable for the orbital link. (3) When will construction (a) commence and (b) finish on the M5 to Wall grove Road link. (4) What impact has the environmental impact statement process for Sydney West Airport had on the construction timetable referred to in part (3). Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The funding allocated for the Western Sydney Orbital in 1995-96 was $18.788 million and $5.0 million in 1996-97. (2) (3) and (4) Timing of the construction of the Western Sydney Orbital will be decided after determination of the two Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)on the route and the EIS process for the second Sydney airport. Migrant Services: Electoral Division of (Question No. 912)  tion and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: (1) What sums were provided to organisations in 1995-96 (a) in the electoral division of Chifley and (b) outside the electoral division of Chifley but which provide services to residents of Chifley, in respect of (i) grant in aid schemes, (ii) migrant resource programs and (iii) community relations agenda grants schemes. (2) Was funding to the organisations referred to in part (I) reduced in the 1996-97 Budget; if so, by what sum. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I )(a)(i) Total sums provided to organisations in 1995-96 in the electoral division of Chifley for Grant In Aid schemes were $145,242. (I )(a)(ii) There are no Migrant Resource Centres in the electoral division of Chifley. (I )(a)(iii) Total sums provided to organisations in 1995-96 in the electoral division of Chifley for Community Relations Agenda grants were $22,500. (l)(b)(i) It is not possible to measure the level of assistance to residents of the electoral division of Chifley as funded Grant In Aid agencies are not required to collect this data on individual clients. (1)(b)(ii) Residents within the Chifley electoral division are serviced by the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre. Core funding of $240,852 for the period 1 October 1996 to 30 June 1997 was allocated to this centre located within the electoral division of Greenway. (1)(b)(iii) Nil. (2) No, funding was not reduced. However, the Community Relations Agenda grant had expired by the end of the 1995-96 financial year, therefore no funding was provided for this grant in 1996-97. Council for the Order of Australia (Question No. 937) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 November 1996: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 822 (Hansard, 4 November 1996, page 6301), does the Constitution of the Order of Australia provide that the Council for the Order of Australia shall consist of the Chief Justice of Australia, among others. (2) Is he able to say whether the present Chief Justice has indicated to the Governor General that Chifley he did not consider it appropriate for him or any other Justices of the High Court to serve on the Council; if so, when. (3) Have steps been taken to amend the Constitution to exclude Justices from the Council.",130
289,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 1 August 1996 amendments were made to the Constitution of the Order of Australia. These included the removal of the ex-officio appointment of the Chief Justice as a member of the Council. See Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S303 of 16 August 1996. (2) Yes. See my answer to part 2 of question No. 822. Chief Justice Brennan, AC, KBE advised the Governor General of this on 21 April 1995. (3) The Constitution makes no provision in respect of Justices, other than the reference to the Chief Justice of Australia prior to 1 August 1996. As stated at p. 268 of the Report of the Review of Australian Honours and A wards: ""The Chief Justice ....... .indicated to the Governor General that he does not consider it appropriate for him or any other Justices of the Court to serve on the Council."". Foods Imports: Requests (Question No. 940) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 7 November 1996: (1) What requests to allow foods into Australia have been received since March 1983. (2) Which foods (a) have been allowed in, (b) have been refused, and (c) are before him for assessment. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is estimated by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that approximately two thousand requests are currently received per year for access for imported food products. I regret I am not prepared to provide a detailed answer to this question, due to the considerable resources which would be required to gather the relevant information. (2)(a) Accessible records show that since 1983 the following food products of animal and plant Country DenmarkffhaiiandiUSA DenmarkffhailandiUSAlNZ EU South Africa Canada/USA NZ NZ NZ generic generic Japan Denmark Canada USA EU The following requests to import food products Country Argentina Chile Chile Chile Chile origin have been imported following the development of animal and plant quarantine requirements; Animal-brine shrimp eggs, uncanned pigmeat from New Zealand, canned birds nest products, salmonid meat and roe, canned meat products, uncanned meat (guidelines), egg products from New Zealand, uncooked pigmeat from Canada, chicken meat cooked from New Zealand, honey, dairy products, heat processed meat based flavours, condensed and evaporated milk from Thailand, import of pork floss (guidelines), meat derived from cattle, sheep and goats from New Zealand, animal casings, retorted eggs, spray dried egg powder, and foie gras from France.

The Committee has reported to me. The information being sought by the honourable member will be available when the report is released. Australian Food Products Banned in Other Countries (Question No. 942) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 7 November 1996: (I) Which countries are banning food products from Australia on quarantine grounds. (2) What reasons are given for each ban. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Bans on the importation of Australian food products are either indicated in the published quarantine requirements of countries or become known when commercial parties seek access and are denied. The Department does not have the means to accurately determine the number of food products or product/country combinations affected by quarantine bans. The bans are in place because either pest and/or disease impediments are included in published quarantine requirements or pest and and disease risks have not been assessed and specific quarantine conditions set.",134
