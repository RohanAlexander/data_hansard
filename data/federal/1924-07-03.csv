NOTE PRINTING OFFICE. Mr E. RILEY (for Dr MALONEV) asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. What was the actual amount paid to the trustees of the Melbourne Deutseller Turn Verein, Victoria-parade, Fitzroy, for the purchase of the property free of interest? 2. What was the amount of interest .paid owing to delay of completion of purchase? 3. VVhat was the rate of interest paid?",16
26,Dr EARLE PAGE,PROTECTION OP NATIVE WOME N AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The amount paid to the trustees was £5,496 4s. apart from interest. In addition, £3,500 was paid to the mortgagees plus £3 16s., being interest payable to the mortgagees by the trustees at tlic date of acquisition. These amounts total £9,000. 2. and 3. The trustees were paid interest amounting to f303 2s. 5d., being at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum from the date of acquisition to the date of completion of purchase. In addition, interest amounting to £204 5s. was paid to the mortgagees. This was computed in the following manner in accordance with section 49 of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906:Five and a half per cent, (the rate payable under the mortgage) on £3,500 for the first six months after the date of acquisition. That interest, viz., £96 5s., was added to the £3,500, and interest thereon was computed at the rate of 3 per cent, from the date of acquisition until the date the mortgage was paid off.

28,Mr WATSON,RINDERPEST OUTBREA K IN,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it correct as stated that the Government's decision in connection with the claims for economic loss during the late outbreak of rinderpest in Western Australia was omciai? 2. If so, when can the representatives of that State expect his reply to their appeal on behalf of the sufferers?",16
29,Mr BRUCE,RINDERPEST OUTBREA K IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as following low :1. In connection with the rinderpest outbreak the Commonwealth Government underposals took to share with the Western Australian Government the actual administrative exthe penses of controlling the outbreak and also of the actual cost of compensation allowed owners for slaughter of animals. In addiincreases tion, the Commonwealth undertook independently of the State, to compensate owners in officers respect of the destruction of buildings, sideration vehicles, fodder, crops, &c, to the extent of £7,000. The total Commonwealth liability in respect of the foregoing charges amounts to approximately £27,150. The claims for compensation for economic losses have received the careful consideration of the Government, which has now decided that apart from the creation of an undesirable precedent, there is no basis against the Commonwealth, and, in the circumstances, these claims cannot be recognized. 2. Tlic Premier of Western Australia has been advised of the Government's decision, formal advice is now being forwarded to the honourable members who have made representacan tions in the matter. WAR SERVICE HMS. ROAD CONSTRUCTION, PRESTON, VICTORIA. Mr BRENNAN "" asked the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice I.

30,Mr STEWART,RINDERPEST OUTBREA K IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. No. The Acting Commissioner has recently been inquiring into this matter, but it is necessary to obtain information from certain ex-officers of the commission. These inquiries have not yet ibeen completed. 2. Sec answer to 1. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE. Mr D . CAMERON asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice Whether any decision has yet been reached regarding (a) increased pay and improved conditions of service for members of the Permanent Naval and Military Forces; (!>) the extension of the provisions of the Superannuation Act to all members of the Permanent Forces ?",17
31,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,RINDERPEST OUTBREA K IN,"The f o l reply has been supplied by the Minister for Defence:(a) The Government has considered the prolaid before it, and has approved of provision being made on the Estimates to cover additional cost of the recommendations, which it is estimated will approximate £68,000 to per annum.

32,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST OUTBREA K IN,"the Prime M in for such claims ister, upon notice Whether, in view of the prevailing unemployment in Australia (particularly amongst and unskilled workers), and the idea apparently existing in Soutliern Europe that Australia readily absorb unlimited numbers of unskilled workers without capital, he will take steps to acquaint the various Southern European Governments with the true facts of the position, so that neither the interests of Australia shall be prejudiced nor these people themselves misled.?",17
33,Mr BEUCE,RINDERPEST OUTBREA K IN,"I desire to point out that the Government give no encouragement, nor grant any financial assistance whatever to Southern Europeans to come to Australia, and it has already been arranged with the Government of Italy , the country most particularly concerned, that passports for Australia shall only be issued to intending It a l i a n emigrants who have sufficient funds to support themselves, or who have been nominated by relatives or friends in Australia who will look after them ancl find them employment on arrival. SECRETARY TO MR . SPEAKER .",17
34,Mr SPEAKER,RINDERPEST OUTBREA K IN,"Rt. Hon.WA. Watt). 1 - W it h reference to the question asked yesterday by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), respecting the appointment of Mr A . G. Turner as secretary to the Speaker and junior clerk in this department, I desire to say that it has long been felt that the staff of this House is too small for the amount of work demanded of it , and that future efficiency will best be provided for by the appointment of juniors of good education, who will be thoroughly trained in the work of Parliament. The honourable member's question can be divided into three sections. He asked, first, whether the appointment was made by the Public Service Board. The answer is that the appointment, which is on probation, was not made by the Public Service Board, but by t.he Speaker, in accordance with section 9, sub-section 1, paragraph b of the Public Service Act. The second part of the question was whether the necessary examination had been passed by the person appointed. To that the answer is that the person appointed passed the intermediate examination, which is under the control of the Melbourne University, in all of the eight subjects for which he entered. This examination I prescribed as an equivalent examination, in accordance with section 33, sub-section 1, paragraph c of the Public Service Act. The third section of the question was whether the amount of salary stated is in keeping with such a responsible position as that of secretary to the Speaker. The answer to that is, that the officer appointed is a. youth who is not yet eighteen years of age. He is taking the place of the Speaker's former secretary and typist, and he is also performing the duties of a junior clerk. terms of his appointment, at a salary of £100 per annum, provide for yearly in crements of £ 5 0 u n t i l he reaches the salary of £250. This salary is, in the circumstances, considered quite adequate. I have only to add that the re-arrangement in connection with the office staff has so far worked satisfactorily. NA",17
35,Mr BRUCE,DISTRIBUTION OF WOOL,"Yesterday the honourable member for Yarr a (Mr Scullin) drew my attention to the absence of certain papers from the file of correspondence relating to the claim by Bawra and the payment thereon by the Commonwealth Government, which was laid on the table of the Library on the 27th June. I find that the documents referred to consist of enclosures which, by reason of their bulky nature, could not be incorporated in the file, and were therefore filed separately. I have now taken action to have these documents placed with the papers at present on the table of the Library. PAPERS. The following papers were presented:Public Service Act-Regulation s amended. Statutory Rules 1924, Nos. 95, 96. Quarantine Act - Regulations amended. Statutory Rules 1924, No. 85. NA TASMANIA.",18
36,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Bass) [2.52] - I move That, in view of the serious nnancial position of the state of Tasmania, this House is of opinion(a) That the Government should consider the advisability of providing for an annual payment to be made to that state, in accordance with section 96 of the Constitution; (it) That this annual payment should continue for a period of ten years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides; (c) That it should commence at an amount of not less than £200,000, and be reduced by £10,000 annually. I submit this motion not with any pleasure, but because of the serious responsibility that lies upon me and every other representative of Tasmania. For the benefit of those honorThe able members who do not know the history of the previous grants made to that state, I shall briefly recapitulate the events that have led up to the present situation. Section 96 of the Constitution was inserted at the instigation of the late Hon. John Henry, who, at the federal convention, stated the case for Tasmania so effectively as to leave no shadow of doubt among its members that federation would adversely affect the finances PROFITS. of that state. His prediction has been verified. The then Premier of New South Wales, Mr - late r Sir GeorgeReid, admitted that that section made a decided improvement to the Constitution, and ensured that the claim of states like Tasmania woulcl be dealt with in a proper manner. .Honourable members are aware that one provision of the Constitution was that three-fourths of the customs revenue collected by the Commonwealth should be paid over to the states, but that arrangement did not by any means compensate Tasmania for the revenue it was losing, because its import business was chiefly with the mainland. The royal commission which was appointed in 1912 at the instance of the then honourable member for Bass (Mr Jen-sen) reported that on a 3 per cent, basis an amount of £900,000 was due to Tasmania, but statistics may be quoted to prove that that amount was totally inadequate. is estimated that the percentage should have been 5 or 6 per cent., or even higher, but in accordance with the recommendation of the royal commission this Parliament agreed to pay Tasmania £90,000 per annum for ten years. Since the expiry of that arrangement the Commonwealth has made two further payments to the state of £85,000 each. At the present time Tasmania is bearing an intolerable burden of taxation, which is seriously hampering its development. The reasons for its present financial position may be summarized as follows:-(1 ) high taxation; (2) low taxpaying capacity; (3) slow increase of population; and (4) rapid increase cd the publio debt. The heavy expenditure undertaken by the state during the last seven or ten years was designed to attract population, but it has failed to achieve that purpose, and the public debt has increased more rapidly than the population. In 1913 the population was 199,675, and ten years later ithad in creased to only 215,064, or an advance of 7^ per cent, in the decade. The public debt, on the other hand, increased from £11,495,963, or £ 5 8 13s. 4d. per head in 1913, to £23,215,439, or £ 1 0 6 per head, in 1923. In other words, the debt has more than doubled, and its increase per head has been ten times as rapid as the growth of population.",18
37,Mr BRENNAN,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,The Commonwealth debt also has grown a Uttle diiring that period.,19
38,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"I recognize that, Tasmania is bearing its share of the Commonwealth burden, and, indeed, a rather unfair proportion of it , as I shall show later. The principal claim of the Tasmanian people to consideration at the hands of thig Parliament is based upon their low taxpaying capacity. At the request of the Premier of the state (the Hon. Joseph Lyons) a publication was issued by the Government Statistician some months ago, in which he quoted the results of the wealth census in 1915 to show the low index of incoine and taxpaying capacity of the Tasmanian people. that publication has been forwarded to honourable members, I shall not quote the figures in extenso, but they show that the average income in Australia in 1914-15 was £ 4 9 8s. 7d., varying from £50 l is . 2d. in Victoria, which was lOd. higher than that in New South Wales, to- £ 3 6 0s. I d . in Tasmania. Taking 1,000 as the basis, It there was a variation in the index of income from 1,043 in Victoria to 743 in Tasmania. The index numbers of the taxpaying capacity for those two states were 1,088 and 552 respectively. I draw the attention of honourable members to the more up-to-date figures of the federal income tax assessments for the eight years 1914-15 to 1921-22. They show the taxpaying capacity of each of the states by the following index numbers: - Ne w South Wales., 1,051; Victoria, 1,022; Queensland, 979; South Australia, 907; Western Australia, 1,056; and Tasmania, 566. It will be seen that Tasmania's taxpaying capacity is less than 60 per cent, of the average for the six Australian states. If honourable members will peruse the figures for the eight years, they will notice the very slight variation in the index numbers for New South Wales and Victoria, which were practically over the 1,000 during the whole period. There was a marked rise in South Australia, from 642 to 993, the figures for the two years prior to 1923 being 1,138 and 1,095. Western Australia experienced a decline from 1,066 in 1914-15 to 871 in 1921-22, althoueh in the year 1915-16 it reached 1,370. But in Tasmania we started in 1914-15 with an index figure of 577. We touched our highest figure of 693 in 1920-21, and the average for the state was 566. Honourable members can understand what that means to taxpayers in Tasmania. There is not only a low taxpaying capacity, but but also a very small population. That small population is maintaining services that were designed for a much greater number of people than are now in the state. Another factor in the unequal incidence of taxation is the customs and excise revenue. Considering the taxpaying capacity with the customs and excise taxation, we find that for years past our loss has been something like £171,000 a year. That is full y explained in a subsequent pamphlet issued by Mr Giblin in March of this year. That pamphlet also deals with the severity of taxation. As For the purpose of making a proper comparison the Tattersall's taxation is omitted; that is borne mostly by-people in the other states, for nearly . 95 per cent, of the tickets sold are sent to people resident on the mainland. The crude rate of taxation in 1922-23 was: In New South. Wales, 71s. 10d.; in Victoria, 51s. 2d. ; in Queensland, 84s.; in South Australia. 71s.; in Western Australia, 57s. 6d.; and in Tasmania, 49s. 8d. Mr . Giblin divided the crude rate by the index figure of the taxpaying capacity, and multiplied the result by 1,000, which gave the following corrected rates:-Ne w South Wales. 71s. 5 d . ; Victoria, 44s. 2d.; Queensland. 106s. 6d.; South Australia, 66s. I d . ; Western Australia, 66s. 4 d . ; and Tasmania, 84s. 5d. The average for the six states was 65s. l i d . The Tasmanian treasurer recently increased taxation there by no less than 12s. per head, so that today the corrected rate is 105s. 2d., or within ls. 4d. of the Queensland rate, although there is an in finitely lower taxpaying capacity in Tasmania tban m Queensland. Taken over the last eight years-and it is reasonable that we should not take any particular year to ascertain the severity of taxation - w e find that the figures are: For New .South Wales, 68s. 4d.; Victoria, 50s. I d . ; Queensland. 85s. lOd.; South Australia, 78s. 3 d . : Western Australia, 54s. 5 d . ; and for Tasmania, where taxation is highest, S7s. 9d. Heavy taxation like this can only do two things. It must drive people out of the state and prevent others from going there. Melbourne is a very big attraction for the people of Tasmania. That is no new factor, for I read in the Melbourne 'Herald recently that 50 years ago people from Tasmania were migrating to the big centres of population. Serious loss has been caused to Tasmania by its isolation. The effect of strikes has been veiy serious, particularly to the primary producer. Three years ago hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of produce rotted on the wharfs there. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr. Whitsitt) knows more about that than I do. Those products could have been sold in an excellent market had it been possible to ship them away, for the state of New South Wales was suffering from a partial drought and crying out for the goods. There were three shipping and coal strikes in four years. Mr E . RILEY - Every state has been similarly affected.",19
39,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"There has not been a railway strike on the mainland for some 3 ears, and the effect of the shipping and 7 coal strikes upon Tasmania has been disproportionately great. The revenue from pubhc services is much smaller in Tasmania than in the other states. The land revenue is 8s. I d . per head, as against an average of 16s. in the other states. Tasmania has been called the "" Garden of the south."" Unfortunately, we caunot collect taxes from our scenery, which, although it may be an asset from the tourist point of view, does not help our land revenue. In order to attract population we launched the hydro-electric scheme. In that connection I would like to quote what the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) said in Hobart recentlyThe harnessing of your great natural water supplies with the creation of your hydroelectric schemes has stamped Tasmania with the hall mark of courage and vision. It took some "" courage"" aud some "" vision "" to carry that scheme through. The state is finding the burden a very heavy one, and it will be some years before we can put the hydro-electric scheme on a paying basis. We gave the lead in Australia in a work that was much overdue, and I am pleased to hear that the other states are considering the harnessing of their water power, with a view to becoming independent of coal supplies, which are frequently withheld. Contracts for the supply of electric power were let before the works were completed, aud the high cost of materials, the high cost of construction, and the high rates of interest on borrowed money during the war greatly increased the initial cost of the works. Tasmania contributes to public works in all states, but it has not been necessary for the Public Works Committee to visit Tasmania to investigate any proposal made by the Federal Government for expenditure there. That shows that no work involving an expenditure of over £25,000 has been proposed for Tasmania since the committee came into existence in 1913. Tasmania made no bargain when she came into the Federal compact; other states did. Several millions of pounds have been spent in New South Wales at Canberra and more will be spent there in the future, and there has also been the expenditure on the Jervis Bay and other colleges. Tasmania contributed to the sugar bounty for Queensland and handicapped its own f r u it industry by so doing.",20
40,Mr MACKAY,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,It saved its f r u it in dustry.,20
41,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"That is open to question. Our fruit-growers say that it did not help the industry, but we nevertheless stood loyally to the compact. I , as a Tasmanian representative, supported sugar control, and assisted the sugar industry of Queensland, but I believe that the fruit-grower would have received more for his product if sugar had been cheaper.",21
42,Mr WEST,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,Do not belittle the other states.,21
43,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"I am making out a case for Tasmania, not for New South Wales. South Australia has been relieved of the burden involved in the Northern Territory, and the Commonwealth also took over from that state the Quorn-Oodnadatta railway, which was, and still is, incurring an annual loss. Western Australia, whose position is similar to that of Tasmania, has secured a transcontinental railway, ancl, in addition to that, received, for five years, special treatment in regard to Customs revenue. Furthermore, Western Australia was given a grant of £250,000 per annum, the amount to be reduced by £10,000 a year. This year, I believe, the grant amounts to £130,000. Victoria, from the inception of federation, has had the benefit of the seat of Government being situated in Melbourne, and a big expenditure has been made in the state in the establishment of the Elinders naval base. The states of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia have had the benefits of a huge Commonwealth expenditure in connection with the M u r r ay waters scheme. year, when a grant of £85,000 was made by this parliament to Tasmania, the very next measure that came before us was a bill to extend the Murray waters scheme, and the expenditure on that work involved a greater cost per head of the population of Tasmania than the grant which had just been made to it . It is useless to make a grant to Tasmania if , at the same time, that state is required to contribute to national schemes the cost of which only makes its position worse than before. We are now faced with probable expenditure in connection with the unification of railway gauges, a work that cannot benefit it. If the £21,000,000 scheme is proceeded with , Tasmania's contribution will amount to £750,000.",21
44,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,Does the honourable member wish Tasmania to enjoy the benefits of such schemes without sharing the financial responsibility?,21
45,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"How can Tasmania benefit from the unification of the mainland railway gauges, or from the Murray waters scheme? I realise that, if a million people were settled in the valley of the Murrav. the general conditions in my state would eventually improve, but it is of no use to starve Tasmania while these works are in progress. I would not object i to even greater expenditure of, public money on large developmental works than is now devoted to that purpose. My advocacy of the north-south railway is an indication of that. It is said that Tasmania is the only state asking favours of the Commonwealth, but let me point out what some of the other states are trying to obtain.",21
46,Mr GREGORY,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,Wester n Australia requires fair treatment.,21
47,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,No doubt it does; and under the Constitution that state will probably receive it . Queensland wants the Northern Territor y railway taken through a portion of that state.,21
48,Mr GROOM,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,Queenslan d has not asked for that.,21
49,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"But its representatives in parliament have certainly been very insistent upon it . New South Wales and Queensland are desirous of having a standard-gauge railway built from the New South Wales border to Brisbane. I am in favour of a uniform gauge, but I do not think Tasmania Last should be asked to contribute to all such works unless favourable consideration is given to its own requests. Another projected federal work that will not benefit Tasmania is the railway from Port Augusta to Hay, and one could name half a dozen other undertakings that chiefly concern the mainland states. Returning to the terms of the motion, I call the particular attention of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to the fact that Tasmania would prefer a straight out grant of £200,000 to the recent offer of the Government, of the whole field of lotteries' taxation. It may be in keeping with the wish of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) to avoid duplication of taxation, but Tasmania, under his scheme, would then be dependent for about one-fifth of its total revenue on the money received by the taxation of in c vestments in "" Tattersall's,"" and it is too much to ask that state to rely on a source of revenue that may vanish within a short period. Another state may pass legislation to empower lotteries to be conducted with in its borders, and it is quite possible that in that case "" Tattersall's "" would leave Tasmania, whose condition then would be very precarious.' I think I am voicing the opinion of the bulk of the people of my state when I say that a direct grant of £200,000 is preferable to the sum annually derived from ""Tattersall's"" being made part of the grant. The message of the Treasurer to the people of Tasmania, delivered through the state Premier (Mr . Lyons), was: ""Increase your own taxation. Effect economies and put your house in order."" Mr Lyons has adopted that suggestion. Tasmania is now the most heavily taxed state in the Commonwealth. Certain economies have already been effected, and others are being arranged as rapidly as possible, but there are certain services that cannot be furthe r curtailed, since efficiency must not be sacrificed. Without a very prompt reduction of taxation, which the proposed grant would enable Tasmania to bring about, all that the state can see ahead of it is decreasing population and a total prohibition of factories and big business enterprises. It is"" unreasonable to ask Tasmania to carry its present burden of taxation, for industries will not be established there if the taxes are so heavy that business is made unprofitable. I confidently commend the motion to the House, believing that section 96 of the Constitution could justly be applied to the case.",21
50,Mr OKEEFE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Denison) [ 3 . 1 8 ] - I regret that it has been necessary for an honourable member to submit this motion. In view of all the circumstances, which for a considerable time have been well known to the Treasurer, the Government should have taken the responsibility of moving in the matter without waiting for a private member tu do so. All the figures and facts which can be adduced in support of the request, some of which have been given today by the honourable member for Bass (Mr . Jackson), have been within the knowledge of the Treasurer for several months past. I believe that that honourable member was one of a deputation of Tasmanians, representative of both branches of the state legislature, who approached the Treasurer early this year owing to the financial stress then felt in my state. The predicament of Tasmania was clearly and concisely expressed by the Premier (Mr Lyons), who, it was generally agreed, made out the best case that had ever been presented for a financial grant to the state. The Treasurer, after listening to the request, replied in these terms:""Go back to Tasmania; tax yourself to your utmost reasonable capacity; put your own house in order; and then we shall give the most sympathetic consideration to your request."" In other words, he led the members of the deputation, including myself and the Tasmanian Treasurer, to believe that if the Tasmanian Parliament during its then approaching session agreed to new taxation proposals under which the people of that state would be taxed reasonably according to their capacity to pay, the request that had been made to him would be considered immediately by the Federal Government. I feel that honourable members of this Parliament, no matter what state they represent, will actjustly towards Tasmania, and that if a concrete proposal to assist that state is made by the Government, it will be dealt with entirely on its merits. If assistance is not given hy one Government, it certainly must be given by another, for the present condition of affairs simply cannot continue. I regret that this Government has not seen fit, so far, to give effect to the implied promise made by the Treasurer that it would aid Tasmania to overcome her difficulties. The Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) was absent fro m Australia when the promise was made, but he has been back for some montlis and, so far as I know, he was only acquainted with the details of Tasmania's financial positiou when the state Treasurer again visited Melbourne in connection with the matter a few weeks ago. I submit that the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) should have put all the facts before the Government, and that it should have taken the responsibility of introducing concrete proposals to this Parliament to meet the situation. The Tasmanian Government is in the unfortunate positiou of being unable to make any move until the Eederal Government's decision has been announced, and it is now practically waiting on the steps of Federal ment House to be told what is to be' done. It cannot even submit a policy to thti State Parliament u n t i l the policy of this Government is stated. In view of the answer given to me recently by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), I have little hope that ho will make any definite announcement u n t i l the budget is introduced.",22
51,Dr EARLE PAGE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,Do you not thin k it is a proper thing to bring clown all the financial proposals of the Government together ?,23
52,Mr OKEEFE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Speakin g in a general way, I do; but the circumstances of the case warrant the Treasurer indicating immediately what steps he proposes to take to honour his promise to Tasmania.",23
53,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,The Tasmanian Parliament meets on the 22nd J uiy. Mr O ' KEEFE - That is so.,23
54,Dr EARLE PAGE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"""We have not ascertained our receipts and expenditure for the last financial year. Mr O ' KEEFE - The Treasurer may not have the definite figures, but he has known for sonic mouths, and certainly since Parliament re-assembled this year, that the Government woulcl be in a position to assist Tasmania. now that it could grant £200.000, or even more, at once, for a large surplus is available. I regret that this debate is limited as to time. Standing Orders the matter may be dis.eusscd only for about one hour more. The Government should have introduced the subject much earlier in the session aud given honourable members ample time in which to discuss it . Some of them would like a good deal more information on it thau they have. The Government Statistician of Tasmania has forwarded to each honourable member a bulky document which gives all the details, but I have no doubt that they have had little time in which to assimilate the figures. If the Government had acted early in the session the matter could have been thoroughly ventilated. So far from doing that, however, I have been given to understand, on good authority, that it does not propose to enlighten even the manian Government as to its intentions u n t i l the budget proposals have been introduced. The Prime Minister does not seem to have had thefacts laid before him u n t i l with in the last Parliatwo or three weeks. In all these circumstances, it is hardly possible that the full seriousness of the position can be realized by him or by honourable members generally. I may be excused, therefore, if I add some figures to those already given by the honourable member for Bass (Mr . Jackson). Tasmania's financial difficulties commenced soon after the establishment of the Commonwealth, but the practice of making special grants to her was not begun u n t i l 1912. In that year £500,000 was voted to her, to be paid at the rate of £90.000 a. year. Subsequently, an additional £400,000 was granted. She was paid £90,000 a year for ten years from those twoi grants. A f t e r those two grants had been exhausted another grant of £S5,00O was made; but so far nothing* has been voted for this year. Tasmania's financial troubles are consequent upon, and inseparable from , federation. In 1914 yet she had a surplus of £35,000, but since then, owing to the war ancl other causes, the state finances i a v e shown an annual deficit, which has increased year by year. In the eight years from 1914 to 1922, the accumulated deficit reached the sum of £350,000. In the belief that the crisis had passed the then Treasurer of Tasmanin He knows persuaded the State Parliament to f u n d the deficit of £350,000, and a loan wasraised for that j^urpose. In June of tha following year-1923-the same Treasurer had to announce a new deficit of £298,000. Under the Again, despite drastic efforts to retrench wherever possible, the deficit for the year ending on the 30th June of this yeav amounted approximately to £220,000. This amount it will be seen is £60,000 less than the deficit for the previous year, owing to the efforts made by the present Tasmanian Government to retrench. The loss on soldier settlement in Tasmania, which is a. separate account, amounts to £232,000 to the end of the last financial year. These figures give a total floating debt of £1,100,000 which the 200,000 people of Tasmania have to carry in ad-"" dition to their funded debt. To justify Tasmania's claim I point out that the taxpayers of that state are not trying to escape their fair burden of their taxation. The question of what is fair taxation must Tasbe answered, not by the amount of tax per head actually collected, but by the ability of the people to pay taxes. It was pointed out by the Government Statistican only the other day that whilst in England the taxation per head is about £ 1 7 per annum, the people there are better off, aud better able to pay it than the people of India would be with a taxation burden of 17s. per head per annum. It has been pointed out in recent discussions of the relative severity of taxation in England, France, and Germany, that the relation of taxation per head to income per head, must be the measure of the severity of the tax. So that when comparing taxation in Tasmania with taxation in the other states the average income per head in the different states must be taken into account. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) gave a number of figures relating to the capacity of taxpayers in the different states to pay taxation, and it is unnecessary that I should repeat those figures. The natural conditions of Tasmania are such that the cost of settlement is proportionately much higher in that state than in the other states. I should like honourable members from other states who may be sceptical about the justice of Tasmania's claim to remember that in Tasmania, owing to the rainfall and the nature of the soil, all roads have to be metalled, and heavy expenditure must be incurred for bridges, jetties, culverts, &c. These facilities are absolutely necessary, because without them the settlers could not get their produce to market during a greater portion of the year. A comparison of the expenditure on roads, bridges, jetties, and so on in Tasmania and in the other states shows that in 1922 Tasmania expended £ 2 4 7s. 7d. per head on these work3 as against an average expenditure of £ 7 13s. per head on similar works in the other states. The average expenditure per head on railways in the other states was £ 4 7 , as against an expenditure on railways in Tasmania of £ 2 9 per head. These figures show a fa r heavier expenditure on railways in the other states than in Tasmania, but it has to be borne in mind that railways are revenue earning works, and roads, bridges, and jetties are not. The following figures show the excess of revenue over expenditure on railways annually per head of population in each of the states : - Ne w South Wales, £ 3 7s.; Victoria, £ 2 4s.; Queensland, 8s. 9d.; South Australia, £ 3 3s.; West Australia, £ 2 l is . 3d., and Tasmania 10s. Id. These figures do not include interest on capital cost. The figures show that the Tasmanian railways earn only 10g. I d . per head per annum to meet interest and other charges, whilst the earnings of railways in New South Wales amount to £ 3 7s. per head per annum. The drain upon Tasmania in connection with CommonweaJth finance has been very considerable since 1915. Tasmania has contributed £7,310,000 to loans raised by the Commonwealth Government. During the same f>eriod, the State Governments have been obliged to borrow, for developmental works, about the same amount of money.. On every occasion when the Commonwealth Government made an appeal for funds on the score of patriotism Tasmania practically stood alone in contributing over its quota. Very little of the £7,310,000 which Tasmania has contributed to Commonweath loans during and since the war has been spent in that state. Owing to the conditions prevailing in the state, Tasmania has not derived very much benefit from federal expenditure. I do not cavil for a moment at federal expenditure on big national undertakings in the other states. I have always tried to look at such matters from a national stand-point, and have by voice and vote assisted to carry proposals for big national undertakings in this Parliament. I raise no question now as to the fairness of expenditure on such undertakings, bub I say that, owing to the peculiar geographical position of Tasmania, that state has not benefited from a very large expenditure on national undertakings. I ts largest undertaking is the hydro-electric scheme, and I may in form honourable members that the Tasmanian Government paid about £250,000 in Customs duties on plant and material for that scheme, which could not be obtained in Australia. Although it was subsequently agreed by representatives of the states in consultation with representatives of the Commonwealth that such importations for state enterprises should be free of Customs duties, no rebate was allowed to Tasmania of any sums previously paid in that way. I submit that it would have been a fair thing if that state had been allowed a rebate of the £250,000 paid in Customs duty on im ported plant and material necessary for an undertaking which means so much to the state. As I have already said, the loss on soldier settlement to the end of the last financial year in Tasmania £232,000. This loss has been increased by the fact that no rebate of interest was allowed by the Federal Government £500,000 raised in Tasmania to carry out its arrangements with the Federal Government at a time when the Commonwealth was not prepared to advance the nioney required. The following figures will show honourable members how governments Tasmania have tried to restrict ture on public services. In Tasmania spent on railways and tramways, £2 10s. 3d. per head. The average expenditure for similar purposes in the other states was £6 3s. per head. On education, Tasmania spent £1 5s. per head, whilst the average expenditure in the other states was £1 10s. 9d. On hospitals and charities Tasmania spent 13s. 7d. per head, whilst the average in the other states was 16s. 3d. On police, Tasmania spent 7s. 2d. per head, whilst the average expenditure on police in the other states was 9s. 5d. per head. With respect to all other expenditure under the head of general administration, Tasmania's penditure amounted to £2 2s. per head, and the average expenditure of the other states to £3 4s. per head. Taking together these items of necessary state expenditure, the totals show that Tasmania spent £10 10s. lOd. per head as against an average expenditure of £16 2s. Sd. per head in the other states. These figures are a complete answer to any one who may say that Tasmania should have cut down her expenditure. They show that Tasmanian Governments have made cuts in expenditure, even in connection hospitals and charities, wherever ment has been possible. In 33 per cent, of the total revenue is derived from direct taxation; in the other states only 20 per cent, of the total revenue is derived from this source. Tasmania we receive from public services, mainly railways, 36 per cent, of our total revenue, whilst in the other states, the same services return an average of 58 per cent, of the revenue. To avoid expenditure, Tasmania has been neglecting her railways to such an extent that in the next five years it will be necessary for the State Governinent to spend £250,000 on repairs to stock and the permanent way to ensure the safety of those who travel over them. During tie first ten years'of Tasmania received £900,000 in special Mr O'Keefe. was grants. In the same period the Commonwealth derived in direct taxation from Tasmania the sum of £2,300,000. In on other words, Tasmania paid to the Commonwealth £1,400,000 more than she received by way of special grants. I make no apology for having occupied so much time in reading the figures I have given to the House. This matter is of in vital importance to my state. Notexpendi- withstanding that the Treasurer has pro1922-23, mised to bring forward the budget proposals within the next week or two, I would like him to indicate today the Government's intention regarding Tasmania's request for assistance. I do not altogether agree with the wording of the motion in the name of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson). In view of all the conditions, no reduction should take place during the first five years at least. The position in Tasmania is so difficult that the Government which has recently assumed office there will find it almost impossible to put its house i u order, or to bring forward anything like ex-, a proper developmental policy for that state without financial assistance. Tasmania woulcl be justified in asking for a grant of £200,000 per annum for a stated number of years, without any reduction. I do not think that she will be prepared to accept a reduction of £10,000 a year from the commencement. I do not know the proposals of the Federal Government, or when they will be brought forward, but I know that Tasmania's position has been brought about by her entry into the federation. She is not asking for charity. with The honourable member for Bass mentioned retrench- that one of Tasmania's delegates to Tasmania, the Federal Convention pictured the financial troubles which his state was likely to meet after federation, and I believe that it was largely owing to the In speeches made by the Tasmanian delegates that provision was made in the Constitution to enable federal grants to be made to necessitous states. This is not a new thing in the history of federation; the same power exists in other federal Constitutions. It, not only exists in the Canadian Federal Constitution, but it has been availed of. about Such powers are necessary in any federal rolling- Constitution. It is even more necessary that, once the necessity for assistance is shown, such assistance shall be forthfederation, coming. The present position of-' Tasmania is due to no fault of henotvm* KT do not even blame past governments for it , although the deficits have probably been made larger by the governments which have been in power. there was distributed among honourable members a document, prepared by the Government Statistician of Tasmania, Mr Giblin, showing that there is ample justification for the request now made by Tasmania. Mr Giblin points out that it is practically impossible for Tasmania to develop as she should without financial assistance for a number of years. W it h ber splendid hydro-electric scheme in operation, providing cheap electric power, manufacturers may be induced to come from other parts of the world and establish factories in Tasmania, and it is to be hoped that the next few years will see her financial position such that she will not need further assistance from the federation. But for the next five years £200,000 per annum should be granted to that state. At the end of that time the position could be reviewed. aware that the Treasurer of Tasmania recently suggested an alternative proposal, but I do not know what attitude the Federal Government has adopted concerning it . Personally, I should prefer a grant of £200,000 a year, to commence forthwith, and not to be subject to reduction for five years. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion, although I hope that that portion referring to a reduction of £10,000 a year will be deleted so far as the first five years are concerned.",23
55,Mr WHITSITT,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Darwin) [4.54] For the last ten years I have advocated in the Parliament of Tasmania and elsewhere that a special grant of £200,000 per annum should be made to Tasmania. Long before the Jensen Royal Commission was appointed I held the opinion that the state should be given such a grant. Federation has proved an awful handicap to Tasmania. The Constitution provides that where a state is financially embarrassed through joining the federal compact, the Federal Parliament may come to its assistance. The word "" may "" should be "" shall."" Tasmania can no longer stand the strain to which she has been subjected. Metaphorically speaking,, we arc compelled to maintain a RollsRoyce, when we should be going about in : la Ford tear. Tasmania is contributing to the Commonwealth far more than she can afford. Her population is small, comprising but. 218,000 souls, or one-quarter Recently of the population of Melbourne. In the year preceding federation, before Tasmania was fool enough to enter the federal compact, her total taxatiou was 74s. 8d. per head. Since that time she has forgone her Customs and excise duties, while the Federal Government has imposed land and incoine taxes and probate duties, and other levies too numerous to mention. Tasmania's population is now taxed in addition by the Commonwealth to, - the extent of £ 6 9s. 2d. per head. That is a lamentable position. Tasmania has been asked to pay towards many of the "" w i l d c at "" prepositions of the Commonwealth. Her people contributed towards a special grant to Western Australia, as well as to the cost of the transcontinental railway. South Australia has got r i d of her Northern Territory, and her non-paying lines, I am on which millions have been spent. Victoria, has had the Seat of Government since federation was inaugurated, and has received the advantages attendant thereon. New South Wales is to have a Federal Capital on which £3,000,000 has already been spent. Queensland has had her sugar bounties. Tasmania's share has been to pay, pay, pay for the lot.",26

The people in Victoria live in affluence, yet no assistance is given to Tasmania, whose people are groaning beneath this oppression. If Tasmania does not get justice from the Federal Government, I am prepared to resort to any tactics to get that state out of the federal compact. That is my attitude.",26

59,Mr WHITSITT,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"We want justice only. I am a true federalist, provided justice is meted out to Tasmania, but not otherwise. I do not care what Government may be in power here or in Tasmania, I am prepared to advocate secession if justice is not granted. I do not use those words as a threat, but the financial solvency of my state is a matter of importance to me; and that solvency necessitates a grant being made. I want honourable members to realise that I am sincere in my statements. I know the position. Tasmania haa the lowest income tax exemption and the highest direct taxation of any of the states. The present condition can no longer be endured. has not the same facilities as the other states, nor has she their population, or their area. Her part has been to pay, pay, pay.

Victoria and South Wales would then be left to carry on alone. That will be the position we do not get justice. Tasmania has had to contribute towards the naval expendiby ture of the Commonwealth, the construcpensate tion of the transcontinental railway, munication with the mainland. the Murray river scheme, and other public works, but that state has not claim derived one farthing's benefit from them. That state of affairs is no good to Tasmania. What is the use of putdevelop ting men on the land if there are no markets for their produce ? deavour should be made to obtain not markets. Later on I shall have something to say concerning the banking question. other states, too. I ask the Federal Parliament to realise its responsibility to that state, which been a loyal member of the federation, has borne the heat and burden of the day, and sent the best of its manhood to fight abroad.

62,Mr CHARLTON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Hunter) [ 4 . 0 ] Whilst I admire the enthusiasm of .the Treasurer. honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I counsel him not to threaten much, because threats usually prejudice rather than help a cause. much sympathy with the proposal that the Commonwealth should grant some financial assistance to Tasmania. That that state is in a position different from that of any of the other states was recognized by the framers of the Constitution when they provided that for Tasmania a number of years a certain sum of money should be repaid to Tasmania by the Commonwealth, and that thereafter this Parliament should decide whether that form of assistance should continue. In a matter of this kind we should not be influenced by petty parochial feelings, but should endeavour to take a national view. Tasmania is at a the considerable disadvantage, because of its Being an island it is deprived Tasof the advantages of railway communication with its partners in the Commonand because of that it has suffered to commercially very much during the last The matter has frequently been mentioned in this House by representatives of the state, who have spoken follow, and of the difficulty Tasmanian producers exNew perience in getting their produce shipped across to the mainland and overseas. I if think the Commonwealth might long ago have gone to the assistance of that state providing shipping facilities to comfor the absence of railway comSome people urge that Tasmania has no special to consideration in this regard, but the Commonwealth, as the parent body, should do everything possible to foster and the other members of the family. Tasmania is not on an equal footing with An enany other state, and in saying that I am unmindfu l of the unfavorable position of Western Australia, and perhaps of Tasmanian Governments have administered the affairs of the has state economically; notwithstanding accruing deficits from year to year, they have taxed their people heavily, and only recently additional taxation was imposed in compliance with the suggestion of the l l Federal Treasurer to the Premier of Tasto mania that he should impose further taxaof tion upon his people before seeking assistperfectly ance from the Commonwealth. Mr O ' KEEFE - An additional 10s. per head of taxation was imposed in compliance, with the request of the Federal",27
63,Mr CHARLTON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"That is a very so heavy increase, and shows that the Tasmanian Government is prepared to do a I have very fair thing, but there is a point beyond which taxation cannot be safely increased. Mr O ' KEEFE - If any further taxation is imposed all the young men will be driven out of the State.",27
64,Mr CHARLTON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Inquiries I made in Tasmania recently showed that the young men were leaving the state, aud I do not doubt that that will continue unless this Parliament does something to assist the state. The cost of living in Tasmania is much higher than in any other state, and at the same time the wages are lower. That is a fact which we must take into consideration. In Hobart tOrday 36s. will purchase only as much as could be bought with £ 1 in 1911. The basic wage is £ 4 12s. 4d. per week, whereas in Sydney it is £ 4 14s. 6d; in Melbourne, £ 4 15s. 7d. ; in Brisbane, £ 4 14s. 2d.; in Adelaide, £ 4 10s. 9 d . ; and in Perth, £ 4 14s. 2d. Though the wage is lower in Adelaide than in Hobart, living in the former city is cheaper, £ 1 l is . 4d. being equal to £ 1 16s. in Hobart, so that, relatively speaking, the Adelaide worker is better off than his fellow in Hobart. In view of these figures it is very difficult for any honourable member to oppose the claim that has been presented by the representatives of Tasmania. There is every justification for asking the Commonwealth to give some assistance to that state. I do not suggest what form that assistance should take, and I shall curtail my remarks in order to afford the Treasurer an opportunity of stating the intentions of the Government. Statistics prove that Tasmania is rigidly restricting its expenditure. Although the state is small in area, its population is sparse, and that makes it difficult to operate its railway system economically. I find that in 1921-22 the Tasmanian expenditure upon railways and tramways was only £ 2 10s. 3d. per head, whereas the average for the other five states was £ 6 3s. 3d. Upon education, including administration, the expenditure in Tasmania was £ 1 5s. 5d. per head, as compared with an average for the other five states of £ 1 10s. 9d. It is clear that Tasmania is in such a bad financial position that it cannot afford to give to the rising generation the educational facilities that are enjoyed on the mainland. Upon hospitals and charities Tasmania spent 13s. 7d., as compared with an average of 16s. 3d. for the other states; upon police, 7s. 2d., as compared with 9s. 5 d . ; and upon all other forms of expenditure, including general administration, £ 2 2s. I d . , as compared with £ 3 4s.. 5d. The total expenditure per head for all purposes, including interest, was £ 1 0 10s. lOd. in Tasmania, as compared with an average for the otlier five states of £ 1 6 2s. 5d. In other words, the mainland states are spending £ 6 per head annually more than Tasmania can afford tospend. Why? Simply because Tasmania has not, and cannot, get the nioney to expend.",28
65,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Hear , hear ! Tasmania does not get anything like the same revenue from its public services as do the other states.",28
66,Mr CHARLTON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"I agree with the honourable member, and I say that that state has a just claim for consideration by the Commonwealth. If honourable members ask why a special grant should be given to Tasmania, I would remind them that the Commonwealth has relieved South Australia of the Northern Territory, a very costly responsibility, of which Tasmania has to bear its proportionate share. The east-west railway, although very necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, was builtchiefly for the benefit of Western Australia. Queensland has enjoyed the sugar bounty; of that I make no complaint, but it has cost the Commonwealth millions of pounds, and Tasmania has paid its share of that. New South Wales will get the benefit of the many millions of pounds to be expended at Canberra. Each of the other states has directly or indirectly received some big benefit from the Commonwealth, and Tasmania, as their partner, has to contribute towards the cost, if from any cause whatever any state is in difficult circumstances, it is the duty of the Commonwealth to come to its assistance. I shall not detain the House further, but shall await with in terest the Treasurer's pronouncement regarding the attitude of the Government to Tasmania's claim.",28
67,Mr WEST,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"East Sydney) [4.14] - As a representative of one of the mainland states, which will have to provide any money that may be paid to Tasmania, I shall have to justify my vote upon this motion. I remind the representatives of Tasmania that from 1914 until recently the Tasmanian Governments have been representative of the Liberal party, of which the honourable member for Bass is such an ardent supporter, and they have continued to pile up deficits year after year. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt) has amusingly threatened that if Tasmania does not get what it is seeking it will petition to be allowed to secede from the federation. I should regret the honourable member's departure from this Chamber, because his peculiar style of speech has always afforded a certai n amount of amusement to other honourable members. Tasmania is a small state, with a population of only 218,000, but it has all the flummery of a Governor. It has an upper house of parliament, and an agent-general in London. Seeing that Tasmania is always in debt, why has it continued to spend money on these things? About four or five months ago the Parliament decided to continue the office of Governor. I remind the state of Tasmania, that expenditure saved is revenue earned. It does not need a financial genius to discover that. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) referred to New South Wales. ' I remind him that New South Wales has many expensive undertakings in hand. It has thirteen lines of railway that do not pay for axle grease. Owing to the vastness of the state, its railways are very expensive to run. The honourable membei' should have made no reference to New South Wales. That state has a population of 2,000,000, as against 218,000 in Tasmania, and it therefore stands to reason that a larger sum of money should be spent there. While the births in Tasmania last year exceeded the deaths by 3,000, the population increased by only 170 persons. Why, in the face of such facts, does that state support an expensive scheme of immigration? It ought to cut down its expenditure on immigration.",28
68,Mr STEWART,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,How much does Tasmania propose to spend on immigration ?,29
69,Mr WEST,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,I am unable to state the figures.,29
70,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"They are not available, because Tasmania is not spending anything on immigration.",29
71,Mr WEST,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"When the late Premier of Tasmania was in Great Britain , he snoke of Tasmania, as a state that wanted immigrants. I extend my sympathy to the Labour Government there, for it is suffering for the misdeeds of its predecessors. The Treasurer should fall in with the views of the honourable member for Bass, and in that case Tasmania will have a chance of securing better government than she has had for many years.",29
72,Dr EARLE PAGE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4.20] - I congratulate the honourable member for Bass on the way in which he stated the case for Tasmania. I congratulate him especially for departing from the method often adopted in the past. He said, quite frankly, that he approved of the spending of money on works of urgent national importance, such as the river Murray irrigation scheme, the unification of railway gauges, and the like. He views the subject from a national point of view, and does not base Tasmania's claim on the fact that money has been spent on national works in other states. In my consideration of Tasmania's oase, I have been inclined to regard favourably the fact that during the last ten years, at any rate, that state has been attempting to overcome the disadvantages which its geographical isolation places upon it . It has made strenuous efforts to develop its secondary industries, and by undertaking the big hydroelectric scheme it has placed itself on the road to, permanent progress and prosperity. Finding itself in a difficulty, it has not unreasonably come to the Commonwealth Government and asked for consideration under section 96 of the Constitution. It has always been fortunate in having very doughty champions of its cause both in this and the State Parliament. No members have fought more gallantly than the honourable members for Bass (Mr Jackson), Wilmot (Mr Atkinson), Darwin (Mr Whitsitt). Franklin (Mr Seabrook), and Denison (Mr O'Keefe), and the Tasmanian senators. On consulting the departmental files, I find that, not merely has there been a persistent and consistent advocacy of Tasmania's claims in this Parliament, but State Premiers and legislators have never lost an opportunity of stating the facts. On the 28th A p r i l , 1919, Sir Walter Lee, who v/as then Premier, made a representation to you, Mr Speaker, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. That was shortly before the expiration of the £900,000 grant. The grant was continued at the amount of £85,000. Sir Elliot Lewis, Chief Secretary of Tasmania, again put forward a strong case in 1922. It received the favourable consideration of this Parliament, and another year's contribution of £85,000 was made. Last year, and the year before that, Sir Walter Lee and Senator Hayes put up a. strong fight for special consideration, apart from, and in addition to, that £85,000. fact that the Commonwealth Government; submitted proposals to the Premiers' Conference last year showed that it was ready to give sympathetic consideration to the request, and to extend special sympathy to Tasmania.",29
73,Mr OKEEFE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,Late r investigations have shown that those proposals would not have placed her in such a good position as the figures represented at the time.,30
74,Dr EARLE PAGE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"T h at is not so. It has been freely stated that the figures presented in a memorandum to the Premiers' Conference were not accurate. I wish to give that statement the lie direct. The figures represented the actual assessments of the previous year. The State Treasurers at the conference wanted to discuss the Commonwealth Government's proposals in the light of the current year's figures, which, of course, were not available. The only figures available for the current year were estimates. Representatives of the Commonwealth pointed out that it was impossible to get accurate estimates, but, at the request of the State Premiers, we discussed the question on the estimates. The figures produced originally, however, were the actual assessments, and cannot be controverted. am glad that the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) has given me an opportunity to nail that lie to the counter, for it has had currency for too long. Mr O ' KEEFE - It is rather a strong term to call the statement a "" l i e ."" I have statistics and the word of the Treasurer of Tasmania to support me.",30
75,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,Rt. Hon. WA. Watt). - If the Treasurer says that anything uttered in this House is a lie his remark is not parliamentary.,30
76,Dr EARLE PAGE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"The statement was made outside the House. The figure* prepared at the time of the Premiers' Conference were taken from the omciai assessments of the Taxation Department. Early this year the Premier of Tasmania came to me with a deputation that represented all parties and both Houses of this Parliament. I think the deputation also included representatives of the Tasmanian Parliament. The Premier stated the case in terms similar to those employed during the last three) or four years, but he [74] 1 brought the facts up to date. I pointed out to the Premier the points which, in my opinion, laid themselves open to critiThe cism. The chief criticism was that the taxation of Tasmania at that time was not so high as that of the other states. The Premier told me that he intended to try to carry through taxation proposals to remedy that defect.",30
77,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,The taxpayers of Tasmania can tell the Treasurer that he has kept his promise.,30
78,Dr EARLE PAGE,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"The Tasmanian Government was not able to get certain proposals through the Upper House to prevent the deficit enlarging, but the Premier has informed me that he has imposed additional taxation to the following extent:-Incom e taxation, £ 8 0 , 0 0 0; land taxation,'£19,000 ; death duties, £ 1 6 , 0 0 0; stamp duties, £ 2 , 0 0 0; and liquor taxes, £14,000-makin g a total of £131,000. Those facts will be taken into favourable consideration by the Government. It is impossible for the Government to make any proposal except as part of its general financial arrangements. Ministers are making a special effort to bring down their proposals at the earliest possible moment, aud the Premier of Tasmania has been informed that whatever is done the Government will make the payment retroI spective to the l st July, so that he will have no difficulty in arranging his own accounts if he finds it necessary to impose further taxation. In those circumstances it would not be proper for me to make a detailed statement of the Government's intentions. During the last six or eight months the Government has had this matter under careful consideration. It has investigated the whole incidence of taxa'tion in Tasmania, and it has analysed the manner in which the Tasmanian public debt has been incurred. It has noted that the Premier of Tasmania has fol lowed the advice offered in regard to the imposition of taxation, and when the budget is brought down the financial proposals of the Government will be known.",30
79,Mr LISTEB,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,I should like the debate to he adjourned.,30
80,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCIALPOSITION OF,"Rt. Hon.W. A. Watt). - r l was about to announce that the time allotted to the consideration of notices of motion had expired. Debate (on motion by Mr LISTEB) adjourned. NA AUSTRALIAN ARCHITECTS. Debate resumed from 29th May (vide page 993), ou motion by Dr MALONEY Tliat in view of the pronounced favouritism those who possess the gift of distribution of public works(1) This House declares that all architectural plans, designs, specifications, &c, of all works for the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Bank, the estimated cost of which amounts to £3,000 and upwards, shall be thrown open to the public competition of the architects of Australia. (2) Contingent upon this motion being carried, it be an instruction to vernment of the day to bring in amending legislation so as to control the policy of the Governor of the Commouwealth Bank in allotting architectural work and the like to one firm consisting of his relations ond others.",30
81,Mr STEWART,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [4.33] - The motion, in effect, lays down the principle that the plans for all works likely to cost more than £3,000 shall bethrown open to architectural competition. our post offices exceed £3,000 in cost, and are erected in all parts of the Commonwealth. If the motion is carried, the plans for these buildings will have to be made the subject of competition, and this would cause, not only delay, but heavy expense to the Commonwealth. fees of members of the architectural profession are 6 per cent, of the value of the buildings erected, and it would be necessary - for the Works and Railways Department to retain a professional staff aud executive officers to protect Government interests. if we did throw the work open to competition we should have to retain nearly the whole of, if not all, the staff that now does this work, and the clerical staff might have to be increased to deal with correspondence with the architectural firms engaged in the competitions. A rule of the Institute of Architects is that the successful competitor shall be given the supervision of the work. This might involve heavy travelling expenses, particularly for work in remote parts of Australia. It does not necessarily follow that a successful architect is competent to supervise the erection of the building he has designed. syptfmi proposed would increase the time taken in the execution of work, and it would complicate the administration. Honourable members will therefore realise that it would be inadvisable to pass the motion. The Works and Railways of Department is in constant consultation with various Government departments. It has had years of experience in designing, for instance, buildings for the Postal Department, and it is in close touch with its particular requirements. The Chief Commonwealth Architect, Mr Murdoch, is a very competent officer, and he has given every satisfaction in his work. Since the present Government took the Gooffice it has instituted competitions amongst architects for carrying out various work at Canberra, and it is now proposed to allow private architects to compete for : the work of designing the administrative buildings there. A similar competition was recently held in connection with the erection of a group of cottages. I mention these facts to show that the Government is not rigidly adhering to the policy that all publie buildings shall be designed by Government officers. The Most of Director-General of Works, Colonel Owen, states that the system advocated in the motion would greatly increase the cost, of works administration, and the delay inseparable from the procedure of inviting, receiving, and judging designs would be The fatal. If the works in the programme for the financial year just closed had been carried out under the system advocated they would have cost in the neighbourhood of £100,000, exclusive of premiums to successful competitors, travelling expenses of supervising architects, &c. The whole branch now costs only about Even three-fourths of the sum mentioned, and the bulk of the present staff would still have to be retained. I think the arguments against, the proposal are overwhelming, and I ask the House to reject the motion. Debate (on motion by Mr MAHONY) adjourned. FEDERAL CAPITAL. RAILWAY COMMUNICATION. Debate resumed from 22nd May (vide page 845), on motion by Mr . MANNINGI. That, in thu opinion of this House, it is The essential that Canberra be connected by rail with the Southern railway line in New South Wales. 2. That the passing of this resolution taken as an instruction to the Mmister Works ancl Railways to move to refer matter to the Public Works Committee to port on the most favourable route.",31
82,Mr MAHONY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Dalley) [4.40] - It is useless to attempt to build au effective capital at Canberra without proper railway communication with the southern line. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) by his motion invites the House to approve of railway connection with the main southern line, but he has included a proviso, with which I do not agree, that the matter should be referred again to the Public Works Committee, so that it might report on the most favourable route. We have already had the chairman of the Public Works Committee (Mr Gregory) saying that it is of no use to refer the matter back to that committee, since it could only come to the same decision as before, that is, one against the construction of a railway from Yass to Canberra. I do not intend to weary honourable members by resuscitating old arguments. The Federal Capital is being built at Canberra, ancl railway communication with it should be provided without delay. Honourable members should accept the responsibility of deciding that railway communication shall be immediately established between Canberra ancl the main southern line. I agree that the chairman of the Public Works Committee should not be asked to take that responsibility.",32
83,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"In anything that is done honourable members must consider the Federal Territory Acquisition Act, which provides for a railway to Yass. """,32
84,Mr MAHONY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I sympathize with the honourable member for Swan in the unfortunate position in which he finds himself as chairman of the Public Works Committee, but he realizes that Canberra, as the future Federal Capital, must have railway communication.",32
85,Mr MATHEWS,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,How does the honourable member propose to surmount the difficulty presented by the Public Works Committee Act?,32
86,Mr MAHONY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"If the House agrees to the amendment that I am about to submit, that difficulty will be effectively overcome. I move That paragraph 2 be left out. be Mr E. EILEY (South Sydney) for this [4.45] - I hops that ihe amendment will ru- be carried.",32
87,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"The Publio Works Committee rejected the proposal on financial grounds, but if Parliament referred the matter back to the committee I think it main would make a satisfactory report.",32
88,Mr MAHONY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I do not think it would, after your recent statement.",32
89,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"The committee would regard such a resolution as a definite in struction. Mr E . RILEY - Parliamen t is to meet in Canberra in less than two vears, The construction of this line will occupy some time, and, in the interests of honourable members living i u Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia, it should be commenced as early as possible.",32
90,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"The line would only save an hour and a half in travelling time, and would cost £750,000. Mr E . RILEY - I shall net be convenienced by it , for I represent a Sydney constituency, but the convenience of honourable members who represent states other than New South Wales and Queensland should be considered. W it h out doubt, many deputations will visit Canberra on public business; public servants will be required to travel there frequently; and many visitors will go to it . These should all be considered. It is hardly fair that a city like Melbourne should be denied direct communication with the Federal Capital. Compared with the amount of money that has already been spent at Canberra, the cost of the line will be a mere nothing. We shall reduce the expense of establishing the Federal Capital if .we agree to construct this railway, for large quantities of building material will be carried from Melbourne on it . It will be no reflection upon the Public Works Committee if honourable members agree to the amendment, for the committee will undoubtedly accept the decision of the House as an instruction, and report accordingly. A railway is just as much a part of the equipment of Canberra as is a Parliament House.",32
91,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Swan) [4.50] - I trust that the House will consider the position very seriously before it agrees to the amendment. Very heavy expense is being incurred in essential works at Canberra. I cannot understand the attitude of honourable members who wish to rush the Government into building this railway. The Public Works Committee is now dealing with the question of constructing a building for the secretariat. I asked a series of questions of the Prime Minister recently in regard to this matter, and learned that so far there has been no consultation whatever by the authorities concerned to ascertain how many officers will be needed at Canberra in the early stages, or what arrangements must be made for their accommodation.",32
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENCOURAGEMENT OF, The honourable member for Swan must confine himself to the amendment.,33
93,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I do not think honourable members who travel from states south of the Federal. Territory will be greatly inconvenienced if the railway is not built at once, for I have no doubt that arrangements can be made with the New South Wales Government to put special Canberra carriages on trains fro m the south for the convenience of passengers travelling to the Federal Capital. Those carriages coiuld be shunted off the main Hue at Goulburn, and run down to Queanbeyan into the Federal city. No change of trains would then be necessary, and. the journey would only take one and a half to two hours longer than if a direct line from Yass were built. That arrangement would be quite suitable in the earlv stages of settlement a.t Canberra. Honourable members who represent New South Wales constituencies should show a little moi\> consideration than they are doing for their own state, for if the Yass proposal is adopted it will involve New South Wales in an expenditure of about £340,000, and the railway would not earn enough money in the next eight or ten years to pay for axle grease. When the Federal Parliament is established an Canberra, honourable members will be better able to estimate the measure of inconvenience involved by the arrangement I have suggested, and, if necessary, steps could then bc taken to build the railway.

AYES.",35
100,Dr MALONEY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Melbourne) [5.26] I have the right to speak to the amendment. I consider that for such an amendment to be moved is an impertinence, as it will hurt the feelings of every sensitive poor person in the community. No man in this House, if asked on a public platform if he believed that tliose who are really poor, destitute, hungry, and homeless, should be placed under a commission, to be tried God knows when, would dare to signify his approval. The honourable meinber for Swan (Mr Gregory) will agree with me that the satirical philosopher was right when he said, "" If God had placed the making of the world in the hands of a commission, it never would have been made."" For this House to carry this wicked and cruel amendment would be an indication to the public that members have neither kindly feelings towards suffering humanity, nor knowledge of the necessities of life. Why did not the honourable member endeavour to amend the motion by moving that after the word "" relieved "" at the end of paragraph 1, these words be added, "" for three weeks, to enable inquiries to be made by the Department of Old-age and In valid Pensions in respect of such destitute cases "" ? I can quite understand that this House contains some members who, themselves, have never suffered want, v and who probably doubt that otlier people are not so well placed as themselves, so far as this world's goods are concerned.

I have never asked a human being to surrender a conscientious conviction, but I resent very strongly the flippant amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parkes. I ask him , as the father of a family, and as one who fought in the war, to agree to some amendment which will achieve something for suffering humanity. I am informed that the very commission to which the amendment refers already has power to deal with this matter. The Victorian Parliament regularly voted a compassionate allowance, u n t i l the practice was discontinued during Sir Will i a m .MCPherson's term as Treasurer. I have heard Sir Alexander Peacock resent the action of Sir William MCPherson in discontinuing the compassionate ance. A member of parliament, a clergyman, or a reputable merchant, could write to the Under-Treasurer that a certain family was in need, and immediately assistance was given, pending inquiry. That is all I desire the. Commonwealth to do. I am sure that if the honourable member for Parkes will think of those who are destitute and without homes he will regret having proposed such a wicked and cruel amendment.

101,Mr CHARLTON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Hunter) [5.46] We are making a farce of parliamentary proceedings. I fail to understand, if honourable members postpone all the business. why there should he a private members' day. Only one day a month is now allowed for private members' business, three other days allowed formerly having been taken away. I raised no objection to the curtailment of that privilege, because I realized the need for getting on with the country's business. Yet on the one day a month when private members' business is allowed honourable members refuse to proceed with the motions standing in their names. I suggest to the Prime Minister that some action is necessary. It would be better not to have a private members' day than to waste the time of Parliament as we are doing today. There may be good reasons for the postponement of one or two motions, but when it is proposed to postpone all of them., and when it is borne in mind that they have been on the notice paper for many weeks, one is led to the conclusion that they are intended merely ns placards for the electors. Those,honourable members who submitted them could not have been earnest about them. Honourable members should refrain from putting motions on the business-paper unless they intend to proceed with them when they have an opportunity. I can speak impersonally in this regard, for I have had only one item of private members' business listed in the State or Federal Parliament. Rather than do as we are doing today, I would prefer to proceed with Government business. We shall soon be asked by the Government to meet on Tuesdays, and perhaps to sit all night. It is therefore foolish at this stage to waste time.",36
102,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External A f fair s ) [ 5 . 4 9 ] - I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that it is unfortunate when private members' business cannot be proceeded with, but I would remind him that on private members' day honourable members themselves are responsible for what is done. The adjournment of the debate was secured by Sir Austin Chapman, who was then Minister for Trade and Customs. There is now a new Minister for Trade and Custonis, and it is natural that he should desire to look farther into the question before coming to a decision upon it . I feel sure that honourable members will realise that there is a very good and substantial reason why the motion cannot be conveniently proceeded with at this moment. The previous motion on the business-paper we have dealt with , and a vote has been takeD on it . To illustrate the difficulty of proceeding with private members' business in all cases, u motion by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr K ill e n )",37

104,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,I referred to it to remind the House that the honourable member for Riverina is absent through illness. I did not intend to refer to the subject of the motion. I doubt whether the House would readily accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that the Government should take away the small amount of time still allowed for private members' business.,37
105,Mr OKEEFE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Denison) [5.52] - At the beginning of this Parliament, over a year ago, I placed the motion on the notice-paper. It was f u l ly discussed. I cited facts and ngures that I thoughtwould enable the Government to make up its mind as to the wisdom or otherwise of agreeing to the appointment of the proposed committee. The motion has been postponed time after time, and the Prime Minister promised me last year that I would be given an opportunity to have a vote taken. I have not had that opportunity, and the motion still stands in my name. The people I represent, and to whom this is a vital question, are wondering what is the matter, and are asking why a vote cannot be taken. I am not permitted to discuss the merits of the motion now, but I have a right to demand a statement of the Government's intentions. If the Government is not prepared to agree to the appointment of the committee, I should prefer to remove my notice of motion from the business-paper, and to take some other action to achieve my purpose. I should like to have a vote taken without further delay. I assume that if a vote is taken, I can rely on the support of my fellow members from Tasmania, and, in that event, the motion will probably be carried. This is not a party question. The committee would be required only to make an investigation, and its appointment would not involve the Government in any expense. It could complete its inquiry in a week. I am willing to allow the Government to choose the members of the committee.",37

108,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I have a personal explanation to make,, consequent upon the with remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), who said that private members who had notices of motion on bers the business paper should be prepared to go on with them. The position in regard to my notice of motion on the NorthSouth railway is that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford), when acting as your deputy, sir, could not procure his notes, and he asked me to allow the motion to be delayed. I could not do other than accede to his request. GOVERNMENT WORKS. THE CONTRACT SYSTEM.

Sometimes the excuse given is that a Minister is sick, and when he is not sick that lie is new to the .work.. When he is not new to office the exeuae is that he is too ill to go on with motions. If a Minister is neither NOES. sick, new, nor-ill, he asks for an adjournment because somebody else is sick.

109,Mr FORDE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Capricornia) [6.5] - I move That all the words after "" That "" be omitted a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words: "" in the opinion of thi9 House a Royal Commission comprised of. throe memof the House of Representatives aud two members of the Senate should bo forthwit h almoin tod to investigate and report upon the administration of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, embracing the management of the Expropriation Board, and iiart'cularly inquiring into the disclosures recently made by Mr John Ambrose Bcgley, late Senior Medical Assistant to the Jfow Guinea Administration."" I submit the amendment spirit, but as an Australian, member of this House who has visited the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. was a member of the parliamentary gation that went to New Guinea last September, and returned in October. delegation had not sufficient cany out such an investigation as, in my opinion, is necessary. In the speech I am about to make I do not intend to father any cf the accusations made by newspapers or individuals Administration or the Board. I have been assured by some people that the charges are Others say that there is a lot of truth in the accusations, while nobody from the Territory is prepared to assert that they are untrue. I have met some people who have returned from the Territory Mr Begley's disclosures were made, and they state definitely that the charges are substantially correct. For the good name of Australia there should bo a royal commission appointed with full power to subpoena witnesses, take evidence on oath, and protect witnesses against tion. Several officers, who are no doubt gentlemen of high character, have been sent to the Territory to report on various matters, but they have not been given the power to take evidence on oath. A royal commission would be clothed with ample powers. In the Commonwealth No. 91, dated 27th September, 1922, regulations under the Public Service nance for the Territory of New Guinea are published. Section 22 provides that an officer shall not publicly comment on any administrative action, or upon the administration of any department, or use for any purpose, other than the discharge of his official duties, information him or conveyed to him through his connection with the Public Service. 23 states that, except in the course of his official duties, no officer shall directly or indirectly give information public business, or of any matters of which he has knowledge officially. readily understand that men in the Service who could make rather startling disclosures concerning the are afraid to have their Mr Forde. mentioned, for fear of dismissal, but they say that they would be prepared to give to a royal commission evidence on oath which would prove that there in no party has been maladministration in the Terriand as a tory. Some of these officers served during the war in Europe, and others were enI gaged in New Guinea. They are good dele- Australians. They declare ""that their sole motive is to improve the administraThat tion with a view to the speedy developpower to ment of the Territory along right lines. The land area of this territory is 90,000 square miles; its width from north to south is 450 miles, and its length from east to west 1,100 miles. One of the outposts is against the 600 miles, and another is 410 miles from Expropriation Rabaul. In setting out to control a territory that was new to it , and which for justified. 39 years had been administered by the Germans, Australia undertook a difficult task. I do not wish to detract in the least degree from the credit due to those who have done the pioneering work since in the Territory. An y statements or suggestions I make will not be offered in a party or vindictive spirit, for I desire to be impartial in the matter. I base my request for a royal commission on the following grounds:-1 . Mr Begley's charges of ill-treatment to natives, victimiza- extracts from which I shall read: the report of Mr H . E . A . Cameron, a medical assistant; and the report of the Commissioner for Native Affairs in the * territory (Mr Carden) referring to Mr . Begley's charges. 2. The Administration's unfair statement that no notice should be Gazette, taken of Mr Begley, because he was allowed to resign instead of being dismissed Ordi- owing to suspicion of his being of unsound mind, a statement which a number of medical certificates by eminent specialists will disprove. 3. Lack of housing accommodation in the Territory; the pernicious chit system, which results in scores of young men getting intoxicants in Chinese gained by hotels as long as they are sober enough to sign slips of paper, with all evil conseSection quences ; the unsuitable methods of selecting district officers or police magistrates. 4. Allegations made by the Public Service concerning Association at Rabaul against the A d ministrator in a letter to members of the One can parliamentary delegation in September, 1923. 5. A letter from the honorary secretary of the Kaewieng branch of the Re- administration turned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial names League. 6. General dissatisfaction amongst publio servants and private citizens in the Territory. 7. In the best interests of the good name of Australia this Parliament should not be silent while grave and serious reflections are cast upon the Commonwealth's administration of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. 8. Experience has shown that depart-, mental inquiries and official reports fail to elicit the evidence when no pro-taction is afforded to the informants. Those grounds are covered by many statements made to me by officials and others while I was in New Guinea, and numerous letters I have since received. Some of the people who spoke to me came to the hotel at night, so that no one would see them with me. They told me many things and asked me to move for a royal commission. I went to the Administrator about one particularly serious matter, but I shall not go into details about it , for to do' so would cast serious reflections on officers who have relatives living in Australia. When I asked for files during my visit I was told that I had no power to demand their production. They had no authority to meetmy wishes. had the greatest difficulty in obtaining authentic information. Certain people told me things in confidence which I had no facilities for investigating thoroughly. As this territory is now under the control of the Commonwealth Government, it is highly important, as I think even the Prime Minister will admit, that honourable members should take a keen interest in its administration. territories under the control of the Commonwealth are- a Territories, originally parts of the states, which have been surrendered by the states to the Commonwealth, namely, the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital Terri tory; b territories not parts of the states, which have been placed under the authority of the Commonwealth by order in council under section 122 of the Constitution, namely, Papua and Norfolk Island; and c territories which have been placed under the administration of the Commonwealth by mandate issued by the League of Nations, which are the territories of New Guinea and Nauru. Nauru has to be administered in conjunction with the British and New Zealand Governments. Australia will have control for three years, the British Government for three years, and the New Zealand Government for three years. Only territories of classes a and b are really permanent territories of the Commonwealth. Under the treaty made with Germany on the 28th June. 1919, which was ratified and came into force in January, 1920, Germany renounced, in favour of the principal allied and associated powers, all her rights and titles over her oversea possessions. By the Covenant of the League of Nations which is embodied in the treaty such of these colonies and territories as were in habited by people not yet able to stand by themselves were entrusted to the tutelage of advanced nations. The council of the League of Nations constituted under the peace treaty issued to His Britannic Majesty, a mandate dated the 17th December, 1920, to be exercised on his behalf by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia in respect of the former German colony of New Guinea and the former German islands situated in the Pacific Ocean and lying south of the Equator, other than the islands of the Samoan group. The islands lying north of the Equator, I namely, the Marshall and the Caroline groups, were placed under the control of Japan by a similar mandate. The Treaty of Peace Regulations 1920-22 contain provision for vesting, as at the 10th January, 1920, in the public trustee, and subsequently in the custodian of expropriated properties all properties, rights, and interests within the territory of New Guinea of German nationals and chargThe ing the net proceeds of their sale, liquidation or other dealings Will the payments as provided for by the Peace Treaty. In the Mandated Territory of New Guinea two important bodies are responsible for the control of the Administration and the expropriated properties. One of these is a Government department of approximately 230 officers, called the Administration, and the other is the Expropriation Board, with a staff of 300"". The administration of these territories has not been very expensive to Australia. So far, the only loans granted have been one of £10,000 recently made to Rabaul, ancl another of £10,000 granted by the Expropriation Board for medical services. When the sum of these two loans is compared with the sum of the administrative expense. 1 incurred in respect of other Australia:! territories it docs not appear to be very great. It was laid down that thfT e r r it o r y of N e w Guinea should be self-supporting, and an e f for t is being made to give effect to that p r o v is i o n . One of the chief grievances of the people in N e w G u in e a is that they lack representation in this P a r l i a m e n t . have no means whatever of g i v in g expression to the i r wishes. T h ey ask for a n elective legislative council on a d u l t f r a n chise; and if possible a representative in this Parhament. I shall make some f u r the r reference to that on another occasion. In support of m y request for a r o y a l commission, I shall read several letters w h i c h I have received. ' I w r o t e to Dr A . H o n m a n , a Collins-street medical m a n , with reference to this matter . the chief medica l oflicer in that t e r r it o r y for some time , and is a p r a c t it i o n e r of h i g h repute. I asked him to express h is v i e w on the proposal for the a p p o in t m e n t of a r o y a l commission, for I believe that he is keenly desirous to see the t e r r it o r y advance.",38

111,Mr FORDE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"The honourable member for Newcastle knows Dr H o n m a n w e l ancl can v o u c h for the value of h i opinion. In reply to m y letter, H o n m a n wrote-Dear Mr Forde,A special royal comniission should he to New Guinea, accompanied hy a business man of ability and a secretary with an in mate knowledge of local conditions. Before a royal commission, all evidence should be taken on oath-in justice to everybody. It woulcl be useless for a man to take a round it is called. A stay of several weeks or months would be necessary for a complete vestigation to bo made. It is of much importance that this should be done in the interests of Australia than that things should be covered up, and individuals, whether high rank or ordinary officials, white-washed. Nothing short of this would satisfy the public. The doctor is one whose w o r d can be taken. The next letter is from a h i g h No w Guinea, w h o is not in a p o s it i o n to disclose his name. To do so m i g h t mean the loss of his p o s it i o n. He w r it e s It requires a master mind to deal situation. However well intentioned the present Administrator is, he is not big enough the job. A cheap man is always unsuitable. You will have to pay a good man from to £3,000 per annum. It is no good trying to cure the body of minor ills if you nre going allow the head to be in a diseased condition. A good Administrator could pull New Guinea out o j the deplorable condition it private citizen has no say at all in New Guinea. He is looked upon as so much dirt. 'J hose people should be represented on a legislative council and an executive council to assist the Administrator. The present advisory committee is a farce. The advisers are heads of departThey ments who are subservient to the Administrator and are afraid of him. The next letter I wish to quote is from a man who has no grievance and whose sole reason for making any suggestions is that the Territory may be benefited. He wrotePremising that all diseases have symptoms and every disease a remedy, it follows that thorough expert investigation by a Royal Commission is needed to locate and provide the remedy. He was Symptoms - (1) Begley's charges; (2) native affairs in relation to commercial progress; (3) discontent and inefficiency in the service; (4) signs of general stagnation. Comments -.(1 ) Begley's charges and other matters can only be investigated by a Royal Commission, any other for m of inquiry would be futile, a waste of energy, time, and money; (2) housing-man y officers, married and single, are living in conditions of slumdom, damaging alike to self-respect and physical well-being; f i ed to the quarters provided for single men at the building knowu as Treasury flats are particularlybad and, indeed, intolerably so; such acl , commodation is not only uncomfortable, but is lowering to self-respect and results in rapid s mental and physical deterioration, and also Dr damages a white man's prestige in the eyes of the natives. NOTE - The Treasury flats and otlier similar buildings were built without the sanction ot sent medical authority, and, indeed, were condemned by such authority before completion. t iOwing to lack of privacy and quietness essential to the peace of mind and rest of .the body in the tropics, flats are altogether unsuitable, even if well planned, for single no loss than trip , as for married people. Most of the buildings in Eabaul, particuinlarly those of the administration, are in a more state of abject decay. The effect is extremely depressing and harmful to the moral tone of the community, and also lowers the national of prestige in the eyes of the natives and Asiatics, who, accordingly, we have reason for believing, place us ou a much lower plane than the Germans. The houses, however, of certain high officials officia l in are well and truly cared for. Admittedly, the task before the Administrator is big and complex. A cheap man is worse than useless. Knowledge, high administrative ability, strong personality, and tact should be with the liis. chief characteristics. General Griffiths is a man who is respected, for and commands confidence in the Territory. General Rosenthal, who is a Sydney architect, £2,000 would also be highly acceptable. The control of the Expropriation Board by to the Administrator, and the consequent benefit financially and generally, would be possible if a master mind, m every sense of the word, is now in. The were to control affairs. I say, deliberately, that until such a man is appointed no alleviation of the conditions outlined, and a reform leading to commercial progress and financial stability, is possible, or is to.be hoped for. The statements of those gentlemen made with no other motive than that of patriotism to the Territory, and to Australia. I could read other opinions, but time will not permit. letters arc sumcient to show that there is a strong desire for the appointment royal comniission to correct things are not right at present. The opinions given are those of persons who are qualified to speak. I also wish to quote from ii letter written by Mr B. W. honorary secretary of the Civil Association of Rabaul. clearly that things are not in New Guinea from the point of view of the Public Servioe generally. copy of this letter to each member of the parliamentary delegation, members of that delegation had neither authority nor power to make any investigation into the matters The officials of the Territory, as a matter of fact, were frightened to be seen speaking with the members of the delegation, for they knew very well that if anything happened as the result of their superior officers would get rid of them at first opportunity. It is of no nse to suggest that the high officials there are any different from high officials elsewhere. If one of the rank and file of the Service gave information which reflected upon his superiors he would be a marked man. But if a royal commission were appointed members of the staff would not bo afraid to tell the truth on oath, for they would know that they would be protected, and have no fear of victimization. them said to me, "" If we gave evidence to a royal commission, we would have to speak the truth, because we would be on oath, and a royal commission would have power to deal with the Administrator any one else who attempted to victimize us. Given the protection afforded by a royal commission we should be quite prepared to give evidence.""",41

113,Mr FORDE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Before the tea adjournment I was appealing to the Government on non-party lines to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the administration of New Guinea. I have submitted this motion for the appointment of a royal commission in no party spirit, but because I believe it proposes the only satisfactory way in which to investigate wore the many grievances of which we hear from time to time from members of the Public Service and private individuals in similar the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. These If we are content merely to accept the denial of the Administrator, who is the of a accused person, to the charges that are that made, we shall be lacking in our duty. I contend, not that all the charges which have been made are true, but that they should be investigated by a royal comShcraian, mission. I have read statements, not Service only from Mr Begley and men in the He shows Public Service, but also from others, and right investigation by a royal commission is necessary to clear the atmosphere. The He sent a appointment of a royal commission would show the Assembly of the League of Nabut the tions that when rumours are current, and accusations are made, this Parliament is prepared to appoint a body clothed mentioned. with ample power to carry out all necessary investigations. In my view there is greater justification for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the administration of New Guinea than, for disclosures instance, there was for the appointment of the Navigation Commission at the in stigation of certain persons who desired to submit evidence to break down our navigation laws. Royal commissions have been appointed in connection with many other matters that were not so important as this.",42
114,Mr ATKINSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Would the honourable member say what he considers the scope of the proposed royal commission's inquiry should be? Some of Mr Forde - The commission should have all the powers that are usually given to a royal commission. It should be able to subpoena witnesses and take evidence on oath. It should investigate not only the administration of the Mandated Territory, or but also the management of the Expropriation Board. Honourable members on the other side, as well as on this side of the House, have received letters from individuals in the Territory, making serious complaints, and asking for an investigation into them. I wish <o assure the Prime Minister that in bringing this matter before the House I do so, not in order, to damage Australia, but to vindicate its good name. Serious allegations have been made against the administrawho tion of this territory, controlled by the . Commonwealth under a mandate of the enmity League of Nations. They can only be Administration probed by a royal commission having the power to subpoena witnesses and take evidence on oath. I believe that Austrapress lians have done a great deal to develop the Mandated Territory, and are making a better job of the task than could bo expected of inexperienced men from any partment Other country. A ny people taking over the administration of a Territory like New Guinea must for some time, and until they have gained experience, expect to tendency make mistakes, but when definite charges Administrator are made against our administration of of this Territory, a royal commission should be appointed to inquire into them. PerThe sons have been sent up to' the Territory to make inquiries, but they have not been invested with the power to subpoena witDirector nesses, aud as a consequence men who partment could give evidence have kept their eviplied, dence to themselves in order to retain their jobs. In other instances leged that arrangements were made for certain individuals with favourable inforsenior mation to give evidence to whitewash the Administration . I am not submitting new this motion only because of the stateAdministrator. ments which Mr Begley has made. I do not know whether all these statements arc quite accurate. But I do know that cally everybody I spoke to stated that Begley was an honest, reliable man. All I ask junior is that his statements and the statements of others should be thoroughly inquired .of . something into. I ask the Prime Minister not to adopt the attitude of the Minister for Home and Territories who, in another place, merely read a statement dealing conclusive with statements which appeared in a Sydney newspaper. I do not intend who to comment upon those statements, but I say that they should be inquired into, we and justice should be done. the following extract from a letter by M B. W. Sherman, which was handed to actions the parliamentary delegation on the occajustice. sion of their visit to the Territory in September. He saysTn Australia iherc is a Parliament, press, in(lenpivleiifc people, and an articulate public opinion. Here tliere is no press, few independent people, and public opinion is riot articulate. It must bc remembered that the Government and Board officials, who are the majority of the European residents, are dependent Governinent. The planters, traders, and Mr Forde. receive their licences and leases from the Administration are in the position that the of the Administration may at least cause serious inconvenience. The powers of the are vested in the Administrator, and to all purposes there is no appeal from him. . . He is free from the check which a and articulate public opinion would place on his actions. . . Hundreds of returned men and other Europeans, and thousands of natives, are under the unsupervised control of the Administrator. The unsupported word of the Administrator is accepted as suflicient by the Dein Melbourne. . . His Honour has had no training in civil administration work, and his military career, brilliant as it was. would only tend towards despotism. This has caused great unrest iii the Service, and has, in our opinion, tended to make the less liable to listen to the advice the technical advisers but to overrule them, as was done in the case of building the flats at the Treasury, and the boats recently built. . . . flats are considered by the Service as the last resort to which they may be compelled to go to for accommodation, and when the then of Public Health held that all plans should be submitted to the Public Health Defor approval, the Administrator rein writing, to the effect that the greater included the less, and therefore his approval it is alwas suflicient. . . . The position is that the civil servants, both and junior, are absolutely dependent on the Administrator, who is as yet comparatively to the work given him. . . . Senior married omcers are still more dependent on the If a man incurs the dislike of the Administrator, the man and his family can be shut out by the Administrator from practiall the social life of the Territory. In this way the senior married officers are even more dependent on the Administrator than officials. In the office and social life the Administrator can exercise n despotic authority. . Every one, although to a man in favour being done, is afraid to take any action, fearing the kick back from the Administrator. . . . The letter of the R.S. & S.I.L. of Australia to the Administrator and his reply speak for themselves. We say this is of the general opinion that'the Administratoris a man who will victimize those differ from or go against him. Given nn inquiry, when evidence can be taken on oath, can prove what we say. . . . We say that, the power given to the Administrator has heen I make exercised in such a way that members of the r . Servico have in the past dared not object to which, in their opinions are a gross inThe Association are of opinion that the two and a half years' of civil administration have shown1. That the Administrator is unfitted hy want of training to exercise powers given to him. 2. Tliat in the opinion of this Association his word cannot be trusted, and that he is not impartial a.nd allows personal animosity to influence him. on the If that statement is true, what chance others is there that a man making an ordinary i u q u i r y would bo able to secure evidence against the A d m in is t r at o r ? It is for this reason that I ask for the a p p o in t m e n t of a r o y a l commission. Mr Sherman's letter continuesMembers linvc, at tliree general meetings this year, expressed this opinion. . . . Individual members .dare not give evidence under present conditions for fear of victimization. . . . We make a charge and call witnesses. The matter is then referred to the Administrator, wno makes a statement we do not see, and on which we cannot cross-examine him, and on his own statement he is judged. As we have no faith in tlic impartiality of the Administrator, members do not feel that, under existing conditions, they would receive fair treatment, and that later they would suil'er by bringing forward what the Department in Melbourne, on the word of the Administrator, regards as a false charge. must be remembered that members of the Service do not see the remarks the Adminstrator sends to the Minister. Eight months ago seventy-one members of this association, at which the majority of the permanent heads and senior omcers were present, decided by secret ballot, without dissent, to ask for an inquiry into the causes of the discontent widespread throughout all ranks of the Service, and the meeting stressed the fact that the members were of opinion that the attitude of the Administrator to the Service was one of the main causes of the discontent, and asked for an inquiry by an outside person. . . . . . . After articles appeared in a Sydney paper in Juno to the effect that practically every civil servant had a grievance, the Department, after submitting the matter to the Administrator, say, in the face of the motion passed by 71 members and the statements in the Sydney press, that the discontent is not widespread. The action of the Department has made it impossible to get members to allow their names to be used. The letter is a lengthy one and deals with various matters but concludes in these termsI n conclusion, we wish to emphasize(o) Our just desire for an independent inquiry into all matters affecting the Service, such inquiry to take evidence on oath. (6) That the lack of previous training, together with the tendency towards militarism, unfits the Administrator for such a big position, this being particularly shown by(1) His favouritism towards his (2) His disregard of the Service in (3) His failure to obtain and carry (4) His despotic interpretation of the Ucgulations as particularly shown in his payment of overtime in some cases, and his refusal to do so in equally justifiable cases. (5) His disregard of the best interests of the Service in making appointments, regardless of the tack of experience and training of the officers so appointed. (6) His failure to take the advice of his high officials qualified to give sucli advice. That is not a letter from one who was dismissed from the service in N e w Guinea. Mr Begley does not appear in connection with it at all . It is It from Mr B . W . Sherman, secretary of the P u b l i c Service Association at R a b a u l , and the statements made in it demand the full e s t in v e s t i g at i o n. I asked the A d m in is t r at o r for the file concerning one case, but he said that he h a d no a u t h o r it y to give it to m e. The c o m p l a i nt from the P u b l i c Service Associat i o n was sent to the Minister , and in the course of the reply it was stated, in t e r aliaW i th regard to the request of members of the deputation at Eabaul that an inquiry be made into General Wisdom's administration of the Territory, I am of opinion that justification for such an inquiry has not been established, and it is not, therefore, proposed to take any action in the direction indicated. The A d m in is t r at o r was asked to report on these matters, and on h is w o r d no in q u i r y was granted.

S. & S. I . League held on the 25th instant the following resolution was unanimously carried :"" That this meeting of returned men desire to express tlieir dissatisfaction with the attempt to install Asiatics in competition with returned men on trading stations."" That shows that the complaints cannot he classed as anti-Australian propaganda. These men are returned soldiers, who fought for the Empire, and who have the interests of Australia and of New Guinea at heart. They consider that they have - a grievance. The letter continuesA Chinese hotel keeper-So o 1'ong-ha s made several contracts with Asiatics whereby the hitter are to conduct these trading stations under a licence taken out in the name of Burns, Philp, k Co. Ltd. It is significant that this 'Chinese (Soo Tong) himself and not this Company's representative actually negotiated with the Kanaka to secure the latter's con-sent necessary for the allotment leases in question. The native was actually questioned by two members of the local Branch uf the League, who found that the native did not know ""or recognize Burns, Philp, & Co. in the matter, but Soo Tong only. Furthermore; there is no relation of employment between the Chinese actually operating these stations and Soo Tong, much less between them nnd Burns, Philp, & Co. Ltd. The Chinese in quostion state that they paid Soo Tong foT their trading licences, &c, and that Soo Tong was to advance tbem an instalment of trade goods on credit to enable them to make a start. A ll copra bags were to .be branded "" BP "" and delivered to Soo Tong, who would then continue to advance trade goods as a sot-off against copra. Here, again, it is obvious that these Chinese look to Soo Tong - whateve r their real relation to him may be deemed to be. What Soo Tong's actual"" terms are with Burns, Philp, & Co. cannot be stated yet with certainty, but it is reasonably sure that Soo Tong is acting virtually as a commission agent -{ill copra being ultimately Burns, Philp, & Co.'s representative here. In short, we contend thai) this firm, whose name is being used to secure trading sites and licences, are practically subletting to Asiatics. Of course, were this attempted directly it would obviously be illegal. It may be apposite to hero mention that as this firm is in receipt of a subsidy of some £55,000 from the Australian Government for carriage of mails between Australia and this Territory, and have a virtual monopoly of freights, fares, &c., the Federal Government should be able to exercise some measure of control over this Company, especially as the experience of certain returned men who are making a bona fide attempt to settle in this District goes to show Mr Forde. that this firm through its agents are not favourable to returned men settlers generally. Other instances of the Government's intention being frustrated are the issue of three licences direct to Asiatics in their own name in this district. At one time all the trading licences were issued to Chinese, but the returned soldiers made representations to the Federal Government, and it was then decided that after the 30th June, 1923, all the licences should be granted to them. They have since complained that Burns, Philp, and Company, through Soo Tong, engaged Chinese to compete unfairly with them. That is another phase of the discontent that exists. I shall not reiterate the complaints which appeared in a Sydney newspaper, and which have already been referred to. The Government knows all Mr Begley's charges. I have not the time to repeat them. It is not my desire that Australia's name shaU be discredited before the members of the League of Nations. My sole purpose is to obtain a royal commission tcinvestigate these charges. An effort was made by the Home and Territories Department to discredit Mr Begley, who made certain statements. I have evidence to prove that Mr Begley is a sane, honororable person. It may be wise for me to quote other gentlemen's statements on this occasion. Here is a letter from Mr H . E . A . Cameron, the medical assistant at the Longan General Hospital, Bahmatt Island, Ninigo Group",42
115,Mr MAKIN,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,A very capable officer.,45
116,Mr FORDE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Yes . Mr Cameron statesDuring the last two years 1I have seen both free Kanakas and indentured labour brutally treated by some overseers both at Witu and Ninigo Group. At Witu I felt it my duty to report, in confidence, one or two eases to the late D.O. of Talasea, Col. Neligan, and regret delivered to to say that that official told the overseers, with the result that I was in hot water with the overseers, ancl ealled a pimp. Eventually .1 asked to be moved from Witu, and was sent to Longan in charge of the General Hospital here, and during my eight months here I have met some awful cases of brutal treatment to natives, several cases having to be treated in Hospital. One boy haa been in Hospital IS!) days pending a Court case by the District Officer. This boy is still in Hospital. Only as late as January of this year, about the 14th, the boy Tatia was most brutally struck and knocked on the floor of the hospital, and his mouth made to bleed. Three or four days after this the same boy was struck across the face by his master. I do not say that the Administrator would condone that kind of thing. I do not think that he would, but he has to call for a report from the men who are responsible. NatvtralLy, they deny the charges, and make counter charges against the man who gives the information. man who gives information to the Administrator, or to any one in Australia, is branded by them as a "" pimp."" Every effort is made by the departmental officials to discredit every man who has the temerity to come to Australia and make known truths of which they do not approve. I have dwelt on none of the statements made by Mr Begley today, because they are already known to disclose serious charges of brutal treatment of native men and women. I have quoted statements from the Returned Soldiers' League, the Publio Service Association, and Mr Cameron. I shall now give a statement made by Mr Cardew, Commissioner for Natives, to the Administrator regarding the allegations made by Mr BegleyA boy, Daren, who was previously indentured to Patrol Officer Wilkin, and who is now returning to Buka "" finish time,"" substantiated the majority of Begley's statements when 1 spoke - to him in Eabaul. He also made a statement to me quite voluntarily as to certain affaire which occurred in the village of Burra Burra when he was present. Burra Burra was the native village which Begley said was burnt at the instigation of certain officials. Mr Cardew's statement continuesLeaving Kaewieng we proceeded, to Manus, where I served a warrant on an official on a charge of "" Carnally knowing a girl under the age of seventeen years."" On arrival at Matty the case was heard nnd the official was committed for triad at the Central Court, Rabaul, and the witnesses and interpreters were brought in on the Mataram. We next proceeded to Silio (Eitape), where Mr Begley, Medical Assistant, came off to see me. He made several charges against various officials, which are embodied in the Appendix hereto, but I told him I would only deal with them insofar as they concerned Native Affaire. He also desired meto examine certain witnesses, but I told liim I would lay his papers before the Administrator in Rabaul, and if I was so instructed I would institute an inquiry into Native Affairs of the Eitape District, when the boys he mentioned would bo thoroughly examined. If even a portion of Mr Begley's statements aire true the position seeins to call for a full and thorough inquiry. Mr Begley, I am told, was never asked to appear before a tribunal of enquiry on these charges. I desire now to deal with the statement, of the Prime Minister to the press in the early part of last month, referring to certain allegations made concerning the Administration. On that occasion the Prime Minister saidAny It will he remembered that at about this period last year there was a campaign of slander against the Administration of New Guinea, which occurring as it did, just prior to the annual meeting of the Permanent Mandates Commission, constituted under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, gave rise to the apparently well-founded suspicion that it was designed to prejudice Australia in the eyes of the .League. . . . It is, therefore, a most significant fact that tliere should he a recrudescence of this campaign just prior lo the forthcoming meeting of the Permanent Mandates Commission, which it is expected will be held about the end of the present month. I do not blame the Priine Minister personally, or say that he thinks that any thing said against the Territory or its administration is anti-Australian propaganda. The officials prepared the statement and always hide behind that charge when accusations are made.",45
117,Mr MAKIN,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,I was accused of that.,46
118,Mr FORDE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I am as good an Australian as any honourable member in this chamber, and would not willingly do anything to discredit Australia's name. My request for the appointment of a royal commission is to vindicate the honour of Australia. If any men are guilty of maladministration, they should be brought to book. Why should we allow these accusations to go unchallenged 1 The person responsible for the articles in the Sydney Daily Telegraph last year was Mr M . H . Ellis, whom I know personally. I have nothing to say against Mr Ellis except that he does not support the party to which I belong; but that is not a matter of much moment. He is a prominent Nationalist. In Queensland he was the publicity officer of the Nationalist party, and occupied the position of secretary to the Nationalist Leader of the Opposition. Afterwards he was secretary to the Country Party Leader. Subsequently he was appointed to the staff of the Sydney DaUy Telegraph, and was sent to New Guinea as a special commissioner. He made serious allegations against the administration there, and against the Expropriation Board. He was muck perturbed when b.is allegations were branded as anti-Australian propaganda, and interviewed the Prime Minister to explain that he had no desire to damage the name of Australia in any way. The Prime Minister recognized that that was so. Yet it is still stated that auy adverse comment on New Guinea is anti-Australian propaganda. This is what was published in the Age as a statement, from the Prime Minister regarding BegleyTlic Minister for Home and Territories has received a preliminary report from the. Administrator of New Guinea, which disclosed the fact that the person to whom the statements are attributed is no longer un officer of the New Guinea Service, having recently been permitted to resign from the service as an alternative to dismissal for discreditable conduct, the only reason for not taking the serious step of dismissal being that a medical report had raised a doubt as to Mr Begley's mental condition. He is greatly concerned about that, beresort to tactics of that kind. cause his friends had read that he is doubtful niental condition. In another place the Minister for Home and Territhese tories made the following statement:When the first of the articles containing the allegations by Begley appeared, a summary was communicated to the Administrator New Guinea by radiogram.

Begley states that on the evidence of two men who were dismissed from the Service certain accusations were made Mr Forde. him, but that there was no inquiry. He was given leave to December of this year and resigned of his own accord; he was not dismissed. The statements against his character were made by men concerning whom he had made serious Allegations which I shall not repeat, because those men have relatives in Australia. The Minister for Home and Territories read a plausible statement in the Senate in. the course of which he said that a deliberate attempt was being made by certain people to damage the credit of Australia. He quoted paragraphs from a Sydney newspaper and referred to a man named Murray , who was supposed to have corroborated something that Begley said, and added that M u r r a y had attempted to commit suicide. It was not M u r r a y but Armstrong, I am told, who said he could corroborate those statements. The M in i ster was only begging the question, and I feel sure that the Prime Minister will not Certain of other men, including Captain Thompson, were discredited in order to prove that allegations against the adminstration are faked. Mr Begley did not bring those men into it at all. Why try to discredit him if any of them have not got a of good record.

I have had exceptional opportunities of testing his mental condition as 1 served with The him on the public health staff in the Mandated Territory of the Near Pacific Islands in 1921, and saw him practically every day for at leastfour months. I have no hesitation in certifying that he is now and always has been a very appointment observant and careful officer, meticulously accurate in his work in hospital and in the field, n strict disciplinarian to those under his charge, sober, honourable, and honest in all 1 saw of him, and kindly and self-sacriticing in his attitude to the sick and suffering in his a holiday. capacity as chief of the hospital staff of orderlies, white and black, in the native hospital, Rabaul. In a l e t t e r w r it t e n to me, Dr O ' B r i e n the said I have John Begley was under my observation whilst on service with the Public Health Department in New Guinea. He was my chief white orderly in a small-pox scare in mid 1921, ana it was mainly through his personal efforts that the east coast of the Mandated Territories of New Guinea was vaccinated by hint under my instructions. He is, to my mind, a man to be - absolutely trusted. I found him a particularly careful officer, always sober, and meticulously careful in the many duties apportioned to him. I find I have here another statement from a person in N e w Guinea who worked with Begley, and knows him w e l l Begley is a good man with the natives. He stands for their protection, first, last, and all the time. You could not say that Mr Begley is insane. Any man away up the Sepik River, hundreds of miles from civilization for a long period without associating with whites is liable at times to become a little abnormal, but f have always found Mr Begley quite normal, intelligent, and sane.

An ex-employee of the T e r r it o r y named R . P .

At all times his ability was unquestioned, and he was well respected by all those with whom he eame in contact. He was of temperate habits, and quite normal. The letter continues in the same appreciative strain. As Mr Begley's are well known I have not dwelt on them today, but have confined myself to the statements by the Returned Soldiers League, the Public Service Association, H. E. A. Cameron, Cardew, and the testimonials which show that Begley was held in very high repute by medical officers. I have spoken to other medical offioers in the Territory, while corroborating the evidence I have read, arc not prepared names to be used lest their should bo prejudiced. I submit that I have made out a good case for the appointment of a royal commission. company with other members of this Parliament, went to New Guinea as a delegation, because we thought it right legislators for the Commonwealth controls that Territory should themselves with it and learn what is taking place there. But we had not the investigatory powers that would be enjoyed by a royal commission. that instead of allowing members to go to the Territory as tourists they should be given the responsibility and status of a royal commission to investigate these allegations. I do not say that they would find that all the allegations are true, but I am confident that a great in the administration of the would result. Mr Begley has been most unfairly treated.

120,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [8.42] - The honourable member for Capallegations ricornia (Mr Forde) has stated his case with moderation, and has shown a considerable appreciation of the grave and Sailors and serious responsibility that rests upon us in the Mandated Territories, Mr because of the fact that their administration has been entrusted to Australia by the nations of the world through the agency of the League of Nations. who, Whilst the Government cannot acquiesce in the appointment of a royal comto allow their mission, I appreciate the reasons which positions have caused the desire for such an investigation. But the honourable member, in presenting his case to the House, I, in overlooked a number of pertinent facts. Most of us are aware of the recent history of the Mandated Territories and the at that tacks which have been made upon Auswhich tralia's handling of the trust reposed in familiarize her by the League of Nations, and upon the administration of the expropriated properties. I shall remind the House of what has occurred during the period I suggest in which this mandate has been held by the Commonwealth, and I shall have a few words to say about the actual work done in New Guinea by the Australian Administration to show that the interest and welfare of the natives have been safeguarded in every improvement possible way. But, before doing that, I Territory would remind honourable members of some recent history. About twelve months ago numerous charges were made in the press unreliable, of Australia against the administration reof the Territory, which was accused of defamation ill-treating the natives. Those articles were full y discussed in this House on several occasions. Following upon the publication of the articles, I dealt very I am not f u l ly in this House with the charges made, for the Government is very jealous of Australia's honour in regard to the manner in which we are administering Australians the Territory. I delivered a very long speech on the subject, and I can well remember the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) asking, in the course of it , whether it was necessary to deal with all the As minor charges levelled against the administration. On the present occamore sion I do not intend to reply to all the charges that have been made. Many of those made twelve months ago were proved to be quite frivolous and unwarranted, but the Government selected those that were obviously of a character, and those that maltreatment of the native population, and made them the subject of a special inquiiy by Mr Canning. It is now suggested that his investigation was useless because the people who knew the facts, being apprehensive of what might happen tf* them if they stated the truth , did not come forward to give evidence.",49
121,Mr WATKINS,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,They had every justification for their fear.,50
122,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I ask the honourable member how the position would be materially altered by the appointment of a royal commission. We all understand what a royal commission is, and we know that witnesses who give evidence before one are protected. But the honourable m ember for Capricornia suggested that deliberate, if not overt, action would be taken against any one who gave evidence at Mr Canning's investigation, and, if that statement be true, I think that the same influences would operate in connection with any type of T do not agree with the honourable member's view that Mr Canning's investigation was not thorough, or that an opportunity was not given to every one to bring facts forward and state them publicly in the fullest possible manner. One person who was interested in the allegations contended that the scope of Mr Canning's inquiry was too wide, seeing that he was instructed not. mprely to investigate the charges that had been made, but also to ascertain whether there were grounds for any otlier charges. When that objection was made to me, my reply was that the Government, besides being concerned with the charges made in a newspaper or by an individual, had the great responsibility of ensuring that there should be no possibility of the maltreatment of natives. 1 said that we had to assure ourselves and satisfy the public conscience that nothing had been done to the detriment of the natives. The holding of an investigation by Mr Canning was the thing to provide for. Similar charges have again been made, and have been given wide publicity by one newspaper. They cover things that happened before the investigation by Mr Canning, and it was obviously open to Mr. Begley, who has made them, to state the facts at that inquiry, yet none of the allegations now made came to light at the inquiry. It was only after this gentleman serious had lef t the service that he proceeded to alleged make his accusations. One newspaper, just as happened twelve months ago, has published charges about the treatment of the natives, based on information f u r nished by one individual. I submit to the common sense of the House the question whether the Government could have done more, when charges had been made, than send to the Territory a special investigating magistrate with judicial training to hear evidence from any one who wished to put the facts before him? That inquiry having shown that the charges were unfounded, we cannot be expected to continue to appoint investigating magistrates or royal commissions every time a fresh charge is made. The Government is very anxious to ensure by every possible means that there shall be no ground for complaint against Australia of bad treatment of natives or maladministration of the Territory. I spoke of Mr . Begley in this House recently. I shall not now go into that matter again, parinquiry. ticularly as the honourable member who moved the motion has not pressed it , or dealt with the charges Mr Begley made; but even in view of the statements of the honourable member about the effect of living far from civilization, as Mr . Begley has done on many occasions, the charges made by him are not such as to justify immediate action in holding another inquiry. I hope that the honourable member, who has been so sincere in bringing the subject forward, will not think that I am brushing it lightly aside, but I wish to bring under his uotice one fact that seems to render the appointment of a royal commission at this time quite unnecessary. A f t e r the discussion in this House last year, and because of the desire of the Government to remove any possible doubt that might exist, a cablegram was sent to the British Government asking.it to make available to us the services of an officer - with a life-long training in the handling proper of native populations. The British Government responded to the reouest and made available to us the services of Colonel Ainsworth, who is at present in the Territory, and will short.lv return to Melbourne to prepare his renort to the Government on the statp of the administration. Until we have received that report it would be premature to appoint a royal commission. Colonel Ainsworth is a very experienced oflicer.",50
123,Mr WATKINS,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Is he dealing with the natives only?,51
124,Mr BEUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"He is inquiring into the work of the administration only, but not into the management of the expropriated properties. There is frequently a confusion of the ordinary administration of the Territory and the administration of the expropriated properties. They are two entirely different things. To a great extent the honourable member for Capricornia dealt with the ordinary administration of the Territory, and that is what I am speaking of now. This borrowed officer has been in the mandated territories for some time. He received instructions to make an impartial investigation of the administration, and to report full y and frankly to the Government. We have given him thei widest possible powers; he can inquire in any direction he desires, and can obtain all the informatio n he can possibly need in order to form a sound judgment upon the way in which Australia is discharging its trust. We must wait u n t i l we get that report; but I can assure the honourable member that if there is any indication of anything warranting the appointment of a royal commission to conduct a further investigation, or any suggestion that something more ought to be done to promote the welfare of the natives or to administer the Territory better, the Government will not hesitate to do what is required. It appears to the Government that at this moment it would be premature to appoint a royal comniission. We base that decision upon a wide survey of the situation. Improvements may be desirable in matters regarding which no charges have been made. I appeal to the House to await Colonel Ainsworth's report, and I suggest to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), that he will have other opportunities during the session to bring forward matters that, in his opiuinn. require further consideration. The Government cannot agree to appoint a royal commission at this moment. The honourable member has referred to the Administrator, whom he has described as "" autocratic."" He said that the Administrator's military career had unfitted him for the position which he occupies. The honourable member has somewhat changed his views on that subject. I remind him of what he said when he returned from New Guinea when the administration of the Territory was fresh in his mind. He said then that what was really preventing the proper administration of the Territory was that it was completely in the hands of a bureaucracy in Melbourne. He pointed out that when the Germans administered it , the Governor had almost complete and absolute control, being unfettered and unhampered, and he seemed to suggest that Australia should conduct its administration in the same way. To-day, he says that the Administrator has too much power, which he is exercising autocratically.",51
125,Mr FORDE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,I was merely reading thai opinion of the secretary to the Public Service Association.,51
126,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"The honourable member had previously referred to the communication he had received from the Public Service Association in New Guinea, but I understood from his speech this evening that he was endorsing what the association had said. Perhaps I was wroncr. Possibly the honourable member still holds the view that the administration is strangled by the bureaucracy in Melbourne. The honourable member appears to have adopted two different attitudes, or else, having quoted the communication he received from the Public Service Association at Rabaul, he totally dissociates himself from the statements contained in it . At all events, he did not make his position quite clear. But I do not wish to stress any minor point of that character; I merely desire to state plainly the attitude of the Government in regard to the administration. The Government recognizes the responsibility for placing the administration on the best possible basis. It has not hesitated to admit the great difficulties in the way of establishing a service for the administration of a native territory, seeing that Australia has never previously had such a task entrusted to it . Steps had not been taken to train a civil service with the necessary qualifications for handling a native population. But on the evidence that the Government has before it-and I was glad to hear the honourable member for Capricornia endorse this view-it must be admitted that, under most difficult circumstances. and with no trained personnel, the administration has, on the whole, been creditable to Australia; for great initiative in coping with a new and difiicult. problem has been displayed. we think that Ave liave done well, yet, when charges are made that something improper has been done, or that the administration has not been of the high standard we desire, we have taken steps to ascertain the facts, so that, if possible, the administration may be improved. WQ not only sent Mr Canning to the Territory to omciai inquiry, but we gave opportunity to any honourable member of the House to go to New Guinea and make himself familiar with the conditions there. Further, we requested British Government to lend us one of its most able administrators, who was experienced in dealing with native population?. We expect, shortly, to receive his report, but u n t i l it comes to hand we do not intend to appoint a royal commission. If , after that report has been received, it is thought that the appointment of a royal commission is desirable, the Government will not hesitate to take the necessary action. The expropriated properties present an entirely different problem. The allegation was made that these properties were being mismanaged, and that Australia was incurring great responsibility by the manner in which it was allowing them to deteriorate. were made that action should be taken to ascertain the true state of affairs. Upon those representations the Government appointed a firm of auditors in Sydney, Messrs Yarwood, Vane and Company, to make an investigation of the matter, and I think that honourable members will admit that uo firm of accountants has a higher standing in Australia than that selected for the work.",51
127,Mr FORDE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,It had no power to quire into the administration.,52
128,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Of course, the firm was appointed only to investigate the management of the expropriated properties. Associated with it was an expert in tropical agriculture, who accompanied the representative of the firm to New Guinea. Honourable members have had an opportunity of perusing the report presented, and no one who has carefully studied it will deny that, according to the opinion nf this firm, the manner in which the properties have been administered is, on the whole, quite as satisfactory as could Although have been hoped for in the exceptional circumstances. Certain suggestions were made in the report as to what should be done in future, and if these representations were acted upon the expenditure of a large sum of money would bo incurred. Whether or not these suggestions should be adopted is a question for consideration by Parliament at a later date. I conduct an refer to that report at the present juncan ture merely to indicate that everything possible has been done by the Government to determine whether the expropriated properties are being properly adthe ministered, and whether any action should be taken to improve the manner in which they are handled. No useful work could be done by appointing a royal commission to inquire into the administration of those properties. I know that certain honourable members have views concerning the way in which the expropriation was carried out and the treatment of the people from whom the properties were expropriated, but that is not the matter that has been dealt with by the honourable member for Capricornia. I can only say regarding it that the fullest investigation has already taken place. Most of the disputes with the former German owners were settled some time ago. Nine months ago'I asked how many cases Representations were outstanding, and a special board was appointed to dispose of them. There can be no doubt that the fullest consideration was given to those cases, and a reasonable measure of promptitude was shown by the Government in clearing up a position that had existed for some years by the appointment of the board about October of last year. In view of the report that the Government has just received from Messrs. Yarwood, in- Vane and Company making definite recommendations as to what should be done, we feel that there is nothing that would warrant the appointment of a royal commission to consider the care and development of the properties. I do not think any honourable member would suggest that such a commission should be sent to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea to ascertain whether even-handed justice has been meted out to the persons from whom the properties were expropriated. It is always possible to make representations in regard to individual cases. If it can be shown that anythiug in the nature of injustice has been done in any case, the Government is quite prepared to reconsider it and determine whether any further action should be taken. I have mentioned the only possible way in which the question of the administration of the New Guinea Territory can for the moment be approached, and the only reasons on which the appointment of a royal commission could be justified. As today is set apart for the ventilation of grievances, I do not propose to dwell on the subject to anything like the extent I should like to do, but it is well to remember what has beeu done by the administration for the betterment of the condition of the natives and for the general welfare of the Territory. Honourable members should read the reports prepared year by year for the information of the mandates commission of the League of Nations. These reports show at great length exactly what is being done there, and they indicate a record of considerable achievement, for they show that the condition of the natives has been considerably improved. At the very most, all that has been alleged, even by the severest critic of the administration, whether he has written newspaper' articles or has given the information upon which newspaper articles have been based, is that in individual cases certain things have been done, and individuals concerned in the administration have been guilty of conduct, which nobody would suggest for a moment any Government of Australia would endorse. All that has been alleged by any of the critics is that in tain instances excesses have been permitted and injustices perpetrated against the natives. If such charges can be established it is essential that a full quiry shall take place. ""We should member that the administration visits heavy punishment upon any member of the service who is convicted of acting as has been alleged. But we should not allow onr judgment of the way a great task is being performed in the Territory to be prejudiced by such charges as have been made. Even if some of them were proved to be well founded, it Mr Bruce. would not offset all that stands on the credit side in the improvement of the health, education, and general welfare of the native population of New Guinea. I ask honourable gentlemen, when dealing with this question, to consider the importance of their remarks. If they feel compelled to speak of improper things that aTe alleged to have taken place, or to be taking place, I trust that they will remember to give credit to the administration for the very great service that has been rendered to the native population since Australia took charge of New Guinea.",52
129,Mr WATKINS,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,".Newcastle) [9.16] I had occasion, last year to refer to the matters which have been dealt with by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), and it is not necessary for me to go into the subject again in detail. I do not say for one moment that all is wrong in Now Guinea, but honourable members on both sides of this House continually receive information which proves that all is not well there. It is because they recognize that Australia has a big task in administering the territory that they exhibit diffidence in making disclosures which may besmirch her fair name. I know nothing about the affairs of Mr Begley, but I am in a position to say that the reason why the local residents are not prepared to come forward nnd make definite charges in. respect to maladministration is that something serious happens to every one who dare? to do so. Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON' - Would not that happen even if a royal comniission wer<* appointed ?",53
130,Mr WATKINS,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"It is time that the cer- Government took steps to protect people who give such information. ' When I was in the Mandated Territory the president of the Returned Soldiers' Associain- tion boarded our steamer at the Island re- of Manus and asked me to receive a small deputation of two returned, men who had some complaints they wished to make to the authorities. I was not looking for trouble, and I asked one of the officers of the Expropriation Board to go with me. He said that he was too busy to do so. There happened to be a young officer on board who had not ceased to drum into my ears praises of the Expropriation Board. He wae ashore. The two meu made the ordinary complaints respecting livin g conditions, the necessity for mosquito doors, and so on. Soon (after they began to speak the young officer commenced to interject, although he had nothing whatever to do with the matter. I asked the deputation to put. their complaints i u writing, which they did. It is significant that in consequence otf in formation given to the authorities by the young officer, one of the members of that deputation was sent south in the boat that followed the one I was on. things like that happen, people cannot be expected to give information. Subsequently I asked the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) for the papers in the case, ancl they were placed on the library table. Air. Ellis, whose name has been mentioned in this discussion, was in Melbourne at that time. He was present at the deputation. I asked, him whether some of the statements that that young officer alleged that the returned soldier had made to me had really been made by him, and Mr Ellis said that they had not. It is of little use for the Governinent to send Mr Canning, or any body else, to New Guinea to make inquiries unless protection is given to the people who give information. I wish now to bring a matter under the notice of the Minister for Defence. Some little time ago I asked him why the Navy Department had given increased orders for coal from Wales for the use of our navy. is well known that small quantities of coal were imported in years gone by, and placed at certain points on the coast as a reserve for war purposes, but lately a tremendous quantity has been landed right at Newcastle, the home of the Australian coal industry. The Minister said that this coal was for war reserves. When I was in Newcastle last week-end I ascertained that that coal had cost £2 12s. per ton landed in Newcastle, and that after having been dumped there it was reshipped in the Biloela and taken away north, where our vessels were cruising, It can hardly be argued, therefore, that it was for war reserves. When the French naval vessels were cruising in Australian waters they used Australian coal, and so did the vessels of the American Navy. If our coal was good enough for them it surely ought to be good enough for our own navy. There is no need whatever to bring coal from the other side of the world for naval purposes. I would like to know who lied to the Minister by telling him that this coal was for war reserves. There must have been some lying, for the coal was used in ordinary cruising. Many mines in^ the Newcastle district are unable to obtain suflicient trade to maintain full production, and it is ridiculous that coal should be imported. The Navy Department should be compelled to use AusWhen tralian coal. It is scandalous that the importation of Welsh coal at a cost of £2 12s. a ton should be permitted when an . equally good article is obtainable locally at a lower price. I ' do not know what this coal cost after reshipment to Thursday Island and other places. The practice of importing coal should be stopped, and I assure the M in ister that I shall not rest u n t i l the right thing is done, and our navy is compelled to use Australian coal. It should not be allowed to waste the people's money and do in j u r y to our local industry by i m porting coal.",53
131,Mr BOWDEN,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Parramatta-Minister for Defence) [9.26] - The Welsh coal to which the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) has referred was not used by the Royal Australian Navy ships on its northern cruise. I repeat what I told hi m before, that not one ton It pf Welsh coal was used in our boats on that cruise. Australian coal was used. The only shipment of coal taken from the reserve stocks was taken at the request of the Admiralty, and was for an A d miralty ship which is at present in Australian waters. Our arrangement with the Admiralt y is that while vessels of the Royal Navy are in Australian waters the requisitions of the captains of those vessels shall be honoured. This particular vessel had been using New Zealand coal from Westport, but the officer in command reported to the Admiralt y that it was not suitable to the vessel's f u r naces. The Admiralt y thereupon requisitioned 200 tons of Welsh coal on a repayment basis for its own vessel. We had no control over that vessel, and had to honour the Admiralt y requisition. The only other parcel of Welsh coal that has been taken from reserves was a few tons that was brought down to Flinders Naval Base for testing |>urposes. It is being tested to ascertain whether there has been any depreciation. As a matter of fact, the Royal Australian Navy vessels on their northern cruise tried Queensland coal, which they shipped in Brisbane, and the results, I understand, were very good. It is proposed later to pick up more Queensland coal at Gladstone. The ""Welsh coal is purely and simply a reserve for war jrarposes, and is provided because it gives Canning inquiry. 2 or 3 knots an hour more steaming power than the best Australian coal. Welsh coal has not been, and will not be, used in the Australian Navy for ordinary peace services.",54
132,Mr NELSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Northern Territory ) [9.30] - I applaud the honourable meinber for Capricornia. (Mr Forde) for bringing forward this matter to-night. I feel very keenly for the people in New Guinea, because I have lived for twelve or fourteen years under a similar system of administration. I was surprised that the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) did not have something to say in connection with the statements touching the sanity of Mr Begley he previously made, and which were refuted by the honourable member for Capricornia. Doubt as to the sanity of Mr Begley was assumed by the Prime Minister here, and by the Minister for Home aud Territories in another chamber, as sufficient reason to dismiss his allegations. Yet we now learn that the finest mental specialists we have i u Australia have certified that Mr Begley is not sane, and we have had no apology from the Prime Minister for what he said on the subject. This matter is in itself a sufficient justification for the appointment of a royal commission. Having had experience of a similar system of administration, I know what can be exoected under the present regime in New Guinea. We heard a lot to-night about the Canning inquiry. I have known of similar inquiries in the Northern Territory. Coiinmissioois on all fours with the Canning commission have been sent to the Northern Territory, and as soon as the commissioner arrived he lived with the Administrator. When his inquiry was over for the day he went, driving with the Administrator, and his environment from the time he came u n t i l he went away from the territory was conducive to findings by him desired by the Administration. The sending of any commission to New Guinea that is not vested with the full powers of a royal commission will only be followed by similar results. The Prime Minister laboured the statement that, although he made charges, Mr Begley did not come forward to substantiate them at the As a matter of fact, he was 100 miles up the river, and it was not possible for him to attend the inquiry. I have had past experience of this very old trick in connection with all sorts of inquiries into matters of administration. I have known of repeated instances where responsible officers who were material witnesses in an inquiry were at the psychological moment sent to places far away from where the inquiry was being held. In connection, again, with the question of Begley's sanity or insanity, I may sav that for many years in the Northern Terri tory there was but one doctor in control of medical affairs. He could certify that any man in the territory was insane, and could have him nut into an asylum and kept there. Similar conditions appear to have prevailed in New Guinea, and it is highly improper that members of the medical fraternity should be used in any such manner. Cases have arisen in which junior officers have been called upon to adjudicate on matters by which their seniors were affected. In such cases the junior officer may be quite in - honest, but he has to consider his job. He knows that if he gives a ruling adverse to his senior officer, his tenure of his own office will be very short indeed. With reference to the statement that these charges are always fomented on the eve of a sitting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, I ask whether it is not infinitely preferable that Australia should clear these things up itself than that it should receive an order from the League of Nations to do so. These matters are being taken up by English journalists and ventilated in the English press. On that ground alone it is essential that we should go into them thoroughly. 0,uite independently of the statements submitted by the honourable member for Capricornia. I can give the House some idea of numerous letters I have been receiving from, most reliable sources, dealing with affairs in New Guinea. I do not intend to read the letters in detail, but the charges which are made in tliose letters against magistrates during the last twelve months include rape, connection with girls under the age of twelve years, forced labour, 'or blackbirding. These charges are being taken up, as I have said, by English journalists, and they are made by persons who are in a position to know what is taking place. This should be suflicient to induce the Government to clean up its house before it is compelled to do so by the League of Nations. According to my correspondent, in one district alone, serious charges arc made against district officers, deputy district officers, two patrol officers, and a medical assistant. The district officers are magistrates, and it is stated that, up to a few months ago, they could imprison a white man for life, and even now they have the right, without appeal, to inflict upon a native any punishment but death. Serious charges are laid against these men, but, in some mysterious manner, they invariably evade any t r i a l. Legal advice given on these matters has been ignored, and meu untrained in the legal profession have adjudicated on several cases. It is said that Wisdom, the Administrator, will make the excuse that the officers sent to him were incompetent. Most of the officers had no previous training in administration, but they were jumped over the heads of men with 20, 30, and 40 years' experience of civil administration. It should be borne in mind that for three or four years the whole of the staff of the Administrator occupied more or less temporary positions. D u r in g that period, had the Administrator known his work, he could have weeded out those who were unsuitable, and might have made application to the Home and Territories Department for officers better qualified for the work. But I think I can show the House that it was a case of kissing going by favonr, and qualification for the position was quite secondary to the friendship of the A,d mini strator. Most of the officers who were made permanent on the recommendation of the Administrator in 1923 were the very men who were charged with committing serious offences. A fte r all, Wisdom himself has had no great experience in administration. He was an hotel-keeper in Western Australia, and though it does not necessarily follow that he was a bad man, or unfitted to be A d ministrator, we look usually for men with some administrative experience to tackle such a job as his. It is claimed by those who are in a position to know that he had neither the training nor the education to f it him for the position of Administrator. According to my correspondent, what may be said of Wisdom in this respect is even more noticeable in the case of some of his officers. He saysWhen the people of Australia hear of the cruel doings in Rabaul, they will shudder. Wisdom has no experience or system of training his staff. He has done nothing, because he did not know how to do it. There is one case which I wish to bring before the House to show the partiality with which the administration is conducted in New Guinea. Some months ago a boy named Luxmore was convicted on a charge of stealing, and sentenced to three months imprisonment. By a requisition from the people the Administrator was asked to remit a part of the sentence because of the youth of the offender. He refused to do so. To show the impartialit y of my correspondents, I may add that, in connection with this matter, they sayThe Administrator acted quite rightly in not remitting the sentence because it was suitable to the offence. A month or two later a man named Dyson Hoare was convicted of receiving the goods stolen by Luxmore, and he was sentenced by the chief judge to imprisonment for three months. The judge severely commented upon the conduct of Hoare in putting all the blame on the boy, and he said that Hoare was the ringleader in the business. This man Hoare was married in Administrator Wisdom's house. His wife was an intimate friend of Wisdom's, as were Hoare's father and mother. Hoare's brother-in-law. Grose, now Superintendent of Police, was also an intimate friend of Wisdom's, and was Acting Government Secretary for twelve months. The sentence passed, upon Dyson Hoare was remitted by the Administrator without consulting the Crown Law officers. Here, a youth was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and compelled to serve the whole term of his sentence, yet the man who, according to the judge's statement, was practically responsible for his offence, was reprieved by the Administrator without consultation with his responsible legal advisers. That shows the manner in which administration ried out at Rabaul. I should like to know wliether the judge who tried Hoare or the Grown Law officers were asked for their comments on the proposed release, and what is the relation of Hoare to the Superintendent of Police. at a conference between the trator and the Civil Service it was pointed out to him that the conduct of some o£ the officials was bringing discredit on the Service. association asked for stricter The heads of departments and senior officers found it impossible to get rid of certain offenders simply because those men were under the wing of the tor, and, like the great kings, could do no wrong. The officers who were bringing discredit upon the administration known to the Administrator, sheaves of letters on the were forwarded to him Public Service Association Returned Soldiers' Association ing the statements I am In March, 1923, the association placed before the Prime Minister the views of the senior officers, when they stated that the methods of control, and the incompetence of the. Government Secretary, had ruined their authority. That was before those scathing articles appeared in the press. I ask the Prime Minister to produce a letter, dated 12th April, 1923, from the Civil Service Association of Rabaul, addressed to the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department. That letter, which has been ignored by the department, tained a warning that things were falling to pieces, and that the end was not far of f . I have had experience of these things, as for many years a similar state of affairs existed in the Northern Territory. happened in the Northern Territory will happen in Rabaul, and Parliament be responsible. The reason for the trouble is that these people are not given an opportunity to clear things up. We have been told that when commissions were appointed evidence could not be obtained. From personal experience, and from letters I have received, I know that officials are quit© willing to give the most llr. Nelson. damning evidence against the present administration, if protected by the powers of a royal comniission. But to send a man there, and to ask those offioers to volunteer evidence, and then to leave them to is car- the tender mercies of those against whom they have given that evidence, is asking too much of them. What happened to Dr Jensen, and to the Chief Protector of Aborigines? As soon as the inquiries were over their positions were In 1923, abolished. Dozens of similar cases could Adminis- be quoted. But when a royal commission Association, was appointed, the judge made it clear that there was to be no victimization. The result was that whereas the previous comThe missioners returned with a negative report, the royal commission brought back discipline. an affirmative one; in fact the judge, who eame from Tasmania, said that if the things which were happening in the Northern Territory had happened in Administra- Tasmania there would have been a revolution within ten minutes. That will be the outcome of the present were administration n Rabaul. I want to em; because phasize the fact that Grose was a personal subject friend of Wisdom, and was made Governby the ment Secretary as soon as he arrived there. and the He obtained the position over the heads support- of officers of many years' service. I ask making. the Minister to state the educational qualifications of Grose for the position, his age when he left school, and also his civil occupation before the war. If the Minister supplies that information, honourable members will be able to see the kind of man who is being appointed to high positions over the heads of experienced officers. I understand that the present Treasurer's brother is now the Government Secretary, and that Grose is the superintendent of police. The manner in which the Administrator travels about the island con- is repulsive to the people there. A correspondent informs me that he gets about the island with a. staff, carries a sword, has a crown on his car, but will not go off the main road. What Such conduct is offensive to Australians. I am informed that there has been no inwill spection of district officers and their work, apart from those on the main road. The disgraceful state of affairs as affecting the natives was only found out as the result of parliamentary visits, or because of disputes among the officials. General Wisdom should be asked to justify the appointment of these untrained the men. The man named Dyson Hoare, to whom I have referred, held a recruiting licence. Here, again, is evidence of the favouritism I have mentioned. He committed an offence against the ordinance under which licences are granted, and was fined. Later, he committed another serious offence against a native labour ordinance. The matter was inquired into by Grose, his brotherin-law, who cancelled his licence. was not brought before the court, as should have been done, but he was tried by a relative, and acquitted. Four months later, under the authority of the A d ministrator, he was given another licence, whereas others who had similarly offended have been refused licences for years. contend that the law should not only be fair, but that it should appear so to the general public. Dyson Hoare has now been committed for trial on a charge of receiving. These complaints are not confined to one set of officials, but are general throughout the Territory. I would like to quote one more example from the letter of the C i v il Service Association to show the remarkable position which has arisen in the TerritoryAbout two months ago the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League at a meeting decided to convene a public meeting to consider means to obtain some improvement in the present method of government. After the meeting the ouicers of. the League approached leading members of the community to ask them to allow themselves to be nominated as members of a committee to be formed. The response was so bad that it had been practically decided to abandon the calling of the public meeting, although every one was in favour of something being done-the y would take no part because of the fear of the kick-back from the Administrator, The League then wrote and asked the permission of the Administrator, which was granted, and the people approached, on being informed of this, consented to take part. The letter of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia to the Administrator and liis reply speak for themselves. We say this is conclusive of the general opinion that the Administrator is a man who will victimize those who differ from or go against him. We ask that you ask for the production of those letters. Given an inquiry whenevidence can be taken on oath we can prove what we say. That is the general feeling of the people on the island. They will not attend to give evidence when their positions may be jeopardized because of what they say, but if given a royal commission they will come forward with this evidence. It is in the interests of the Commonwealth that the position should be cleared up. When it is remembered that the charges include rape and murder it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government, particularly in view of the fact that this is a mandated territory, to see that they are thoroughly investigated, and either proved or disproved.",55
133,Mr LACEY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Grey) [ 9 . 5 6 ] - I wish to refer to a matter affecting the CommonHe wealth employees engaged on the transcontinental rail-way. The permanently employed men on that line are compelled, under the Superannuation Act of 1922, to contribute to the Superannuation Fund, and to take up at least two units of pension. The cost to them varies, with I the age at which they commenced to contribute, in many instances the deduction being as much as 16s. or 17s. a fortnight. Because their wages are based on the cost of living figures, with . no allowance for the payments to the Superannuation Fund, and the amounts they actually receive are 16s. or 17s. a fortnight less than the basic living wage for the district in which they are working. Another section of employees, working in the same localities-the clerk3 in the employ of the Commonwealth railways-receiv e a child endowment of 5s. per child-per fortnight. Those clerks are thus enabled to provide for their children's education in a way in which the other employees are not. My point is that the same conditions should apply to all. Mr Justice Powers, in his judgment in the Australian Workers' Union v. the Commonwealth Railways Employees case, has dealt with this matter. His Honour saidIf the employees along the line were clerks or persons in liigher positions under the Public Service Act, they would, in cities or large country towns, be paid an allowance for each child, in addition to the basic wage. This court cannot yet in general awards fix allowances for children, but, as the men are really working "" in the Public Service,"" the court or the Government should consider whether the men on the line, at least,, ought not to get an allowance for each child to enable them to give better educational advantages than are possible along the line. In making that statement Mr Justice Powers recognized the justice of the claims of these intra.. Similar clauses exist in other awards. In many cases employers carry out suggestions made in this way; and I ask the Minister to see that these men, who are forced either to join the Superannuation Fund and have deductions made from their pay, or to leave the employ of planation, the Commonwealth, are dealt with justly. Those men are compelled to contribute the superannuation f u n d , and as a result they are receiving less than the standard division. wage fixed by the Arbitration Court. For the sake of uniformit y in the service and in justice to those employees, they should receive the same bonus on account of children as is paid to the clerical members of the service. I ask the Minister for Works and Railways to give consideration to this matter and let the House know of what relief he is prepared to offer.

135,Mr CKAKLTON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Hear , hear !  is to authorize the Commonwealth to execute an agreement with the Tasmanian Hopgrowers Pool Limited. The main points of the agreement are: The Commonwealth is to advance a sum of £24,500 to the pool on the security of PAIRS. 2,558 bales of hops exported by the pool to Great B r it a in , and also the assets of L, the pool. Interest at 6% per cent, will be paid on the balance remaining from time to time unpaid. The moneys realized from the sales of the hops will be paid into the London branch of the Commonwealth Bank, to the credit of the Commonwealth in repayment of the adI f the advance and accruing interest are not full y repaid at the expiration of twelve months from the date of the agreement, the pool must forthwith pay the deficiency. The usual conditions are imposed requiring the deposit of documents of title with the London branch of the Commonwealth Bank, aud insurance of the goods to their full value. Authority is also given to the Auditor-General to make any examination of the affairs of the pool which he may think necessary. The agreement ensures that the amount advanced shall be forthwith distributed tq the growers. The bill practically provides for a loan to the pool of £24,500, repayable with interest as the hops are sold, and limited to one year. The reason why the advance is necessary is that many hopgrowers are in a very bad way. Some of them have had to go out of the industry owing to the fact that the pool has a large surplus of hops from the 1922 and 1923 seasons which it was unable to sell in Australia; consequently, no return could be made to the growers in respect of the unsold hops. In order to find a means of relieving the position, towards the end of 1922, the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers), after a good deal of negotiation, succeeded in having an agreement made between the Australian brewers aud the hop pool, by which the brewers undertook to limit their consumption of imported hops to 15 per cent, of their total annual consumption. On the other hand, there was an understanding not mentioned in the agreement, that Henry Jones and Company would relieve the brewei's of the overseas hops they had contracted for to the extent made necessary by the limitation of the use of imported hops. For reasons that are not clearly ascertainable, the contract hops were not taken over by Henry Jones and Company Limited, and they continued to come in, with the result that the agreement was not observed and the Hop Pool was left with a large surplus of unsaleable hops. This surplus has now been exported to Great Britain, where there appears to be a reasonable opportunity of selling it at a payable price. The quality of the hops which have already arrived in England has been favourably commented on. The reports received indicate that the crop in Great Britain is sliort of requirements. The consumption of hops there is under Government control, and the controller, in releasing hops for consumption, is giving preference, after disposing of British supplies, to the dominions. As this year's crop in Great Britain will not be on the market for some time, the opportunity of disposing of a considerable portion of the Tasmanian hops in the meantime appears to be very favourable. A small quantity of the hops shipped has been sold at £10 per cwt., which is a very reasonable price. The balance was shipped on consignment for sale by the Pool's representatives in London. The question will probably be asked why the Pool could not obtain an advance from the banks in the ordinary way of business. This could not be done, because the bulk of the hops was shipped on consignment, and, in view of this, the banks would not do business. If the hops had been actually sold for delivery in England there would have been no difficulty in this respect. Another aspeci of the case needs to be mentioned. In addition to the 2,558 bales exported by the Pool, other concerns have also exported hops to Great Britain to the extent of 1,150 bales. This quantity includes 500 bales exported by Henry Jones ancl Company Limited. This company has given an undertaking, in legal form, that until the Pool has sold in England 500 bales of the Pool's hops, Henry Jones and Company Limited will not sell, or allow to be sold, any quantity of their hop? in excess of the quantity of the Pool's hope sold. This undertaking was required from Henry Jones and Company Limited, and it demonstrates in a practical and effective way the confidence of the company in the market. The total value of the hops exported by the Pool at £10 per cwt.. the price which reports indicate will be realized, is, approximately, £56,000. As the amount advanced is only £24,500. the security for repayment of the aclvanee is amply sufficient to guarantee the Government against loss. Honourable members will realise that the action proposed to be taken is in the interests of the small growers, who are entirely dependent upon the sale of their hops to enable them to carry on until they receive returns for their next crop. As I have already stated, the agreement provides that on payment of the advance the proceeds will immediately be paid direct to the growers. The hop industry is a valuable one to the Commonwealth, and is of very vital importance to Tasmania. There is every prospect that when the accumulated surplus of past seasons is got out of the way by sale to Great B r it a in , the existing arrangement, which is being strictly observed, whereby the breweries are restricting their use of imported hops to 15 per cent, of their requirements, will enable the industry placed on a very satisfactory basis. The Government has very carefully considered the matter, and I commend the proposed arrangement to honourable members as being business like, and, in the cumstances, justifiable in the interests of tha Tasmanian hop-growers. As this the first time. I have h a d the responsibility, in the honourable position I occupy, of submitting a bill to the House, I hope it will have a quick and-happy passage.",59
136,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,What is its urgency?,61
137,Mr CHARITON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Hunter) [10.23] I should not have risen if the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) had not asked, "" What is the urgency of the bill ?"" I am pleased that the Minister has introduced the bill. are many small hop-growers who are in difficult circumstances, and banks would have closed on them had it not been for the action taken by the Government. They are not to blame for their troubles. The agreement referred to was drawn up at the end of the last Parliament. It provided for taking over all the hops produced in Australia, with the exception of 15 per cent., which would be exported. As our production is in the vicinity of 10,000 or 11,000 bales, there was no difficulty in finding a market. Although the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) stated that the agreement would be policed after the election, for some reason unknown to me that was not done. I played my part in drawing up the agreement, andsubsequently I was absent from this House through ill ness. Later I ascertained that the agreement had not been policed, and that thousands of pounds worth of hops, upon which duty had been collected, had been imported from New Zealand. Tasmanian hop-growers found themselves with their hops on their hands. That is the position facing the Government today. There was a large carry over of hops,'not because there was no demand for them in Australia, but. because New Zealand hops had been allowed to come in. Henry Jones and Company sent the hops to England, and covered themselves for what they had paid to the New Zealand growers. As a result, there is an accumulation of hops which have been sent overseas. Some have been sold since their arrival. They are very satisfactory, and the people of England have stated to be that there will be a market for Tasmanian hops for all time in that country. I do not think there will be any hops to send after the present accumulation has disappeared, but in the meantime, because cirof the accumulation of Australian hops, there is no money available to pay the is growers. There are very few rich people in. the hop-growing business; most of them have small areas, and employ their own families. H ad not the banks and Sir Henry Jones and Company stood behind them, they would have had to go out of business. It is now very necessary that money to finance them should be made available at the earliest possible moment. The banks gave notice to them that they must meet their liabilities, but, when it There became known that the Government would advance the money against ample security, the the banks held off. The Government takes no risk in the matter, for the security is sound. To delay passing the bill would mean, if the Senate does not sit next week, that two or three weeks might elapse before it would become law. The bill is of great importance to the hopgrowers. It affects their bread and butter. I am very pleased that the Government has submitted the bill even at this late hour of the evening, and I congratulate the Minister, who has stated the facts very clearly.",61
138,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Swan) [10.27] - I do notintend to oppose the bill, but I urge that, as far as possible, an opportunity should be given to honourable members to read and study bills before they are passed. No departure should be> made from that practice except in very urgent and unavoidable cases. The Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have given good reasons why the bill should be passed. I remember that, on a previous occasion, a bill introduced by the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs, and endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition, was about to pass the second reading before members had had an opportunity of even seeing it . I hope the Minister will make clear that it is urgent that the bill should be passed to-night.  member that the b i ll is urgent.",61
139,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"It appears that the Government is justified in going to the assistance of the hop-growers, but the Minister should not ask for bills to be passed in this way if there is any possibilit y of giving lionorable members an opportunity to peruse them.

140,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Flinders-Prime Minister) [10.30] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I desire to inform honourable members that in view of the complaints regarding decisions as to whether the disabilities of certain ex-soldiers are due to or aggravated by war services, and also in view of questions raised by honourable members on the subject, the Government proposes to appoint a royal commission, consisting of eminent medical men, to consider and report on the following reference: Is the present method of determining whether an exrsoldier's disability is due to or aggravated by war service adequate to decide the origin or the degree to which it is aggravated, and what portion of his present incapacity can be regarded as having resulted from his war service? Owing to the length of time since the cessation of hostilities and the increasing complications of damage done to soldiers by their war service and of things happening after the war, the question of assessment of incapacity is now mainly a medical matter. In order to ensure proper methods of determining all the factors that can be held to cause the incapacity as at present existing, it has been decided to ask a royal commission, consisting of eminent medical men representing the different states, to thoroughly examine and report upon the procedure at present adopted. These medical men have all a wide knowledge of disabilities as they particularly affect soldiers, and the appointment of such a commission cannot fail to prove helpful to all concerned. The difficulties inherent in the work of [75] evaluating pensions have been experienced in every country. Although pensions have been introduced in every country, and although the principles underlying the granting of them are uni1 versal, the method of applying those principles and overcoming the difficulties involved are found to vary in some degree not only in every country, but from time to time. However, it is felt that such a royal commission as is proposed will prove to be very beneficial, and will result in a general feeling of satisfaction to the soldier and to the public generally, for it will be realized that nothing will be left undone to put into effect the desire of the community generally that these men, who suffered disabilities in consequence of their devotion to their country, should not fail to be amply recompensed so far as pension benefits can be said to recompense them. The methods employed up to the present have been designed carefully and thoughtfully, and it is confidently hoped that the proposed royal commission will be welcomed, not only by the soldiers, but also by those whose responsibility it is to re-establish them medically. All the names of those proposed to be appointed will command respect, not only in their own state, but amongst the soldiers and also overseas, for practically all the names are those of men of world-wide reputation. The result of an inquiry by such men as these, with the experience of the past few years to guide them, must be of the utmost value generally. I am sure that honourable members will welcome the appointment of a commission of such a character.",62
141,Mr FORDE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,What are the names of the commissioners ?,62
142,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I cannot mention them at the moment, since the Government has not yet received their acceptance of appointment. I hope to be able, tomorrow, or at any rate in the near future, to announce the personnel of the commission. Another point I desire to bring before the House is that, whilst the commission will examine the methods adopted in assessing the disability of soldiers, so that honourable members and the public generally may know that the best possible means are being taken to ensure just and equitable treatment of the soldiers, the question of administration must inevitably enter very largely into the mquiry. All honourable members have had many cases brought under their notice in which apparent injustice has been done to the soldier, and the Government is desirous that honourable members should have the fullest opportunity of ascertaining the exact circumstances surrounding any case that may be submitted to them. The Government, consequently, proposes to make available the services of another Minister in order to discuss this question with honourable gentlemen who from time to time have cases which they desire to bring under notice. As all honourable members are aware, this feature of repatriation work is under the direct control of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), who, with his many duties, is physically incapable of devoting the time necessary to discuss in dividual cases with honourable members. I think, therefore, that it will help us all if another Minister is made available to devote all the time necessary to the consideration of cases requiring attention. I also desire to notify the House that the Government has determined to recognize the great accomplishment of WingCommander Goble and Plight-Lieutenant Mclntyre in their flight round Australia in a Fairey sea-plane. The Government has decided to make a g if t of £500 to Wing-Commander Goble and of £250 to Flight-Lieutenant Mclntyre. The feat of these two officers is one of the most wonderful accomplishments in the history of aviation. Their services have already been recognized by the King, who has conferred upon them the Order of the Companionship of the British Empire, but in the recognition by H is Majesty no distinction was made between the two officers. The Government felt that in this furthe r recognition a distinction should be shown, for Wing-Commauder Goble was the officer responsible for the flight, and the whole of the arrangements were in his hands. He acted as the ing officer throughout the exploit, and the burden on his shoulders was somewhat greater than that on his companion. Mr CITAKLTO'JX - I hope that a direct representative of the returned soldiers will be appointed to the commission.",62
143,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Every member of it will be a returned soldier.,63
144,Mr OKEEFE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Denison) [10.3S] - I am very pleased to hear the announcement of the Prime Minister that a commission will be appointed to inquire into the methods by which the degree of in capacity of returned men is now determined. I should like to know whether the commission will have power to take evidence in each of the states, or whether it will merely sit in Melbourne at the seat of government. It seems to me that it is highly desirable that the commission shall have power to visit the various states if it wishes to do so. I hope no obstacle will be placed in the way of its doing so.",63
145,Mr R GREEN,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Richmond) [10.40]. - Whil e congratulating the Government on the appointment of the commission, I think it would, perhaps, be well if the Priine Minister could now assure the House that effect will be given to the recommendations of the commission. In the event of those recommendations clashing with the 'lolicy at present adopted by the Repatriation Commission, I maintain that they should be submitted to the House for approval. I am sure honourable members would rather adopt the recommendations of such a body than continue a policy that has given rise to enormous dissatisfaction. If any amendments to the Repatriation Act are necessary in order to give effect to the recommendations, will the Government take action forthwith to amend the act accordingly ?",63
146,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External AfTairs) [10.41] - I can assure the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe), that the Government will afford the commission every facility desired by it to full y investigate the subject of reference. Regarding the question raised by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green), the commission's recommendations will be treated in exactly the same way as those of other royal commissions. No Government can relieve itself of its own responsibility by navigat- the appointment of such a body. When the commission has made its report, the Government will take such action upon it as it considers to be in the best interests of the soldiers. It will then be for the House to express its opinion of the action taken by the Government. I can assure honourable members that any recommendation made by the commission will receive the fullest and most careful consideration. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned afc 10.43 p.m.",63
