DEATH OF GEORGE HENRY GRAY, Minister",14
4,Mr HAROLD HOLT,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"It is with regret that 1 formally advise the House of the death on 2nd August of ths late George Henry Gray who had represented the Division of Capricornia since 1961. At the time of his death Mr Gray was a member of the Public Accounts Committee and from March 1962 until November 1963 he was a member of the Library Committee. He was a member of parliamentary delegations Ihat visited South East Asia in 1963 and 1966. Before entering the Federal Parliament, Mr Gray had been Secretary of the Canegrowers Execulive in north Queensland and Secretary of the Rockhampton Agricultural Show Society. George Gray enlisted in the Australian Military Forces in September 1939 and served overseas as a captain with 17th Australian Ordnance Ammunition Company and 10th Australian Advanced Ammunition Depot. As many honourable members will recall, he retained an active interest in defence matters, particularly those technical aspects that he had become familiar wiih during his own service, and we remember that his interest took him to the extent of producing plans for a combined tank and tank carrier. George Gray won the respect of all honourable members of this Parliament with his quiet earnestness and his obvious sincerity. He was a champion of the many causes to which he devoted himself and he worked untiringly for the Australian Labor Party in the electorate he represented. He had a personality and character which, as we all recall so vividly, inspired friendship in all who came to know him. He will be missed and mourned by the many friends he made in both Houses of this Parliament. George Gray had a large family of children and our sympathy goes to them and to his widow in their sad loss. I move: That this House expresses its Jeep regret at the death on 2nd August 1967, of George Henry Gray, a member of this House for the Division of Capricornia, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.",15
5,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I support the motion the Prime (Mr Harold Holt) has moved. My M.P. colleagues and I appreciate the Prime Ministers tribute to our lat J colleague. We similarly appreciate the tribute paid to the late George Gray immediately after his death, ft was appreciated throughout the many areas and in the many organisations in which G:orge Gray had served and in which he was deeply respected and will be long remembered. The Prime Minister has referred to the parliamentary career and some of the public career of our late colleague. He led a very active, full and varied life indeed. At the age of nineteen George Gray joined the Chinese customs service in Shanghai. He was a very proficient sportsman, particularly in tennis and rifle shooting. He served throughout the Second World War from its first month to its end. After the war he took a reconstruction training course and obtained the Diploma of Economics at the University of Sydney. He was a qualified accountant. After the war, however, he decided to go on the land and he began dairy farming in south Queensland. He later moved to the Tully district as a cane grower. He had been a member of my Party ever since the war. As the Prime Minister said, George Gray was elected to this House at the end of 1961. In addition to his activities on parliamentary committees and in parliamentary debates in which he was an effective speaker on an extraordinarily wide range of subjects, he was also very active in many of the affairs of the parliamentary party. He was of course, particularly interested in matters of northern development and of defence, the defence not only of northern Australia but of the whole of Australia. The Prime Minister has very properly referred to the interest the Chiefs of Staff have taken in the tank carrier prototype which he demonstrated to many members of the House, from both sides, last year. I have never known a man who has belonged to so many organisations. At the time of his election to the Parliament he was secretary or president of twentyits two associations or societies in the Rockhampton area. I first met him ten years ago when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. He gave evidence before the Committee at Rockhampton, in regard to new States. I think it can be said that he and a member of the Committee, the late David Drummond, were principally responsible for the recommendation which the Committee unanimously made on that subject. In all of his very great range of interests, he was a man of creative imagination and engaging ingenuity. His family can well be proud of the manner in which he contributed to life in this country and of the manner in which he served this country. He was justly proud of the service which mcmbers of his family have given and are giving to this country. His eldest son is a member of the Regular Army and has just recently returned from service in Vietnam. His second son is at the Army's radio electronics base at Balcombe in Victoria. His youngest son is not yet one year old. He has three daughters, the eldest being in the Department of the Navy. For six generations the Gray family has served Australia. This family dates its Australian history to 1804, when the founder of the Australian branch came here as a member of the New South Wales Corps. My colleagues and I join in the tribute that the Prime Minister paid to a very valued contributor to this institution of which we are members.",15
6,Mr ANTHONY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I would like to associate the members of the Australian Country Party with the condolence motion and with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Harold Holt) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) concerning our late colleague and friend. George Gray was universally liked by all who had an opportunity to know him. He was a quiet, dedicated man who held very strong convictions on anything he believed was right and in the public interest. His whole life seemed to be associated with one cause or another. However, if he appeared to be an ordinary type of man his demeanour belied him. George Gray was a most unusual person. As the Leader of the Opposition said, he lived a full and varied life with a tremendous experience of different places and of different types of occupation. People who were closely associated with George would have heard him reminisce about his experiences in China where he was a customs officer for many years. His stories, some in humorous vein, would keep his friends intrigued for many an hour. In his capacity as a customs officer in China he was an assessor in the courts and could tell of many and varied experiences. He also had a distinguished military record and was a member of a unit which managed to hold Wau at the time df the Japanese attack in New Guinea. As honourable members are aware, Wau was held only by a thread's breadth. George was there on that occasion. He was also a farmer and a union organiser and was associated with many organisations. He was devoted to the New State Movement. All round, he had a great knowledge of human affairs and was a most suitable person to come into this House as a member of Parliament. We will remember him with affection and we will all miss him. On behalf of the members of my Party, I would like to express our sympathy to his wife and family.",16
7,Dr PATTERSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I would like to be associated with the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Harold Holt) and to express my deep sympathy to the family of George Gray. During the last two years I became very closely associated with him. Remarkable though it may seem, my electorate of Dawson completely encircles the mainland portion of the electorate of Capricornia. For this reason, many of my electoral activities were of interest to George Gray and things that he did were of interest to me. Travelling between Canberra and Rockhampton with him as frequently as I did was an experience that I shall never forget. I believe that few people could really appreciate kis remark* able background. The number of issues and events with which he somehow or other became involved was truly astonishing. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has said, George Gray was associated with a tremendous number of organisations. This was evidenced particularly at his funeral. The number of people representing all walks i?f life and various religious denominations showed clearly the respect in which this man was held by the people of the area that he represented in this House. I spoke to Mr Gray only a few hours before he died. But he did not speak of death. He spoke, with his peculiar and extraordinary enthusiasm, of how quickly this sessional period of the Parliament was drawing near and of how much he looked forward to coming back here to help solve sonic of"" the problems about the solution ol"" which he emhuxril so much. If there is one small recompense IOT his death. I belii-ve it is the fad that he died in a way tli.it he would have approved. I know ihat Mrs Gray also thinks this. He died in his own home, among his family, with ihe two babies which were his and which he loved so much close at hand. George Gray was a remarkable man. Sir. and 1 believe thai ihis Parliament will miss him greatly. He was an extraordinarily good Australian. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members sianding in their places. Mr Harold Holt- Mr Speaker, I suggest that, as a mark of respect to the memory of our late colleague, the sitting be suspended until 8 p.m.",16

As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased member, th; sitting is suspended uniil 8 p.m. Silting suspended from 3.19 to 8 p.m. APPROPRIATION BILL (Nn. 1) Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr MCMahon, and read a first time.",17
9,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Hon. W. J. Aston)In accordance with Budget practice, I now call on the Chairman of Committees to take the chair as Deputy Speaker. Second Reading (Budget Speech)",17
10,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Lowe-Treasurer ) [8.2] - I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In so doing, I present the Budget proposals for the financial year 1967-68. This Budget presents the sum of many proposals, each with its own purpose. The amount involved is large and grows inevitably year by year. Total Budget outlay this year will equal about one-fourth of our Gross National Expenditure. Spending on this scale, and the measures required to finance it, must have powerful effects. The precise impact will depend on the trend and strength of many other influences runnirv; through our economic life. Therefore, 1 want to speak briefly about our recent economic experience, take stock of the economy at the moment, and then say something about our prospects. A year ago, the effects of drought were still lingering, consumer spending was sluggish, and private capital expenditure seemed to be slowing down. For these reasons, last year's Budget was designed to he expansionary. The economy responded much as we intended. The year 1966-67 was one of strong and varied growth. On the demand side, public authority expenditure led the way. With a much better season, rural output and incomes both increased notably. Consumer spending, comprising normally about three-fifths of all expenditure, also revived. While building and construction for commerce and industry and private spending on plant and machinery tended to fall away, there was a considerable lift in dwelling construction. For 1966-67 as a whole, gross national product rose by 9%. After making full 1967-68 allowance for price increases, there was an increase of between 5 and 6% in national production in real terms. This achievement was close to the best of recent years. Plainly, there must have been some good gains in productivity. The number in employment in 1966-67 was 2.5% greater than in the year before. This was a smaller increase than has been usual. By all accounts employers have had less difficulty infindingeither skilled or unskilled labour than in recent years although overtime working has been fairly high. The lower migrant inflow has been a factor in the smaller rise in civilian employment. Domestically, therefore, supply and demand seem to have been pretty much in balance. Wage rates have increased strongly: over the year to June, niinimum weekly wage ra>es rose by about 7%. As to prices, the consumer price index rose in the first three quarters of 1966-67 at an annual rate only a little above 2%. However, in the most recent quarter, the rise approached an annual rate of 5%. This of course is much too high. Externally, results have been mixed. Taken as a whole, the export performance over the past year has been splendidthe best we have ever had. Imports increased little as compared with 1965-66, though the rate was rising in the later months of 1966-67. The substantial trade deficit in the preceding year thus gave place to a useful surplus of S95m. With defence and civil aid and other payments abroad increasing, the net deficit on invisible payments widened and net receipts of capital from abroad fell a long way from the record level of 1965-66. In the outcome there was a loss of SI77m in external reserves. The offsetting increase in our drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the credit extended to New Zealand reduced the net adverse movement to Sl25m. That was a pretty good result. The financial year has in fact opened well for the balance of payments. There were good trade results in July, with shipments of wheat, wool and minerals running at a high level and with imports a little lower than they have been in recent months. NA Let me now outline the Budget briefly in terms of total expenditure and receipts. It provides for total expenditure in 1967-68 of §6,483m and total revenues and similar receipts of $5,887m. Thus the estimated gap to be financed from borrowings of various kinds is S596m. This would be $61m more than the amount borrowed last year. On these figures, expenditures will be $561 m or 9.5% greater than those of last year-whe n the increase over the previous year was 11%. The increase in revenue will be S499m-o r 9.3%: last year it was S309m Or 6%. Statements No. 2 to 4 attached to the Budget Speech give details of these estimates. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate in Hansard these statements and others to which I shall refer in the course of my speech. These aggregates of expenditures and receipts crystallise the Government's decisions. They reflect our judgment as to the kind of Budget the economy needs to keep it healthy during the year and beyond. To a considerable extent the shape of the Budget is pre-determined by past commitments and by such necessities as defence. So the scope for policy adjustment lies chiefly in decisions about new expenditure proposals and on whether taxes and charges shaU be increased or reduced. It is these decisions which determine whether the marginal impact of the Budget will be one of stimulus or restraint. As I now see the prospect, we can expect another good year. The supply of labour, material and plant is adequate to sustain a good rate of growth. With normal additions to the work force from our own population and net immigration, a rise of 3% in employment seems feasible without putting much strain on the labour market. It would be normal to expect some further gain in overall productivity. Indeed, the big additions to industrial plant during recent years ought to go on boosting output per man hours for some time to come. The capacity for expansion is certainly there. The rural industries will depend, as always, very much on seasonal conditions. For some major districts a good season is not assured as yet. But there can be no doubt that the rural industries, especially the wheat industry, are capable of greater production. Given a good season greater production will certainly be achieved. On the side of demand there are also grounds for confidence. Consumer spending is the major component of national expenditure. It has been growing strongly and we can expect this trend to continue. Employment is bound to go on rising and so are average earnings. Generally, conditions seem set, not for a boom, but for a good steady expansion of consumer demand. Let us now consider the prospects for the other main segment of private spending, that is, capital expenditure. Expenditure on dwelling construction has been increasing steadily. There are no signs of slackening. The flow of finance appears to be keeping up. If anything, the year ahead might see some further increase in dwelling construction. An increase in non-residential construction also seems likely. The value of approvals for commercial, industrial and other non-residential buildings in the recent June quarter was 16% higher than a year earlier. We were aiming to achieve a figure something like this. Increased consumer spending can be expected to make heavier demands on production and hence on plant capacity. Various big projects associated with minerals, oil and gas are in train. Bank lending and unused overdraft limits are high and monetary liquidity is adequate to support a substantial increase in business expenditure. All told, therefore, Ihe indications are that private capital expenditure in general will gather impetus as the year goes on. Let us turn now to public authority expenditure. The allocation of resources between the public and private sectors was the crucial question we faced when framing the Budget. I have indicated that there is scope in the economy foi"" production to rise at much the same rate as last year. Total expenditure also could increase about as fast as production without upsetting the balance of demand and supply. But if expendi ure increases faster than that it must outrun the resources available with adverse effects on costs and the balance of payments. This, in fact, is what must happen if all the main segments of expenditure rise strongly together. Consumer spending has revived and we expect private capital expenditure also to do so. There could obviously be trouble if, at the same time, public spending were allowed to continue to rise at the rate of the pasi few years. We could quickly find ourselves over-spending, with resources over-stretched, prices rising fast and a heavy external deficit. The Government does not want lo take the risk that these conditions will emerge. Already rising wage rates have created a cost problem, worrying for all; serious for the exporting industries and acute in the case of some sections of the wool industry. Externally our position is under some stress; it could become difficult sive rise of demand led to a strong upsurge of imports. I emphasise that we are not prepared to take this risk. While we keep the progress of the economy sure and steady, our balance of payments can be manageable. Our export prospects are certainly good and, in particular, the big mining developments now under our earnings abroad. It seems possible that, even in the medium term, the fruits of oil discoveries will serve to replace a considerable quantity of imports. On the other side of the ledger we expect imports to increase. Additionally, we face some big external commitments in the period immediately ahead, especially for defence. Of this I shall say more later. Capital inflow is unpredictable. Allowing for a rate of inflow comparable with that of 1966-67, I think some further loss of external reserves is likely in this nnancial year. We do not want that loss to be aggravated by an overstimulated demand for imports. On a balancing of these probabilities, we do not think it wou'.d be in the nation's interest to put further restraints on consumption. The taxes imposed in 1964-65 and 1965-66 in order lo shift resources to defence are sti;i effective and new restraints could immobilise rather than divert resources. It must be emphasised that a large part of industry and the employment it provides are geared to the needs of the consumer. If we cut back consumer demand too hard not only are living standards affected but tihe immediate result is more likely to be unemployment than a transfer of resources to other activities. It could also affect immigration adversely. For these reasons we do not want to reduce disposable income. Equally, however, we do not think that consumption expenditure needs any stimulus now. The tasks to be done and Ihe demands to be made on resources are too numerous and heavy for us to be able to afford too strong an increase in consumer spending. Nor do we wish to depress private capi.al expenditure. Some of it might not pass the test of high national priority but the private sector is responsible for the largest part of production and has, therefore, a critical role to play in national if an excesgrowth and progress. GROWTH OF THE PUB! IC SECTOR One reason why we have drawn the reins on public sper.d'ng more tightly than before is to provide room for balanced expansion of the private sector. For some years novv the public sector has been setting the pace and doing so strongly. That it should have done so is in part based on historical need; that is, the need for large and rapid defence expansion coinciding with unparalleled demands for works to serve great new developments and improve facilities for education, transport, power and fuel supply-in a word, to establish the foundations for larger economic growth. In the four years from 1962-63 to 1966-67 public authority spending as a proportion of total spending has grown from 19% to 21%. In the past two years 44% of the increase in employment has gone to the public sector. A few years back 25 to 30% would have been more like the ratio. Public expenditure has also been calling more and more heavily on our overseas resources. In the main, these necessities could be denied and they are likely to increase. growth. To recognise these necessities does not mean, however, that the requirements of the public sector must override everything Essentially, this involves the problem of choice and allocation of resources to which I referred in my Budget speech last year. Pressed hard by competing claims, we had to decide what the broad allocation of resources should be. As I said earlier, private sector has a major part to play in growth. I add that it also has a major role to play in national security since basically defence must be built upon the growth of our manpower, our industrial capacity and our ability to pay our way abroad. EXPENDITURE, 1967-68 These are the reasons why we have made a strong effort this year to bring the increase in expenditure within tighter limits. The goal we set was 9% and within the city practical limits set by our commitments for defence, we have gone close to achievfinding ing it. I shall now explain what we in respect of the main expenditure groups. Again this year defence commitments have been a dominant element in the Budget. Last year, expenditure was S950m. This was $50m below the estimate. Even so it was 27% above expenditure in the previous year. This year we are providing $1,118m for defence-a n increase of $168m or 18% on 1966-67. May I recall that in 1962-63, five years ago, our defence biil was $428m, nearly $700m less than the estimate for this year. Over the four intervening years the rate of increase has averaged 22% per year. We have accomplished this expansion without serious distortion or disruption of our domestic economy. We have done it through fiscal and monetary means without the direct controls associated with a proclaimed state of war. In other words, the defence effort has been accommodated within our available resources. Lest any one should suppose that it has all been costless, let him reflect how much could have been done if all those additional expenditures and the resources they represent had gone into the enlargement of our industrial not capacity and other basic facilities for It is not, however, the present level of else. defence spending so much as the rate of escalation that concerns us most. Plainly we cannot continue for long to meet anything like the rate of increase of recent years without deep impairment of the economy. As it is, estimated defence costs this year the will be equivalent to 5% of what we think gross national product is likely to be, calculated at factor cost. Among the countries of the Western World, only the United States. Brilain and France are at present devoting a larger proportion of their resources to defence than we are. Britain now considers that the burden of defence expenditure is more than her economy can stand and the Government is putting into effect plans to reduce the proportion of her resources that go into defence. The United States, with her immense productive capaand a gross national product per head more than half as great again as ours, is her external defence cosls a heavy propose strain on her balance of payments. Defence Total defence expenditure is one aspect of the problem: our mounting external defence costs are another and more serious aspect. Five years ago, our external costs of defence were well under SlOOm a year. This year they could rise above §350m. At this level they would represent 11 % or more of our export earnings. Some of this expenditure will be met from credits arranged abroad but, though helpful in spreading payments, credits simply carry the liabilities forward. Even so the net cash outgo this year will be well above S200m. Out. standing defence orders abroad for ships, aircraft and other equipment and supplies at 30th June last were costed at more than $600m. Further orders will have to placed overseas this year and later plenishment or replacement as provide for new and additional requirements. Defence must, and does, rank high in our national priorities. We must be prepared to play an effective role in our own defence and, in co-operation with our Allies, in the security and stability of this part of the world. Our effectiveness will grow as our resources develop. But we would not be helping either ourselves or our Allies were we to attempt to overreach our capacity. Defence subtracts from the resources available for growth. Seriously weaken the potential for growth and the capacity to support an expanding defence effort is whittled away. NA We propose to seek an amendment of the legislation governing Defence Forces Retirement Benefits to give common entitlements to all servicemen on full-time continuous duty for periods of twelve months or more by admitting to the benefits of the scheme those now excluded because they are enlisted for periods of less than six years. extension of the scheme will give cover to national servicemen, who are enlisted for two years. If any of the servicemen now to be covered is discharged through invalidity or dies, he or his widow and children wili receive the same pensions or other benefits as permanent members of the Forces. While serving in special areas such as Vietnam, servicemen are, in addition, covered by the Repatriation legislation. Thus, for example, a married private soldier totally and permanently incapacitated as a result of war service will receive a pension of $31.50 per week under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits legislation, together with a basic pension of $34.55 per week under the Repatriation legislation. Additional Repatriation are, of course, provided in respect of children and by way of medical and hosand pital treatment. The legislation will be introduced as as possible. Later I shall announce proposals to improve the pensions payable to former membe bers of the Permanent Defence Forces for reunder the Defence Forces Retirement well as to Benefits legislation. International Aid I shall refer next to the contribution we are making to the economic advancement and security of developing countries. Both in our foreign policy and our defence planning our goal is international peace. Along with this must go economic progress. These aretiheaims of our international aid. The scale of our economic aid to developing countries is not as well known as it should be. Unlike other aid-giving countries, we give all our official aid in grants not in repayable, interest-bearing loans, tied or untied. Our official aid this year, estimated at $142m, will probably represent about 0.75% of our estimated national income. Only France among the countries of the West can point to a better performance than that. Australia's aid, moreover, has grown rapidly in recent years whereas that of other donor countries has been static or declining. This year, our expenditure under bilateral and multilateral aid programmes will inThis crease by $9m to $50m-that is by 23%. We are providing aid these days under more than twenty separate headings. The main increases will occur in our contribution to the International Development Association and in emergency assistance for Indonesia. The IDA expenditure is a further instalment towards the second replenishment of IDA funds for which Australia has agreed to provide $ 17.7m in all. The amount of $5.2m for Indonesia is special assistance over and above normal Colombo Plan aid to that country. We are providing $9.5m in anticipation of the coming into effect of food aid obligations under the International Grains Agreement. A gift of 150,000 tons of wheat to India, valued at nearly $9m, has already been arranged. Defence aid of some $6m will be given benefits to Malaysia and Singapore. The grant to the Administration of Papua New Guinea will increase this year by almost $8m to $77.6m-that is, by early 11%. The Administration intends to provide additional capital for the Papua-New Guinea Development Bank, which has now started operations. If through the year the Bank's requirements seem likely to exceed its resources, we shall consider adding enough to the grant to permit the Bank's needs to be met. Over and above the grant. Commonwealth Departments will incur in the Territory expenditures of an aid character amounting to about $l4m. Other Departmental expenditure, including defence expenditure there, will run to more than $30m. Together, the outlays from this Budget in the Territory will amount to more than $120m. In alf of this aid-giving we clearly nise our obligation to help the needier people of the world. We do this, knowing that the transfer of resources to others must subtract from our own resources and especially our external resources. These are anything but unlimited. Further information on Australia's external aid is contained in Statement No. 8. Social Services, Health and Repatrialion I turn now from international to domestic needs-thos e in the field of social and health services and repatriation. Overall, we expect expenditure in this field to rise this year by more than $50m to a total of about $1,332m. Payments from the National Welfare Fund will rise this year by an estimated $40m to $l,071m; these relate to age, invalid and widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment and sickness benefits, medical and hospital benefits, other benefits and services in the field of health and the homes savings grants. NA We propose to give additional assistance to larger families by increasing child endowment for children under sixteen years by 25 cents to $1.75 a week for the fourth child in a family, by 50 cents to $2.00 a week for a fifth child and so on, with a further 25 cents being added for each successive addition to the number of children.",17
11,Mr COPE,CHILD ENDOWMENT,You are only looking after yourself.,22
12,Mr MCMAHON,CHILD ENDOWMENT,"As I said at my Party meeting, it shows that I have other ambitions besides my political ones. A family including nine children under sixteen years, full year. for example, wil! under this propev-.t! receive an additional S5.25 weekly. The** new raies will apply on and from 19th September, the commencing date for the regular fourweek and twelve-week child endowment pay period. Later I shall announce taxation concessions that also will give benefits to families. NA NA We propose to extend eligibility for social services benefits to intellectually handicapped persons while they are in State recog- institutions when they can benefit from training specifically designed to he'p them. Other mental patients will continue to be eligible for payment of pension on discharge, together with arrears of pension for up to twelve weeks of the period spent in the institution. NA Legislation will be introduced to authorise the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories to supply hearing aids on loan for a nominal hiring charge to pensioners and their dependants wilh defective hearing who would benefit from iheir use. The details will be announced when the legislation is brought down. NA NA We intend to open discussions wilh the States with the object of working out mutually acceptable arrangements for the assistance of deserted wives and wives of prisoners. At present these women are, subject lo a means test and other conditions, eligible for a widow's pension if they have been deserted, or if the husband has been in prison, for not less than six months. Meanwhile, they can approach the State authorities in most States for assistance, with assistance varying considerably from Stale io Stale. If the States can reach agreement on uhe principles to be followed, we will offer to meet half the cost of State assistance where the wives concerned have children. The cost of these four proposals is estimated at $7m in 1967-68 and $(0m in a NA 1I have already referred to the decision to apply the benefits of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act to national servicemen and other classes of servicemen. As to repatriation, expenditure is estimated to increase this year by about $llm to some $26lm. Having carefully reviewed all repatriation benefits we have decided to increase pensions for war orphans. For children who have lost one parent through war service, the weekly pension will rise by 50 cents to $4.40 for the first child and to $3.25 for the second and other children. For those whose mother also is dead, the weekly pension will rise by $1.00 to $8.15 for every child. These increases will cost $127,000 this year and $169,000 in a full year. Education There can scarcely be a facet of our national affairs that attracts more widespread attention than education. A community quickly growing in numbers and in economic capacity needs continuously to raise its educational standards. The basic responsibility for education, constitutionally and in fact, still remains with the States. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth's ro!e in this field has been growing and its financial contribution has been increasing rapidly. For example, over the past six years the increase has been almost fourfold. We have seen dramatic developments in university education-: new universities have been established, standards of buildings and equipment have been improved and enrolments have more than doubled in eight years. These achievements would have been impossible without Commonwealth support. This support has net, however, been limited to universities; it is being extended to new tertiary institutions providing broadly-based educational opponunities for those being trained for technological vocations. The Commonwealth also has recognised the needs of secondary schools in the teaching of science and has given financial assistance for this purpose. It is giving capital grants also to improve facilities in technical colleges. Now, in this Budget, we are for the first time providing grants to the States for the building of teachers colleges. All this, of course, is additional to the cial assistance we give to students and the educational needs we meet in full in the Commonwealth territories. The cost to the Budget is in conseqence mounting rapidly. Total Commonwealth expenditure on education this year is estimated to be about $194m. This is S51m or 35% more than in 1966-67. This total includes payments to the States specifically for education. These will increase by 50% to Si 18m. Within this amount grants for universities and colleges of advanced education will account for nearly $81m. More than $29m will be for science laboratories, technical training and research grants. Provision is being made for grants of $8m for teachers colleges. Additionally, the Australian National University and its affiliated colleges will receive just on §24m or more than $4m in excess of last year. The cost of the various Commonwealth scholarship schemes will rise by $4.7m to nearly $29m. Current expenditures by the Commonwealth on education will this year amount to about $107m-this includes some $3m for the Soldiers' Children Education Scheme, which is a Repatriation item-and capital expenditures will total about $83m. Administrative expenditures associated with education amount to another $4m. Revenue Assistance to the States Except for expenditures on business undertakings, education accounts on the average for nearly a third of State expenditures from their revenue funds. Revenue grants to the States by the Commonwealth represent more than half of State revenues excluding business undertakings. These Commonwealth grants therefore help them in a big way to meet their education costs. In 1967-68 Commonwealth general revenue grants to the States will be about $936m as at present estimated or $5 8m more than last year. Other specific purpose revenue payments are estimated at $44m-abou t $7m less than last year, when payments related to drought were heavy. These figures do not include the Commonwealth payfinanments specifically for education to which I have referred; these will add about S49m to Commonwealth revenue-type grants to the States. For the first time total Commonwealth revenue assistance will exceed a billion dollars-abou t Si,028m in all. Capital Expenditures On capital account Commonwealth specific purpose payments to the States will this year be S319m- a 28% increase on last year's figure. This includes S69m for capital expenditure on education to which I have referred. It includes also $160m under the Commonwealth Aid Roads arrangements and more than S6m for beef cattle roads and the Gordon River road in Tasmania. For railway standardisation projects in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, more than $37m is to be provided. Over $6m is included for Tasmanian hydroelectric development and $5m for the South Australian natural gas pipeline. Natural disaster payments of a capital nature will approach $13m. Other payments will be made for water conservation, rural development and health and welfare. These specific purpose payments are additional to the funds the Commonwealth borrows or provides from its own resources for State works and housing programmes. These programmes will this year total $677m or 5% more than last year. When it approved this amount, the Loan Council also agreed that the borrowing programmes for S.ate semi-governmental authorities should be increased by 16% to S3Ilm. The effective increase was actually greater than this because the Loan Council agreed that these programmes should in future apply only to authorities seeking more than $300,000 within the financial year. Previously, the limit was $200,000. The semi-governmental authorities arrange their own borrowings. It is significant, however, that the combined borrowing programmes of the States and their authorities for capital works and housing in this financial year will be close to $ 1,000m. In addition, as I they will receive revenue assistance from the Commonwealth of more than one billion dollars. Expenditure on Commonv.eal-.h capital works and services will rise this year by 9% to $516m. The largest single item is Post Office capital works, on which expenditure will rise by 17% to $240m. I want to refer to the Post Office in detail later. Here I point out that the net requirement from the Budget tofinancethis expenditure will be $18lm. The remaining S59m will be provided from internal Post Office sources, mainly depreciation funds. Most of the capital expenditure this year will be for extending and improving telephone services. In our quick-growing economy, demand for services involving new lines rose by about 12% last year. With the growth of traffic, trunk and local networks have to be extended and improved. New Post Office buildings are also needed and some existing buildings require remodelling or replacement to cope with expanding business. Capital expenditure for civil aviation will total more than $35m- a 23% increase on last year. Most of this will be for airport development, mainly at Sydney and Tullamarine. More will be spent also on navigational aids and equipment. Expenditure by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-e!ectric Authority will taper off. It is estimated at less than $42m-nearl y $7m less than last year's expenditure. For works in the Australian Capital Territory $56m is being provided-$4 m more than last year. In the Northern Territory works expenditure will be $27m. On beef cattle roads in the Northern Territory expenditure is estimated to exceed $3m. Two new projects estimated to cost $4,650,000 will be started-one , the Daly Waters to Cape Crawford road and the other, the restoration and sealing of the road from the Barkly Highway to Anthony's Lagoon. There are increased provisions also for the Commonwealth Railways, chiefly for rolling stock for the Sydney-Perth standard gauge service; for the Broadcasting and Television Services; and for other items such as computer equipment for the Bureau of Meteorology and the Bureau of Census have pointed out, and Statistics. NA Because of the number who have already taken advantage of the War Service Homes Scheme, it seems likely that there will be fewer applicants for advances this year. The provision has therefore been reduced to $45.5m, which Ls SI3.6m less than the amount disbursed last year. We shall seek additional funds if the amount now being provided proves insufficient. Running Costs of Business Undertakings The running costs of business undertakings-the Post Office, the Commonwealth Railways and the Broadcasting and Television Services-ad d heavily to Budget expenditures, though in total the outlays will be more than offset by revenues earned. Together, these costs are expected to increase by 10% to $4I0m. Assistance to Industry Expenditures on assistance to industry are estimated to rise this year by 28% to $230m. The group includes bounties and subsidies, support of industrial research and assistance to the Queensland sugar industry. With increasing sales, ties and subsidies on phosphate and nitrogenous fertilisers are expected to rise by nearly $7m to almost $40m. The average export price for wheat from the 1966-67 crop is expected to be above the previous year's level and it is estimated that this will reduce the Commonwealth payment into the Wheat Prices Stabilisation Fund this year by $3m to SI3m. Under arrangements made last year, an amount of almost S20m is to be made available to the State of Queensland to enable it to meet interest and repayment obligations in respect of advances by the Reserve Bank to the Queensland Sugar Board in respect of 1966 season No. 1 Pool sugar. We have decided to provide further assistance to the State to enable it to provide assistance to the sugar industry in respect of the 1967 sugar crop. The provision we are making for this purpose is $10m. Depending on prices realised for export sales we are pared to increase this assistance up to a total amount not exceeding $15m. The assistance we are providing in respect of both the 1966 and 1967 crops will be repayable by the State in future years. Administrative and Other Expenditures I come now to the residual group of penditures which in ali are estimated increase by 4% to $689m. They include the running costs of Commonwealth Departments, estimated to rise by 9 per cent to $378m. Debt charges are estimated to rise by 8% to SI02m. Current expenditures in the Territories other than Papua and New Guinea-that is, in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the minor territories-ar e estimated to increase by 16% to $52m. This excludes educational costs covered by the figures for education I have already mentioned. I add that we are providing SI.4m for operational expenditure and $I.2m for capital expenditure on a programme due to come into effect at the beginning of 1968, to increase facilities for the education of aboriginal children in the Northern Territory. These increases are substantially offset by reductions in other expenditures. Payments amounting to S27m were made last year to finance drawings in Australian currency by other countries from the International boun- Monetary Fund. No provision has been made for similar payments this year. Expenditure on the introduction of decimal currency is expected to decrease by 50% to S8m. Aboriginal People I mention at this point that the action to be taken by the Commonwealth in relation to aborigines, following the approval by referendum of an amendment of Section 51 (26) of the Constitution, is now under detailed and careful consideration by the Government. The Commonwealth's object will be to co-operate with the States to ensure that together we act in the best interests of our aboriginal people. Immigration Population growth is vital to our development. We are providing $25m this year for assisted passages and $5m to Commonpre- wealth Hostels Limited as a contribution towards the accommodation costs of migrants. In addition, S3.9m is being provided for improvements at migrant hostels -$2.5 m more than last year. We attach the greatest importance to maintaining our immigration programme at a high level. It is, however, becoming increasingly diffiexcult to attract migrants to this country. Beto cause of Europe's increasing prosperity, interest in migration has declined there. Moreover, British migration, until now the mainstay of the programme, has been falling off. Special steps have already been taken to stimulate migration from Europe. Last year we offered additional assistance towards passage costs and recently, by increasing our own assistance, we eliminated the last of the arrangements requiring certain categories of migrants to take oui loans to meet part of their passage costs. The immigration target will be maintained at last year's figure of 148,000 settlers, including 92,000 assisted migrants. This programme is designed to yield about 70,000 workers a year. Retirement Pensions and Allowances Retirement pensions and allowances have been reviewed by the Government. The last adjustment to pensions payable to retired members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund was made in 1963, when the proportion of pension payable from Consolidated Revenue was increased to the amount that would bave been payable if the pensioners had retired at the end of 1959. Those who have retired since 1959 have not received any increase in their pensions despite the large since then in salary levels. The Government has decided that the Consolidated Revenue proportion of existlast ing pensions should be brought up to the the amount that would have been payable greater-abou t if retirement had taken place on 30th 1967. This will be of considerable benefit to former Commonwealth officers and bers of the Permanent Defence Forces, and their widows. The estimated cost is $7.7m for a full year and $5.45m in 1967-68; this will be offset to some extent by reductions in entitlement to social serand vice benefits. A comparable adjustment will also be made in existing pensions under the liamentary Retiring Allowances Act, at an estimated cost of $85,000 in a full year $60,000 in 1967-68. Summary of Expenditure Before leaving expenditure, 1 think it would be helpful to indicate under broad functional groupings the proportion the main groups bear to the total amount of $6,483m: Defence 17% of the total Social Services, Health and Repatriation . . 21% of the total Revenue Assistance io States .. 16% of the total Capital Expenditure {including State works and housing and specific purpose payments to States) .. l i % of the total Administrative and all Other Expenditures not elsewhere included . . .. 2J% of the total 100% NA As I said earlier, we expect receipts from all soirrces, except borrowings, to be about $5,887m. With expenditure of S6,483m increases there will be a gap of SS96m. Mainly because we expect economic conditions this year to be more buoyant than year, we estimate that the rate of increase in total taxation revenues will be 8%, compared with June last year's 6%. Details of the Estimates of Receipts are contained in Statememment No. 4 attached to the Speech. The central objective of the Budget is to promote conditions favourable to sound and efficient growth, with consumer spending private capital outlays rising steadily. To avoid overstraining our resources we have put a close limit on the rise in Budget Parexpenditures We do not think the added restraint of a general increase in taxation and necessary to restrain demand. Postal and some other charges will be increased; but they are directly related to the increasing costs and outlays of the Post Office and other Departments and to the necessity to provide increased and expanded services. They are not general taxation measures. On the other hand we have not felt that general reductions in taxation are needed. We are therefore leaving the general level of taxation unchanged. What we have done is to survey the whole field of taxation in order to ensure that, as far as it was financially practicable, we would provide concessions wherever we felt there was a real need and benefits could and should be given, especially for those with family responsibilities. I shall now ex-plain these concessions. NA Income Tax NA The allowances for maintenance of dependants have remained unchanged since the financial year 1957-58 and in that time their value to taxpayers with families has diminished a good deal. We have decided to increase the allowances by $26 a year. The increase will apply over the whole range of these allowances. To give some examples, the allowance for a wife will be increased from $286 to $312, for one child under sixteen years from $182 to $208, and for other children under sixteen years from $130 to $156. The higher allowances will apply in assessments based on income of the current income year 1967-68. For salary and wage earners they will be taken into account in reduced tax instalment deductions expected to come into operation on or about lst October next. NA NA It is proposed to raise to $ 1,200 the mum allowance for payments by a taxpayer as fire or flood. for insurance or superannuation cover for himself and his famiiy. The limit is now $800. NA The age pension means test was liberaof lised last April. As a corollary to this, it proposed to increase the amount of income that aged persons may derive free of income tax. In the past, the age allowance has been related to an aged person's net income from incurred. all sources, which is quite often a different amount from his taxable income and this has often been misunderstood by the taxpayers concerned. We propose to remove this complication for 1967-68 by basing the allowance on taxable income instead of net income. For 1967-68 no tax will be payable by an aged person whose taxable income does not exceed $1,196. For a married person qualified by age no tax will be payable unless the combined taxable incomes of the husband and wife exceed $2,106. The qualifying age for the allowance is sixty years for women and sixty-five years for men. Aged persons will benefit in two ways. The amount of the allowance is being raised by $126 and its value is being enhanced because income not taxable will be disregarded and deductions for medical and other deductible expenses will be allowed in the calculation of the allowance. NA In the last two Budgets temporary measures were adopted for wool growers who were forced by drought to advance shearing dates and shear their sheep twice in the one year. The measures permitted the proceeds of the advanced clip to be taxed in the year in which tax would ordinarily be payable on them. It is proposed to continue these measures for 1967-68 and future years. It is also proposed to extend them to wool growers who are forced to advance shearmaxiing dates by otber natural disasters, such Some time ago I announced that the special 20% depreciation allowances on primary production plant would be continued beyond their present termination date 30th June 1967. It is now proposed to is continue the allowances without placing any limit of time as to their operation. A further proposal is that the cost of erecting sub-divisional fences be allowed as a deduction in the year in which it is The final proposal affecting primary producers relates to forced sales of livestock due lo fire, drought or flood. Under the present law a primary producer may elect that the net proceeds of these sales be taxed over five years if the proceeds are used principally in replacing the stock that has been sold. An alternative method of accounting for the proceeds is proposed in relation to sales in the 1967-68 income year and subsequent years. Under this proposal, a primary producer may elect that the profits of a forced sale be applied to reduce the value of replacement stock for taxation purposes. The broad effects of an election will be to defer tax on the profits until the stock has been replaced and sales are made in the normal course of business. Sales Tax A review of sales tax exemptions and classifications has disclosed a need for some adjustments in the light of technological and other developments. It is proposed, in a Bill to be introduced later this evening, to effect a number of such adjustments. Some will result in the extension of present exemptions, some in their withdrawal and others will vary the classification for rating purposes. Stamp Duties in the Australian Capital Territory It is also proposed, during 1967-68, to introduce legislation to impose stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory. The duties will become payable from a date to be announced later. Effect on Revenue It is estimated that these proposals will result in a net cost to revenue of $ 17.5m in 1967-68 and $37m in a full year. The cost for 1967-68 is mainly attributable to the proposed increase in allowances for dependants. ADDITIONAL. REVENUE PROPOSALS We are also, as I have indicated, proposing some increases in revenue charges, the most notable being those of the Post Office. These proposals are, as I have said, related to particular purposes and are not general revenue measures. Post Office Charges and Financial Arrangements During 1967-68, the expected higher level of business activity and of housing development will place increasingly heavy demands on the Post Office. When speaking of the capital expenditures from this Budget, I said that Post Office capital works this year would require an amount of $240m, of which $181m will be the net requirement provided from this Budget. The Post Office also faces the problem of rising costs in running its services. It continues to install the latest technical equipment and to improve operating methods and techniques. By these means, productivity has been steadily improved, as is shown by the fact that business done has increased faster than staff numbers. For example, between 1959 and 1966 the postal staff increased by 10% but handled 31% more traffic. By their nature, however, the services provided by the Post Oflice require a lot of labour and labour costs have gone on rising. This year it is estimated that Post Office wage and salary costs will rise by more than $19m. Of this increase, over $13m is due to the increases awarded in the National Wage Cases and other recent arbitration decisions, including the full year cost of the Interim Margins Award. When higher prices for materials used and other cost increases are also brought to account, the Post Office will be headed for a loss of over $40m in this financial year if charges are not increased as proposed. Financing a loss of this order would pose a serious budgetary problem. Without the estimated increase revenue of $36m to be obtained from the higher charges, the net call of the Post Office on the Budget this year would, it estimated, rise from $181m to $217m. in There has been no general increase in postal tariffs or telephone local call fee trunk charges, since 1959. With one or two minor exceptions, the increases in charges now proposed are the same as those put before Parliament towards the end of the last financial year. They are to operate from lst October next. The adjustments proposed are expected to yield in 1967-68 an additional $36m in Post Office revenue, or $17m less than if they had been introduced from 1st July as originally planned. They will yield $64m in a full year. Other changes of an accounting and procedural kind are proposed to help Post Office operate as a business underbusiness taking. The Post Office is required to duct its operations in accordance with best business practice. The Government is convinced that this objective better served if the financial machinery of the Post Office were changed from the standard Treasury and Departmental system to a commercial form more suited to business requirements. After a thorough study the Government has decided to create a Post Office Trust Account into which Post Office revenues will be paid and from which its expenditures will be met. The Department's net requirements for capital purposes each year will be provided annually under one-line appropriations from the Budget and paid to the Trust Account. The Department will thus operate its own trading account, but will remain subject to the control of the Postmaster General and, of course, of Parliament. The new arrangements will, in fact, give Parliament greater opportunities to examine in affairs of ihe Posi Office. Its commercial accounts and annual report will, as now, be tabled in Parliament each year. An innois vation will be the tabling at Budget time Parliament of a White Paper giving estimates of commercial results and expectaand tions, the proposed capital programme, together with the way it is to be financed, and other information on Post Office affairs. Further information concerning the proposed new financial arrangements will be given shortly by the Postmaster-General, and legislation will be introduced during the current financial year with the objective of having the new administrative arrangements operate from Ist July 1968. While it has important national obligations to meet, the Post Office sbould earn sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs over a period of years. It is the reasonable also that its earnings as a undertaking should make some concontribution towards the expansion of the the telecommunications network. Some retention of profit for capital purposes is stanwould be dard business practice. Against this background the Government decided to increase Post Office charges. Air Navigation Charges and Passenger Service Charge In accordance with the policy of progressively recovering from the air transport industry a greater proportion of the large and increasing cost of providing, maintaining and operating airports and airway facilities, the Government has decided to increase by 10% the rates of air navigation charges payable by all aircraft operators. These increases will take effect from 1st January 1968 and are estimated to bring in $257,000 additional income in 1967-68 and $893,000 m a full year. The rates of air navigation charges have the been increased by 10% in each of the last five years. Despite this, the gap between the amount that it costs the Commonwealth annually to provide aviation facilities for the industry, and the amount of revenue received annually from the industry for the use of these facilities, has continued to widen. Thus general taxpayers, rather than the aviation industry and the users of air services, are required to meet the cost of these facilities to an increasing extent. The Government has decided that additional measures are necessary if this trend is to be arrested and further progress made towards the objective of requiring commercial aviation to meet an increasing share of the cost of facilities provided for it at public expense and properly attributable to it. It has therefore been decided, in addition to increasing air navigation charges, to introduce a passenger service charge which will be payable by passengers on both domestic and international air services. Details of the scheme will be announced at an appropriate time by the Minister for Civil Aviation. Legislation to give effect to it will be introduced during the current financial year. The charge will be calculated to yield revenue of between $4m and $5m a year at present traffic levels. NA I said earlier that estimated expenditures of $6,483m will exceed estimated receipts of $5,887m by $596m. This amount will have to be covered by net borrowings at home and abroad. This 'financing gap' between expenditures and receipts is not the same as the Loan Council borrowing programmes for State works and housing which this year total $677m-5 % more than last year. In last year's buoyant monetary conditions, net cash p^>ceeds of public loans in Ausgations tralia totalled S646m and those of oversea loans, $52m, giving total proceeds 3699m. With redemptions a. home and abroad of S393m the net proceeds were S306m. Despite the relative easiness of last year's domestic loan market, the Commonwealth had to subscribe from its own budgetary resources for the States just on $90m to complete the Loan Council borrowing programmes. We do not expect the domestic loan market to be more buoyant this year than last. We must also eonsider the increased semi-governmental borrowing programmes for State semi-governmental authorities which, at $31 lm, exceed last year's programmes by $43m. It is practically certain that the State works and housing programmes will again make a heavy call on our Budget this year. Part of the borrowing requirement arising will be met by net drawings on the credit arrangements for defence purchases in the United States-this year estimated at $123m compared with last year's $91m. That will leave another $473m to be borrowed from other sources. The comparable figure in 1966-67 was rather less at $444m. We will continue to borrow abroad on acceptable terms. At present, however, the European dollar market is the only source of new money we can feel reasonably sure about and I must emphasise that this is a sensitive and crowded market. We intend to maintain the good position we have established in this market and to make any other borrowings abroad that prove practicable; but it would be a delusion to suppose that great sums can readily be borrowed overseas. There is another side to this story: the the weight of maturities and repayment oblion our external debt is now heavy and oversea capital markets being what of they are, refinancing is difficult. So far as our borrowing prospects abroad can be assessed, we would expect redemptions again to exceed new loan proceeds although to a smaller extent than last year when the excess was $82m. The amount then remaining to be covered by net borrowings in Australia should not exceed the net S527m borrowed locally last year. We cannot estimate with any accuracy how much of the amount to be raised locally will come from the Australian public. We shall aim at raising as much as we can from that source. We can be sure that a considerable amount will come directly or indirectly from the banking system. In all probability, some borrowing from the Reserve Bank will be necessary. The substantial direct payments abroad financed from the Budget will, however, have offsetting monetary effects. Here let me refer to the July cash loan against the background of the amount of about $473m that I said we would have to borrow locally. July Cash Loan Although liquidity is at a seasonal low at this time of the year, our 1966-67 borrowby ing programme has opened well with a very successful July cash loan. We raised $129m which was nearly 50% more than in last year's first cash loan. It was also encouraging to see that almost three-quarters of the subscriptions to the loan were in the long or extra long term securities. NA We cannot measure precisely either the monetary effects or the economic impact of the Budget. What we can do to assist interpretation is to break down the estimates into economic categories. This is done in Statement No. 6 attached to the Speech which sets out the estimates in the national accounts form. In this form, the estimates are comparable wilh the national accounting statistics for the economy as a whole. Expenditure on goods and services, which adds directly to demand, is distinguished from transfers such as pensions, and loans, which add to the capacity of the recipients to spend. Direct payments abroad are separated from those that make demands on domestic resources. Receipts are analysed as between those that are likely to offset the effects of the Budget spending and those that are not. Finally, the national accounting presentation gives a general indication of the extent to which demand-increasing outlay will exceed or fall short of demand-reducing receipts. So presented, the estimates indicate that total Budget outlay will this year increase by 10% compared with an increase of nearly 12% last year. This outlay includes direct payments abroad. Mainly because of defence commitments, these external payments are estimated to rise to $652m or $I47m more than last year. Outlay within Australia is estimated at $5,554m and will exceed estimated receipts only a small margin. Receipts include an estimated $330m of revenue which is expected to result from the growth of incomes and economic activity. This revenue being itself the consequence of the economic expansion expected this year will not have offsetting effects on those Budget outlays that add to incomes and spending in Australia. At the beginning of this Speech I said I would say something to you about the prospects-immediat e and long-term. Let me say we are confident that the effects of this Budget, combined with the steady rise in private spending for both consumption and investment, will keep the economy growing at a healthy rate and will keep resources tully employed. The Budget will help us achieve our central aim, which is to strengthen the economy and give greater scope for private spending. As the year goes on, the Government will as always be ready to meet particular needs or eventualities. Monetary policy can and will be used as necessary to help keep the economy on the right course. In our view businessmen can with confidence make plans with the expectation that the economy will continue to grow steadily. Indeed, if we all plan in this way our expectations are the more likely to be realised. Even the most cautious amongst us can scarcely fail to be confident of the future of this country. Vast new discoveries resources are becoming almost a commonwe place. In this recent phase, each discovery has inspired further effort and further effort has led to new discoveries. As far ahead as we can see Australia has all the potentialities for sustained growth and we in Australia are in truth making creditable efforts ourselves. I this against the background that we plough back a quarter of all we produce into inbefore vestment for the future, allocate 5% are equally great too. of our national production for defence, and make a large contribution to international assistance. This I repeat is a worthy and creditable effort. These efforts together with these great natural resources are the source and foundation of growth. There are, loo, other pre-conditions of growth we cannot afford to neglect and there are many questions we should ask. Our workforce is growing and gaining in competence. Is it growing fast enough for all the tasks now crowding upon us? Management has a critically important task to fulfil. Is management everywhere doing of the job national greatness demands? Are mobilising the capital we are accumulating and allocating it to tihe right uses? Are we sufficiently conscious of the critical necessity to control costs of production? Are we efficient? To ask these and other questions is not to belittle the achievements of those who are in fact finding the say answers to our problems. They simply remind us that if the opportunities that lie us are great, the efforts they demand In 1966-67, the excess of Commonwealth met from borrowings-wa s $535 million. This Expenditures, receipts and the excess of as follows: Receipts Excess of expenditures over receipts (ii) Excludes the effects of changes in accounting expenditures in 1966-67 by about $30 million.

15,Mr HULME,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Petrie-Postmaster General and Vice-President of the Executive Council) [9.22]- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. As my colleague, the Treasurer (Mr MCMahon), indicated when presenting the Budget for 1967-68, the Government proposes to amend the Post and Telegraph Rates Act to provide for increases in a range of postal and telegraph charges. Honourable members will recall that the Senate has twice rejected such measures, which dealt with certain basic charges, and disallowed regulations covering a range of other charges. There can be no question that these increases are necessary and the Government is concerned about the financial effect of further delay in the introduction of the new rates. In addition to this Bill, I will shortly be introducing further legislation dealing with those rates previously the subject of regulations. It is the Government's intention that the full range of new charges be open to debate during consideration of this first Bill. I am presenting statements showing in detail the proposed adjustments in postal and telecommunications charges. These include not only those covered by this legislation but also those adjustments which will be the subject of the further*Bill. The Government is proposing that all the new rates take effect from lst October next. When these matters were last before the House I stressed that, although the Post has obligations of service to the community, it is also a national business which should pay its way. The Government views 30 as a business investment the substantial capital funds provided from annual Budgets States for the expansion of the Post Office's services, and expects the Post Office, like 1967. any other business, to earn sufficient for revenue from the sale of its services at least to cover its costs, including interest on This leads me to refer to another statement made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech regarding the Government's decision to create a Post Office trust account. Appropriate legislation to enable the introduction of this new financial arrangement as from 1st July 1968 will be brought down in due course. It will, however, enable honourable members to view the Post Office tariffs and finances in better perspective if I outline briefly the changes proposed and the main reasons for them. The Post Office is continually involved in making business judgments and decisions, it must react quickly to variations in demand for its services, and it is subject to the added discipline of planning its expenditure with an eye to the revenue and the net financial out-turn it will yield, as well as to the service rendered to the community. While the Government and Post Office management recognise all this and expect the Post Office to conduct its affairs on a business basis, it nevertheless still operates within the same financial machinery as any other department of state. The Post Office is required to pay all of its revenue into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and it must draw all of the funds it needs for operating and capital purposes from annual parliamentary appropriations. These financial arrangements are not suited to the operations of a business undertaking and in fact detract from the ability of the Post Office to operate efficiently on a business basis. They also pose difficulties, rather than assist, in bringing about effective parliamentary control and public understanding of the Post Office's finances. The new financial arrangements will do much to remove these difficulties and will provide for the Post Office to operate its own trading account into which all its revenues will be paid and from which all expenses, both capital and operating, will be met. Because of the likely levels of capital investment required, particularly in the telecommunications area, the revenues of the Post Office will not be sufficient to meet all its needs in any year. It will be dependent therefore upon Parliament for its cash requirements over and above its revenues, and requests for additional funds, or net borrowings, will be dealt with through the normal Budget procedures and the Estimates debate. To give a better appreciation of its operations and prospects, the Post Office will submit a White Paper to Parliament at the Budget session each year outlining its affairs generally and including estimates of its commercial results for the year, the proposed capital programme, and the method of financing it. There will still be presented an annual report, together with financial statements and the report thereon of the Auditor-General. The Post Office will thus be still subject to parliamentary and ministerial control and honourable members should be in a position to be much better informed than under the present system. It is against this background of the Post Office being regarded as a business enterprise and the Government's intention to give it business-type financial arrangements, that the measures I am now bringing before the House sbould be considered. When these matters were before the House recently, I outlined in some detail the nature and scope of the proposed new charges, and I do not intend to go into the same detail again. Since the matter was last dealt with in the House, however, several changes have been made in the proposals, and I will, of course, deal with them fully. It needs t'o be emphasised that there have been no overall increases in postage rates for eight years, since the basic postage rate of 5d was introduced in 1959. In fact, the only significant change has been the reduction in the basic rate to 4c at the time of the changeover to decimal currency last year. This has so far cost the postal service almost $lm in lower revenue. Although there have been continual improvements in efficiency and productivity, in recent years it has not been possible to absorb the increases in wage rates which have been granted to postal staff. Consequently, losses on postal operations bave occurred and are increasing rapidly. The postal service was able to maintain a breakeven financial position over the five year period from 1959-60 to 1963-64, averaging a profit of about $900,000. In 1964-65, however, a loss of $2.6m was incurred and this was followed in 1965-66 by a loss of $10.3m. The loss incurred in 1966-67 is expected to exceed $20m and in the currentfinancialyear, with current postal tariffs and allowing for a continuation of recent cost trends, might exceed $30m. Over the last two years, the extra wages payable as a result of variations to awards totalled more than $12m compared with an increase of only $7m in postal revenue in the same period. Awards have already added almost $6m to postal service costs this financial year, the recent national wage decision alone adding S2m. Increases in postal rates are required to offset these increasing losses. Australian postage rates compare more than favourably with those in other countries, especially when allowance is made for the huge size of our continent and the scattered nature of a large proportion of our population. A proposal for a 6c basic postage rate, equivalent to 5.7c Australian, is before the United States Congress at present; and I understand that the British Post Office is considering an increase to 5d, equivalent to 5.2c Australian. The United States Post Office this financial year is expected to have a deficit of $ 1,800m. The basic postal rate for letters in the European Economic Community countries is 7c Australian and each country concerned is recording a continuing loss in mail service operations. For example, the West German Post Office last year incurred a loss in its mail operations of $A90m. The proposed changes in postal rates and conditions are set out in the statethe ments which I have circulated. The most important single change is the increase in the basic postage rate from 4c to 5c. As I have already said, I do not intend to repeat the detailed explanations of the various postal rate proposals I gave viously, for no alterations have been made to the increases I submitted earlier in year, except in respect of postage tions discounts. The postage discounts of up to 25% will be welcomed by the business comcovered munity. These will be available to large users who reduce Post Office handling costs by presorting their mail and by meeting certain other posting conditions concerning make-up and transmission. The discount allowed will vary according the size of the consignment and the offset amount of presorting by the customer. Two variations have been made to the discount conditions previously submitted. Firstly, the minimum quantity of mail which must be posted to be eligible for 5% discount has been reduced from 5,000 to 2,500. This change will allow many smaller firms to participate in the scheme. Secondly, postings in large envelopes, well as those in small and medium size standard envelopes, will be eligible for discounts. The inclusion of postcodes in the addresses on discount mail will be a requirement from lst October 1968. A variation has also been made to the postage discount which it is proposed io apply to the householder mail service, by which articles addressed to 'The Householder' or similar title are delivered to each point in a designated area. At present a flat 30% discount applies. Earlier proposals envisaged a flat 40% discount, but the Government now proposes a 40% discount on articles up to 2 oz in weight and a 60% discount on articles over 2 oz. A survey has shown that thb will not incur a loss of revenue. On the contrary, the increased business that will result is expected to increase it. Attention is also drawn to the revised date of effect of new size limits for enveloped mail eligible for conveyance by air free of airmail fees within Australia and its Territories under Operation Post Haste. This will be effective from lst October 1967. FuH details are set out in statements which I am presenting. It will be necessary for the proposed increases in domestic rates to be applied to several international rates for surface mail. The price for aerogrammes will also be preincreased from 9c to 10c. These will be effected by Executive action as authorised the by the Post and Telegraph Act. The variain postal charges which I have outlined, together with those which will be dealt with in detail in a further Bill and some miscellaneous charges which will be by administrative action, will, if introduced on lst October 1967, bring in additional earnings of approximately $22m in 1967-68 and $30m in the first full year. It will be appreciated that the additional to earnings of $22m in 1967-68 will not now the predicted loss, at current tariffs, of at least $30m. If the new tariffs had operated from lst July last the postal service could well have broken even during 1967-68. Even with the tariff adjustments a now proposed it is estimated that a loss exceeding $10m will be incurred in 1968-9. This figure is, in fact, higher than the estimate I gave to the House when this as matter was last debated. Before the end of the financial year it could only have been an estimate. The Department is continuing to explore all means of arresting the loss trend in the postal service, but because it is a labour intensive enterprise these efforts are largely nullified by the continued wage increases granted to Post Office employees along with other members of the community. In the circumstances, it would appear that our experience may be similar to that in, for example, the United Kingdom where a select parliamentary committee drawn from all parties concluded in a report of February 1967: . . . the need for periodic tariff increases appears to your Committee to be inescapable if the general standards of the postal services are to be preserved. The telecommunication tariff proposals in this Bill cover only increases in telegram rates. Telephone call fees and trunk rates, together with some adjustment of charges for miscellaneous telecommunication facilities and services, will be dealt with in the further Bill I have already mentioned. Apart from a minor adjustment in 1964, telegram rates have not been altered since 1956. The telegram servics is operating at a loss und it is proposed to increase telegram rates by 20%. The new charges for ordinary rate messages will be 36c for the first 12 words and 3c for each additional word, compared with the current rates of 30c for the first 12 words and 5c for each additional two words. The revised telegram rates will bring in additional revenues of about $600,000 in 1967-68 and $lm in a full year, but the telegram service will continue to operate at a toss. In the White Paper presented recently the British House of Commons outlining certain changes within the British Post the Office, this paragraph was included: The Corporation will inherit a number lic services which cannot be made financially viable at any reasonable level of charge. The outstanding example is the inland telegraph service, which has run at a loss for many decades cannot hope to pay for itself as its use continues to decline. Obligations of this kind are normally taken into account when financial targets are fixed. I found during my recent visit overseas that the problems faced by the Australian Post Office have a parallel in almost every adjourned. country in the world-namely , that telephone services are generally profitable, but profits are dwindling each year, telegraph services show a small but continuing loss, and postal services invariably at a great loss. Every administration has, or is, considering increasing its charges, not only for mail services but for others too, because other profits are becoming smaller each year. All administrations are looking forward to some mechanisation to handle the mails more speedily and economically. There is no doubt in my mind that Australia's communication services compare favourably with those of other countries, particularly as we have the problem of a large area and a small and scattered population outside the capital cities and principal provincial centres. The electronic mail coding equipment Australia is using is undoubtedly the best in the world. The nearest approach to its efficiency and sophistication I saw was in Germany where it is still in very limited use. It has always been held by succeeding governments, irrespective of their politics, that the Post Office should be operated as a business undertaking and that those who use the services should pay for them. For this reason it has been the custom for measures varying Post Office charges to be given free passage through both Houses of Parliament. The previous Bill to vary certain charges, whilst it passed this House, was rejected twice in another place. Similarly, regulations to amend certain other charges were rejected by the Senate in an unprecedented special sitting. It is quite apparent to the Government that this action was taken for political purposes only-a n endeavour, in fact, to gain poliin tical kudos from the Australian people. What it has done in the result is to reduce ability of the Post Office this year to be reasonably profitable and perhaps to affect of pubadversely the essential services being demanded by the Australian public. It would be interesting to have an explanation and by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) of the reason why the Australian Labor Party has changed its Post Office philosophy. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Webb) NA REGULATIONS BILL 1967 Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Hulme, are operated and read afirsttime. Second Reading",83
16,Mr HULME,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Petrie - Postmaster General and Vice-President of the Executive Council) [9.43]- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Postal, Telephone, Telegraph and Picturegram Regulations in order to vary the charges for certain Post Office services. Provision is made also for the introduction of a special mail despatch service. In addition, the opportunity is being taken to convert to decimal currency equivalents, where necessary, money amounts specified in these Regulations. The changes are the same as those which were the subject of regulations recently disallowed in the Senate. Under the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, they cannot be again presented in the same form within a period of six months from the date of disallowance. It is for this reason that it has become necessary to deal with the changes in the form of legislation. I would point out that, although this Bill replaces action by regulation, the method of fixing tariffs in the future will be covered in the Bill to be introduced in due course in connection with the new financial arrangements for the Post Office. The amended postal charges relate to miscellaneous facilities and services are the same as those previously proposed for introduction on 1st July. These are set out in full in the statements circulated refer to a new special mail despatch service to operate from lst October this year, development. commission on money orders, fees on some postal orders and charges for philatelic services. Honourable members will recall that in previously announcing the introducfees tion of a special mail despatch service, pointed out that it was designed for highly urgent mail between the business areas capital cities. This service will allow mail posted at specified locations after normal mail closing time to be available tion or to be delivered early the following morning in all but the most distant capital cities. I come now to charges for telecommuniments cation services. It will be appreciated that telecommunication costs in recent years have been affected significantly by higher wage rates and by the capital charges associated with expenditure on new facilirates ties. It is necessary to take heed of the current trend in the operating results of telecommunication services. Taken together, telephone and telegraph services showed a profit of $10.2m in 1965-66, most of the expenditure and revenues being associated with telephone facilities. Higher wage rates and other increased costs are expected to result in only a marginal profit in 1966-67 and, unless telecommunication charges are increased, a loss of some millions of dollars will be inevitable this year. The dependence of the business community and the public generally on the Post Office for adequate and effective communication services places a heavy responsibility on the Post Office. With these growing needs is associated a corresponding demand for capital and it is also for this reason that increases in some telecommunication tariffs are inevitable. About 95% of the proposed Budget appropriation of $240m for Post Office capital works in 1967-68 will be spent on telecommunication facilities. Demand for telephone services rose by about 12% last financial year and, with local telephone calls and trunk traffic increasing steeply, the capital needs for telecommunications will almost certainly show a sharp rise in future years. Apart and from connecting new services, the major emphasis is on providing improved facilities and services to the existing 2,200,000 and subscribers within the network who derive increasing benefit from this continued The telecommunication tariff proposals in this Bill cover increases in telephone call and trunk rates together with some I adjustment of charges for miscellaneous telecommunication facilities and services, of some of which will be dealt with by administrative action. All of these proposed adjustments are detailed in the statements for collecwhich have been distributed. With regard to telephone charges, the local call fee is to be increased from 3J cents to 4 cents, with corresponding adjustin trunk call fees. This is the first increase in call charges for eight years, apart from a few minor variations in trunk call fees at the time of introduction of decimal currency. There are variations to the trunk previously intimated to the House. These now provide for uniform three minute rates for all trunk calls from subscribers services, irrespective of whether they are booked through an operator or subscriber-dialled; there is no change in the principle that with STD calls the subscriber pays only for the time he speaks. The variations will mean that earnings from this source will be $3m less in a full year than proposed earlier. The adjustments in charges for miscellaneous telecommunications facilities, which include a reduction in the rates for the longer distance private telegraph lines, will increase overall earnings in this area by about 20%. Overall, increased telecommunication tariffs including those covered by the earlier Bill will bring in additional earnings of about S26m in 1967-68 and $34m in a full year. However, in 1967-68 additional cash receipts will be only Si4m because of the six monthly billing cycle for most accounts. I have already, in this session, dealt at some length with the nnancial position of the postal service and I will not take up the time of the'""House by repeating these details. I am sure that honourable members will agree that, in the light of the mation already placed before them, any further delay in the introduction of new charges would have a serious effect on Post Office operations. It is proposed, therefore, that the increased charges covered by this Bill should take effect from lst October this year. These increases in a full year are expected to bring in additional earnings of about $34m-$4 m postal and $30m telecommunications. I commend the Bill to honourable members.

The Australian Loan Council decided at its meeting last June that the borrowing proAir gramme for States works and housing for [9.54]- I move: 1967-68 should be $677m. Within the limits of this borrowing programme the States themselves have nominated the proportion of the funds that they wish to receive as advances for housing. Thus, with Loan Council approval. an amount of $122,840,000 will be made available to the States thisfinancialyear in accordance with the provisions of the Housing Agreement Act 1966. These advances will be repayable over 53 years and bear interest at 1% per annum below the long-term bond rate. The distribution, by States, is as follows: $ New South Wales . . 43,080,000 Victoria 33,000,000 Queensland 9,060,000 South Australia 21,000,000 Western Australia 10,000,000 Tasmania 6,700,000 Total 122,840,000 This Bill seeks the necessary authority for the Treasurer (Mr MCMahon) to borrow the amount of $122,840,000 in question. Last financial year advances to the States under the Housing Agreement amounted to infor- $120m. This year the amounts nominated by the States represent, in aggregate, an increase of a little more than 2%. As honourable members will be aware the current Housing Agreement continues the provision that requires each State to appropriate at least 30% of the advances they receive to a Home Builders' Account from which loans for private home building are made available through building societies and other approved institutions. The balance of the advances is used by the for the erection of homes either for rental or for sale to families with low or moderate incomes. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) BILL (No. 3) 1967 Bill presented by Mr Howson, and read a first time. Second Reading",88
18,Mr HOWSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Fawkner-Minister for and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to give effect to the sales tax alterations which the Treasurer (Mr MCMahon) foreshadowed in the Budget Speech. As the Treasurer mentioned, a review has revealed a need for some adjustments to sales tax exemptions and classifications. With the rapid strides of modern technology there is the inevitable flow of new products and new techniques that could not be envisaged when many of the existing exemption and classification provisions were incorporated in the sales tax schedules. This Bill is designed to effect various alterations that are now considered necessary in the light of technological and other developments. A number of the new exemptions will benefit persons engaged in primary industry or in handling primary produce. Among this group of exemptions are gas welding equipment for use in agricultural industry, machines for grading, sorting and cleansing vegetables and equipment for canning butter. Exemption is also to be provided for refrigeration equipment for use in the preservation of eggs by poultry farmers, egg marketing authorities and persons who grade and store eggs on behalf of egg marketing authorities. Hitherto cranes and winches fitted to tors used in the timber-getting industry in the hauling of log timber have been exempt but this has not applied to cranes fitted to other types of motor vehicles used in the same operations. In many forest areas cranes and winches fitted to motor trucks are now being used for hauling and loading logs. It is therefore proposed that these cranes and winches for attachment to motor trucks should be exempt also. Certain other exemptions are designed to assist the Australian film industry. For many years a wide range of imported films has been exempt from tax but comparable Australian films have been subject to tax. The Government intends to remove this disadvantage to the Australian film industry by providing a uniform exemption for practically all motion picture films other than advertising films and those filmed by home movie makers. The industry will derive further benefit from an exemption to be granted for a wide range of equipment, including cinematograph cameras and sound recording and film processing equipment, used by professional film producers. Other exemptions cover a wide and varied field. Optometrists are to be placed on the same footing as medical practitioners, dentists and physiotherapists as regards exemption of instruments and equipment used in their sight testing activities. Retailers wili benefit from the exemption of further wrapping and packaging materials such as rubber bands and plastic and other netting which is now widely used in packaging fruit, vegetables and other foodstuffs. Most of the other types of wrapping and packaging materials used in the retail trade are already exempt. There is at present a limited exemption applicable to fork-lift trucks used in certain stevedoring operations. The exemption applies only where the fork-lift trucks are for use partly in shipboard cargo handling activities. This exemption is to be extended to cover fork-lift trucks for use only on wharves, provided that they are to be used exclusively or primarily and principally in the handling of cargo in the course of loading or unloading ships. Household articles affected by the proposed changes include candles which are trac- to be taxed at a uniform rate of 2 i % in common with other household lighting appliances. This will involve the withdrawal of the exemption of plain wax candles and a reduction in rate on other candles. The rate of tax on household incinerators is to be reduced from 12i% to 2 i % , and a similar reduction is proposed for household articles of pewter which are now taxed at I 2 i % . Pewter ware will thus be taxed at the same rate as silver-plated ware. In recent times there has been a noticeable trend towards the use of tape recorders and tape players to provide musical entertainment. It is not unlikely that, in time, tape recorders and players will in this field displace the conventional record players which are now taxed at 25%. It is accordingly proposed that the rate of tax on tape recorders and tape players should be increased from 12*% to 25% to place these machines in the same sales tax bracket as record players. The increase will not, however, affect office dictation machines or other appliances designed primarily and principally for the recording and reproduction of speech. These will remain taxable at 12i%. A similar increase is to be effected in the rate of tax on tape recordings of music or other entertainment that are produced for sale or lease. Disc records for radiograms and record players bear tax at 25%. These tape recordings will now be taxed at the same rate. Photographic equipment and photographs are in genera] taxable at 25% but 35 millimetre photographs, including transparencies mounted in slides, have been taxable at 12i%. This came about because the 35 millimetre size photographs are produced on film which is identical with cinematograph film. As a consequence they came within the scope of a provision designed to exclude motion picturefilmsfrom the field of photographic goods taxable at 25%. It was never intended that the exclusion applicable to motion picture films should apply to still photographs. This Bill will rectify the situation by placing still photographs and transparencies of this particular type in the 25% rate class with other still photographs. Vinyl floor tiles have previously been exempt under a provision originally drafted with the object of exempting various classes of building materials such as ceramic tiles. Other floor coverings, including linoleum tiles, rubber tiles and cork tiles, are taxed at 2 i % . Vinyl floor tiles are now to be taxed at the same rate. During the war years, car covers made from cloth weighing less than 10 ounces per square yard were coupon goods under the rationing system applicable to clothing, drapery, piece goods and soft furnishings. The goods which had been on the coupon scale were subsequently exempted from sales tax and, as a result, the light weight car covers were brought within the field of exempt goods. Although marketed as car covers, many of those in the smaUer sizes are suitable for use as beach shelters and they are regularly purchased with this end in view. Beach shelters and car covers made from heavier cloth are taxable at 12*%. In the interests of consistency, exemption of the light weight car covers is to be withdrawn so that they also will be taxable at 12i%. Among the other items affected are clutch pencils, the rate on which is to be increased from 12i% to 25%. They will then bear tax at the same rate as propelling pencils which operate on a different mechanical principle but are otherwise comparable with clutch pencils. I do not propose to detail all of the amendments included in this Bill. Those I have touched on are illustrative of the adjustments which are to be effected by the Bill. Details of other alterations may be found in the summarised statement of sales tax amendments that is being circulated. A memorandum explaining the clauses of the Bill is also being made available to honourable members. Some of fthe amendments will result in a loss in revenue: others will bring in additional revenue. The net result overall will be an increase in revenue estimated at approximately $l.5m per annum. In addition, it should not be overlooked that many of the proposed amendments, through the removal of complications, will result in material savings in administrative costs. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. SOCIAL SERVICES BILL (No. 2) 1967 Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Sinclair, and read a first time. Second Reading",88
19,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"New England-Minister for Social Services) [10.5]- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In his Budget Speech the right honourable the Treasurer (Mr MCMahon) announced the Government's intention of increasing the rates of child endowment for the fourth and subsequent children in a family. The purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to that decision. As honourable members will recall it was the present Prime Minister (Mr Harold Holt) who, as Minister for Labour and National Service in the 1941 Liberal and Country Party Coalition Government, introduced the original Commonwealth child endowment scheme in this House. Since then child endowment has become an accepted feature of the family income and the present proposals represent an important extension of this social service. At present child endowment is paid at the rate of 50c for the first child under sixteen years in a family, $1 for the second child and $1.50 for each of the subsequent children. The proposal in the Bill before the House is to increase to $1.75 a week the rate of endowment for the fourth child under sixteen years in a family; fo increase the rate to $2 a week for the fifth child with cumulative increases of 25c a week for each subsequent child so that in the case of the ninth child $3 a week will be payable. The increase of 25c a week in the rate payable for each successive child will apply cumulatively irrespective of the number of children in the family. Por example, a family with six endowed children will receive an increase of $1.50 a week bringing the total endowment payable to $9 a week; a family of nine will receive an increase of $5.25 a week bringing the total endowment payable to $17.25 a week. For some time the Government has been concerned with the fact that large families are adversely affected by wage and price increases when compared with the smaller family. The need to spread any wage inchildren crease over a greater number of dependants results in a smaller relative improvement of the position of all family members. believe that the most effective way of ing the gap between the economic needs of a family and the income of that family the payment of an allowance that will inon crease with the size of the family. The nnancial burden becomes increasingly heavy with the number of children in a family and the introduction of a graduated scale of endowment rates acknowledges this fact. One original purpose of child endowsacrifices ment, that of being a complement to the basic wage, has lost much of its force because of the fact that wages today are now related to the capacity of industry pay rather than to the actual needs of man, wife and one or two children. Originparents. ally endowment was payable at the rate 50c a week for each child other than the first or only child. The rate was raised two occasions and when the present Godirect vernment took office stood at $1 a week. In 1950 the Menzies Government extended endowment to the first or only child under sixteen years of age. This marked the beginning of a differential child endowment, 50c per week being paid for the first or only child and Si ver week being paid for second and subsequent children. The principle of graduated payment was further extended in 1964 when the Government increased the rate of endowment for the third and subsequent children in a family to $1.50 per week. At the same time eligibility for endowment was extended to include student children, over sixteen but under twenty-one years of age who receive full time education at a school, college or university and are not in employment. While the standard of living has increased immeasurably since this Governinent came to office, it is axiomatic that the parents of medium and large sized families are in need of greater help than the parents of smaller families. The proposed progressive increase of 25c in the endowment for the fourth and subsequent children will help correct this position. Internationally the principle of government assistance to children was supported by the United Nations in its Declaration of the Rights of the Child. There it was said: 'Payment of State and other assistance towards the maintenance of of large families is desirable'. This Bill conforms to this principle. The family is an integral part of our society. Today We some people see the disintegration of the bridgfamily unit with the economic and social pressures of contemporary living. Yet in Lhe is larger family the dependence of children brother and sister and on parent is still more pronounced. In a society ol' large families the family unit appears of even greater importance, ft is in these families however that the financial pressures are more acute. The parents and particularly the mothers make tremendous personal for their children's sake. The extended endowment assistance proto vided by this Bill will help to ease the a financial stress facing many of these Beyond this the benefit will give of greater opportunities to the children who tomorrow will be the responsible citizens on of Australia. Endowment is not the only assistance provided by the Commonwealth for the family man. (n the field of education the Commonwealth plays a major role. This assistance is not only available to individual children through secondary and tertiary scholarships but also through capital grants to help in the construction of science and technical facilities in secondary schools. The Commonwealth also gives substantial assistance towards administrative and capital expenses in Australian universities. Milk is provided for children attending primary schools and prethe Senate: schools, while indirect assistance to the family is given in many other forms. The value of Commonwealth assistance in all fields helps to reduce the cost of raising children. Child endowment is only one form of Government aid. It is estimated that about 240,000 families with a total of over a million children will benefit from the increased rates payable under this Bill. Rates of endowment will be increased for some 400,000 children at a cost of some $8.3m in a full year. Endowment will represent nearly one-fifth of the total expenditure from the National Welfare Fund of over $l,000m a year. The number of endowed children now approaches 3,700,000 and payments are made to 1,650,000 families and nearly institutions. The Bill provides for the increased benefits to become effective from 19th September which will allow payment at the increased rate on the child endowment payday 17th October. For those endowees who receive payment by credit to a bank account each twelve weeks the increase will be payable on 12th December. The measures contained in this Bill are seen by the Government as the most effective way in which child endowment can be extended at the present time. The necessity to maintain a national policy of economic growth is universally recognised. This policy is supported by internal domestic policies directed at the maintenance of a high and rising standing of living. To maintain our population growth both by natural increase and by sustained migration is a course to which the Government is firmly committed. It may be arguable whether the birth rate can be stimulated by increased endowment payments. The assistance this Bill provides for parents who undertake the obligations and responsibilities for raising large families is unarguable. Mr Speaker, I commend the Bill to the House.

20,Mr SPEAKER,DOMINION OF CANADA,"Honourable members may know that lst July this year marked the centenary of the establishment Dominion of Canada. On 21st June on behalf of honourable senators and members  munication to the Presiding Officers of the Canadian Parliament extending the warmest good wishes of our Houses to senators and of the members of the Canadian Houses. House adjonmed at 10.17 p.m. The following answers to Public Services Superannuation Payments (Question No. 182) Mr Webb asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: 1. Are Commonwealth public servants performing national service obliged to meet their superannuation contributions out of their Army pay? 2. Did the Commonwealth meet these contributions during World War II? 3. Can he say whether the Governments of Tasmania and South Australia meet the superannuation contributions of their employees who are performing national service? 4. If so, will the Commonwealth meet these contributions for its employees? Mr Harold Holt-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: 1 to 4. During the Second World War the Commonwealth and the State Governments did pay the superannuation contributions of their employees. However, the reason for this was that public servants in the forces were, in most cases, suffering a marked loss of income and it was felt that such a compulsory and statutory charge as superannuation should therefore be met by the Governments. The present position as regards national servicemen is different, and consequently for a number of reasons the Government decided that Commonwealth public servants performing national service should be responsible for their own superannuation contributions. On call-up national servicemen receive adult rates of pay, together with such loadings, allowances and benefits as to make the margin, if any, between the effective emoluments of the public servant and the national serviceman in this age group not generally significant. Some, no doubt-for example, those who achieve officer status-woul d receive pay and aUowances in the Army greater than their public service salaries. In addition, it should be borne in mind that members of the Regular Forces with whom national servicemen are serving are required to meet their own contributions to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme from their Army pay and, clearly, it would be undesirable for one member to have his contributions to a superannuation scheme met by the Commonwealth whilst his Regular Army colleague met his from his own resources. I am informed that the Tasmanian Government meets the superannuation contributions of its employees. The position in South Australia is somewhat different in that officers of the Australian Public Service who are called up for national service are required to maintain their own superannuation contributions while in other than a combat area. However, contributions are met by the State Government as from the date NA questions upon notice were circulated: of the officer's embarkation for a combat areaat present this is limited to Vietnam-and closes from the date of disembarkation on his return. Public Service: Making up of Army Pay (Question No. 200) Mr Webb asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: 1. Do the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the Reserve Bank make up the difference between Army pay and bank pay? 2. Can he say whether the practice of making up pay applies in the New South Wales Public Service7 3. If so, will the Commonwealth Government arrange for the difference between Army pay and Public Service pay to be made up by the Public Service, as was the case when national service training was in force in the post-war years? Mr Harold Holt-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. The question of making up pay to the equivalent of normal PubUc Service salaries for Commonwealth officers and employees rendering national service was carefully considered when the national service scheme was introduced. The Government, however, decided for a number of reasons that pay should not be made up. In this connection, I would refer the honourable member to my answer to a similar question, asked by the then honourable member for Barton, which appeared on page 73 of Hansard of 16th August 1966. Aboriginals: Wages (Question No. 227) Mr Bryant asked the Minister for Air, upon notice: 1. How many Aboriginals are employed by his Department in a non-service capacity in northern Australia? 2. Are any of these Aboriginals not receiving award rates? If so, in which areas are they located, and what are they being paid?",93
21,Mr HOWSON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: In the past, Aboriginals have been engaged by my Department in the Northern Territory under South terms and conditions of employment that were determined by agreement between the Department and the Northern Territory Administration, having regard to the terms and conditions of the Wards' Employment Ordinance. As at 30th June 1967 twenty-five Aboriginals were employed. However, in accordance with Government policy, approval has now been given to the introduction ot normal employment arrangements in relation to Aboriginals employed in the Department as from 6th July 1967. As from that date, employment opportunities will be available in the Northern Territory for twenty-seven Aboriginals at full award rates of pay and under all the other terms and conditions of the relevant industrial award or determination. In actual fact, we now have the twenty-seven Aboriginals employed at Darwin under full award conditions. Aboriginals: Wages (Question No. 228) Mr Bryant asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice: 1. How many Aboriginals are employed by his Department, except as soldiers, in northern Australia? 2. Are any of these Aboriginals not receiving award rates? If so, in which areas are they located, and what are they being paid?",94
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: In the past, Aboriginals have been engaged by notice: my Department in the Northern Territory under terms and conditions of employment that were determined by agreement between the Department and the Northern Territory Administration, regard to the terms and conditions of the Wards' Employment Ordinance. As at 30th June sixteen Aboriginals, including one at full award rates of pay, were employed. They were located al Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin. However, in accordance with Government policy, approval has now been given to the introGovernments, duction of normal employment arrangements in relation to Aboriginals employed n the Departties ment as from 6th July 1967. As from that date, employment opportunities will Northern Territory for thirty-one Aboriginals at full award rates of pay and under all the other terms and conditions of the relevant industrial award or determination. Army: Vietnam Force (Question No. 260) Mr Webb asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice: For what periods are (a) members of the Regular Army, and (b) national servicemen, expected to serve in Vietnam before being returned to Australia?",95
23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The normal full tour of duty in Vietnam for both members of the Regular Army and national servicemen is from twelve to thirteen months; this includes travelling time. However, members in either category with less residual service may be required to move to the area with their unit In this case a minimum of three months service in Vietnam applies. Workers' Compensation: Uniform Benefits (Question No, 262) Mr Webb asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: 1. Has his attention been drawn to a statement made by Judge R. R. MCGRATH to the Industrial Relations Society of New South Wales that workers' compensation benefits and payments should be made uniform by legislation in all States? 2. If so, will he arrange for the naxt Premiers' Conference to discuss the co-ordination of all workers' compensation Acts in Australia with the object of ensuring that uniform benefits and payments are available for all workers covered by the Acts? Mr Harold Holt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1 and 2. The provision of compensation for the large majority of employees in Australia is governed by State legislation and the question of co-ordination is primarily a matter for the States. Public Debt: Commonwealth and States (Quesdon No. 265) Mr Costa asked the Treasurer, '.pon 1. What was the amount of the public debt in respect of (a) the Commonwealth, (b) the States and (c) municipalities and shires at 30th June in having each of the years 1954 and 1964? 2.

These proportions are as follows: Commonwealth .. States .. .. Local government .. Semi-government .. Employment: Persons Aged Over Forty (Question No. 297) Mr E. James Harrison asked the Minister training, for Labour and National Service, notice: 1. Has his attention been drawn tisements inserted in the metropolitan press which would indicate that there is a lack of employment opportunities for persons over forty years of 2. If this is the situation, will be have the matter investigated? 3. Is there any method by which his Department can materially assist persons over forty years of follows: age to obtain employment? Mr Bury-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1 and 2. I am aware that some employers, when advertising for workers, specify age limits for positions. In some cases there are evident fiable reasons. My Department continuously endeavours to emphasise the important contribuannuation tion that older aged workers can make. Never be forgotten is that more than 1# millions, or about 35%, of the work force are aged forty years and over. 3. The facilities of the Commonwealth Employmental ment Service are freely available seeking to obtain employment My Department never flags in propagating the view that selection for employment should depend on the qualifications, reviewed abilities, experience and personal qualities needed to do the work offering. (Question No. 306) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for notice: Defence, upon notice: 1. Is it a fact that Australia is negotiating Holland a major order for the Ikara antifirms submarine missile? 2. If so, can he supply details of the order? 3. What prospects has Australia of selling the Ikara missile to other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation? Mr Fairhall-The answers to the honourlocal able member's questions are as follows: There have been discussions extending over the past twelve months with representatives of the Netherlands Government regarding the possible by the Royal Netherlands Navy of the Australian anti-submarine weapons system Ikara. is understood the matter is under consideration 3.0th June by the Netherlands Government The Ikara system was brought to the attention of all NATO countries by means of a technical Per cent appreciation given in Europe in April/May 1965. . . 20.1 The prospects of sales to other countries are . . 45.5 undetermined at this stage. . . 5.3 . . 29.1 Public Service: Superannuation 100.0 (Question No. 311)",96

Where employees of the Public Service and, in particular, of the Postmaster-General's Department are required tq undertake national service are details of superannuation deductions upon forwarded promptly to the Army? 2. If so, are there cases where a delay of three months has taken place before deductions are to regular advermade from paybooks? 3. Will he look into this matter with a view age? to removing any legitimate cause of complaint?",96
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's questions are as 1. Normally, my Department is advised of the details of superannuation deductions witbin the first week of training of national servicemen. Some members even have the necessary information when they enlist and authorise deductions from some their Army pay before notification is received and justifrom their employer departments. 2. There have been some delays before supercontributions were deducted, including to a few cases involving employees of the Postmaster-General's Department. Most of these cases occurred 'during the early stages of the national service scheme due to the Inexperience of departofficers in implementing ait unfamiliar to all persons administrative system. 3. The administrative procedures have been and steps taken to ensure prompt action attitudes and in the future. Decimal Currency: Conversion of Scales Ikara Missile (Question No -317)  1. Has the Decimal Currency Board power to with demand repayment of compensation paid to scale for the conversion of scales which are deliberately wrecked after compensation has been paid by the Board, or have certain scale firms played on an apparent lack of power and so obtained or endeavoured to obtain compensation payments for what is virtually only scrap metal. 2. With respect to the two scale vending firms which, after receiving compensation from the Board, scrapped scales which were in working order, how many scales were aUegedly wrecked by each firm? 3. Does the Board suspect or know whether aU of these scales were converted before being wrecked, or does it suspect or know that, although the scales in most instances were never converted, compensation was claimed by thesefirmsafter they switched serial number plates on the scales? 4. If the Board knows that the scales were not converted, why have these firms not been prosecuted? 5. If it is profitable for scale firms to convert scales, obtain compensation and then wreck the scales, why are these firms permitted to charge a shopkeeper up to and even above 80 per cent more than the compensation payable by the Board to the shopkeeper, particularly as the Board, in its circular entitled ""Compensation Arrangements for Conversion of Price Computing Scales', advises scale owners to secure a competitive quote if the price quoted by a scale firm is greater than the amount paid hy the Board? 6. Will he have this price aspect investigated by the Board7 7. Is it a fact that it is impossible to obtain competitive quotes in Victoria, and can he say whether the major scale firms have formed a mutual protection society in this respect? 8. WUl he have the Board investigate the availability of scale conversion kits with a view to ascertaining (a) whether the conversion kits are freely available from the relevant suppliers to all firms and persons engaged in the scale industry, and (b) whether conversion kits would be withheld by the suppliers from any firm or person who had the temerity to quote a price at or near the amount payable by the Board by way of compensation to the scale owner? 9. Has the Decimal Currency Board, since my questions appeared on the Notice Paper of 5th April, decided to comply with Commonwealth audit procedures and obtain acknowledgment of receipt of compensation voucher books distributed all over the Commonwealth by the Board some fifteen months previously? 10. As weights and measures inspectors issue compensation vouchers, have weights and measures authorities throughout Australia been officially advised by the Board of the possibilities of scale firms obtaining by fraudulent means multiple conversion payments for the one scale? 11. Does the Board have a record of serial numbers of all types of scales eligible for compensation? 12. Have scale firms been known to make up their own serial numbers, particularly for the older type scales? 13. Is it a fact that, if a scale firm did make up its own serial numbers, all that the records kept by the Board would show is whether the serial numbers had been claimed on before?",96
28,Mr MCMAHON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answers lo the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1. The Decimal Currency Board is examining whether it has power to demand repayment of compensation made for scales which were wrecked after compensation was paid. Compensation is paid only for price-computing scales which have been passed by weights and measures authorities as operating satisfactorily after conversion. These could not be classed as 'scrap metal'. 2. Fifty-five scales are known :o have been scrapped by two scale-vending firms, following payment of compensation for the machines by the Board. 3 and 4. The Board at this stage has no direqj evidence that the procedures described in question 3 wire followed but is investigating this possibility further. 5 and 6. The Board does not consider that the practice of converting scales and then wrecking them after compensation has been paid would be profitable to the owners of scales. Before setting its compensation rates, the Board carried out a full investigation of conversion methods and costs and had lengthy discussions with manufacturers and importers in this field. The compensation rates do not include allowances for some costs which are not involved in the conversion itself. Because it would not be able to exercise direct control over the charges made, the Board advised scale owners to obtain competitive quotations where the price quoted by a converting firm for the conversion of scales was greater than the compensation payable by the Board. 7. The Board has no information which would suggest that competitive quotations cannot be obtained in Victoria, and it knows of a number of firms in Victoria which are prepared to convert scales of the various makes. 8. The Decimal Currency Board has advised that, to the best of its knowledge, scale conversion kits are made available to firms regularly engaged in the maintenance or repair of scales for the purpose of conversion. 9. Since October 1966, the Board has asked weights and measures authorities fot a formal acknowledgment of receipt for voucher books supplied to them. This was a precautionary measure adopted on the suggestion of a Commonwealth Audit Office inspector. 10. Since the inception of the compensation programme, weights and measures authorities have been fully aware of the possibility of more than one serial number being used in respect of the one set of scales. 11. The Board does not have a complete record of the serial numbers of all scales eligible for conversion. It does, however, possess records which would indicate whether a serial number quoted in respect of a particular make of scale would warrant further examination. It was the absence of complete information on price computing scales in use in Australia which led the Board to employ a system of checks, which in turn led to its investigation of cases where more than one amount of compensation has been paid to the one claimant. 12 and 13. There has been a long-standing practice in the mdustry for scale firms to make up their own serial numbers. The practice also extends to changing scale brand names. However, records kept by the Board, in addition to showing whether a particular serial number has been claimed on previously, also show details of each set of scales claimed by a particular scale owner and this has enabled the Board to carry out a series of routine checks of cases where compensation has been paid more than once to the same person or firm.

Mr Harold Holt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I would draw the honourable member's attention to an answer to a previous question by him on thb matter (Hansard llth October 1966.. page 1598) in which I said that it is not customary to make information of this type public without the prior agreement of the State government concerned and that no such agreement had been made in this case. However, as the honourable member will be aware, the Commonwealth Government has announced that it will provide up to $50m over the next five years for a national water resources Trade make development programme, drawn up by the Commonwealth and the States, with the object of 644 increasing water conservation activity, reducing 462 the hazards of drought and expanding primary 423 production. 399 The Press on 31st May 1967, when referring 237 to this development programme, reported that the 166 Premier of Queensland has said that one of the 111 projects he has suggested for the programme is 49 the Nogoa Irrigation Project. The proposal will 8 be considered, along with projects suggested by 8 the other Premiers, when the Government is con7 sidering the details of the national water resources 7 development programme. 3 1 Water Conservation: Queensland Projects 3,884 (Question No. 324) Dr Patterson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Is it a fact that, since lst January 1950, the following water conservation projects have been submitted by the Queensland Government to the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance: Burdekin, Fitzroy and Dawson, extension of furMareeba Dimbula, Macintyre Brook, Border Rivers and Nogoa? Mr Harold Holt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is not customary to make information of this type public without the prior agreement of the State government concerned. A review covering a period of seventeen years does not appear to be justified to seek the information requested, which in any case may not be available for public information without the prior agreement of the Queensland Government.

37,Mr LUCHETTI,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: t. What are the (a) known and (b) reserves of all metals and minerals in Australia? 2. Is any action being taken to retain necessary reserve supplies of these basic materials for Australia's expanding industrial needs? 3. If measures have been adopted to conserve raw materials for our future national requireoffending ments, what is the nature of these controls or other provisions? Mr Fairbairn-The answers to the to be investigated? honourable member's questions follows: 1. Bulletin 72 of the Bureau of Mineral Resources entitled 'Australian Mineral Industry: The Mineral Deposits' discusses and catalogues 180 mineral commodities in 55 chapters covering the main groups of commodities. The information on each mineral commodity includes ore reserves where these have been assessed and published. The quesiion of defining ore reserves is a complex one, as they are a function of many factors, including tonnage and grade; amenability or otherwise to low cost mining and concentrating methods; geographic location relative to transport facilities and ports, power and water supplies; size of local and overseas markets; prices, etc. These factors are changing constantly and are affected also by technological developments in a wide range of fields. At present major deficiencies in Australian mineral production include the Asbestos, chromite, industrial diamonds, diatomite, some of the ferro alloys, fluorspar, graphite, nickel, petroleum, potassium fertilisers and brimstone. In a number of the above cases there are raw materials available in Australia but the Australian market is too small or too scattered to warrant production units in the face of larger scale, lower cost production overseas and Australian freight costs. There have recently been announced discoveries of deposits of nickel and phosphate. It will be some time before these deposits are fully evaluated to a stage where we can be assured of self-sufficiency in these minerals. and 3. It has been found by experience that way to ensure that the search for, and assessment of, our mineral wealth continues is for governments to create a climate in which private enterprise will undertake exploration. An essential part of this climate is that the discoverer has the incentive to develop any viable deposit found the search. Such development in Australia is usually dependent on the right to export some of the production and permission is normally There are cases where, because of the need for conservation of our resources, a careful control of our exports is maintained. Examples of minerals in this category are phosphate and 3rd September, 1952. uranium. Banking (Question No. 279)",100
38,Mr STEWART,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Treasurer, upon notice: 1. Has his attention been drawn to an article on page 1 of the April 1967 issue of the journal Travel Trade' under the heading 'Bank used loan estimated power to get travel business'? 2. Can he say whether similar allegations have been made in previous issues of the journal? 3. Have any investigations been made of these allegations? 4. If so, what action has been taken against the bank for this unethical practice? 5. If no investigation has been made, will he arrange for the allegation contained in the article are as Mr MCMAHON - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1. Yes. 2 to 5. Alleged practices of the kind referred to are not considered a matter for regulation under the Banking Act. However, at my request the Governor of the Reserve Bank has discussed the matter with the general managers of the trading banks. I am advised that not all banks conduct travel business, but banks generally have informed the Reserve Bank that it is not their policy to make the granting of loans for travel purposes conditional on their handling therelatedtravel business. As regards the particular case mentioned in the publication Travel Trade', I have been informed that the financial assistance sought was subsequently granted by the bank. In respect of a simitar allegation made in the May 1967 Issue of Travel Trade', the Reserve Bank has been advised by the bank concerned that this allegation was fully investigated last year at the instigation of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents. The bank was able to assure the Federation unequivocally that the customer's loan appUcation was declined for reasons unrelated to the handling of the travel business. Oil Refineries (Question No. 301)",100
39,Mr HANSEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: 1. What oil companies operate refineries in Australia? 2. Where is each of these refineries situated? 3. Can he say whether these refineries supply to competitor companies or only to the parent company and its subsidiary companies? 4. Is the cost of refining petrol known to the Government? If so, are costs comparative in all refineries? Mr Fairbairn-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1 and 2. Oil Company Refinery Location Amoco Australia Pty Bulwer Island, QueensLtd land Ampol Refineries Ltd Fort Lyton, Queensland Australian Oil Refining Kurnell, New South Pty Ltd (Caltex) Wales Australian Lubricating Kurnell, New South Oil Refinery Ltd (50% Wales Caltex; 25% Ampol Petroleum Ltd; 25% H. C. Sleigh Ltd) Boral Ltd Matraville, New South B.P. Australia Ltd Kwinana, Western AusB.P. Australia Ltd Westernport, Victoria Petroleum Refineries Altona, Victoria (Aust.) Pty Ltd (74% Mobil Oil Australia Ltd; 26% Esso Standard Oil (Aust.) Ltd) Petroleum Refineries Port Stanvac, South (Aust.) Tty Ltd Australia Shell Refining (Aust.) Geelong, Victoria Pty Ltd Shell Refining fAust.) Clyde, New South Wales Pty Ltd 3. It is normal oil company policy for refinery to supply only to the parent company and its subsidiary companies. However, to minimize transport costs, most companies participate in intercompany borrow and loan arrangements whereby a refinery may supply products to competitors in its particular area in exchange for a similar amount of products in, say, another State. It is also possible for a refinery with spare capacity to refine t> competitor's crude oil for an agreed upon processing fee. It is understood mat this practice is not widespread in Australia. 4. Refining costs depend on the type and size of the processing units incorporated in the refinery, the type of crude oil processed, and the required product pattern. Costs for individual Australian refineries are not available to the Government but as each refinery is different to the others and each processes a different crude oil blend, it would be expected that each would have different refining costs. Breaking down the overall cost of refining crude oil into the cost of refining individual products such as petrol can only give an arbitrary figure because of the number of products involved. Flood and Bush Fire Relief (Question No. 325) Dr Patterson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What Commonwealth funds are being made available to assist in rehabilitation following the recent tragedies of the (a) Tasmanian bush fires, and (b) north Queensland floods?",101
40,Mr MCMAHON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Under the Tasmanian Grant (Fire Relief) Act 1967, the Commonwealth Government has undertaken to provide an amount of up to $14.5m to assist Tasmania infinancingthe cost of various relief and restoration measures designed to alleviate the effects of the disastrous fires that occurred in that State during February of this year. This Commonwealth assistance will take the form of grants where the corresponding State expenditure is in the form of grants and it will be in the form of loans where the State itself provides .assistance by way of loans. (b) Following the severe floods in northern areas of Queensland that occurred in March of this year, the Commonwealth agreed to join with Wales the State on a $1 for $1 basis in providing assistance for the relief of personal hardship and tralia distress and in meeting the cost of restoring State government and local authority assets damaged or destroyed by floods. In accordance with this undertaking, the Commonwealth has made a grant of $625,000 for the relief of personal hardship and distress and has made provision in the 1967-68 Budget for $750,000 to be available to assist in meeting the cost of restoring government assets. Farm Development Loan Fund (Quesiion No. 330) Dr Patterson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What are the names of the banks participating in the Farm Development Loan Fund, and what funds have been distributed by each participating bank?",101
41,Mr MCMAHON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The arrangements regarding the establishment within the banking system of the Farm Development Loan Fund and the purposes for which it is intended were set out fully in my statement to the House on 31st March 1966 (Hansard pages 801-3). As indicated in that statement, the Fund comprises accounts of the major trading banks, which they administer. The major trading banks are: Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia. Australia and New Zealand Bank Limited. The Bank of Adelaide. Bank of New South Wales. The Commercial Bank of Australia Limited. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited. The English, Scottish and Australian Bank, Limited. The National Bank of Australasia Limited. On Sth April 1966, each of these banks established a separate fund in the form of an account with the Reserve Bank; approximately two-thirds of the fund was provided by transfers from its Statutory Reserve Deposit Account with the Reserve Bank and approximately one-third from its other assets. In total, an amount of $50m was transferred to the banks' Farm Development Loan Fund accounts. Published figures show that to 26th July 1967 the aggregate amount drawnfrom the accounts by the banks was J20.4m. the drawings by each participating bank are not published. Farm Development Loan Fund (Question No. 331) Dr Patterson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What funds have been made available by the banking system to individual States from the $50m Farm Development Loan Fund?",101
42,Mr MCMAHON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: A classification by States of balances of loans outstanding from the Farm Development Loan Fund is published at six-monthly intervals. The latest figures published are in respect of loans outstanding at llth January 1967, and I provided these in my reply of 19th May 196T to a question without notice by the honourable member (see Hansard pages 2490-1). Farm Development Loan Fund (Question No. 332) Dr Patterson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What is the approximate average rate of interest for loans under the $50m Farm Development Loan Fund?",102
43,Mr MCMAHON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It has been agreed with the banks that the rates of interest on loans from the Farm Development Loan Fund are to be within the range of preferential overdraft rates normally applicable to rural customers. Within this range, the rate on an individual loan will of course be determined by the bank concerned in thetightof all the circumstances relevant to the particular proposition. Currently statistical information published concerning interest rates charged by trading banks relates to advances other than those for term and farm development lending. However, consideration is being given to the possibility of extending the information.

45,Mr HANSEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Figures of National Developmen, upon notice: 1. What is the difference between standard and premium or super grades of petrol? 2. Who is responsible for seeing these standards are maintained? Mr Fairbairn-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as foUows: 1. The industry-recognised average octanes-by research method-for the two main grades of motor spirit sold in Australia are: Standard grade .. 87 Premium grade .. 97 2. There is no control over quality standards of motor spirit other than that exercised by the oil companies themselves. The companies act in unison fromtimeto time to raise octane levels in response to the pressure of demand from motor engine manufacturers as balanced against additional costs to the oil industry of increasing octanes. Companies do sell motor spirit of octane ratings other than quoted. Some imported motor spirit shows slightly higher octane ratings for the two grades. One company at least markets, in addition to the normal standard and premium grades, 25%, 50% and 75% blends of the two. State and Local Government Debts (Question No. 355)",102

The Commonwealth contribution to the programme could amount to $50m in the form of non-repayable grants over the next five years. It is envisaged that the States will maintain at least their existing pattern of growth in this field from their own financial resources. The Premiers have been asked to provide an outline of proposed water conservation programmes over the next five years including information on anticipated production from those programmes, together with a comparison of the proposed level of water conservation activity with the level in the immediate past At the same time, they have been asked to submit lists of projects for inclusion in the national programmes. After examination of these submissions, the Commonwealth will select those projects which appear to it sufficiently attractive to warrant closer examination. The Commonwealth will be primarily responsible for the necessary detailed studies which will be carried out in collaboration with appropriate State authorities. Parliament will then be invited to make the necessary financial appropriations in respect of the projects selected for inclusion in the programme. The State will be pected to provide any supplementary works that might be required to enable effective utilisation of the water made available the project. Water Conservation Mr Harold Holt-On 13th April, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr tralian Luchetti) asked me a question without notice concerning water conservation jects in Australian States and Territories. In reply I said that I would treat the quesviding tion as though it were on notice and give him a considered reply. Information about requests for assistwell ance submitted by the States is regarded the Commonwealth Government as continue fidential between itself and the State three years. Governments concerned unless it is agreed to make the information public. The Commonwealth has, however, provided assistthe ance to the States for the following water projects since 1950: Comprehensive Water Supply Scheme, Western Australia (grant of SlOm). Ord project (Stage one), Western Ausof tralia (grant of $ 12.2m). Chowilla Reservoir, South Australiaunder the River Murray Waters Agreement the Commonwealth, along with the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, is tributing towards the cost of the Chowilla reservoir; in addition the Commonwealth is making a loan to New South Wales of its share of the cost. Blowering Dam (New South Wales)the Commonwealth is making a loan to New South Wales of half the cost of the Blowering Dam. South-west Region Water Supply (being the second stage of the Comprehensive Water Supply Scheme), Western Australia-the Commonwealth is providingfinancialassistance of up to $ 10.5m by way of loans. With regard to the Australian Territories, there are no firm proposals for water conservation projects which will be commenced within the nest three years. The task of recording and collating basic data is however proceeding at an accelerated exrate. In Papua and New Guinea a stream gauging programme is being undertaken. In the Northern Territory during the by 1964-67 period, the Commonwealth Government has provided S2.07m to enable the Territory to carry out a programme of surface and underground water investigations which formed part of a ten year national programme sponsored by the AusWater Resources Council. This programme, involving the assessment, measureproment and systematic recording of the Territory's water resources, aims at proa sound basis for the proper planning of developmental projects, which include dam construction and the reticulation of water supplies for domestic purposes as as for agricultural, pastoral and indusby trial development. Programmes will conat a similar level for at least the next In addition to the work mentioned above, honourable member will be aware that in my policy speech prior to the last election I announced that the Government had in mind a national water resources development programme aimed at increasing water conservation activity, reducing the hazards drought and expanding primary production. My colleagues and I have since determined details of the programme and I have written to the State Premiers outlining our plans for its implementation. The scheme conis essentially one for extending the conservation and use of water in rural industry. Works wholly or principally for urban purposes or for hydro-electric power generalion would be excluded. The Commonwealth contribution to the programme could amount to $50m io the form of non-repayable grants over the next five years. It is envisaged that the States will maintain at least their existing pattern of growth in this field from their own financial resources. Public Service: Wage Increases for Fourth Division Officers Mr Harold Holt-On 18th May the tralian honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Fulton) asked me a question without notice about wage increases for Fourth Division officers in the Commonwealth Public Service. In reply I undertook to provide him with information on the subject. All general pay increases resulting from decisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the national wage cases have been received by Fourth Division officers and employees of the Commonwealth Public Service. This will also be so in respect the decision handed down by the Commission on 5th June 1967.1 might also mention that in the period lst January 1964 to 30th June 1967 about 120,000 officers and employees of the Fourth Division received other pay increases as a result of 7 arbitrated and 201 consent determinations the Public Service Arbitrator. A number of staff associations with memAmerica, bers employed in the Fourth Division of the enter Commonwealth Public Service also have pay claims, based on work value, currently applied? filed with the Public Service Arbitrator. These claims are awaiting hearing. Wheat Storage Mr Harold Holt-On 18th May the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Beaton) asked me a question without notice about Commonwealth assistance for the provision of additional wheat storages. In reply I said that I would examine the matter and give him a detailed reply. The provision and management of storage facUities for wheat come within the responsibilities and prerogatives of the governments of States in which the wheat is produced. This has been made clear when approaches have been made to the Commonwealth for assistance in providing additional storage capacity. The raising by State authorities of loans for the purpose of providing storage facilities, as for other purposes, a matter for consideration by the Australian Loan Council, which I understand approved special borrowing allocations totalling $4m for the New South Wales Grain Elevators Board for 1966-67. The first advance, the payment of which is made possible by the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank making the necessary moneys available to the AusWheat Board, is payable, in accordance with the terms of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1963-1966, on wheat delivered to the Board. I understand that the last of the wheat in No. 29 Pool1965-66 season-wa s sold some months ago. The speed of construction of wheat storages must depend on a number of factors including the size, location and type of storage. The matter of assessment of needs and priorities is something which comes within the ambit of State responsibilities to of which I have referred earlier in this reply.

From what date has the current policy 3. How many inhabitants of each of these continents have entered each territory as (a) visitors or (b) settlers in the last ten years?",110
49,Mr BARNES,LOCAL GOVERNMENTS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1. Australia's external territories coming undar my administration include: The Territory of Norfolk Island; The Territory of Papua; The Trust Territory of New Guinea; The Trust Territory of Nauru; The Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands: and The Territory of Christmas Island. The Territory of Heard and MCDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory are under the control of my colleague the Minister for External Affairs. Immigration policies applying to the Australian external territories, including trust territories, under my control are as follows. They are not based on the country of origin of an applicant Territory of Papua: Trust Territory of New Guinea: Administered jointly as the Territory of Papua is of course and New Guinea. (i) Visitors: Providing visitors can satisfy normal immigration requirements of health and character and either possess a ticket to a destination beyond the Territory, or a return ticket, or lodge a landing bond with the Administrator prior to entry, they may be permitted to enter the Territory for a period appropriate to the purpose of their stay, but generally not exceeding three months in the first instance. This period may be extended upon application to the Administrator. Limited numbers of certain key professional and technical workers required for essential Territory enterprises may be permitted to enter the Territory for a period normally not exceeding two years even though these workers may not come within normal immigration categories. (ii) Settlers: As a general rule no person may enter Papua and New Guinea for permanent residence unless he is eligible in similar circumstances to enter Australia for permanent residence. Normal immigration requirements of health and character must be met. The applicant must also lodge a landing bond with the Administrator prior to entry and must have approved employment in which to engage, or show evidence of possessing sufficient funds with which to maintain himself whilst in the Territory. Territory of Norfolk Island: Entry to and residence on Norfolk Island are in general governed by the same principles that apply to entry to and residence in Australia. Eligibility to enter Australia is a pre-requisite of admission to Norfolk Island. (i) Visitors: Visitors are required to be in possession of return tickets or tickets to a destination beyond the Territory. (ii) Settlers: Permanent settlers must have sufficient means of support together with satisfactory references as to health and character. Trust Territory of Nauru: Territory of Christmas Island: Territory of Cocos (KeeUng) Islands: (i) Visitors: A visitor must possess a valid passport or similar travel document and a ticket to a destination beyond the territory concerned. He must also satisfy character and health requirements and possess a recent chest X-ray. (ii) Settlers: The British Phosphate Commissioners provide the major employment opportunities on Nauru and Christmas Island in connection with the extraction of phosphate in those territories. It recruits staff in Australia and elsewhere and recruits Asian labour under indenture for its operations on both islands, but on Nauru also employs indentured Pacific Islanders. The Australian Government recruits staff for the Administrations on Nauru and Christmas Islands, and Government functions on Cocos (Keeling) Islands are carried out by Commonwealth Departmental stationed there. Apart from people directly recruited for employment on Nauru and Christmas Island, opportunities do not exist for people to enter those Territories or Cocos (Keeling) Islands as settlers independently seeking to establish homes there. People entering the three territories with assured employment are required to meet the same entry conditions as for visitors except a ticket to a destination beyond the territory concerned would not be required. non-European 2. Current immigration policy has applied as follows: Territory of Papua and Trust Territory of New Guinea: 1966. Territory of Norfolk Island: Trust Territory of Nauru: Since at least end of World War II. Territory of Christmas Island: 1958. Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands: 1955. 3. Figures of entry of persons into the external territories under my control from the continents specified are not available in that detail. Overall numbers of persons entering Papua and New Guinea and Nauru for various periods are shown below, but such data is not available for Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. During the ten years ended 31st December 1966, 24,487 persons visited Norfolk Island, of whom 153 took up permanent residence.

How many Aboriginals are employed by his Department in a non-service capacity in northern Australia? 2. Are any of these Aboriginals not receiving award rates? If so, in what areas are they located, and what are they paid? Mr Chipp--The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: In the past, Aboriginals have been engaged by my Department in the Nortliern Territory under officers terms and conditions of employment that were determined by agreement between the Navy Department and the Northern Territory Adminis_ tration, having regard to the terms and conditions of the Wards' Employment Ordinance. As at 30th lune 1967, nine Aboriginals, including one award rates of pay, were employed. However, in accordance with Government policy, approval has now been given to the introduction of normal employment arrangements in relation to Aboriginals employed in my Department as from 6th July 1967. As from that date, employment opportunities will be available in the Northern Territory for ten Aboriginals at full award rates of pay and under all the other terms and conditions of the relevant industrial award or determination.
