Firstly, I go to the issue of total 382,800 jobs as against 729,900 jobs created Prime Minister's government has created only that we created in our last three years in government. I go to the question of full-time jobs. The 38.9 per cent of the total jobs that we created As far as I am concerned, a permanent part-time and the Howard government has created 213,100 Labor, or only 72.6 per cent.

I want to do some comparisons the Howard government's first three years in jobs growth. The Howard government has created by Labor in its last three years. In essence, the 52.4 per cent of the number of full-time jobs Howard government's record is 169,700, or only of 436,200 in our last three years in government. job is as good as a permanent full-time job, jobs as against 293,700 jobs created by people, after three years, February 1996 to unemployment by only 67,600.

But they have to be placed in the the truth of the matter is that we have made very ABS figures that we are now under eight per cent. rate of over half of one per cent-actually, 0.7 to a seeming improvement in the figures. that we have made very little impact on reducing three years, this government has been able to the Australian community expects more-the by more than a reduction of just on 65,000 in of the long-term unemployed.

But they do not tell where this training will take place, and I think answer to that question.

Outsourcing, or contracting out, in Australia, and I think that it raises a number of services and the contracted agencies' accountability who are, of course, the taxpayers of Australia. I think that one of the dichotomies that is will inevitably lead to decreased accountability. argument is that with less accountability comes delivered more quickly without the interference services in the past. Unfortunately, I do not efficiency with decreased accountability and both the decrease in accountability and a decrease are the big losers in such a scenario. The trend towards contracting out is driven private sector does everything better. According for allocating resources-the market will discipline and usually meaner delivery of services. This is contrasted with public sector delivery from its work force-public servants. Public the delivery of services than the clients of theory. What this theory misses out on are the benefits that the public sector has. This model ignores ignores also all the evidence that we have provision. We have got numerous examples from allude to later. Contracting out, rather than decreasing the need for accountability. In his 1990 article, the most common privatisation proposals, such as of special interests. He went on to say: ... preference for private provision actually reflects can deploy.

Is this just an opportunity the potential for profit making? I ask that the profits are the natural constituency It is certainly true that contracting out weakens of the Public Service. While the minister retains services, the process of contracting out places quite often have the contracting department pointing service provider saying, 'It's not our fault, Richard Mulgan, in an article called Responsibility for service provision is placed in control of department managers and are not subject officials. Contractors are accountable to public officials but not for many of the acts of discretion which therefore limited in terms of the contract. The issue of the writing of the contracts is which it is impossible to write detailed contracts. specifications for the type of road a government project, although there are some arguments that However, that is much easier to write detailed of Meals on··Wheelsservices, as has happened in Victoria.

That is quite often written of course, to t4rn a profit in the delivery of who should be getting the services are not getting them. Access to information in this area is unfortunately legislation.

(6) What were the (a) countries of origin, (b) work or skill categories and (c) places of residence in Australia of the persons referred to in part (5). (7) Are persons entering Australia under the temporary migration program discouraged from seeking to change their migration status after arrival; if so, how. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There have been 75,434 persons granted temporary business (long stay-subclass 457) visas between 1 August 1996 (when new entry arrangements commenced) and 31 January 1999. Approximately 50 per cent of these persons were principal visa holders and the balance members of the family unit. It is estimated that the stock of principal visa holders in Australia at a point in time is in the order of 20,000. (2) The main occupational categories nominated by business sponsors in 1997/98 are detailed at Table A below. (3) There is no readily available data ,on specific geographical locations of temporary residents. However, incoming passenger data (on State of intended residence) and onshore application data in 1997/98 indicates a proportional spread of 45 per cent to NSW; 20 per cent Victoria; 12 per cent Queensland; 17 per cent Western Australia; 4 per cent South Australia; 1 per cent Northern Territory; and 0.5 per cent Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. (4) The 1997 Report by the 'Lin' Committee of Review of the Employer Nomination Scheme and Labour Agreements confirmed the business preference for sponsored temporary entry of overseas personnel. This reflects the increasingly internationalised economy and skilled labour market. It provides for expedient entry of key personnel critical to business prosperity and a period of time for employers to assess the performance of staff ahead of any more permanent employment relationship. Australia is competing globally for highly skilled workers with cutting edge skills and knowledge and these workers are increasingly mobile in their employment. The Government accepted the recommendations of the Lin Committee (legislative changes introduced with effect 1 November 1997) including removing any bar on temporary residents applying for permanent residence on skill grounds, and removal of a 12 month aggregate period for which qualifying visas must be held in Australia before applying for change of status. The Lin Committee otherwise confirmed the appropriateness of higher level criteria for permanent residence under the Employer Nomination Scheme with the resultant strengthening of entry criteria. Temporary business entry arrangements require sponsoring employers to demonstrate a satisfactory training record or commitment to the training of Australian residents or, that they will be introducing, utilising or creating in Australia new or improved technology or business skills. Business sponsors are also required to give formal undertakings including with respect to creating career opportunities and supporting training of Australians. Any breach of undertakings may result in cancellation of an employer's sponsorship and cancellation of related visas. All temporary business entry sponsorship applications are referred to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) for assessment in respect of the employer's training history or proposed training plan. (5) In 1997/98, there were 2,573 applications for permanent residence in Australia from persons holding temporary business entry visas. Some 66 per cent were on occupational (skill) grounds, 16 per cent on spouse grounds and 12 per cent related to establishing a business in Australia. In the first six months of 1998/99 there were a further 1,903 applications for permanent residence made in Australia from persons holding temporary business entry visas. Approximately 70 per cent were on occupational (skill) grounds, 17 per cent on spouse grounds and 12 per cent related to establishing a business in Australia. (6) (a) and (c) The top ten countries of origin and State distribution of the applications mentioned at Question (5) are at Table B below. (b) There is no data available which tracks the occupational categories of onshore permanent residence applicants holding a temporary business visa. However, with the roll out of the department's new integrated client service environment, it is expected that this data will become available.

(2) Is the Government working towards national standards in the child care sector; if so, how is this being effected. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government requires child care centres to be licensed by the relevant State or Territory Government before being approved for Childcare Assistance. (2) All Commonwealth funded child care services are required to comply with the provisions of any relevant statute, regulation, by-law and requirements of any Commonwealth, State, Territory or local authority as may be in effect from time to time. The Commonwealth has worked together with the States and Territories and with child care service providers to develop national standards for children's services. National standards for centre based long day care were approved in 1993. National standards for outside school hours care and Family Day Care Carers were agreed in 1995 and standards for family day care coordination units were endorsed in July 1998. Implementation of national standards is a State and Territory government responsibility. Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program: Funding (Question No. 383) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 8 February 1999: Did the Minister's Department assess applications for funding (a) for major projects from the Federation Fund and (b) from the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program; if so, in each case, (i) how many applications were made in NA 14 300 20 (i) (B) For the purpose of this question, those a predominantly indigenous cultural heritage element other materials related to the project and directly indigenous communities in their region were counted. in each State or Territory by or on behalf of NA o 17 9 (ii) Those organisations identified each State and Territory (A) in total and (B) by or on behalf of indigenous organisations, (ii) will the Minister provide a list of all applications made by or on behalf of indigenous organisations in each State and Territory, (iii) how many applications made by or on behalf of indigenous organisations were successful and (iv) will the Minister provide a list of all successful applications made by or on behalf of indigenous organisations. Mr Vaile-The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Federation Fund Projects The Department of the Environment and Heritage did not assess applications for funding for major projects. A small Task Force was established in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in 1997 to assist the Government in assessing Federation Fund proposals. (b) Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program (FCHP) The Federation and Cultural Heritage Projects program (FCHP) is jointly administered by the Minister for Communications. Information Technology and the Arts and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. All eligible projects submitted for funding under the FCHP were assessed by the Federation Task Group (FTG), which was made up of officers from the two Departments. The FTG did not recommend specific projects for funding. It advised the Ministers of 114 projects which strongly met the criteria outlined in the program guidelines. The Ministers forwarded a list of their recommended projects to the Prime Minister for approval.

(2) Is she satisfied with the outcome of the conference. (3) What strategies will she implement to ensure that Australian sport and the Sydney Olympics are drug free. (4) Will responsibility for the outcome referred to in part (3) be delegated to another person. Miss Jackie Kelly-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The International Olympic Committe,e World Conference on Doping in Sport was a meeting of anti-doping experts from around the world regarding Olympic sports, It was not an inter-government conference on all Australian sports. Australia's senior anti-doping official attended the meeting after a thorough briefing by me. (2) There were a number of positive outcomes, but more work needs to be done to achieve uniformly strong sanctions for doping across all international sporting federations. (3) and (4) The Government's strong anti-doping policy, which provides for a broad range of strategies, is laid out in our sport and recreation policy-A Winning Advantage. The implementation of these strategies falls to a range of organisations, ments under which: including the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA), through its testing and education programs, the Australian Sports Commission, through its management of doping policies of national sporting organisations and the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory (ASDTL), through its research into drugs in sport issues. In 1998-99, $4.9 million has been provided to ASDA to undertake its drugs testing and education responsibilities. In addition, since 1997-98, the Government has provided $3.8 million specifically for the purposes of sports drug testing and research associated with the Sydney 2000 Games and the period leading up to the Games. This will be enhanced by the use of ASDA and ASDTL services by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, ensuring the Sydney 2000 Games has access to state-of-theart technology and world's best practice in sports drug testing. Black Coal Mining Industry: Long Service Leave (Question No. 417) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 15 February 1999: (1) Is the Government considering the report of the Review of Funding Arrangements for Long Service Leave in the Black Coal Mining Industry; if so, (a) at what stage is its consideration, (b) when did he receive the report, (c) what were the report's recommendations, (d) which organisations were consulted during the review and (e) which organisations made submissions to the review. (2) Will he initiate reviews for long service leave arrangements in other industries; if so, which industries. Mr Reith--The answer to the' honou-able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (a) The report was released in December 1998 for public comment. It is expected that all comments in relation to the report's recommendations will have been received in the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business J:>y the end of February. These responses will then be considered together with the findings and recommendations contained in Mr MCLaughlin's report. (b) 26 June 1998 (c) The report recommends that the current arrangements be wound up over the next 12-18 months and replaced by voluntary funding arrange. - producers who wish to manage their own long service leave obligations can do so; and - other producers can participate in a voluntary collective fund if they so wish.

Dr ·:)avid Kemp MP, announced that the Government would examine amending the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 to allow employees in the Commonwealth public sector the opportunity, as part of agreement making, to negotiate whether they wish to retain long service leave as part of their terms and conditions or to vary those provisions. The Labour Ministers' Council has also noted that a research paper on Long Service Leave issues is being prepared for the Council by the Western Australian Government.

(2) Which of them have mentioned Portuguese overseas possessions in their address. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In order to answer the Honourable Member's question, extensive research would be required into the publicly available Official Records of the United Nations General Assembly over a period of more than 50 years. In view of my Department's work on other priorities for the Government, it does not currently have the resources to undertake this research.

(4) Did the General Assembly in 1961 establish a special committee to examine the application of the declaration and to make suggestions and recommendations on the implementation of the declaration. (5) Did the Gorton Government take Australia out of the committee in 1969. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Honourable Member's question asks about matters in the publicly available Official Records of the United Nations General Assembly, and about the record of the Menzies and Gorton Govemments. In view of its work on other priorities for the Government, my Department does not have the resources to undertake the historical inquiries necessary. Portuguese Timor: Letters (Question No. 436) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 February 1999: (1) What were the texts of the letters that Prime Minister Menzies wrote in October 1961, February 1963 and October 1963 to Prime Minister Salazar about Portuguese Timor.

Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia's contributions to international organiyear sations are a matter of public record, and are detailed in the Budget Papers. The extent to which international organisations which have received budgetary support from Australia have, since 1973174, supported activities in East Timor under their programs is not readily ascertainable. My Department is currently devoting its resources to current and future developments in East Timor. Territorial Boundaries (Question No. 440) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 February 1999: On what dates, in what places, in what circumstances and with what outcomes have the boundaries of the territorial sea and seabed between Australia and its northern neighbours been discussed by Australian Ministers or officials with foreign authorities who accepted or claimed responsibility for parts of the sea and seabed. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Discussions between Australian Ministers or officials and authorities of Australia's ""northern neighbours"", which the Honourable Member is taken to refer to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and France (in respect of New Caledonia), on delimiting territorial seas and other maritime boundaric:s have taken place since the 1960s. The outcom"" of these discussions has been a number of treaties the texts of which are available through the Treaties page on the Department's web site (www .dfat.gov .auJindex.html). Macau (Question No. 441) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 February 1999: On what occasions and in what circumstances has the UN considered the question of Macau. Mr Downer-The answer to the hOlli .. 1'able member's question is as follows: Any consideration by the United Nations of the question of Macau would be a matter of public record, and be available in the Official Records of the United Nations General Assembly. Parliamentarians: Salaries and Allowances (Question No. 452) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 18 February 1999: What was the cost to the Commonwealth in each from 1988-89 to 1997-98 of (a) Members' and Senators' salaries and ministerial supplements, (b) parliamentarians' entitlements including superannuation, travel allowances, provision of vehicles, office rent, telecommunications, office equipment, stationery and newspapers, (c) parliamentarians' staff including salaries, overtime, superannuation, travel and training, (d) domestic and international conveyance of parliamentarians and their staff, (e) the operation of each of the five parliamentary departments and (0 other costs associated with the running of Parliament and Members' and Senators' electorate offices. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The information sought in the honourable member's question is not readily available in consolidated form and it would be a major task to coordinate and collect the information from several departments and agencies. The practice of successive governments has been not to authorise the expenditure of time and money involved in assembling such information on a general basis. However, should the honourable member wish, I will ask my Department to discuss with him the information, that may assist the honourable member, that may be drawn from annual appropriation documentation. Australian Tourist Commission: International Advertising (Question No. 457) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Sport and Tourism, upon notice, on 18 February 1999: (1) What sum did the Australian Tourist Commission spend on international advertising in (a) 1996-97 and (b) 1997-98. (2) What sum was spent on promoting Australia as a holiday destination in (a) England, (b) the UK, (c) Singapore, (d) Indonesia and (e) Japan in (i) 1996-97 and (ii) 1997-98. (3) To what extent have the advertising campaigns increased the number of overseas tourists to Australia. Miss Jackie Kelly-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) 1996-97: $88.3m (b) 1997-98: $101.8m Figures relate to ATC international advertising and promotional activities. (2) (a) and (b) (1) 1996-97: $9.8m; (ii) 1997-98: $12.3m. For purposes of promotional activities, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of expenditure for England separate from the rest of the United Kingdom. (c) (i) 1996-97: $6.9m (ii) 1997-98: $6.8m (d) (i) 1996-97: $I.7m (ii) 1997-98: $O.7m (e) (i) 1996-97: $19.5m (ii)1997-98: $17.8m For UK, Singapore, Indonesia and Japan these costs are country specific.
