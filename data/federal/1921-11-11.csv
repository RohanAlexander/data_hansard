1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 12 noon, and read prayers. NA COMMISSIONER.",19
2,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [12.1] (By leave.)- I desire to announce to the House that the Government have appointed the right honourable Sir Joseph Cook, P.O., G.O.M.G., to be High Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Australia in London. HONOBABLE MEMBERS -'Hear , hear!",19
3,Dr EARLE PAGE,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"Does the Prime Minister remember a promise - which he gave me on the 13 th. October last, when I asked the right honourable gentleman whether he would afford the House an opportunity of discussing the question of the alteration of our system of representation in England before making any appointment to the vacant office of High Commissioner? I desire to know now whether the right honourable gentleman will give the House such an opportunity today.",20
4,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"I well remember the honourable' member putting Ms question to me, but I certainly did not promise that the Government would defer making its appointment until it had received the permission of the honourable member. Tho honourable member challenged the Government in this House, and he knows perfectly well what was the result- a fortnight's' waste of time, after which the honourable member, was still where he was, by the grace of God, and with the assistance of the Labour party, to whom he is anathema. Therefore, if he proposes to waste any more time today, let him proceed to do so. It will not make the slightest difference to the matter before the House. WHEAT POOL.. ADVANCE PAYMENT. - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Has the Primo Minister any statement to make relating to a further advance to farmers on behalf of the Wheat Harvest Board?.",20
5,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"I cannot make a statement at this moment. However, there is something so alluring about the prospect of being able to tell any one that he is going to receive money that I shall make immediate inquiries. If the information BO procured bears out the suggestion contained in the honourable member's question I shall make an announcement to the House. ARBITRATION OOURT. VIEWS OF MR.' JUSTICE POWERS : CONGESTION OF BUSINESS.",20
6,Mr CHARLTON,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"Has the Prime Minister seen a statement of Mr Justice Powers to the effect that the resolution passed at the recent Premiers' Conference was accepted by him as an intimation that the present Arbitration Court was' to be abolished within a very short time, and that, in the circumstances, it would not be right for him to hear further cases which could not be completed before the Court was abolished? Will the Prime Minister make a definite statement in regard to this matter, so that nothing may be done to bring about industrial turmoil?",20
7,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"I do ""not see what I con possibly do in such circumstances. If persons charged with responsible duties are going to decline to carry out those duties merely because they see that some body of individuals has met and come to a decision which, in the very nature of things, cannot possibly take effect until every Legislature throughout the Commonwealth, Federal and State, has given effect to it, all I have to say is that government will be impossible. There iB no reason why the Federal Arbitration Court, as now constituted, should not perform those duties which it was charged to perform, should not continue to carry on its work. If the Court .complains to the Government that there are not enough Judges to cope with its business, that would be another matter, and a difficulty which would call for immediate adjustment. But for a Judge to say that he will not carry on his duties because at the Premiers' Conference a resolution was agreed to which, if given effect to, would abolish the present Court and substitute another-ove r which, by the way, Mr Justice Powers would, in the very nature of things, be the presidentthat is. a thing so extraordinary, so unprovoked by circumstances or any act of the Government, that I am unable to say anything further than that the Court, should continue to do that whioh it was constituted to perform, and go on with its work.",20
8,Mr BRENNAN,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"What about the question of State instrumentalities? Mr 'HUGHES - I would like to add that, whatever alterations are made, they will not affect cases part heard. In those circumstances, what remains for the Court but for it'to go on hearing cases?",20
9,Mr BRENNAN,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"Has the attention ' of the Prime Minister been called to the fact that the present President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is quite unable to cope with the volume of business before him? In view of the statement made by the right honourable gentleman this morning, there is likely to be a great influx of new business in order to take advantage of the Court before its dissolution",20
10,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,Do not look so downhearted; it is a good thing for you.,21
11,Mr BEENNAN,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,I am not at all down-hearted. I merely wish to know whether the right honourable gentleman will take steps to adequately staff the Court in order that it may be able' to deal with the business.,21
12,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"As this matter is of considerable importance, and a precise answer is desirable, if an answer is to be given at all, perhaps the honourable member will put his question' on the notice paper, when I shall endeavour, not only to answer it, but to declare generally the intentions of the Government. TRADE WITH GERMANY. SALE OF AUSTRALIAN OPALS.",21
13,Mr CONSIDINE,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"I desire to learn from the Prime Minister whether the restrictions which were in operation during the war regarding the sale of opals from the White Cliffs and other Australian fields to German buyers are still in operation. I wish to be informed, further, if any restrictions are in operation which prevent the sale of Australian opals to Germany, whether the right honourable gentleman will see that such disabilities are immediately removed.",21
14,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"So far as I knowand the honourable member will recollect that I was absent from Australia for about five months of the current yearthere are no restrictions. At any rate, if there are, they ought to be, and will be, removed. I thought the position was that any of our goods could be sold to Germany. The embargo was placed upon goods coming into this country from Germany.",21
15,Mr MASSYGREENE,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,That is so.,21
16,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"Then I can make my answer clear and without reservation.' If conditions exist which prevent or hinder the sale of opals to German into the circumstances. buyers, the Government will take such steps as may be necessary in order that trade shall be resumed. "" ANTI-DUMPING LEGISLATION.",21
17,Mr WATKINS,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"I am not sure whether, in the programme of business which the Prime Minister has announced for .the attention of Parliament before Christmas, specific mention was made of the Anti-dumping Bill.",21
18,Mr GROOM,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"The measure was. included in the business to be dealt with. ' Mr WATKINS - Then , do the Government intend to proceed with the Bill before the adjournment next month?",21
19,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,The Government certainly so intend. WAR SERVICE HMS. PROMISED STATEMENT BY MINISTER.,21
20,Mr MACKAY,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"When does the Minister for Repatriation intend to make his promised statement in connection with the War Service Homes administration, for the particulars of which the public are anxiously waiting?",21
21,Mr RODGERS,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"I am ready to make the statement as soon as the House is prepared to allow it to be made. If an opportunity is not afforded by the House, I shall have to wait until the Estimates are before us. RABAUL. ALLEGED IMMORAL STANDARD OF LIFE.",21
22,Mr RILEY,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,Has it been brought under the notice of the Prime Minister that business men from Rabaul are making allegations to the effect that a low moral standard has been observed there since the Commonwealth Government took over the control? Will the right honourable gentleman inquire as to whether there is any truth in such statements ?,21
23,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"This matter has not been brought under my notice, but I am astounded that it should be suggested for one moment that anything with which this Government has anything to do is, or can be, referred to as having a "" low moral standard."" I resent such a suggestion very much, and I shall make all inquiries that are necessary and discreet SOLDIERS' HMS. AGREEMENT WITH WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",21
24,Mr FOLEY,APPOINTMEN T OF HIG H,"Can the Minister for Repatriation say whether the arrangement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Western Australia in relation to the erection of soldiers' homes has been finalized, and, so, is it the honourable gentleman's intention to inform us what the conditions are when he makes his promised statement on the War Service Homes administration? Ma-. RODGERS - An agreement has been reached between the Government and the Government of Western Australia, and when it has been signed by the representatives of the two Governments it will be laid on the table of the House. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). NA BRITAIN. Mr SPEAE1ER - I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent publio importance, viz.: ' ' The representation of Australia in Britain."" Five honourable members having'risen in their placesQuestion proposed.",22
25,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"Cowper) [12.17] I submit this motion in* order to discuss the question of the system of the representation of Australia in England. Before doing so, however, I should like to say that I have no personal feeling in the matter. I desire to pay a high tribute to the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) for his long political record and active public life in Australia for the last thirty years. It is recognised throughout the Commonwealth that the work the right honourable gentleman has done will live for long in the memories of the people, and his departure now from Federal politics will be very, much regretted. The fact that he forms a link between the fathers of Federation, like Sir Henry Parkes, with whom he sat in the New South Wales Parliament, and the present generation, to which I belong, makes him an extremely interesting figure. I regret that the method of appointment to the position of High Commissioner prevents me giving an unqualified endorsement to the appointment. I regret, also, that the Government, by ignoring the desire expressed, not merely from this corner, but also by honourable members opposite and those on the Ministerial benches, as indicated by notices of motion upon the business-paper regardi f ing the method of representation abroad, for a discussion to take place before the new appointment was made, have placed Sir Joseph Cook in a false position with the public, and are making his position in relation to future Governments invidious. Their action will tend to perpetuate the difficulty which apparently has always been felt, and which needs to be alleviated to a certain extent, in maintaining that perfect confidence which should exist between the Government and its representative in London as a free channel of communication between the Commonwealth and Imperial Governments. I cannot understand the Government's desire to hasten this matter.",22
26,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,Haste ! That is funny.,22
27,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"I mean haste at this particular time. The Prime Minister gave me an assurance,, which I thought would be honoured, that this matter would be discussed at an appropriate place on the Estimates, and relying upon that undertaking I took no steps to secure an earlier discussion. Eight or nine months have elapsed since the last High Commissioner's term of office expired, and prior to that Mr Fisher had enjoyed three months' leave of absence, so that the pusition has been vacant for nearly a year.",22
28,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,There was plenty of time to discuss this matter. What U'ore you doing all the time. I was away? The House could have discussed it over and over again.,22
29,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"Si r Joseph Cook stated, during the debate in this House and the newspaper discussion on the Estimates, that he was anxious to remain in Australia to defend those portions of his Budget which were the subject of criticism, and to prove beyond question that his estimates of income would be realized, and that he could carry the country through its period of financial stress. Tliese are the circumstances that surround this new appointment, and I think the public are entitled to a more straightforward method of dealing with appointments of this kind. Only yesterday a Ministerial statement was made in another place that no information could be' given regarding the High Commissionership because there was none to give.",22
30,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,That is very like the things the honourable member says to his patients.,23
31,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"We doctors must tell our patients something convincing, just as we always give a convincing colour to the medicine which we prescribe. My objection to the present system is that it takes us nowhere, and, on account of the methods of administration adopted in London, seems to lead to continual growth of expenditure and extravagance. The two previous High Commissioners, Sir George Reid and Mr Andrew Fisher, gentlemen who performed great public service in Australia, did not come back to the Commonwealthat the termination of their appointments to put the additional service they could have rendered at the disposal of the Australian people, as they might have done had a different system of appointment prevailed. I see no reason why the London representative of the Australian Government should not please himself as to what he does after his term of office has expired; but there seems no better"" way of inculcating a real Imperial sentiment than by widening the bounds of our knowledge of the Empire, and bringing back again into Australian politics, or, at any rate, into close contact with those who are in active politics, men who have been for some years in intimate touch with the Impprial Government. Under present conditions, that intimate touch is practically confined to the Prime Minister and such of his Ministers as go to London at long intervals to attend I m perial Conferences. And, even in respect of those Conferences, the Prime Minister, unfortunately, has been more reticent than we think he should be regarding the matters discussed and decided there. The tie that holds the Empire, together is one of sentiment, and we need full, complete, and increasing knowledge of the whole Empire .in order that that sentiment may live and thrive. We have observed the same need in some of our own ill-developed localities. In the old days, before the advent of motor cars and means of quick travelling, adjacent localities had narrow outlooks, and entertained strong prejudices against each other, but with better means of communication, and a more complete knowledge of each other's affairs, each is now more ready to appreciate the other's point of view.",23
32,Mr BAMFORD,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,Would the honourable member be in favour of sending members of this Parliament to London every year?,23
33,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"Not every year, but, perhaps, visits occasionally would not be a bad scheme. . The best method of strengthening the Imperial sentiment is by changing the present method of representation in London. During the history of Australian responsible government we have had many systems of representation. They have necessarily undergone changes according to the stage of development, the political outlook and scope of, first, the separate Colonies, and, later, the Federation. There has been continual evolution and growth, and what seemed - sufficient to fulfil the requirements of a few years ago is no longer so. We have passed through various stages in our Imperial relationships. At the beginning there was comto be plete detachment from Imperial affairsthe struggle was for local autonomy-loca l control by . each colony of its domestic problems, such as development, &c. Then, when this was granted, a struggle ensued over the fiscal autonomy of each part. Next the question of some system of I m perial pref erence held the field of discussion till the Great War; but the war has shown that the question of trade within the Empire is, though important, not so vital as the questions of foreign affairs and trade relations abroad. At first, we had not fiscal autonomy, and later we attained it. Then we had business men appointed as Agents-General to represent us on. the other side of the world, and now we are approaching a stage when we are sharing responsibility for the external policy of the Empire, involving questions of peace and war. Anybody who has studied what took place during and since the war will realise that the High Commisenabled sioner, as such, does not perform the functions necessary to maintain comthese munication with the Empire in a proper way. If one looks for the reason why, think it will be admitted that one of fundamental causes that has necessitated a continual procession to London of Prime Minister or some of his colleagues official during the last three or four yearsthe Prime Minister must have spent third or half of his time in the heart the Empire, and many of his Ministers have also been away from Australia-i the fact that our High Commissioner must be regarded as an official appointed by Government of the day. We really need London some one to carry on political activities in close relation to the ment, some one who would be a member of this Parliament and responsible to it .",23
34,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"The honourable member's statement is very unfair and improper in regard to our late High Commissioner, because every Dominion in the Empire has been in exactly the same position cently in that it has had the head of Government in London, just as I have been .there, notwithstanding the fact that it also had a High Commissioner",24
35,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"I am making no charge of improper conduct against Prime Minister in this regard. Under the present system of representation in London, his long absences from Australia were inevitable; but definite complaints a similar nature have also arisen Canada, although necessarily they are so deep-seated by reason of the fact that ment. Canada is closer to Great Britain. simply contending that it is necessary have some alteration to the system. the 1911 Imperial Conference New Zeaference land put forward a proposal that, the High Commissioners should, if possible, become a real part of .the Imperial machinery, and be the' sole channels communication between the Imperial Government and the Dominion Governpatches,"" ments-of course that was not possibleand that the High Commissioners should attend the meetings of the Committee Imperial Defence and come into closer touch with the Imperial Foreign Ministers in all matters of an industrial and social nature affecting the Empire. This system, if adopted, would have each High Commissioner to keep his Government fully informed upon all subjects, but the objection raised to the proposal was that which I have I previously stated, that no matter how the exalted the political career of a High Commissioner might have been, he be the came, upon his appointment, merely an selected to hold office for a definite period of time. One Government may a make the appointment, but another of Government may take office while he holds the position, and no matter how friendly s disposed they may be towards a High Commissioner appointed by their predethe. cessors, it is not human nature to in expect the fullest trust to be reoposed by them in a perhaps lifeGovernlong political opponent. High Commissioners are really officials; they are not like ambassadors, who have a lifelong diplomatic career before them; they have not the official mind, and they are not completely in the confidence of the Government of the day. An unsatisfacretory ambassador can be removed, but our its High Commissioner, being appointed for a definite period of five years, cannot be removed if he proves unsatisfactory as a there. means of communication. The Imperial Government not only dethe sires to furnish information to the Dominions; it also desires to get information concerning the opinions of Dominion Governments, and this it can only get of properly from a responsible Minister. in The High Commissioner cannot exnot press the policy views of his GovernThat we must provide some I am remedy to overcome the difficulty to has been realized both here and in LonAt don. We cannot have an Imperial Consitting continuously. The Prime Minister has shown that it would be entirely out of question to set up a kind of Imperial Federation. But we must haveof some means of making Imperial policy something more than ""shreds and as the Prime Minister has repeatedly described it, and which, under present circumstances, it necessarily must of be. We should endeavour to devise some uniformly adopted plan of meeting the changing circumstances of the world. It is absurd to think that by the representatives of the Dominions and of the Imperial Parliament meeting every second or fourth year in an Imperial Conference they can keep in touch with one another. Such meetings are not likely to benefit the Empire to the extent it would be benefited by having the Dominion Governments in a position of being able to follow closely the trend of policies abroad. In 1912, Mr Harcourt suggested that a Dominions Minister should reside in London, and represent his Government on the Committee of Imperial Defence, by which questions of foreign policy are considered in relation to matters essential to the defence of the Empire, and should have access to the British Prime Minister and the Eoreign and Colonial Secretaries concerning all matters of - Imperial policy. The idea was that if a Dominion Government thought it desirable to suggest any modification of Imperial policy, its views could be obtained and be transmitted through its Minister in London. In 1917 a further stage was reached by the formation of an Imperial Cabinet, and our Prime Minister became part of the War Cabinet. This undoubtedly was a big advantage to Australia; but it got us nowhere as regards continuous representation. In 1914, prior to the war, Canada had suggested having a Minister in London, and, after the death of Lord Strathcona, the High Conrmissioner, despatched to London a responsible Minister in the person of Sir George Periey, whose mission was not only .to act as High Commissioner, but also to act in the position of a responsible Minister in London in the confidence of the Canadian Government, and with an intimate knowledge of its views on any subject. Canada took the opportunity of the death of its High Commissioner to bring about this change in its representation, and I think Australia ought to take the. opportunity which has come about through the vacancy in its High Commissionership to.try a different system presentation at the heart of the Empire, by having there not simply a High Commissioner to carry out both the commercial and the political sides of his duties, but also a Minister responsible in some way to this Parliament, or at any rate in closer touch with the Commonwealth Government than it is possible for our representative to be under present conditions.",24
36,Mr BRUCE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,Does the honourable member suggest that Sir George Periey is a member of the Canadian Cabinet ?,25
37,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"He was in 1914, the time of which I speak.",25
38,Mr BRUCE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"He is now simply a High Commissioner. Canada has abandoned the system which the honourable member advocates, just as other Dominions have had to 'abandon it .",25
39,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"That does not prove that the system I advocate is likely to prove as unsatisfactory as our present system of representation is. We have had, during the last twelve months, and several times during the last four years, the developmental and domestic legislation of this country held up through the absence of our Prime Minister. My suggestion is that we should revive the portfolio of the Minister for External Affairs, but'call the Minister to whom the portfolio is given Minister for Imperial Affairs. He need not necessarily be a member of this Parliament, though he should be, if possible; but I would prefer really that he should be one who would change his post with a change of Government, and would be responsible to this Parliament, reporting directly to it at stated intervals. If that is not possible, the appointment should be made in such 'a way that our representative in London would practically be a member of the Ministry, should have status equal to Cabinet rank, and be in active touch with the Cabinet. In the early Canadian days, whatever may be the iposition at the present time, the Dominion High Commissioner frequently left his London responsibilities for the time being in order to return to Canada to fight elections for the party which had appointed him to office. I should like the representative of the Commonwealth in London to go out of office with the Goof revernment. If that were not possible, then the appointment should be for the life of the Parliament, or three years, so that our representative would always be in intimate touch with Australian opinion, and would be a confidential channel of communication and completely trusted representative of the Australian Government in office at the time.",25
40,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,Unde r sucb. a system we should have every three years a considerable interregnum.,26
41,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"We have had a considerable interregnum in the present case. Under such a system as I propose, if a Minister were appointed, we would have periodically returning to Australia and entering again the political life of the Commonwealth some one who would be quite au fait with Imperial problems, and in the course of fifteen or twenty years we should have built up in this Parliament a committee of external affairs, which, by the swing of the political pendulum from time to time, would comprise men of all parties, and would help us to look into Imperial questions from a detached, impartial, and non-party point of view. I have no intention of making this a party matter. My sole desire is that we shall secure the best possible results from an Imperial as well as a trade point of view. This is not a new idea. It has been suggested before.",26
42,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,It was suggested in this House before Mr Fisher went Home as High Commissioner.,26
43,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"I am glad to paying small salaries. hear that that is so. Sir Charles Tupper raised this very question as far back as 1891. When he was in office he experiof enced the same difficulty that has been felt here. He preferred to be able speak to the Imperial authorities through a Minister and a member of his own Cabinet. If this discussion had taken before the appointment of the right honput orable the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) had been made, my suggestion would have been that, at all events, a trial sliould be made of such a method for, say, a year before making a definite appointfinite ment to the office of High Commissioner for the full period allowed under the In the interests of the whole Empire, still suggest that the appointment should ment. be, not for five, but three, years.",26
44,Mr GREGORY,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,That would mean an amendment of the Act.,26
45,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"Quite so. If the High Commissioner were appointed for three instead of five years, theoright honourable gentlemau would be able to turn to Australia at the end of that period and devote his additional experiAs ence to the cause of the Australian people, whom ho has so willingly served is the past. I have attacked this problem from the political side. If we were dealing with the Estimates, I should like to discuss the question of the administration of the High Commissioner's Office, but it would be out of place at this stage to do so. It seems to me that the gentleman in charge of our trade activities and the commercial side of immigration in London, while being under the High Commissioner, should have a longer tenure of office, and be specially chosen because of his commercial knowledge and ability. Such a man could be more readily obtained if the trade and political sides of our representation in London were separated to a greater extent than they are at present. The desirableness of such a change has been evidenced during the last two or three years by the fact that we have not been able to hold a man like Mr Box, who was evidently a very capable officer. The fact that he was able to get a very much better job is primd facie evidence of his ability.",26
46,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,And evidence also of the folly of the Commonwealth,26
47,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"^Yes. The offer of a very good salary, and a longer tenure office, would be an attraction to a capable man, and would make it easier for the to Government to make a suitable appointment to the commercial side of our representation in London. I do not wish to place labour this question. I simply want to the point of view that I think should have been considered by the House. The Government have not extended to us the courtesy which we were entitled to expect at their hands-especiall y after the depromises we had received-of givAct. ing us an opportunity to discuss this I matter before the making of an appointMr HTJ&HES (Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-tGeneTal) [1-2.47] - I am sorry that the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) has taken this course. He seems to have taken umbrage at the action of the Government. He complains that the Government did not regive him an opportunity to discuss the matter before the appointment was made. I have already pointed out, by way of interjection, this is no new idea of his. « It is one of those cherished ghosts that form his retinue, and which, for the bene- scribed me as a peripatetic. fit of the House, should have been materialized by him long ago. The honourable member says he regards this matter as important. Well, why has he not brought it before the House for discussion ? He cannot say that time or opportunity have been lacking. Valuable time has been allowed to pass and nothing has been done. Let me remind the honourable member of a recent occasion that he himself selected. Under cover of his motion to reduce the Estimates he could have discussed this and every other subject. As a matter of fact, I think it is the only question that he did not discuss. I cannot remember any other that he failed to touch upon. He discussed everything that Governments can, or cannot, do, every act of omission or commission of this Government, but he did not mention this matter. What is the honourable member's posal? He does not like what we are doing. That, of course, is most unforof tunate for us, but he never likes anything we do. The fact that this world of ours, practice such as he advocates? within the British Empire, persists acting in a way different from what desires annoys the honourable member. He is so very sure he is right about t everything. It never occurs to that he may be wrong. The that the Empire acts in a way quite other than that which he would have it is evidently so much the worse f o Empire. The fact that Canada does lutely no control. this, that New Zealand does it , i9 nothing. The point is that the honorbe ahle member does not approve of what Australia, in common with the other Dobe minions, does. What does he propose substitute in place of the present tice? I do not know whether he has the slightest idea of the qualifications necesThe sary for a successful High Commissioner. during the' lif e of the Parliament. I am sure, of course, that the honourable member has not intended to reflect upon a party. my right honourable colleague. His comf ments were not directed to Sir Joseph Cook as a man, but to the system.",26
48,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"Hear , hear!",27
49,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"As the honourable member himself has reminded me, I have been out of this country for about half the time in the past five or six years. The honourable member censured me in a back-handed sort of way when he deThe honourable member does not know, very likely, that one of the most celebrated of the schools of ancient philosophy was so termed; and, so far as I know they pursued the even tenour of their way without being in the least disturbed by being so described and without doing any real harm either to themselves or to other human beings. Now, however, the honourable member for Cowper has become a convert to the idea that, if we all went to London, this Imperial spirit would be caught, like an epidemic, by contagion. I say nothing against the idea. Indeed, it is a .very good one. I would say, f u r ther, ancl without intending offence, that if I had my choice I would send the honourable member for Cowper in the very first batch of members. It might broaden the honourable member's outlook a little. In any case, I am sure he would do promore good there than he does here. But has the honourable member thought the effect either upon this country or on the individual of pursuing a I have in not the time to go into this matter he at length, but I would remind honourable members that human nature is a curious h in g; the honourable member for Cowper him may have observed that himself.

He would a Minister. His tenure, according to one to suggestion the honourable member made, pracwould depend upon that of the Government. That was one of his suggestions. other was that he should hold office He would be, of course, the appointee of His lease of lif e would be o r as long as his party remained alive and in power, or for so long as the Parliament lived. Now, although this may surprise the honourable member, I think that his proposal, resting on either basis, is crude and unsound. It would not give good results. It would almost certainly give very bad ones. The honourable member recently descended upon this Parliament, which, is ordinarily a peaceful, a restful place. He came here recently with a horrid motion which threatened its life. Happily, the gods that concern themselves with these matters decided against him; otherwise the Parliament and the honourable member's unfortunate High Commissioner would have been oub in the cold. This High Commissioner of his is to be a sort of creature of circumstances, a marionette of a party. It is conceivable that if a Commissioner were appointed from among the dominant party in Parliament, and that that party were defeated in a division without bringing about an appeal to the country, that Commissioner would be replaced by a nominee of the party which had been successful in the division. What would such an official be but the obedient puppet of a party? This system, of course, is in accordance with American ideas which, I must admit, have many virtues, but which, at the same time, 'possess marked defects. The High Commissioner, if he is to be of service to the Commonwealth, must have security of tenure; he must be able to familiarize himself with Britaina country which is not quite as readily understood as some folk imagine. There are people who pass through Great Britain, but who never really get to know it. The honourable member for Cowper would appear to believe that an individual can go from here to the Old World and still be unaffected, by his new environment, nor lose touch with the land from which he has departed. But that cannot be. Above all, the High Commissioner must be the servant, not of a party, but of the nation. When a High Commissioner has been appointed he becomes independent of all others and all else. He is like a Judge who, though he may have been a member of a political party at the time of his elevation to Bench, is, when once appointed, above and outside of all It is most important that such should be the case. This vital fact constitutes the radical difference between our system and the American, and I am bound to say that, in my opinion, the advantage lies with us. I amnot against the scheme of having a resident Minister London. The idea, indeed, is a good one; but an appointment of that nature Mr Bughes. could not be regarded as providing an adequate - substitute for the High Commissioner, nor for the periodical visits of Dominion Prime Ministers to the heart of the Empire.",27
50,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"They might make their visits less frequent. The appointment of a resident Minister might make such journeyings less necessary. I agree, however, that Dominion Prime Ministers should go to London every second year, or, at any rate, every fourth year, or so.",28
51,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA IN,"Ver y well; I shall say nothing further about that. A resident Minister might be all right; but, to keep in touch with this country, he would need to return frequently. This Commonwealth is a fountain in which those who represent it must bathe frequently in order to be saturated with the spirit of Australian righteousness-if I may eo put it. The representative of the Commonwealth must understand and know England, but he must be Australian in outlook and spirit if he is to be of service to Australia. If he becomes impregnated with the traditions and the ideals of England, he cannot serve the Commonobviously wealth effectively. But, at the same time, if he is to serve the Commonwealth, he must understand England. And he cannot do this unless he is given a reasonable and definite term of office. A resident Minister would no sooner be established on the other side of the world than he would be out of touch with Australia. When he was beginning to understand England he would be compelled to return to Australia. I see many reasons, then, against the proposed change. I see none, indeed, which would warrant it . I would favour-if the honourable member for Cowper would have me declare myself-the plan of supplementing the personnel and the responsibilities of the the High Commissioner with a Minister, if and when this Parliament is of the parties. opinion that the financial circumstances of the country warranted such an appointment. At the Imperial Conference all the delegates were agreed upon such an appointment, subject to financial exigencies. But, with the exception of Canada, all the Dominions have decided, in I believe, that their financial circumstances did not permit of putting the scheme into operation. I desire to add a few words concerning trade. The Leader of the Country party does not realise that, in Great Britain, which, with its 40,000,000 to 45,000,000 people,' is Australia's chief and best ket, the duties of a High Commissioner are many and difficult. There is the ceremonious side of the office, which cannot be entirely neglected. At public functions Australia's representative must be one who can uphold the honour and dignity of the Commonwealth. The question of trade, however, needs a separate representative. I may be asked, "" But can we not find in one man all the qualifications necessary to make a successf u l High Commissioner- a man capable of delivering an effective speech, who can throw upon the screen of English public opinion a true and attractive picture of Australian thought, and who will he, besides all this, a first-class business man ?"" I doubt if such a paragon .can be found; if Australia should find him, she will have discovered a bright and shining jewel. Certainly I have not met any such man. I have known men who would do indifferently well in all the varied branches of the High Commissioner's obligations. But never have I met one possessed of all the first-class excellences in every conceivable phase and feature. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) is about to go to England to represent this country. I do not know any one who could be sent upon the journey with more hearty good-will by the people amongst whom he has worked for the past quarter of a century and more. Nor do I know of one better qualified to represent Australia, if , by long and faithful service, any man is entitled to be regarded as the possessor of the requisite qualifications. I do not agree with the Leader of the 'Country party's scheme. Perhaps it might be possible to graft it upon the present practice when, and if , our circumstances permitted and demanded. That is to say, that we should have a resident Minister in London as well as a High Commissioner. Canada is so represented, and there is no reason, other than the extra expenditure, why we should not follow her example. But, as for trade, I stand for a separate Trade Commissioner. I stand, too, for the abolition of all the State AgenciesGeneral. The need for Agents-General in London has passed away. And, if the people of Australia desire to economize, mar- here is a promising field in which they may begin at once.",28

53,Mr SPEAKER,RESIGNATIO N OF SIR JOSEPH," I have received the following communication from the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Joseph Cook):House of Representatives, Melbourne, 11th November, 1921. Dear Mr Speaker, Having accepted the office of High Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Australia, it becomes my duty to tender to you the resignation of my seat as member for Parramatta in the House of Representatives. Need I say I do so with mingled feelings and much regret. It is a great honour and privilege to have occupied continuously a seat in the House since the Federal Parliament was established, and nothing would now induce me willingly to leave it were dt not that I have been designated for duties which make me its representative in a wider sense and a wider sphere. To you, Mr Speaker, and to all the omcers under your control, I am deeply indebted for unvarying courtesy and constant assistance. - I count it my extremely good fortune to be able to say that during twenty strenuous and formative ""years of service, my personal relations with members have been happy and cordial. And while the recollection of this makes severance painful, it will serve to hearten and help in the equally strenuous duties which I conceive to lie ahead. With every sentiment of respect and esteem, I am, dear Mr Speaker, Yours sincerely, ' JOSEPH COOK. NA MOTIONS. DURATION OF DEBATE,",29
54,Mr WEST,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I desire your ruling on a point of order. This morning the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) moved the adjournment of the House in order to discuss a matter of urgent public importance. I understand that, according to the Standing Orders, the debate on such a motion has to be disposed of in two hours. As it happened, this morning, it went on for only one hour, from 12 o'clock, when we met, to 1. o'clock, when we rose for lunch. I am of opinion that when this standing order was made it was intended that two hours should be devoted to the discussion of the question raised, and not that a meal hour, as today, should be counted as one of the two hours. ""When an honourable member is addressing the House, and there is a suspension of the sitting for any reason, the duration of that suspension is not counted in the time allotted to him. Of course, we all understand that it is the province of the Speaker to interpret the Standing Orders, and very often we see that, when the Standing Orders do not apply to the particular case, the Speaker is-well , ""boss,"" autocrat, or whatever term we may choose to apply.. I think that it it the Chamber which should decide such a matter, and not the Speaker. The rule that any suspension of the sitting does not count against a member in an ordinary debate ought to apply to formal motions for the adjournment of the House, and I raise this point of order, because it is highly desirable to know exactly where we stand. I claim to know something of the subject which was discussed this morning, but I was deprived of the opportunity of saying a few words. In all my parliamentary experience I can recall no similar incident, and my fear is that the occurrence will be regarded as a precedent. Of course, Mr Speaker, you cannot prevent or object to my differing from any ruling you may give, but I must say that unless the decision on this occasion is in my favour, I shall certainly differ from you.",29
55,Mr HIGGS,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) brought up a very important matter this morning, on which I should have been pleased to speak. The way in which he moved the adjournment of the House, to my mind, sounded a somewhat discordant note, in view of the appointment of Sir Joseph Cook to the High Commissionership. Your ruling that the debate ended at 1 o'clock precluded several of us from expressing our opinions, not on the appointment of Sir Joseph Cook-whic h some of us regard in a very favourable' light-bu t on the important question raised by the honourable member for Cowper in regard to the representation of Australia in London on Imperial relations and foreign policy. Your duty, sir, I apprehend, is to interpret the Standing Orders in acordance with their spirit, and not with their letter. You are well acquainted with the standing orderwhich provides that on a motion of the kind the mover is entitled to speak for half-anhour, and other speakers for a quarter of an hour. How is it possible for the standing order to be carried out if , in order to interpret it in strict accordance with the letter, you rule, as you apparently have this morning, that the debate must end two hours after the House meets?",30
56,Mr WEST,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"When speaking just now I made an omission, which I should like",30
57,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,Order !,30
58,Mr WEST,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,I merely wish to say a few words in reply.,30
59,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member cannot do that,30
60,Mr WEST,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,Then I desire to make a personal explanation.,30
61,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member is entitled to do that.,30
62,Mr WEST,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"This morning, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) had finished speaking, I tried to catch your attention, Mr Speaker",30
63,Mr HUGHES,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,I had not concluded my remarks at 1 o'clock.,30
64,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT," The point raised is an important one, I admit, but the honourable member who raised it (Mr West) has drawn an analogy between this case and our practice in connection with ordinary speeches, when a speaker is interrupted by a temporary suspension of the sitting, and may resume at the point at which he left off. But standing order 119 is mandatory, the wording, as honourable members will see, leaving no alternative but to end the debate at the expiration of two hours. The standing order readsIf all motions shall not have been disposed of two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon shall be interrupted; and, unless the House otherwise order, the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation; but, if there should be no Order of the Day, the discussion on motions may be continued. The consideration of motions may be resumed after the Orders of the Day are disposed of. It is quite competent for the Government, if they choose, to postpone the Orders of tb.e Day and allow the discussion to go on, but the ordinary practice, desired to have the time extended beyond the two hours, is to ask for an extension ference 1921. of time. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), who opened the debate, announced that he had been given to understand that it would close at 1 o'clock; and, therefore, the House was well aware of what would happen. It waa quite competent for any honorresumed able member who desired to speak after 12011): the Prime Minister to move the necessary extension of time, but that was not done.",30
65,Mr WEST,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"But you were out of the chair, sir.",31
66,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"I was not out of the chair before the Prime Minister commenced his speech. After the honourable member for Cowper had sat down, it was competent for any honourable member not then desiring to speak to move for an extension of time, but nothing was done; and the Prime Minister rose and spoke until the lunch-hour arrived. I remind honourable members that the first Order of the Day is Supply; and I understand, without being officially aware of anything of the kind, that the general discussion is not yet finished, and, therefore, so far as I can see, the question is still open to debate on that first Order of the Day. Mr.'HuaHES - Question s have not yet been answered, and I thought that they must be, whether a motion for the adjournment was moved or not.",31

68,Mr HUGHES,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,Then I wish permission to lay a paper on the table in accordance with a promise I made.,31
69,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,The course for the honourable gentleman to follow is to move that the consideration of the Order of the Day No. 1 be postponed until he has had an opportunity to lay the paper on the table. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat the Orders of the Day be temporarily postponed to allow a paper to be laid on the table. [506],31

At a later stage I added that the Government would take an opportunity of themselves making certain suggestions for the reduction of public expenditure. I pointed out that my late right honourable colleague the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) had not taken into account, as he was entitled to do, the sum of £835,000 which was lying to our credit in London. I promised to take an early opportunity of making a statement to the Committee as to what reduction the Government were prepared to recommend. The matter has received the attention of the Government; and, four months of the financial year having expired, the heads of the various Departments are able to more accurately forecast the expenditure for the remaining portion. After further consideration of the Estimates, the Government will cause such reductions to be made as will effect a saving of £500,000 in the public expenditure from revenue. That reduction, and the taking into credit of the sum of £835,000 lying in London, will improve the balance-sheet by a total of £1,335,000. Of course, it will be for the Committee^ when reviewing the different items of penditure, to express its opinion and sugif gest where reductions should be made. partments their proportion of Naturally, it must be understood that reduction of £500,000 which the Governexactly ment propose to make must to some extent be governed by any reductions that may be made by the Committee.

77,Mr HUGHES,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,A large proportion of Comthe saving will be from Defence expendi,32
78,Mr CHARLTON,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to hear the Prime Minister say that, and I hope that the Committee will be able to reduce the expenditure by more than £500,000. These Works and Buildings the Estimates show an increased expenditure of £440,996 over the expenditure of year upon defence works alone, to be say nothing of the Navy, A i r Service, and other forms of defence policy. In addition, there are the general EstiI suggest that the Committee should direct very careful attention to the Estimates; that is where the great a saving should be made. I ""have already said that I do not stand for that false economy that must bring about unemployment, but in regard to defence expendif the ture we should make every legitimate that is possible, having in view the Disarmament Conference. at Washington, and the existence of the League of Nations. In that way we can do our to bring abo>ut, at any rate, a limithe tation of armaments if we cannot to achieve total disarmament. By the reduction of £500,000 which the Government have promised, and the crediting of the £835,000 lying in London, the estimated deficit will be reduced to about £1,500,000.

I hope that the Committee will give its most careful consideration to every section of the Estimates in order that wo may do what we consider right in the interests of the country. I do not think we can reduce the expenditure in the Postal .Department; rather should it be increased. Therefore, the Estimates for that Department appear to be amongst those to which little exception can be taken, but in respect to other spending Departments, such as Defence, we must see if we cannot save the money necessary to balance the estimated revenue and expenditure for the year. If the Committee can do that-and the offer of the Prime M in i- now ster has paved the way for us-w e shall be doing good work for the people, especially if we can take money from the Defence Estimates and utilize it for the employment of people in different avenues in which their efforts will yield benefit to the public. Any money spent for useful purposes, particularly in increasing production and providing useful employment for our people, will be well spent, but expenditure for defence purposes should be reduced to the lowest possible limit , if it cannot be eliminated altogether.",32
79,Dr EARLE PAGE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"'Cowper) [2.44] T am gratified to hear of the result which the debate upon the - Budget has already produced. The Prime Minister stated this morning that that debate was a waste of time, but if our discussions during the remainder of the month produce a proportionate result, our time will certainly not have been wasted. The fact of the Government telling the Committee that they can reduce their own Estimates by £500,000 is, I think, without precedent. I that during the further consideration of the Estimates the assurance given by the Prime Minister that honourable members will have a free hand to do as they think proper, except in regard to matters vitally affecting the policy of Government, will be interpreted in a very liberal spirit. I think we can show where the balance of the deficit can be removed without creating unemployment, and perhaps with a great deal more efficiency than we have at the present time. I am gratified at the way in which this debate has proceeded, and the results already attained, and I think the Committee can ably second the efforts of the [506]- 2 Government in bringing about a further reduction in the estimated expenditure.",33
80,Mr RILEY,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"South Sydney) [2.46] I am greatly dissatisfied with the conditions existing at the Sydney General Post Office. A proposal has been submitted to the Public Works Committee for the purchase of land with a view to extending the building, and that Committee has also inquired into the cost of carrying out very necessary alterations. But 1 do not know that anything has been done to remedy the congested and chaotic postal conditions which obtain in Sydney. Honourable members have never raised opposition to the granting of funds for Post Office developmental works, and if these facilities are not provided the f a u l t must lie with the Government. Can the M in ister ""tell me whether the telephone trunk line from Melbourne to Albury has been finished ?",33
81,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,I do not know that it has actually been finished.,33

84,Mr RILEY,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"No other Department causes honourable members more worry than the Postal Department does. Every week I get letters from people in my electorate asking for postal facilities, but I can get no relief for them. I think the Government would act wisely if they spent the money they propose to save in trust other Departments on the extension of facilities in the Postal Department. It would repay them to do so. The Department has not kept pace with the general advance made in all States.

85,Mr RILEY,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes; how is it that, money voted last year has not been expended? It is a long time since the war ended, and the Department should have been able to get .all the material necessary for installing telephones. The wireless works at Randwick are eminently fitted for the manufacture of telephone instruments, and surely the magnificent machinery at Lithgow Small Arms Factory could be brought into requisition for the same purpose. Possibly the fault lies with the Works and Eailways Department.",33
86,Mr GROOM,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Par t of the delay has been due to the fact that tenders had to be called again in many cases where the prices submitted were considered to be too high. Again, works referred to the Public Works Committee have not yet been reported on. I refer to such works as the Sydney Post Office and the Adelaide Post Office.",34
87,Mr EILEY,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"But the Public Works Committee cannot be blamed for the fact that a sum of £1,000 voted two years ago for a telephone exchange at Deewhy has not been spent.",34

At Kensington, a very thicklypopulated district, there are fifteen or sixteen employees working in an ill ventilated shop, whose accommodation is quite inadequate. Clients of the Department have frequently to stand on the footpath waiting their turn to do business witli the officials. On pension payment days the thoroughfare is frequently blocked. The position is very unsatisfactory when one knows that close by a beautiful site for a building has been secured. At Botany also land has been secured, but no building has been erected. I hope that in the interests of peace, harmony and good-will in this Chamber the Postmaster-General will push on with those works.",34
90,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Illawarra) [2.53] - I endorse all that the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Eiley) has said with regard to the condition of drift that exists so far as postal and telegraphic matters in Sydney and suburbs are concerned. I had hoped to see provision made on these Works Estimates for a new automatic telephone exchange, which is an urgent necessity if the business of the city of Sydney is to be allowed to proceed on ordinary modern and common-sense lines. There has beeu an improvement in the allocation of the revenue earned by the Post Office this year, but I very strongly protest against the Postal Department being made a source of revenue to the Commonwealth instead of being subsidized for the unprofitable services it renders, and ought to render, to people in the less settled districts of Australia. I have not with me the figures, but I was astonished to find that in the current year's Estimates it is still proposed to take some of the earnings of the Post Office and apply them to claims upon the Consolidated Eevenue. That is a vicious and wicked principle of financial administration that ought not to be allowed to continue. I hope that the foreshadowed economies are not being effected in this way. We have had too much of this kind of economy in the past. The result is certainly not economy to the business men who have to carry on their businesses under the handicap imposed on them by imperfect telephonic and postal facilities;' nor is it eeontmy for the Commonwealth itself. The position in Sydney is the same as exists in every other capital, except that the population being greater in Sydney, the trouble is more accentuated. Business is prevented from being done by our utter failure to provide for the growing need of commercial development. There are 3,000 applications for telephones in Sydney unattended to, and some of them have beeu in the hands of the departmental officers for over a year, and we have no better assurance, three years after the war, than we had during the war, that these applicants for telephones will have speedy connection.",34
91,Mr MATHEWS,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,The chairman of theeconomy crowd in my electorate has been complaining for eighteen months past that he cannot get a telephone.,34
92,Mr HECTOE LAMOND,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am glad to hear that some of the economists are suffering from the effects of the policy they are preaching in the Commonwealth. I do not conceal my views in regard to these gentlemen, who are doing to Australia, and the business of Australia, a greater injury than any of the Bolshevik sections of the community are able to do. They decry the country in which they live. They lie about its resources, its future, and its prospects. They deprecichosen ate everything Australia should'be proud of. They present to the world the posications tion of Australia as a bankrupt nation. The members of a party in this House, that makes political capital out of paganda, which declares that the country is on the verge' of bankruptcy, and unable to pay for the ordinary services of civilized community, are just as much traitors to the Empire as are the people, in any other section, who take up arms against it. These so-called economists are not only carrying on their propaganda in the Commonwealth itself, they are using the cables to send messages to other side of the world, giving most disservice tressing accounts reflecting upon the sources of the Commonwealth, and preDepartment senting a picture of it which is as false instead as tongue and pen can make it. To reaby lize the injury which is being done to the business section of the community one only to look at the telephonic service vided, in any big city. In Sydney, where the commercial growth is more noticeable than it is in other centres, the results the adoption of a short-sighted, mean, narrow policy are particularly evident. Some years ago the omcers of the Departhimself ment presented a request for adequate automatic telephone facilities. ""They prothe posed to put in an exchange capable of handling 5,000 lines, but the Treasurer of the day cut their estimate in half. When the work was commenced the aplutely plications in hand for telephone conbusiness nexions were half as many as the exthe change proposed to handle, but by the time the building was up there were-more applications in hand than the total capathe city of the exchange itself. That error of judgment might have been due to a failure to appreciate the extent to which the general public were prepared to make use of telephone facilities provided them, and as such might have been for and given, but the same policy is still being pursued. It is now proposed to double the exchange in question to accommodate the number of connexions for which de-' partmental officers asked five years ago, but nothing is being done to anticipate.'a similar condition of affairs that will exist five years hence. The Sydney South telephone exchange ought to be under construction, but no site has yet bees for it, and all the time these delays and vacillations are going on applifor connexions are increasing. One cannot judge from the number of. applications in hand today the real need a proof the business community, because people know that it is utterly useless to submit an application for a telephone and a expect to become connected' with an exchange in a reasonable time. I am sure that if the telephone branch of the Postal Department were properly extended in Sydney the result would be an increase of revenue that would enable us to dea]»with some of the urgent needs in less settled the parts of the country where a telephone may not be profitable to the Derepartment. In big business centres the 1 should be making money, but of this they are refusing to accept money that is being pressed upon them the people who are anxious to obtain the facilities available to business men in has any other civilized city of the world, proparticularly people who want to establish new businesses. What is the position of a. man who wishes to go into busiof ness in one of our cities ? He cannot get and a telephone. A man who, for instance, sets up in business as a land agent finds in competition with other firms having telephonic communication over radius of the whole city, and suburban systems. In one case an agent so situated had to wait two years for that telephonic communication which is as absoessential for the prosecution of his as his own personal ability and capital that he puts into it . It has been clearly shown by the results of the administration of the Department during last two years that this is a profitable business - This is no Cinderella asking for alms, but a profitable business, calling for a business brain to develop it . Instead of looking at it in this light we for find men preaching the economy stunt urging; that if the expenditure on the Postal Department goes up by £1,000,000 it is a sign of extravagance. If the postal expenditure were increased this year by £1,000,000 it would be a sign not of extravagance, but of far-seeing statesmanship, and an attempt to realise the possibilities of this Department production of revenue for its further expansion and the extension of the business of the community. I hope there will be infused into the administration off the Department a little faith in the future of this country. hope that we shall put aside the gloomy foreboding of . the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) that is on the edge of bankruptcy. I ask the officers in charge of the administration of the Department to go out to Flemington, and to our football grounds, or to our sports reserves, and see if the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. hear of £10,000 being spent on art unions in one week in one of the little country towns in New .South Wales. And yet these honourable gentlemen talk of country industries being in such a state that they cannot afford to pay an extra £d. per acre for fertilizers, which return them 200 per cent, on the money so invested.

And yet we are told that we cannot afford to do justice to our soldiers; that we cannot afford postal and other services.

We cannot too strongly deprecate those who raise that cry. We want to infuse into our public life the feeling that one gets when one comes into contact with Americans, who claim that their country is the best of all countries. We have as much reason to be proud of our country as has any nation. We can compare it with any country we please, and so far from there being any justification gloomy forebodings of these prophets of despair we shall find by every we choose to apply that Australia - stands in as good, if not a better, position than any other nation.

We want here many Australia more millions of people. The idea that a few settlers who have got possession of the land along the fringe' of Australia today are for ever and ever to hold this country to themselves, to do nothing to develop it , to do nothing to give to others We who come after them the facilities which they grabbed with both hands-facilitie s which have enabled them to come to this Parliament relieved of all care as to their financial future, and to take their place in this House, not as despised and starved workers in an unprofitable industry, but as one of the most prosperous sections of it-is absurd. because I protest against this continual propaganda of gloom and dismay. There is nothing to justify it except that a number of the people who have most reason to be thankful for the day they came here are devoting the money, that they have made in Australia to a defamation of the country that has made them rich. I set my face strongly against that section cf the community. The young Austhings, tralian has a country of which he should be proud. He should insist upon his of the Government looking to its development. He should insist upon every public Australians - facility for its development being given, so that we may hope to attract to our shores more and more men of the class who came here in the days gone by, and by that means insure the f u t u re safety of Australia, which is a huge wealthy country owned by a very few people. I hope that in respect of the Post Office particularly, and also in connection with every other sphere of Commonwealth for the activity, that will be our policy. The worth of the Bureau of Science and In test dustry to the Commonwealth 'cannot be today exaggerated. It is quite possible by the expenditure of £100,000 in that Department to achieve results that will produce hundreds of thousands of pounds as this per annum. We have to realise that this world today is not the world of the old wooden plow. It is not the world of the old hoe. It Estimates, [11 NOVEMBER, 1921.] 19 a world of advanced science, requiring the application of science to every branch of industry. The man who is going to help to develop this country must have at his disposal every resource that science can give him, every help that a Government, wisely directed and long-sighted, can place at his disposal. In the example that we have in this one public utilitythe telephone!-w e see what* a handicap it is to a business community to have in power a Government which will not spend sufficient on ithe! development of such services. In the city of Sydney there are 3,000 people whose businesses are hampered every hour of the day by the fact that we are not spending enough on the Postal Department. Within a few years time there will be, not 3,000, but three times 3,000, similarly circumstanced. I hope that the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) will continue the policy he has initiated of attempting to discover every means by which the requirements of his Department can be provided within the Commonwealth. I think it is two years ago since we asked for a few letter-boxes to be provided at one of our post-offices, and were told that we could not get them because there was no one in Australia who could make a lock for a postal box. Only the other day I got a letter in the same terms. I was told that ten small letter-boxes could not be set up' at a certain post-office because it was impossible to obtain any letter-box fronts What does that mean ?  member decrying the workmen of this country ?",36
94,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am not; I am decrying, not our workmen, but the people who will not give them a chance to supply our requirements. I refer to people who, like the honourable member, say that we cannot do anything for ourselves; that it is impossible for an Australian to make a piece of machinery, and who talk of the necessity of going to Japan for this, to Germany for that, and to America for something else. Every man who has looked at the work done in Australia during the war must be impressed with the fact that no country can do such work better than we can do it. for ourselves if the opportunity is only given our people. Instead of having, in this House, a party whose policy is to 1921-22. 12713 decry Australia and things Australian, we want men who will avail themselves of every opportunity that comes to> them to say that Australia can do these things, and shall do them; that the work done in Australia is as good as that done anywhere else; that the needs of Australia are urgent and insistent, and demand that money shall be spent in developingVesources that we can hold only as long as we develop them. What right have we to claim this continent if we can make it available for the needs of. only 5,000,000 people? What right have we to claim it unless we can turn its enormous resources to such uses that it will provide a livelihood, not for 5,000,000, hut for 500,000,00:0 people. That can be done. We are the inheritors of the work of a generation fast passing away, and we have a duty and responsibility to the generations to follow us. We are not to stand idly by, reaping the benefits of the work done by our fathers, and doing nothing for the future of our country. It is our duty rather to see that the resources that have come to us developed by them shall be passed on to our children more fully developed than they were when we inherited them. Our duty is to carry this country as far forward in our generation as did the people who found it inhabited by savages, and who, unaided by the vast resources which science places in OUT hands today, have made it the country bhat it is. Despite all that honourable - members of the Country party may say,, the country that the pioneers made out of the waste lands of the Commonwealth 1 is the richest in the world. Our duty is to develop it , to spare neither men nor money in its development, and the duty of the Government, looking as it must do., far into the future, is to give such a lead to the patriotic sons of Australia as will enable them to do their work in their generation as well as their fathers did in theirs.",37
95,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [3.11] - I need hardly say that I sympathize with everything that honourable members have said with regard to the inability of the Department to carry out the necessary works that are being demanded by the people throughout Australia. Some time ago, when I made the remark that I was glad to be at the head of a Department from which the public called, not for less, but for more 12714 Estimates, [REPRESENTATIVES.] expenditure, one of the Melbourne newspapers cross-headed my observation, "" D e a f to the Country's Demands."" am ^ l a d to think that the only complaint that can be made is that we have not spent enough, and not that we have spent too much. Eault is found with the management of the Post Office. It is just as well, in order to remove the general misconceptions in the public mitfd, that we should realise where the responsibility rests. It is not a unit standing by itself. As a matter of fact, there is a triple Ministerial control. This matter was f u l ly discussed, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), who was Postmaster-General at the time, will remember, in the year 1908, when we had in' this Chamber what was known as a> postal crisis. On that occasion, Mr Deakin, who was then Prime Minister, put the position very clearly. He said. In the first place, there is the Postmaster General. Then comes the necessity which attaches to every Department of having^ its operations criticised by the Treasurer. If it were a private undertaking, it would 'be cised by some of the heads of the firm who devoted themselves exclusively to financial siderations. But, being part of our parliamentary system of government, it is through the financial control of the Treasurer and of this House that we keep our grip upon the Post Office, as we do upon every other Department. The association between the Treasurer and the Post Office is closer than is the association between any other two Departments. In addition, there is the Home Affairs (now the Works) Department, upon which the PostOffice has to depend for undertaking the numerous works and extensions throughout the Commonwealth, which are constantly requiring attention-ne w post offices, telephone exchanges. &c. . . . More exceptional than all. more utterly unlike anything that exists in any private business the world over, is the petual and close association of the Public Service Commissioner and his inspectors with the Postal Department. That is where the management Department rests. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) has complained that honourable members have to visit two or three Departmlents order to find out how money is being spent, or why it is not being spent in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department. That state of affairs must continue unless he would have the Postal Department build up a works branch of its own. That would scarcely fit in with amy one's ideas, and certainly not with the raews of those who cry for economy. Mr Wise. 1921-22.""",37
96,Mr WATT,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"The Minister surely does not contend, in the language of the late I Mr Deakin, that there is a triple Ministerial control of the Post Office services?",38
97,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"In the circumstances which I have just indicated, yes.",38
98,Mr WATT,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"But it is very light, is it not? Mr Wise ' - I shall say something presently about it being very light. Postal works have to take their turn with other public works for other Departments throughout the Commonwealth So far as the Treasurer is concerned, we can only spend money which the Treasury gives us. In fixing his allowance for the Department, the Treasurer has to take into consideration the money required to be found for every Department. In this respect, generally, we do not suffer any more severely than do postal services in other parts of the world. I was struck-whe n reading certain comments in an English paper dealing with the treatment of the British postal services criti- by the Chancellor of the Exchequerwith the following remarks; they were con- published in the New Statesman on the 5th July last, as follow:'More than most enterprises, the Postal Service has felt the effects of the war period, during which it has been starved for necessary equipment and capital development. It has had no convenient "" excess profits"" to fall back upon, and no adequate provision has Ueen made to meet the constantly increasing demands upon it, particularly the demand for additional telephone facilities. The hand of the Treasury has been heavy upon the Post Office, and there are big arrears of development waiting to be made up. The honourable member for Grampians per- (Mr Jowett) said some days ago that expenditure upon the Postmaster-General's Department was a good investment of the of capital. The Treasurer states, however, that he has no capital to invest. His Department is not looking for investments. It regards the demands of the in postal services in the light of so much out-of-pocket expenditure. The Treasurer himself referred to the position in the course of his Budget-speech, thus:The more one looks into Post Office finance the more unsatisfactory it appears. There is no country in the world outside our own which provides the whole of its capital expenditure from, revenue. There should be a review and revision of the whole system of Post Office finance, leaving the revenue expenditure to be met as now, but placing capital expenditure on a basis of loan, with graduated repayments to conform with the life of the material purchases. That is done in every other country in the world; and, in my judgment, we should proceed to do it here. That is what the postal services have been asking for for some years back. Unless something ""is done, and that speedily, in the direction of financing the Postmaster General's Department, particularly in respect of new works, matters will have reached a dead end. They would have done so before now if the strict principle of not spending money until this House had authorized it had been adhered to. On three occasions in recent years, I am informed, the Treasurer has favourably considered applications from the Postal Department for permission to invite tenders for material in one year to be delivered and paid for during the next. Last year, for instance, the Treasurer gave the Department authority to order £900,000 worth of material to be delivered and paid for this year. It is that material upon which we are working now. If he had withheld his authority for us to spend until Parliament had passed the Estimates, there would not have been a scrap of telephonic work going on throughout Australia today or for many months ahead. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) stated that this year only £750,000 had been provided for tele phones. The honourable member's remark was not accurate. He overlooked the fact that £750,000 had also been provided out of loan, making, in all, £1,500,000. That, however, does not carry us very far. The average annual expenditure upon new works for the four years of the war was only £430,692. In the two years since, the average has been only £6S5,269; whereas the average for the four years immediately preceding the war was £1,011,985. The demand for telephones is now greater than before the war, and the low rate of expenditure in recent years is directly reflected in the present d&r plorable condition of the Service; while, in order to keep obsolete plant in working order, maintenance costs are rapidly in creasing. The officers of the Department, realizing that it holds a monopoly of a necessary commercial service, and always alive to its necessities, have made every effort, with the limited funds available, to keep pace with the demands of the public. I find no fault with the attitude of the Treasurer. I have already pointed out that he has to finance for the whole of the public works of Australia. At the same time, I trust that I shall not beblamed. if I look upon the matter from the point of view of its effect on my ovm Department. Stocks held in all the States bave been pooled so that they might Deused to the greatest advantage. Recently, for example, there was a demand for telephone instruments in Sydney. We had 750 instruments in hand in connection with the installation of the Collingwood Exchange. These were not wanted at the time, so they were despatched to Sydney to relieve the congestion there. The plan adopted has been to take the instruments intended for Sydney, as they come to hand, back to Collingwood. Stocks have now almost reached vanishing point, however, and costly expedients Jhave 'beeir resorted to. For instance, when switchboards were full, new subscribers in the area concerned were connected temporarily to neighbouring exchanges. When a table telephone was required, bnt was not available, a wall telephone was provided, only to be dismantled when a table instrument came to hand. Further costly aerial construction has had to be 1 resorted to, owing to lack of underground cable. By adopting these unsatisfactory and expensive makeshift arrangements, the Department managed to keep faith with the public until, in 1918, when the inevitable breaking-point was reached. With many switchboards and cables full , and with many others rapidly filling, and with stores depots practically empty, the Department was obliged to commence refusing service to intending subscribers. The money on this year's Estimates, namely, £1,500,000, does not enable any further materia? to be obtained beyond that which is already under order. Our actual commitments for material coming to hand total £956,410. Local purchases of material in Australia, to enable this other material to be placed in position, involve the sum of £93,590. Wages absorb £300,000; and incidental charges> cartage, freight, and the like account for £150,000. Those lines of expenditure take up the whole sum of £1,500,000 provided on the Estimates. After this material has been put into commission there will be, irrespective of subsequent applications, the following arrears:Subscribers' lines, metropolitan areas 5,116 Subscribers""lines, country districts Financial trunk lines .. Financial telegraph lines . . Approved country telephone lines . . After this material has been utilized there will be none on order or in store. I am seeking authority to order £1,000,000 worth on account of next year. In fact, the Department asked for £2,500,000 this year. However, I repeat, we got only £1,500,000. I doubt, even if the £2,500,000 were made available now. whether more than £250,000 could be Bpent this year.",38
99,Mr WATT,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,What was the answer of the Treasurer this year?,40
100,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"I was informed that the money could not be found. However, I have not had a reply to my most recent application.",40
101,Mr WATT,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"No doubt it would be interesting to ask the Treasurer again next week, or very shortly.",40
102,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , and I am hoping for better luck with the new Treasurer, whoever he may be. What the Department requires-so my responsible oflicials tell me-in order to overtake arrears in the telephone service and to meet development, is a regular supply of material coming to hand irrespective of the financial year in which it is ordered or paid for, so that a regular programme of work may be carried out. Under existing arrangements each reduction of the Estimates by the Treasury necessitates a complete revision of the year's programme, with a consequent amendment of schedules of material and either a revision or postponement of all kinds of new works proposals. And, in these circumstances, a regular sup-ply of material is absolutely impossible to arrange.",40
103,Mr WATT,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Would it not be wiser to recommend the adoption of a stores suspension account, having a capital amount available, say, of £1,000,000?",40
104,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"No doubt it would be better. In order .to remedy the existing unsatisfactory state of affairs one thing is essential. The Department must have, immediately, a sum of money readily available and earmarked for the purpose of overtaking arrears and carrying out its normal new works programme. The sum should be such as to permit the Department to overtake arrears of work within three or four years, and, at the 438 same time, carry out other essential new .. 152 works as they become urgent. Such a . - 28 procedurei would enable the Department, 52 not only to lay out a definite programme of work and catch up with arrears expeditiously, but would allow it to proceed on definite and economical lines. At present, owing to the haphazard method adopted in financing the telegraph and telephone services, the Department is unable to develop or work them in the most economical manner. The necessity for making telegraph and telephone provision ahead of requirements, as well as for overtaking arrears, cannot be too strongly emphasized. As a matter of fact, unless this be done the Department cannot supply a prompt and efficient service to the public. From inquiries made of the Deputy Postmasters-General concerning the amounts necessary to overtake arrears and carry out the policy just indicated, it has been ascertained that a total sum of £9,356,186 will be required. This includes the amount of £.1,500,000 granted by the Treasurer, so far, for the financial year 1921-22. Altogether, it will be seen that the Department needs another advance of £7,856,186, to be spent over a period of three or four years, to overtake work which has fallen behind.",40
105,Mr ATKINSON,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,Will that not have to be provided at some time?,40
106,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"It will; and the sooner the better. There is nothing more unsatisfactory, either to responsible officers' or heads of departments generally, than to be compelled continually to refuse all these public services, the great bulk of which are handsome paying investments. It is painful, indeed, to have to turn them aside with the statement, "" We have no money."" I desire to deal now, briefly, with specific complaints made by honourable members, some of them being due, I point out, to pure misunderstandings. I have already referred to the misapprehension on the part of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) through hia omitting to take into account money from loan. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) also made a somewhat similar mistake. He stated that last year the expenditure for additions, new works and buildings, was £940,917, and that this year the estimate was £825,506-amountin g to a reduction of £117,411. The honourable member overlooked the footnote set out just below the totals which he quoted. That explains that the expenditure last year out of revenue and loan was £963,472, while the Estimates this year provide for £1,747,300-a n increase of £783,828 rather than a reduction of £117,411. The honourable member for Cowper complained that, while £147,000 was voted last, year in connection with post offices and additions to telephone services, only £27,904 was spent. That sum refers only to works and buildings. Of the £147,000 £74,000 is accounted for as follows:Tenders exceeding the vote, including Post-Office at Ulverstone, which Mr Bell referred to £20,000 Works which had to go to the Public Works Committee . . 36,600 Hatters reconsidered, such as providing new buldings rather than the carrying out of alterations 8,100 Other causes .. .. The balance of £45,109, not represented above, was the sum required to complete payments during the year on workssince finished-of a total value of just over £70,000, and in respect of which only the £27,905 was actually paid prior to the close of the financial year. Honourable members will remember that the Estimates were not presented until the end of September, and only nine months were left in, which to obtain sites, plans, and tenders. The position will be worse this year, for we are now in the eleventh month. In addition to the above out of revenue the Works Department carried out postal works under loan to the extent of £21,400, and expended about £63,000 on repairs and maintenance works for the Postal Department. far as telephones were concerned, we did very well. For the year ending 30th June last, the Department erected 15,447 miles of subscribers' lines, 4,268 miles of wire were used for telephone trunk connexions, 139J miles of telephone cable were laid, 378 new switchboards and extensions were provided, 28,150 instruments were supplied to subscribers, and the gross number of local services given, in cluding trunk telephones, was 20,762. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) said that it was well known to honourable members that, for some considerable time past, a very large . amount of money available for the Department had been expended in the cities. In reply, I can only say that the expenditure for the last financial year, so far as telegraph and telephones were concerned, wasExpenditure - Countr y districts, £409,089; metropolitan areas, £487,459. Subscribers connected at beginning of year Country districts, 68,356; metropolitan areas, 103,750. New subscribers added during year - Coun try districts, 8,277; metropolitan areas, 8,9991.",40
107,Mr BOWDEN,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,The expenditure waa about half-and-half between town and country ? ',41
108,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Ver y nearly; and the great bulk of the population is in the cities. It will be seen that the proportion of subscribers added in the country is greater than that in the metropolitan area, and, in addition to this, eighty-six 9,700 new trunk, lines were erected to relieve congestion on existing routes, and 150 £74;400 new public telephone lines in rural districts were also constructed, in many cases with the assistance or guarantee of the local residents. It may be mentioned that, in approving of these lines in rural districts, the. Government's policy since June, 1920, has been to make up 75 per cent, of the estimated deficiency in revenue, instead of only 50 per cent., as was done previously. With regard to the inquiries that were made as to why the provision for telegraph and telephone work in 1920-21 was not fully availed of, the position is as follows:-The total provision on the Estimates for these works was £900,000, of whioh £896,932 was expended, leaving a balance of £3,068. The total amount was apportioned to the six States, and as So the individual payments under this vote are of large amounts, further expenditure could not be made without exceeding the provision. As a matter of fact, the Department incurred further liabilities on this account to the amount of £147,470, which, for want of funds, could not be liquidated. That amount, £147,470, unpaid accounts, was carried forward to be met from the provision made for the cur- for. rent financial year. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) complains of the Department having been starved since Federation started, and I endorse that opinion. And it has never been so starved as during the first six years. There were small demands for Federal expenditure, and any surplus we had had to be handed over to the States for them to spend as they liked. That was the time when the Postal Department's undertakings should have been put in thorough working order. During that time, Sir .George Turner, who in this State has always been lauded by economists as being the most careful Treasurer, was responsible for what occurred. He was applauded for his economy, but he left a heavy burden on subsequent Ministers. The Department, from that time to this, has suffered from that false economy, and it takes a long time to make up arrears. I now wish to summarize the position with regard to the Department's work. Telegraph and telephone works outstanding in the metropolitan districts number 9,586, and we have only provision and material to supply 4,470; while in the country the outstanding works are 1,992, and all we can supply is 1,554. There are 234 financial trunk lines outstanding, said we have money to supply only 42; the financial telegraph lines outstanding number 35, and we have material and money for 7; while approved country telephone lines outstanding number 114, we have money and material for 52. The 6,125 works will be carried out as the material on order is received. The Department asked that an amount of £73,917 should be provided this year for the purchase of 107 sites, and we were granted the sum of £25,000, or sufficient to cover the purchase of 58 sites. For the repair and maintenance of post office buildings, the Department asked for £108,575, and was granted £48,900. I have here a statement showing the number of these buildings and alterations to existing buildings classified as "" very urgent,"" ""urgent,"" and ""necessary."" Of the first class there are 181, but the vote will only provide for 105; of the second class there are 15, but the vote Mr Wise. will not provide for any, and of the third class 11, only one of which is provided I give these facts and figures to show how unsatisfactory the position is. The Treasurer, as I have said, has to find the money for the whole of the public services, and he says that, having regard to the rest of them, he cannot find any more for the Post Office than I have mentioned.",41
109,Dr EARLE PAGE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,The Treasurer has been taking your money now and again!,42
110,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"I have no control over - that; all the money we spend the Treasurer gives us, and all the money we make goes into the Consolidated Revenue. The only way, as the Treasurer says, is to make some provision for permanent works out of loan; and we should require about £7,856,000, extended over three or four years, to pull up arrears. Honourable members find on the Estimates for this year a number of small votes which they say are insufficient for the buildings that are necessary. What honourable members say is quite true, but the small votes, totalling £26,028, are simply on account of buildings which we propose to start this year but which, when completed, will represent an ultimate expenditure of £149,750. We at the Post Office have done the best we can, and it is disheartening to the officers as it is to me when we find ourselves unable to proceed with works and buildings which we know to be necessary. It is not only the public that suffers, but the officers themselves have to work in cramped quarters. Until money is provided, however, they must put up with the conditions. I thought it well that honourable members should know exactly the position in regard to the expenditure last year and the outlook for this, so that they may realise that the Department has been suffering exactly in the same way as the British Post Office has suffered from lack of funds, and that the Treasurer here is acting in exactly the same way as Treasurers elsewhere.",42
111,Mr MATHEWS,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"There never was a shortage of funds, only blind folly on the part of the howling crowd i",42
112,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"I shall saynothing on that point, because I get sufficient criti cism when I talk elsewhere of economy. I am a country representative, and I have no sympathy with the cry for economy; indeed, I warn - the people in the country not to be caught by the economy "" stunt,"" because economy is always practised at the expense of the country districts. have to be cub down, that is done in the country; newspapers which condemn nonpaying lines in country districts have no hesitation ,in taking credit to themselves for influencing the expenditure of £6,0.00,000 on electrifying suburban railways. The same thing happens in reference to postal matters; the cities will not allow economy to be practised at their expense.  that goes on; you are defaming the country districts, according to the honourable member far Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond).",42

116,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Whether ft bo city or country, the Government has to be fair, and the figures I have quoted show that the money spent last year was about fairly divided.",43

118,Mr WISE,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Of course. In years gone by the revenue of the country generally was called upon to pay for what was done in the cities; but now that the post-offices of the cities are making big profits, the money should be spent on works in the country where they cannot be expected to pay right away. I have made this statement today in order that the"" actual position should be understood by honourable members, and to assure them that there has been nothing wanting on my part. I represent a rough country district, where such services are of vital importance. I also know the requirements of the city, and what the lack of services are to busiI f train services ness people. It is heart-breaking to have, to aay to them day after day that there is no money available for work admitted to be necessary. I would like, in conclusion, to thank honourable members far the consideration they have at all times extended to me, even when I have had to refuse reasonable requests.",43
119,Mr WATKINS,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Newcastle) [3.44] I do not blame the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) for any shortcomings of the Post Office any more than I have blamed any of his predecessors. My experience of parliamentary l if e is that the postal is not portfolio has ever been regarded as a junior one, and that the Department has always been regarded as of less importance than any other. As the Postmaster General has said, from the very inception of Federation, the Postal Department has been treated as a milch cow to provide money for expenditure by other Deportments, yet whenever economy was required, it is expected to be effected at the expense of the Postal Department. So far from this Department being the smallest, .it is ihe largest and most important in its dealings with the public. During the war period so-called economy was carried to the extreme by discontinuing the purchase of supplies when they were obtainable at reasonable rates, and now they are either not obtainable at all, or can be purchased only at on increase of 400 per oent. on the old prices. While money was being saved in that way, the profits made by the Department were being devoted to other purposes, and the present chaotic conditionof the Foetal Service is the result. It is time that the Department was placed upon a different basis. The moneys it earns should be allocated to postal purposes only, and them the public would get the service and accommodation that they require. A few figures which I shall quote regarding my own electorate will illustrate what has been occurring throughout Australia. In the year 1918 the number of articles posted at Newcastle was 6,000,000, and the revenue was £43,000; during the ten months of 1921 the number of articles posted was 14,000,000, and the revenue over £87,000, an increase of approximately 100 per oent. in the three years. Yet less moneyis being spent in the supervision of that office today than in 1918. Notwithstanding the millions of pounds of private capital that is being spent at Newcastle in various ways, there is not room on the switchboard for an additional telephone.",43
120,Mr BOWDEN,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"The same conditions obtain in Sydney. Mr ""WATKINS - They are general, but they are probably accentuated in Newcastle because of the remarkable development of that district. It is useless for honourable members to put forward the claims of their electorates for improved services until the system of allocating postal revenues is altered in the way I and others have suggested. During the latter period of the war the Government were claiming a good deal' of credit for the fact that they were saving so much every year from the profits of the Postal Department. At whose expense was the Baving being effected, and with what result? Material that could have been purchased cheaply at that time cannot be obtained today at less than three or four times its former cost.",44
121,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"That has cost the country £1,000,000.",44
122,Mr WATKINS,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Probably much more. Whatever the preachers . of economy may say to the contrary, it is time that the Postal Department enjoyed the use of its own revenues. If that were done, we should know exactly how the Department was operating, and the publio Would get. full benefit for the money they pay into it . Progress reported. SUPPLY BILL (No . 4) 1921-22. Assent reported. ADJOURNMENT. HE-DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed. That the. House do now adjourn.",44
123,Mr RILEY,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,"Can . the Minister for Home and Territories state what progress has been made in regard to the re-distribution of seats? .  Home and Territories) [3.54] - The work is being expedited as much as possible. The six Commissions are at work, but I do not think the report will be finalized before the beginning of next year. Honourable members are aware that the maps showing the proposed alterations of boundaries have to be posted for a month, in order to permit any objections to be lodged.",44
124,Mr RILEY,FORMAL ADJOURNMENT,They will be posted before the end of the year?  Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at S.55 p.m. policy,44
