2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. A humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Attention is drawn to Australia's increasing role in the militarisation of the Pacific region and in particular to the current Government-led arms export drive. The arms trade is not only detrimental to Australians affected by the diversion of public money away from socially beneficial areas-for example, health, education and social welfare-but is an integral factor in the oppression and poverty of the people of the Third World. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will: Cease all military aid and training to governments engaged in repression of their own people. Direct all Federal and State Government Departments and instrumentalities to withdraw from participation in and support for AIDEX and similar arms fairs in Australia and overseas. Close down AIDEX 1991. Establish a register of all applications for arms transfers and offset agreements which would be subject to public scrutiny. Redirect all monies currently being used to promote the arms industry to socially useful research, development and production. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Brereton (from 839 citizens), Mr Duncan (from 165 citizens), Ms Fatin (from 225 citizens), Mr Jenkins (from 94 citizens), Mr Langmore (from two citizens), Mr Lindsay (from 22 citizens), Ms MCHugh (from 254 citizens), Mr Mack (from 1,127 citizens), Mr Newell (from 313 citizens) and Mr West (from 200 citizens). AIDEX Exhibition To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: PETITIONS That attention is drawn to Australia's location and involvement fu the AsiaJPacific region where there exists a number of actual and potential conflicts, along with several countries which can ill afford to pay for the importation of military equipment yet feel obliged to'do so. NA That Australia is increasing its role in the arms trade in this region, and in particular, it is supporting and participating in AIDEX 1991. The arms trade is detrimental to Australians affected by the diversion of public money away from health, education, social welfare, and is an integral factor in the oppression and poverty of people of the Asia/Pacific region. The petitioners therefore appeal to the Australian Parliament to: Stop all military aid and training to governments engaged in repression of their own people. Direct those Government Departments participating in AIDEX 1991, i.e. Defence, Austrade, Industry, Technology and Commerce, to cancel their bookings for space at the exhibition and withdraw their support for AIDEX 1991. Redirect all monies currently being used in promoting the arms industry to socially useful research, development and production. Explore the possibilities of setting up an Agency for the development of techniques for conflict resolution. Increase overseas aid to counteract the reduction since 1983/4. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Robert Brown (from 21 citizens) and Mrs Kelly (from 20 citizens). Abortions: Government Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows that: Every abortion kills an unborn human baby. More unborn Australians are killed every year (80,000) than the Australian death toll for the whole of World War II (30,000). Australia's population is ageing. OUf live birth rate is below replacement level. About 98 percent of abortions in Australia are performed for non-medical reasons (see SA Health Commission statistics). Post abortion depression is a silent epidemic and is linked with the growing incidence of child abuse by mothers who have previously had abortions. The Australian Government should not fund the killing of future Australian citizens. Mothers with problem pregnancies need positive help to carry their babies to full term. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: pass the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990, and help pregnant women with problems to continue their pregnanc-es. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr O'Neil (from 20 citizens), Mr John Scott (from 67 citizens) and Mr Webster (from 15 citizens). United Nations Convention on the Rights The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: (1) (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best (b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements. (2) creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble). (3) will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children. Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in the Parliament assembled, should: (1) By Act, ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) are debated by the Parliament. (2) Take action to have the Convention amended in order to pay the highest regard to the importance of the family unit, and to the rights and responsibilities of parents. by Mr Cadman (from 445 citizens) and Mr Ferguson (from 34 citizens). SBS Second Frequency To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of N.S.W. and Vic. draws to the attention of the House that the rescheduling of programs on radio S.B.S. is a divisive measure damaging to a multicultural nation. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House approve a second frequency for radio S.B.S. in order to adequately meet the needs of newly arrived communities without penalising the ageing and minority migrant groups. La petizione di certi residenti del N.S.W. e Vic. desidera indurre I' attenzione della camera dei deputati suI fatto che la ristrutturazione dei programmi della radio S.B.S. e' un'azione divisoria che danneggia una nazione multiculturale. I richiedenti percio' desideranno che la camera approvi una seconda frequenza per la radio S.B.S. per poter adeguatamente rispondere aile necessita' delle nuove comunita' senza penalizzare quelle piu' piccole, 0 quelle che stanno invecchiando. by Mr Dubois (from 97 citizens) and Mr Mack (from 50 citizens). Medicare: Abortions of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: . That every abortion kills an unborn human interests of their children, baby; That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights; That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life; That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect; That in 1989/90 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 69,587 abortions totalling $7.8 million; That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. And your Petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ford (from 46 citizens) and Mr Hawker (from 17 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights. That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life. That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect. That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million. That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from 12 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the current campaign which is being waged by the Communist Government of Serbia and its agents against the aspiration for independence of the Republic of Croatia. We particularly draw to your attention the fact that Croatia has satisfied the conditions of international law for independence, and that it has made every effort to enter into meaningful dialogue with its opponents in Serbia. These have been to no avail. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House as a matter of urgency offers immediate recognition to Croatia as a sovereign nation. by Mr Kerin (from 167 citizens) and Dr Bob Woods (from 152 citizens). ABC Country Hour To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: The ABC Country Hour radio program (in particular the state component) is an important and widely used resource for the rural people o- Sou!h Australia. The proposed cut to the State sectlOn will be a severe loss to the rural communities of South Australia. Your petitioners request that your Honourable House ensure that the ABC is provided with adequate funding to enable this program to continue. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Andrew (from 311 citizens). Medicare: $3.50 Co-payment To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned residents of the state of NSW, draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are unhappy with the additional $3.50 (soon to become $5.00) patient payment for medical services. We support Medicare and the principle of universal access to health care. We believe the extra fee may prevent many people from seeking primary medical care, especially people with young children and those struggling financially. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to reverse the decision which decreases the Medicare rebate and introduces patient co-payment. Croatia by Mr Baldwin (from 1,380 citizens). Electoral Advertising To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we call upon Honourable Members to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise electoral material on radio and television, believing such bans amount to a denial of free speech, an unfair advantage to an incumbent government, and a denial of information to printhandicapped and other Australians. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Beale (from three citizens). Arms Trade: AIDEX Exhibition To the Honourable Speaker and members in the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesman-like leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, etc. as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment. And we, your humble petitioners will as in duty bound, ever pray. by Mr Broadbent (from 10 citizens). To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the increase in metropolitan house prices, which, together with the escalation in interest rates, is causing great hardship for many Australians attempting to provide housing for their families. The petition also draws to the attention of the House the widely expressed need for a higher level of saving in Australia and the fact that the savings of ordinary Australians are currently penalised by taxation. Your Petitioners therefore request the House to enact legislation to provide for: (a) The establishment of a savings fund open to all Australians but directed to young people for the deposit of a fixed percentage of their income from the time of their entry into the workforce until the age of 25 or earlier marriage; (b) The exemption from income tax of interest earned on money invested in such a fund; and (c) The provision by the fund of low interest housing loans to contributors to the fund. by Mr Cadman (from 325 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their absolute faith in the benefits of the herb, comfrey. We use this herb for many medicinal reasons from removing sun spots to curing asthma to treating broken bones. We object most vehemently to your intention to make comfrey an Appendix C substance so that we will be unable to use it as an ointment or for topical application at all. We depend on comfreyit is an integral part of our everyday life. It saves this country a great deal of money in health costs each year because it does successfully treat these problems and others not mentioned here. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House does not list comfrey as an Appendix C substance. by Mr Courtice (from 360 citizens). NOW Centre To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the BrunswiCk/Coburg and North Westem Suburbs area draws to the attention of the House the undersigned Housing are extremely alarmed about the Federal Government's decision to cease funding of the NOW Centre. For the past 16 years the NOW Centre has provided highly accessible support services, including financial and housing support to thousands of people from the Brunswick/Coburg and North Western Suburbs area. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to assure ongoing funding for the NOW CENTRE. by Mr Hawke (from 229 citizens). Arms Trade To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the central role played by the arms trade in creating an environment in which wars such as the Gulf War can occur. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: (i) call on the Federal Government to outlaw sales of armaments and arms-related technology to overseas organisations, government and private. (ii) call on the Federal Government to lobby internationally, including at the United Nations, for the banning of sales of armaments and arms-related technology. (iii) cancel the AIDEX 91 arms bazaar. Comfrey by Mr Lindsay (from 506 citizens). SBS Television: Northern Rivers Region To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the Northern Rivers region of NSW, being therefore, electors of the Divisions of Richmond and Page, draws to the attention of the House that the Region meets the necessary criteria of population size and ethnic mix for provision of the SBS Television Broadcasting Service, and that because of the current ""Commercial Telbvision Equalisation Program"" a unique, cost effective opportunity exists for this service to be provided. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request the House to detennine that the SBS Television Service be extended to this region, in conjunction with the aforementioned ""Equalisation Program"", within the next twelve months. by Mr Newell (from 57 citizens). SBS: Lower Eyre Peninsula To the Honourable the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned residents and visitors of Lower Eyre Peninsula showeth that: (1) There is a restricted access to Adelaide based television services and on some occasions there is no reception at all. (2) This restricted access means that there is limited viewing choice of programs of a cultural, ethnic, sporting or other nature. (3) The residents of Eyre Peninsula feel deprived by not having access to the same range of services that metropolitan residents have. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: Support the extension of television services to enable all metropolitan based television stations to be transmitted to Eyre Peninsula. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr O'Neil (from 1,792 citizens), Budget Changes: Child-Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Ballarat points out to the House that Budget changes to child care heavily discriminate against single income families and non-working parents. Your petitioners therefore request the House to immediately call a halt to its hasty and ill-considered Budget proposals and ensure that child care is equitable, affordable and available to all Australian families without the unnecessary distinction between work related and non-work related child care. by Mr Ronaldson (from 22 citizens). Mr and Mrs Aka Vana To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament House Canberra. As electors of the Division of Indi, we hereby draw to the attention of the House the extraordinary plight of Mr Mrs Aka Vana and family. Mr Vana, a soldier in the Australian Army has had his application for citizenship rejected and will be deported on 30th: November 1991. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House may urgently undertake to review this case and grant a reasonable hearing to Mr Vana, currently serving in the Australian Army. by Mr Ruddock (from 32 citizens). Child Support Agency To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain Citizens of the state of South Australia, draws to the attention of the house: The Child Support Agency. The areas of concern are: (a) The unfair method of assessment by the CSA towards the non custodial parents. (b) Non custodial parent being taxed as a single person, who is supporting his/her children and being unable to claim tax relief on maintenance/debt to the Commonwealth paid. (c) No consideration to Financial commitments entered into by the non custodial parent, prior to separation. (d) Lack of any consideration towards any future relationships that the non custodial parent may be lucky to enter into. (e) That the custodial parents income is not taken into account when assessments are made. The custodial parent can remarry and have the new husbands income and the possibility of going out to work themselves. The belief is that it took two people to bring the children into this world, not just the non custodial parent. (f) The need for the non custodial parent to having to have the children 42 % of the time, before they can claim any relief in maintenance (and have to prove this). (g) In most cases the non custodial parent was never given the chance to have custody of their children. When he/she realises that they could have them, the cost to them is way over the top $10,000 plus the custodial parent didn't pay a cent. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House would and should conduct an inquiry into this huge injustice towards the non custodial parent, as the future ramifications of this injustice will be catastrophic to say the least. by Mr John Scott (from 158 citizens). Medicare: $3.50 Co-payment To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: This petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully points out(1) During the last election the Government campaigned to defend Medicare. (2) The opposition parties had no such policy. Your petitioners therefore require the House to reverse the 1991 Budget decision to impose the $3.50 Medicare co-payment. by Mr John Scott (from 128 citizens). Australia: Christian Commonwealth To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we, the undersigned, call for the full and total recognition, by Federal Parliament and the High Court and all government agencies that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth according to law and its heritage traditions and customs. That as Australia prepares for the Centenary of Federation on 1st January, 2001 AD we celebrate our Centenary as a Christian Commonwealth as described by the Founders of Federation such as Sir John Downer, who said ""The Commonwealth will be from its first stage a Christian Commonwealth and as stated in our Federal Constitution-""Relying on the Blessings of Almighty God ... That our Federal Parliament therefore implement the following policies before 1st January, 2001 AD. (1) The Adoption of a Christian National Anthem-""God Bless Australia"" to the tune of ""Waltzing Matilda"". (2) The adoption of a Christian National Motto-""One Nation Under God"", for use on our coins, banknotes, etc. (3) The appointment of practising Christians as Vice Regal Representatives of our Christian Queen, Elizabeth n. (4) The retention of our Christian Prayers at the daily opening of Parliament in the standing respectful presence of all Members of Parliament. (5) The retention of ""God Save the Queen"" for Vice Regal Functions as our Royal Anthem and as our National Hymn for all other civic functions. (6) The retention of Christian Christmas Carols in our State Schools and other civic functions during the Christmas Season. (7) Officially inform the United Nations and all the other nations of the world that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will reafflrm our Christian Heritage as a Christian Commonwealth. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from nine citizens). Sri Lanka To the Honourable the Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: We the undersigned citizens and residents of Australia draw the kind attention of the House to the increasing violence' in Sri Lanka's Tamil Homelands. The Sri Lankan Government has embarked on large scale genocidal attacks by aerial, land and naval forces on the Tamil people living in northern and eastern parts of the country. These attacks have completely alienated the Tamils who are now convinced that only a political solution based on the principle of self-determination for the Tamil people could result in permanent peace. Given the changes sweeping across the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe, we believe this to be an appropriate time for the International Community to intervene and end the conflict in Sri Lanka. We, therefore, humbly pray that the House will: call on the Sri Lankan Government to end its inclination to seek a military solution and offer immediate peace to the affected areas by reciprocating the LTTE's offers for ceasefire and negotiations without any pre conditions; Urge the Government of Sri Lanka to immediately end its policy of colonisation of Tamil areas and take concerted action to resettle the displaced Tamils in their homeland; also to release forthwith all Tamil detainees who have been held without any trial or convictions; Consider imposition or suspension of all economic aid to Sri Lanka until a peaceful resolution to the conflict is reached; Take up an International approach of mediation and possible peace keeping force to restore peace and order. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Bob Woods (from 174 citizens). Petitions received. NA Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority",12
3,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the Committee, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Who is to Guard the Guards?, together with evidence received by the Committee,. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
4,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have great pleasure in presenting this report. The report describes the broad evaluation of the National Crime Authority which the Committee has carried out pursuant to its duty under the National Crime Authority Act to monitor and review the performance of the Authority in its functions. The Committee commenced the evaluation in July 1990 at a time when the Authority was the subject of much media comment and public criticism, not least in relation to its Adelaide office. The Committee sought submissions from a wide range of individuals and organisations. Fifty-six submissions were received and the Committee held 12 public hearings. Hearings were held in all States except Western Australia. Sixty-four witnesses appeared and 1,730 pages of evidence were taken. For the first time since the Authority was set up in 1984, the National Crime Authority gave evidence in public to the Committee. The decision to take public evidence has paid outstanding dividends. It has enabled critics and commentators to put their concerns on the public record. It has also given the National Crime Authority a public forum in which to respond. The basic finding of the evaluation is that the National Crime Authority should continue to exist. It was put to the Committee at the outset of the evaluation that National Crime Authority secretiveness and limits in the National Crime Authority Act on the Committee's powers would affect the Committee's ability to carry out a thorough evaluation. The open and frank approach taken during the inquiry by the National Crime Authority'S Chairman, Justice John Phillips, ensured that this did not happen. However, the report recommends amendment of the National Crime Authority Act to clarify the Committee's right to receive information from the National Crime Authority. The report outlines the history of differences between the National Crime Authority and the Committee in previous parliaments. Conflicting legal opinions have been obtained on the extent of the Committee's right to information from the Authority. The Committee considers the issue too important to have to rely on the cooperative attitude of individual National Crime Authority chairmen. Accordingly, the report recommends technical amendments to section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act to clarify what aspects of the Authority'S activities the Committee may examine. In addition, it recommends an amendment to the main secrecy provision in the Act, section 51. The amendment will make it clear that the secrecy provision does not prevent the National Crime Authority providing information to the Committee. In addition, the Committee believes that the National Crime Authority Act should be amended to restrict disclosure by the Committee of sensitive information received from the National Crime Authority. Senator Spindler, a member of the Committee, currently has a private senator's Bill before the Senate to amend the National Crime Authority Act. The Bill, among other things, defines information which is 'sensitive', and prevents the Committee from disclosing this sensitive information in Parliament or to the public. The report recommends adoption of the Spindler Bill definition of what information is sensitive. The report recommends that the Minister responsible for the National Crime Authority, currently the Attorney-General, should arbitrate if a dispute arises between the Committee and the National Crime Authority over whether a piece of information fits within the definition of ·sensitive'. Senator Spindler dissents on this point, preferring a judge to act as arbiter. The Committee considers that it should continue to be the primary means of external scrutiny to ensure that the National Crime Authority does not abuse its special powers. The National Crime Authority Act provides for an Inter-Governmental Committee made up of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers. This Inter-Governmental Committee has the function under the Act of monitoring generally the work of the Authority. The report demonstrates that the Inter-Governmental Committee has neglected this function. For example, it has met only 16 times since 1984. It has failed to comment on the last three National Crime Authority annual reports, although the National Crime Authority Act specifically provides for it to do so. It does not appear to have provided any strategic direction for the Authority or to have taken action to dispel the criticisms which have surrounded the Authority in the past. The report recognises that there needs to be an improvement in the means of resolving complaints from individuals who have been dealt with by the National Crime Authority in an unacceptable manner. I should add, however, that the Committee has received few complaints regarding the Authority. A very small number of complaints have required detailed examination. The report recommends that, to supplement the role of the Committee, the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the Authority, its staff and those seconded to work for it. The Committee is not aware of any specific complaints that the National Crime Authority has infringed individual privacy in unacceptable ways. Nevertheless, it recognises the validity of the general concerns put to it about the potential for the National Crime Authority to intrude on privacy. The report recommends that privacy guidelines be developed to cover the National Crime Authority'S activities in much the same way as guidelines are now being developed to cover the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The aura of secretiveness that has surrounded the National Crime Authority'S activities has reduced the public perception of the value of the Authority'S work. The National Crime Authority Act requires all National Crime Authority investigative hearings to be held in private. Justice Phillips told the Committee that it would assist the Authority to dispel the aura of secretiveness if it could hold some of its investigative hearings in public. The Committee agrees. The report recommends that the Act be amended to give Authority members a discretion to hold hearings in public. The Committee recognises that there is a risk to innocent reputations if hearings are public. The report recommends that guidelines be developed to ensure fairness to all involved in the hearings and the Conunittee expects the guidelines to draw on the experience of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. The report deals with Justice Phillips's future directions policy. This policy, announced in November 1990, is designed to focus the National Crime Authority'S activities in ways appropriate for the 1990s and to overcome some of the criticisms levelled at the Authority in the 1980s. The report generally welcomes Justice Phillips's initiatives. It recommends action to ensure that police forces are adequately resourced to take over investigation of drug related matters that the National Crime Authority is no longer treating as its prime focus. The report notes the potential for unnecessary overlap between the National Crime Authority's intelligence activities and those of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Australian Federal Police. Further, the report recommends continuing review of the intelligence activities of the three bodies to ensure that unnecessary overlap does not occur. The report deals with a number of suggestions for finetuning the current powers and functions of the National Crime Authority, including a proposal to give it a power to bring prosecutions. The report also considers the role of police officers in the Authority, and the need for extension or addition to its existing special statutory powers to obtain evidence. I should mention that the report deals with some aspects of the operation of the National Crime Authority's Adelaide office in 1989. The National Crime Authority has been through a difficult period since mid-1989. It was subject to consistent criticism in late 1989 and early 1990 because of its perceived excessive secrecy and administrative failings. I stress that the National Crime Authority is the most important agency in the national effort to combat organised crime. It is a tribute to the particular skills and abilities of Justice Phillips that the Authority is such a dramatically different body to the Authority of a year ago. I and the Committee believe that Justice Phillips deserves great credit for the work he has done since becoming the Chainnan of the Authority. The Committee recognises the extent of his achievement and congratulates him on his appointment to the position of Chief Justice of Victoria. On behalf of the Committee I thank those who made submissions, who appeared at hearings and otherwise assisted the Committee with its evaluation. In particular, I would like to thank the secretariat of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority.",18
5,Mr FILING,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I would like to concur with the comments of the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), in relation to the work undertaken by the secretarial staff and the number of submissions that were made during our evaluation inquiry. I would also like to pass on congratulations to Justice Phillips on his appointment as Chief Justice of Victoria. This will be a sad loss to the National Crime Authority. In the time. I have available I will deal with two issues. The first issue is the question of the Authority'S relationship with other law enforcement agencies. Originally, the Authority was created to a perceived gap in the ability of traditional law enforcement methods to deal with organised crime. It was not, however, meant to replace or duplicate the work of Australian police services. The Authority was never intended to become a ninth police force. Under the NCA Act the Authority was intended to be a national body that would work in close cooperation with other law enforcement bodies. The Committee's report concluded that there was a continuing need and role for the National Crime Authority in Australian law enforcement. The Committee's evaluation, however, considered criticism that the Authority had in the past failed to effectively liaise and cooperate with police services. Particular criticism was directed to the Authority's unwillingness to share intelligence and cooperate with police in the conduct of investigations resulting in overlap and duplication. I am happy to report that since November 1990 when Justice Phillips's Future Directions policy was launched it has focused the work of the Authority and taken important steps to improve the Authority'S relationship with other law enforcement agencies, particularly police services. The Committee. notes that changes were, in part, responses to criticisms levelled at the Authority in the past. I must say that the Committee was encouraged to note that Future Directions has received widespread support from Australian law enforcement agencies. Successful implementation of Future Directions in the coming years should lead to greatly enhanced cooperation between the Authority and Australian law enforcement agencies and this can only lead to more effective action against organised crime. Notwithstanding its support for the Authority'S shift in focus the report makes the following recommendations: 1. that the re-allocation of resources required by police forces to compensate for the Authority'S changed emphasis be given urgent attention. The report also considers that greater police involvement in the Authority is needed. The report recommends that consideration be given to appointing a senior police officer, fill either serving or retired, as a member of the Authority. I turn now to the question of the minority report to the evaluation report, Who is to Guard the Guards? That report is in the name of Senator Crichton-Browne and Senate Vanstone, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and me. The minority report turns on the question of the Operation Ark report and asks the question: which report is the report? It indicates that the issue should be resolved to satisfactorily ascertain which report was in fact the correct version of the Operation Ark report. ill the qualifying statement to the Committee's 1990 Operation Ark report the majority report did not address issues to satisfactorily resolve the question of which report was the correct Operation Ark report. A great deal of interest was generated by the tabling of the report and issues surrounding the use of in camera evidence. However, the report has done little to resolve the issue of which report is, in fact, the real Ark report, the matter on which this turns. These issues should be resolved in order for the Committee to fulfil its statutory duties. Some Government members, not the least the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), have criticised incorrectly the authors of the qualifying statement for publishing in camera evidence. The Government's response to the Committee's Operation Ark report, the minority report, endorses this view. The issues on which this matter turns are the questions of the two reports and the suppression of one of these reports by the incoming National Crime Authority following Mr Justice Stewart's retirement in 1989. The important questions are these: was there a completed report on 30 June 1989 and can an Authority report be duly authorised without a minuted meeting of the persons purporting to be the Authority? The Committee should have sought evidence from the former members of the Authority and the former Chairman, Mr Faris. Thus far this evidence has been denied to the Committee. The unresolved issues should have been the subject of inquiry during the current evaluation and the Committee should have followed up the qualifying statement. The only exception to this was the hearing which the Committee held with Justice Stewart. The Committee's failure to take sufficient evidence to try to resolve the question of which report was the real Ark report is a clear failure of supervisory duty in relation to the Authority. ill the final analysis, the majority's failure in Who is to Guard the Guards? to properly resolve this question of the Ark report is a significant failure to fulfil its statutory role to oversee the Authority, as was originally envisaged in the debates at the time of the Authority's creation.",20
6,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I join my colleagues in briefly commenting on the evaluation of the National Crime Authority. ill the few seconds available to me I will comment on three issues. I join with my colleagues in complimenting Mr Justice Phillips for the undoubted contribution he has made in lifting the status and the quality of the NCA. We made recommendations at the close of the previous coalition Government for the establishment of such an authority. The recommendations arose out of the Costigan report and the difficulties of maintaining a continued royal commission. I confess that I was disappointed when the Hawke Government was first elected that it decided not to proceed. Later that year, of course, the NCA was constituted. From my understanding of the affairs-I was not on the Committee at that stage-the Authority had a somewhat chequered history under its earlier Chairman. I think that it was not until Mr Justice Phillips came along that it was apparent that the NCA had the confidence of not only the police authorities around Australia, but also the members of the Inter-Governmental Committee. I believe that Mr Justice Phillips deserves a great deal of credit for that. The fact that there was this contrast highlights very much the difficulty there is now in securing a suitable successor to him. I compliment Mr Justice Phillips on his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria and wish the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the IGC well in the search for his successor. Above all, it is important that his successor take on board the contrasting administrative styles of Mr Justice Phillips and his predecessors; that he take on board the recommendation that there is an opportunity, as the Chairman of the Committee has said, for some inquiries to be conducted in public; and that he recognise that the role of the NCA is not to replace the present investigatory powers available to individual State police authorities. The Authority is not to operate in such a way that it can be seen as an independent body in its own right, but rather as a cooperative body, working with seconded police staff from each of the States. It must work with the IGC across State borders and in areas where individual police authorities find themselves unable to proceed adequately in investigations. Inevitably, therefore, the character and nature of the Chainnan and the stamp he places on the Authority are important. The second brief reference I want to make is to recommendation 3 with respect to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the role that he might play. There is a difficulty in the role of this Parliamentary Committee. I gather that it really resulted from an amendment moved by former Senator Don Chipp on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It suggested that the nature of an all embracing crime investigatory body was such that there should be some opportunity for parliament to oversee its operations. In much the same way as ASIO's operations are examined, it was felt that there needed to be a parliamentary committee examining the operations of the NCA, and this Committee has been constituted. Yet there are areas where, because current operative matters are denied to the Committee; there are inevitably problems in determining whether or not the NCA is operating as it should. It was for that reason that the Committee in its deliberations decided that it might be appropriate for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, an officer now in place-one who I would imagine is not overburdened by his task in that respect-to be given an additional jurisdiction, that is, to investigate complaints involving these operative procedures, matters which are denied to the Committee. I trust that the role will be seen as one which can pennit reference from the Committee and reporting back to the Committee in areas beyond its capability. I believe that it is a valuable addition to the supervisory function of this Parliament and I commend that recommendation in particular, as I do the others. I would like to compliment the Chairman of the Committee. In particular, I would like to compliment the staff for the work they have undertaken. I assure the Parliament and the people of Australia that the National Crime Authority, under Mr Justice Phillips at least, has certainly been undertaking its task with due diligence and has been exercising a proper overall coordinating role in a way that I think enhances the investigation of crime in our society.",21

10,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I have much pleasure in presenting the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Australian Defence Force Reserves. On 17 March 1989 the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) referred for inquiry the issue of the structure and capabilities of the Australian Defence Force reserves. The inquiry attracted a great deal of interest from Australian Defence Force personnel, defence academics and the general public. By the dissolution of the Thirty-fifth Parliament in February 1990, more than 120 submissions had been received and four public hearings held. The tenns of reference were referred to the Committee on 13 June 1990 following its reappointment in the Thirty-sixth Parliament. The Auditor-General's report on the Anny Reserve was added later through referral by the House of Representatives. During this present Parliament the Committee received a further 130 submissions, totalling 2,500 pages, and conducted nine public hearings, amassing over 1,500 pages of oral evidence. We also travelled extensively to service establishments around Australia to inspect facilities and discuss issues of concern with both reserve and regular members of the Australian Defence Force. Several major events affected this inquiryfor example, the pilot's strike during the second half of 1989 and the Federal election early in 1990. A further factor was the force structure review undertaken in 1990 and early 1991. The Committee decided to delay finalisation of its proceedings to take account of the review's outcome. Following the tabling of the force structure review by the Minister for Defence on 30 May 1991, the Committee sought further submissions and held a final public hearing in Canberra on 26 July 1991 to allow for comment on the impact of the force structure review on the Australian Defence Force reserves. This has been a protracted and complex inquiry. Indeed, this inquiry has been a mammoth task, involving hundreds of hours of work by members of the Committee and the secretariat. At this point, I acknowledge formally the efforts of my fellow Committee members and Committee staff. I tum to the Committee's assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of Australian Defence Force Reserve forces. Naval reserves contribute only indirectly to readiness. However, the Committee found that naval reserves were performing their current roles effectively and that the estimated annual cost of some $17m was being applied efficiently. Notwithstanding the more than 20 years and $100m spent in its development, an operational Australian Defence Force mine countermeasures capability is still at least many years That is bad enough. The force structure review, however, reversed a long standing policy of employing auxiliary minesweepers manned largely by reserves to complement the minehunting capability. Army reserves make a major and direct contribution to Australian Defence Force readiness. The operational roles concerned relate mainly to surveillance, protection and logistics. The Committee found that Army reserves provide marginally effective surveillance, ineffective vital asset protection, and an ineffective level of logistic support. The broad costs of the Army reserves include equipment worth some $268m with planned near-term acquisitions of about $IOOm; facilities worth at least $130m; and recurrent funding of half a billion dollars a year. The Committee has no doubt that the military capability being generated currently by the Army Reserve is grossly inefficient. ' Ready reserves will be introduced at the expense of one of Army's only three regular brigades-and essentially without any rigorous consideration of 26,000 general reservists. The force structure review has reduced these reservists to third XI status. Of a total of 35,000 personnel in Army's combat forces, some 6,000 regular and 11,500 general reserves are allocated to other than priority roles established by Defence policy. In force structure terms, this equates to seven infantry battalions, or about 30 per cent of all such units in the total Army. Of these, some 40 per cent require 90 days or longer to become operationally ready and some 13 per cent require about a year to do so. The lack of Army Reserve operational readiness is the weak link in the concept of' defence-in-depth. Australian Defence Force ground forces are manifestly unable to secure the bases required for deployed maritime forces. I stress that this is not a reflection on the energy or dedication of reservists themselves but a reflection of major deficiencies in Reserve policy development, equipment and training. Air Force reservists contribute only indirectly to the performance of many operational off. roles at an estimated annual cost of some $12m. This is cost effective. The Royal Australian Air Force's most serious operational weaknesses are its low aircraft-to-aircrew ratio and the relatively few technical and other personnel to support operations at forward deployment airfields. The Air Force plan to introduce reserves as airfield defence guards is sound and be enabled by the Ready Reserve program. No serious attempt has been made to extend Royal Australian Air Force operational effectiveness by widening the application of integrated Regular-Reserve force elements. We believe that Air Force should introduce an integrated structure in at least five or six operation squadrons employing a mixture of Reserve and permanent air and ground personnel. The Committee came to the firm conclusion that a corporate planning approach is the only way that Reserve force development will be achieved comprehensively and effectively, and recommends that the Department of Defence develop a corporate plan for the development of the Australian Defence Force Reserve forces. The plan should address, among other things, the introduction of an mine countermeasure operational minesweepifig capability into the naval Reserve at an equipment cost of about $2Om, to be offset against the planned replacement of five Reserve patrol boats by fleet support vessels; the restructure of Army's manoeuvre and follow-on forces, so that the available Regular and Reserve force structure can be applied to priority capability requirements; and the introduction into Air Force of integrated operational squadrons. The Committee recommends that additional resources be programmed as follows: an estimated $WOm for each of the seven general Reserve infantry brigades to equip them fully; in the order of $2m in the short term, rising to $50m a year after 10 years, for Army general Reserve operating costs; and an estimated total of $5Om over 10 years to acquire unit equipment for the three Reserve airfield defence guard squadrons. The Committee concluded that the Auditor General's report on the Army Reserve is a very valuable document both in its own right and for the impetus and guidance provided to the processes of calculating and attributing costs of Australian Defence Force activities. The past record of policy development and implementation for reserves has been anything but satisfactory. Transparency and regular will now review should be features of the long term implementation process. The Committee recommends, therefore, that the Department of Defence publish a reserves corporate plan by the end of 1992 and thereafter report annually to the Parliament on the exte1).t to which key milestones have been met. In conclusion, the way ahead for reserves must accommodate uncertain strategic circumstances, severe financial constraints and even increased attention to the structural concerns of productivity, effectiveness and efficiency. However, the Committee considers that the planning environment over the next 10 years or so does not represent the major problems facing Australian Defence Force Reserve forces. As this report so clearly shows, the central challenge is to redress the failure of the force development process to adjust the military capability of reserves in response to evolving Australian strategic thinking and the Government's defence policy. I repeat my thanks to the Defence Subcommittee members, the staff and everyone associated with the preparation of this important report. I acknowledge the outstanding contribution to the Defence Subcommittee of my distinguished predecessor, the former honourable member for Brisbane, Mr Manfred Cross, who was Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee during the thirty-fifth Parliament when this inquiry was initiated. (TIme expired)",22
11,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I would like to endorse the remarks of the Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and to acknowledge the dedication and effort that he and his deputy, Senator MACGIBBON, in leading that Subcommittee, have brought to the matters under consideration. The staff have laboured long and mightily, for a very long period, during the gestation and birth of this report. I would like to say a few words about the report. This investigation has been going on the for a considerable time. It started in 1989. A number of submissions, and investigation through public meetings and visits to establishments, really do make this an extremely well-considered document. It will be an extraordinarily useful document to those who have an interest in defence, and defence reserves in particular, because the scope of the report takes in the historical background and makes some very practical recommendations as to what should be done in the future. I was extraordinarily disappointed in the performance of the Government over the last few years in relation to the reserves because I believe that the present Reserve structure has been absolutely starved of futids over the last few years. It is a tribute to the dedication of those members of the Reserve that they have maintained the interest that they have displayed. When one talks to the commanders of Reserve organisations one finds that training days are way down, that equipment is in scarce supply and that the opportunities to effectively develop their capabilities are really being denied, and have been denied for a long period of time, by this present Government. I personally found it very disquieting that the Government made major announcements as to changes in the Reserve structure whilst the Committee was in the course of its investigations. I would have thought it prudent for any government to have waited whilst this major investigation was being undertaken to see what recommendations were made by the Committee. It is not as if the Committee is an inconsequential one. It is not as if the members of the Committee have had no experience in the area. It is not as' if the Committee has a history of making wild recommendations. It is rather the reverse. The work of this Committee is really one of the major achievements of the Parliament, and the reports of the Committee and of its subcommittees have been a feature in their depth of analysis and in the sound and practical recommendations they have made. This report is no exception. I found it very disappointing that the Government made major decisions affecting the reserves prior to the completion of this report by the Committee. If the Government had waited-and I do not believe there was the degree of urgency that it exhibited-it could have made more resources available to the already existing reserves and, secondly, I think it would have benefited from the consideration that the Committee gave in depth to this most important subject. I strongly endorse the views contained in the Committee's report. One of its features was that the weight of evidence was so compelling that people who had very differing views at the start of the process were forced by the weight of logic to come up with this agreed document and the recommendations that it contains. The Reserve forces are an extraordinarily important part of the Australian defence structure. I believe they have been poorly served by this Government. The Ready Reserve concept is hasty and has not been well thought through, and if one reads the report, and particularly the submissions to the Committee in relation to the Ready Reserve concept, one will find a concerted, sustained and well thought through criticism of the way in which the Ready Reserve concept has been brought into place. It will not, in my view, serve the best interests of an adequate and balanced approach to force structure, and I would recommend to all who are interested in the defence area, and particularly in the Reserve aspect of the Defence Force structure, that they take this report and read it very closely indeed.",24
12,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I wish to add my contribution to the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade titled The Australian Defence Force Reserve. I compliment, firstly, the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman and, secondly, the staff-in particular, Air Commodore Ian Westmore, who did an admirable job, in my view, in reviewing some of the earlier work and in the scripting of much of the report as it is finally drafted. There are three things I wish to say on the substance of the report. The first is that quite obviously there are enormous difficulties in maintaining adequately equipped personnel in the reserves and generally in the Australian Defence Force. In particular, I would like to draw the attention of the responsible Minister to recommendation 11, which talks about shortfalls in equipment within the ARes and makes suggestions upon them. The second matter relates very much to the same thing: the difficulties there are in trying to ensure that part time reservists are in fact able to adequately serve the number of days required to meet their role and readiness requirements; and that is covered in recommendation 10. More fundamentally, the problem is that the Government has set up a Ready Reserve which, on all the criteria that we have examined, really does not meet the task. The twelve months period of training followed by subsequent service does not really provide the balance necessary if we take into account the existing regular force on the one hand and the existing reserve force on the other hand. While there is no doubt that in the Air Force and in the Royal Australian Navy perhaps those ready reserves may have a role, in my view in the Army they are really not going to fit happily into the blend of other forces. The substantive recommendation that has come through from this report takes account of the strategic assessments that have been made and the consequence of Dibb's report and the White Paper that followed it. We have looked at where the defence needs of this nation should be placed. We have concluded that the Ready Reserve, as now structured, will use excessive resources, both financial and otherwise, of the regulars and the reserves. It is likely that it will need very significantly reviewed. In the last few weeks we have had the absolutely appalling disaster in Timor. Inevitably, in events of that kind one tends to look at the implications with respect to units of one's own forces and to wonder what would happen if there were to be some added strategic requirement in our region, whether it is in respect of existing circumstances or those not foreseen-and it was in that respect that I referred to Timor. We do not know what is going to happen and what pressures will be placed on us. As I see the Ready Reserve it will not be able to meet the strategic task in the way that I believe an upgrading of the existing part time reservists would have pennitted. I am very concerned that the Government has committed itself and so many of its human and material resources within the Australian Defence Force to establishing, at least as far as the Army is concerned, something that will dominate its thinking-all at the price of the elimination of a pennanent unit that was so badly needed. I fee1 very strongly about this; the report has addressed some of these problems and I trust that the Government might examine them. I think that the existing reserves have an important role. If I have a reservation about the report, it is that perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on vital asset protection. It is a difficult area. It is an important area. Yet, as we have concluded, vital asset protection is one way by which we can give the reserves a distinctive role without derogating in any way from the other responsibility which the reserves have traditionally exercised since the report under Tom Millar recommended that they be integrated within the total Australian Army. The report is an excellent one. It is a good analysis of a difficult situation. I trust that those within the Government will implement our recommendations because I think that if they were to be followed many of the problems that I foresee as a result of the creation of the Ready Reserve would be eliminated. I compliment the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, Air Commodore Ian Westmore, and the staff, who I think have been excellent to be in the services they have provided to the Committee. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER '(Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Motion (by Mr Lindsay) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",25

14,Mr LAVARCH,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the Committee's report, incorporating a dissenting repOli, entitled Corporate Practices and the Rights of Shareholders, together with the minutes of the proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",27
15,Mr LAVARCH,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"Few involved in corporate Australia during the 1980s can look back on that period with a sense of pride. While the vast majority of company officers are honest and concerned with the best interests of their shareholders, a high profile minority has given Australia's corporate reputation a collective black eye. It was against the background of the excesses of the late 1980s that the Committee commenced this inquiry late in the life of the last Parliament. Interrupted by the dissolution of Parliament and the 1990 election, the inquiry did not begin in earnest until June of last year. The Committee's approach has not been to seek scapegoats [or t-e failures in corporate behaviour and regulahons, rather to identify deficiencies in the regulatory landscape and to suggcst mecha-isms to .empower market participants, particularly mvestors, in enforcing their rights and responsibilities. The last 12 months have witnessed many reforms to the corporate regulatory framework. Foremost is the national companies scheme and the establishment of a single regulator in the form of the ASC. The ASC has at its disposal far more adequate levels of funding than were provided by the States and the Commonwealth under the cooperative scheme. The Committee views both the establishment of the national system and the provision of adequate resources to the ASC as the two single major changes that could have been made to safeguard the fair operation of the stock market. Also of considerable importance has been the process of debate that has occurred within the various players in the operation and regulation of corporate Australia. . The Australian Stock Exchange, the accountmg profession and institutional investors amongst others, have all undertaken a vigo-ous examination of the role they have played m the 1980s and the appropriate measures that should be adopted to ensure the abuses do not recur. The Committee believes that it has played a role in prompting and facilitating that process of debate. Self-regulation and self-help are themes which the Committee has ?r-adly e-dorsed not only in this inquiry but lU Its e-rher study on insider trading. Consistent With that approach, the Committee reviewed the operation of the corporations law specifically - the fields of market manipulabon and the nghts of shareholders in relation to the management of their companies. The. Committee believes that, generally speakmg, the failure of the regulatory system to cope with the abuses of the 1980s did not result from deficiencies in the substantiative law but rather was linked to poor enforcement by a flawed - egulatory system and under-resourced regulators. Hence the Committee does not recommend more than some quite specific changes to the corporations law. The recommendations rather focus on the role of the A-stralian Stock Exchange, its relationship WIth the Australian Securities Commission the issue of disclosure, and mechanisms thelp shareholders enforce their existing rights more effectively. In relation to the Australian Stock Exchan-e, the, Committee was impressed by wha- It conslder-d t? be a genuine attempt by the tndustry to hft Its game. To this end the Committee recommends that the ASX adequately fund its detection, surveillance and enforcement division, which can playa valuable role in conjunction with the ASC in detecting market malpractices. Further, the Committee wishes to see develop a greater level of cooperation between the ASX and the ASC in the enforcing of the exchange'S listing - ules. T-is would involve the sharing of l-formatlOn and the use by the ASC of investIgatory powers to assist the ASX in determining whether a breach of listing rules has occurred or is occurring. The Committee also recommends that the Australian Stock Exchange proceed with its proposal to reform the listing rules to ensure a greater level of disclosure of material transactions; secondly, that its rules be drafted by those versed in statutory drafting to ensure clear interpretation and enforcement by the courts; thirdly, that directors be under an obligation to procure compliance by their companies of the listing rules. Failure to do so can be enforced by the courts and be subject to penalty. Finally, we suggest that the ASX be given the right to institute proceedings under the corporations law to have its rules complied with without first having to give undertakings as to damages. The Committee accepts that the stock exchange is not a regulator as such, but the Committee believes that the listing rules can provide protection to investors and that the ASX, in cooperation with the ASC, should play an enhanced role in seeing that the listing rules are complied with. Chapter 4 of the Committee's report canvasses the vital issue of disclosure. It is through the disclosure in the form of accounts and the release of relevant information that shareholders and the market generally are able to make informed judgment about a company's performance and, in particular, the performance of directors. The Committee took a great deal of evidence about misleading reporting and the perceived failure of the audit process. There is no doubt that false and misleading reports were a major tool used by fraudulent company officers. There have been significant reforms in this area, including the long overdue adoption of a consolidated group account standard and the amendment of the corporations law to ensure that companies present all accounts in accordance with approved accounting standards, rather than relying on the more nebulous true and fair rule. The auditing process was examined by the Committee and several recommendations were made to complement the work already being undertaken by the profession and the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board. These recommendations include: firstly, that the Australian Auditing Standards Board enjoy similar recognition to that currently enjoyed by the Accounting Standards Board and that it contain within its make-up a unit to monitor compliance with auditing standards; secondly, that auditors be required to notify the ASC of malpractice when an auditor has reasonable grounds to suspect that malpractice has occurred; and thirdly, that the ASC be given the ability to approach a court to seek an order to have a court appointed auditor on occasions where there is clear evidence that proper auditing standards have been breached. The Companies and Securities Advisory Committee has released a discussion paper on continuous disclosure. The Committee favours the introduction of a system of continuous disclosure, but it is reluctant to see excessive regulatory burdens imposed through legislation. The Committee contends that the ASX listing rules, if· remodelled as canvassed earlier, can provide a mechanism for ensuring disclosure. In this way, a regime as extensive as that foreshadowed by CSAC can be introduced but via a system which is more flexible and responsive than legislation. Chapter 5 of the report looks at the role of shareholders in regard to the management of their companies. Traditionally, shareholders have been excluded from the day to day involvement in management decisions. The Committee has considered various proposals that were submitted to it to strengthen the law with regard to directors' duties. In this area we support the introduction of a business judgment rule and measures to regulate situations where directors can seek authorisation or ratification of possible breaches of their duties. We have also adopted and supported measures, such as audit committees, to improve communications between management and those dependent on their decisions. In relation to remedies available to shareholders, a great deal of attention was paid by the Committee to the old rule in the case of Foss v. Harbottle. Basically, that rule states that a company is the proper plaintiff in actions involving the company and that a shareholder as such cannot question the internal management decisions of a company. In Canada there has been for some time, notably in the province of Ontario, a procedure whereby shareholders and other proper plaintiffs can apply for leave to proceed in the name of the company to pursue a wrong against the company. The procedure avoids the complexity of the rule in Foss v. Harbotde. A feature of the procedure available in Canada is that in appropriate circumstances the court can order that a person given leave to proceed can be indemnified out of the company's resources to mount the action. The availability of such a procedure would overcome one of the principal inhibitions that have stopped individual shareholders asserting their legal rights against directors, namely, that they are required to finance the entire action from their own resources against defendants who often have access to the resources of the company. The Committee does not offer this proposal lightly. It is aware that it could be subject to abuses if not properly controlled. However, it is reinforced in its confidence that such a measure can be safely introduced by the fact that it has been available in Ontario and other parts of Canada for over 20 years. The proposal has been thoroughly examined by the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee and was recommended by it, and it was supported before the Committee by the Australian Securities Commission and the legal profession, as represented by the Law Council of Australia. We have qualified our recommendations in relation to the derivative action' concerns of who would have automatic standing to apply for leave. We have also suggested a range of mechanisms to safeguard the operation of the action, including involving the court in an effective case management role and also to ensure that directors are safeguarded as well.

16,Mr SMITH,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I thank the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), for his remarks. This is a particularly significant report and I believe it will be welcomed in the broader business community in Australia. This brings to an end the role of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for the current period in the business law area. This is the last of the trifecta of reports. The first was the report on mergers, monopolies and takeovers some years ago, the next was the insider trading report, and this report on the rights of shareholders is the last. Interspersed between them were sittings of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, which was set up by the Parliament to look at the very significant changes that took place in company law. The work of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has culminated in this report, Corporate practices and the rights of shareholders. To the Chairman I say thank you. Having been the ongoing Deputy Chairman and having been involved in all of these reports, I congratulate the staff who have supported us in this work, particularly the Secretary of the Committee, Jon Stanhope, who I understand is leaving. I offer him special thanks for all the work that he has done over the years. Particularly in relation to this report, I say thanks to Donald Nairn and Anne Hazelton for their work and that of the supporting staff. I do not want to canvass the issues, because the shadow Minister for corporate law reform, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), wishes to speak, as does the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), if time permits. Both were actively involved in this detailed report, and I say thank you to both of them. There is one point I would make. To allow the market to operate freely, there is always a balance to be struck in this area of the law between the public interest and the protection of shareholders and their rights. The bias and the direction of this report is to ask the industry itself to take it more seriously and to be far more active in its own surveillance and peer review, whether it be with auditors of the ASX or whatever. It is far preferable for the law to be focused in the direction of the markets in that way rather than to provide greater resources and greater levels of intrusive law for more regulation. In my view, over the years that I have been working in this area the regulators have been experts at putting cases for wanting to have more and more law. I think that needs to be resisted, and the best way it can be resisted is for the industry itself to be far more active in selfregulation and peer review. That is the bias that is evident in all the repOlts that we have produced. I am glad that the Government has embraced some of the things we have said in the insider trading report-indeed, nearly all of it-and much of what we said in the mergers, monopolies and takeovers inquiry. I suspect that this report will receive similar treatment. Yesterday the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) indicated in a speech outside the Parliament that he felt that committees were indeed important. I am glad to hear the Minister say that. But committees, if they are to do their work and do it well, will require an' ongoing commitment of resources and expertise. I say thank you to Mr Greg Bateman, an outside consultant whom we engaged to help with this difficult report. That is an example of how a committee's role can be enhanced. I say thank you to all involved and as Deputy Chairman, and as one who probably will not be on the Committee for much longer, I can say that I have enjoyed my time on this particular endeavour.",29
17,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I endorse the thanks that the honourable member for Bass (Me Smith) has given to the staff of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They performed well and were very helpful during the conduct of this inquiry. It seems that every time there is a boom in the Australian business cycle and a boom on the Australian stock market that turns to bust, there is a parliamentary inquiry of some kind or another to try to look at the law to see whether we can prevent the next boom and bust cycle from occurring. This report really comes out of the consequences of the crash of October 1987 and the failure of numbers of business corporations. We sat down, as the Rae committee did after the Poseidon boom, and looked at the law to see what went wrong and to try to improve it. One of the temptations is to look at the current law and at how it failed and then try to add a few sections here or a few chapters to an Act there, saying that we have now tidied it up and it will not happen again. The reason I say that it could be a failing is that in every boom and bust there is a collective mentality that takes over; there are new ways of doing things. For every section that is introduced, five ways of getting around it are found, and sometimes we make the law so complicated that nobody knows what it is and as a result do not observe it in any event. The provisions which were introduced for regulating companies buying back their shares is an example of that. In this report we have borne that in mind and tried to steer away from it. One of the ongoing themes of this report is how much corporate regulation should be exclusively carried by the Australian Securities Commission and how much by the Australian Stock Exchange. I think there has been a bias on the part of the Committee, and it is my bias, that wherever possible we should look to almost self-regulation through the Australian Stock Exchange-empowering it to take proceedings in court, without having to give undertakings as to damages, to enforce listing rules, empowering it to enforce continuous disclosure and empowering it to operate market surveillance. All the members of the Committee were very impressed when they went to Sydney and saw the facilities for market surveillance that the Australian Stock Exchange now has in place. I think the surveillance system of the stock exchange is probably the best chance to detect rigged market practices. In this report we have also picked up a number of ideas which have been around for some time-for example, the business judgment rule, which was mentioned by the Chairman. I think that was first recommended by the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee, the CSLRC, which was chaired by Professor Ford, in its report No. 10. Now that many of the crooks have been chased out of the boardroom, it is time to encourage good people to come back in. We need to have a sensible situation so that good people are not scared off being company directors by liabilities that can put all of their personal worth at risk, even for failed business judgments. That is why I think that recommendation is right and good. I underline that a lot of good work was done by the CSLRC in its final days. We have picked up on that good work in relation to the statutory derivative action, which came out of report No. 12. It has been convenient to say that everything that went before the Australian Securities Commission was wrong and bad and that nothing good ever came out of it, but I think in the final days a lot of good did come out of the CSLRC. I hope that by picking up those recommendations and advancing them we can bring some of those good ideas to fruition. I rose to speak because I entered as a reservation some comments in relation to the statutory derivative action. 'The Chairman has outlined how that recommendation would work. The recommendation empowers shareholders, directors, former shareholders and former directors to bring a statutory derivative action. I have a reservation about that, and it is set out at the end of the report. That is to say that I cannot be convinced that former shareholders and former directors should be able to bring actions. On the material and the argument we heard I was not convinced, but if somebody could think of a reason why it is necessary I would be happy to come on board. My concern was that, by empowering former shareholders and former directors to bring such actions, people who had no connection with the wrong that was being taken up in the company's name and who possibly had no interest in the outcome of the action would be bringing actions in the company's name. I think it is important that, when it comes to allowing the derivative action, the court should assess who is the most appropriate person to bring the corporation's right of action. It may be that a former shareholder who was not there at the time the wrong was committed and has no interest in the outcome is not the right person to enforce the corporation's right of action. If provision is made for the court to take that into account, as I have said in the reservation, I have no difficulty; but I think to widen the class and not make any specific proposal as to how that can be taken into account is too bald and too wide on the basis of the evidence that came before the Committee. That is why we entered that reservation. I hope the Government does work through the recommendations that are made in this report. 'There are a lot of good and very sensible recommendations. I think they would improve the standard of corporate law in this country. Let us hope that when the next boom comes the recommendations that are made in this report will have some ameliorating effect on what could be the next wave of excesses in boom conditions on Australian stock markets.",30
18,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I would like to do two things: firstly, I wish the Secretary of the Committee, Jon Stanhope, well. I think all of us envy him his not new role on Norfolk Island that will take him away from the air-conditioning and other traumas of this place. Secondly, I compliment the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and the staff for the excellent work they have done in the report, and largely echo the remarks that have been made by my colleagues. I wanted to pick up one other field very briefly-auditing standards-but my time has expired and I cannot. All I will say is that they should be by legal and regulatory change. I am delighted to see the recommendations embrace that.",31
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the Chairman wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion? Motion (by Mr Lavarch) proposed: That the House take note of the report.,31

21,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Thirty-Seventh Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, New Delhi, India, September 1991. I wish to place on record that this was one of the most fascinating visits that I have had in my parliamentary experience-a visit to the world's largest democracy, a land of many contrasts and certainly a land of exotic culture. There are 850 million people living in India and growing at a rate equivalent to Australia's population each year. It is certainly a land extreme contrasts-from the very poor through to the very wealthy. There are thousands upon thousands of homeless people in New Delhi and there is a lack of infrastructure within that city. Things that we normally take for granted, such as water, sewerage, basic housing, drainage and electricity, are lacking in some areas. However, since the green revolution in primary industry in that nation, it has added to its sustainability of agricultural production; in fact, the Indian people are now largely self-sufficient in food production, and this is having a tremendous impact on the country of India. This was an excellent conference with 216 delegates attending from Commonwealth countries. The interchange of ideas amongst participating Commonwealth parliamentary delegates, as always, was very enlightening and very fruitful. The Australian delegates played a major role in the conference and, in fact, there were Australian speakers, Australian delegates at every plenary session and several panel sessions. Senator Margaret Reid, one of my colleagues, contributed to the plenary session on violence against women and children; Dr Theophanous participated in the first, second and third plenary sessions and in panel aid discussions; I had the privilege of participating in the panel session on 'what Commonwealth parliaments can do in furthering food production marketing and consumption'; and Dr Catley was a panellist in the session on 'the role of the press in a INDIA democracy' . Report The level of agreement on many of the issues that were debated was quite surprising. In fact, unusually, the motion on South Africa did not take up its full allotment of time because there was a high level of agreement on the discussions which took place. Whilst many of these views were largely concurrent, one regret I did have was that resolutions were not adopted by the conference nor was action taken to forward the result of resolutions to the countries concerned. This is an area where Commonwealth parliamentary conferences can be improved. I would like to take this opportunity also to thank our hosts for their wonderful hospitaliof ty. The Indian people treated us in a wonderful way and certainly made the conference a very great success. They also organised postconference tours, which gave us the opportunity to experience Indian life at first hand, to observe many cultural activities and to see exactly how the Indian people live. I want to pay a tribute to the President of the Senate, the leader of the delegation, Senator Kerry Sibraa, and to Mr David Evans and his staff at the Australian High Commission in New Delhi for his assistance in making our visit so educational and invigorating in India. I would also like to place on record the delegation's thanks to Mr Jim Pender, Clerk Assistant, and Mr Fred Peppinck, the personal assistant to the President of the Senate, Kerry Sibraa, for their assistance during the conference in making the experience one that I am sure the delegates will never forget. NA NA NA",32
22,Ms MCHUGH,DEVELOPMENT,"I move: That this House: (1) take an active interest in, and where possible contribute to, Australia's preparation for and participation in the UN Conference on Environment and Development which is to take place in Brazil in June· 1992; and (2) urges aU Members to support Australia's role in the development of an Earth Charter document of principles, an Agenda 21 action document and International Conventions on Climate Change and Biodiversity. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be known as UNCED or Earth Summit 92, will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1 June to 12 June next year. UNCED is expected to be the largest gathering of heads of state and government ever to consider environment and development issues, and about 30 000 delegates will attend. The conferenc- is a bold attempt to have the nations of the world find a common basis for action to protect the futt;tre of our planet. It seeks to lay the foundations for a global paltnership between developed and developing countries to secure for all people a more equitable and sustainable future. Recognising that the issues of environment and development are often juxtaposed in a very confrontationist way, the Brazll conference aims to put environmental protection and sustainable development at the centre of the decision making processes of government. The last five or so years have seen much debate about the concept of sustainable development. The concept was first introduced in a comprehensive manner by the World Commission on Environment and Development in the now well known Brundtland report called Our Common Future. It defines sustainable development as development which: . '.' meets the needs of the present generation Without comprorrusing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Governments around the world have been grappling with this concept and trying to create policies which reflect its meaning. The Australian Government has been very active in developing policies to ensure that what we call ecologically sustainable development practices are followed. However, many of the environmental problems of today are global and can be addressed only in forums with representation from around the world. That is what UNCED is for. Next year's Earth Summit will provide our global community with the greatest opportunity yet to give practical application to the concept of ecologically sustainable development in the decision making of developed and developing countries. Key issues which the conference will address include protection of the atmosphere, that is, climate change depletion of the ozone layer and so on: protection of land resources, including combating deforestation, soil loss, desertification and drought; protection of freshwater resources; protection of oceans, seas and coastal areas, and the rational use and development of their living resources; environmentally sound management of biotechnology and hazardous waste, including toxic chemicals' prevention of illegal traffic in toxic producand wastes; improvement in the quality of life and human health; and improvement in living and working conditions of the poor by eradicating poverty while stopping environmental degr-dation. I hope it will also find a way of tackling the problems created by extraordinary growth in world population whilst remaining sensitive to the economic demands of the poor in developing countries. The conference is expected to produce an Earth Charter, which will provide basic principles for the sustainable economic and en,:ironmental behaviour of peoples and nations; Agenda 21, a blueprint for action in all major areas affecting the relationship ?etween the environment and the economy mto the twenty-first century; and conventions on climate change and biodiversity. It is also expected to formulate institutional mechanisms to implement the outcomes of UNCED. The second part of the motion I have moved today urges all members of this Parliament-this House in particular-to actively support Australia's role in the lead-up processes. On issues such as these, Australia has often been able to take the lead and galvanise opinion at both a regional and an international level. The recent decision on Antarctica is an excellent example of just how important Australia's role can be in terms of changing international opinion on environmental issues. But the success of UNCED really does depend ultimately on all nations cooperating and - ing committed to implementing policies which may seem domestically very difficult to achieve but which contribute to global well-being. Possible outcomes for a convention on climate change are but one example where such commitments are needed. I am sure all honourable members recall the intense debate when Australia adopted the interim Toronto target of a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005. There was a perceived conflict between Australia's domestic and international environmental policy objectives. Australia is committed to playing a significant role both in the preparations for the Earth Summit and in following up the outcomes. An Australian delegation has been active in each of the three preparatory meetings held to date and will continue to be active in the fourth Prepcom planned for New York in February next year. There has been enormous activity in nongovernmental organisations and within the Government in preparation for the conference; as a parliament we too can be involved. So far we have been involved through the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which I chair. Other members from that Committee will follow me today. The issues which UNCED intends to address-as well as its outcomes-will be of great interest to all members of our parliamentary Committee. As I have already mentioned, one of the expected outcomes of UNCED next year will be an international convention on biodiversity. This global convention is being negotiated under the UNEP. There will be country specific studies, action plans for national priorities and national reports. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) announced the first stage in the development of a national strategy for the conservation of Australia's biological diversity. That national strategy, it is hoped, will be made available for public comment in early 1992. Our House of Representatives Standing Committee is involved here. We are undertaking an inquiry. Recognising that the biological diversity advisory committee is drawing together specialist information in developing that national strategy for the maintenance of biological diversity, our Committee is inquiring into the extent to which Commonwealth assisted community based projects contribute, either directly or perhaps incidentally, to the protection of biological diversity and the maintenance of ecological processes and systems. Also, many members of this Parliament are members of a group called Parliamentarians for Global Action. This is a worldwide group, not of government representatives but of representatives from many different parties in many parliaments and legislatures throughout the world. The House would be interested to know that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), formerly on the executive of PGA, is a member of my House of Representatives Committee. His place on the executive has now been taken by Senator Reynolds. As its name suggests, PGA is concerned with issues of global significance. In recent years it has put much effort into attempting to raise awareness amongst parliamentarians of the need for substantial policy shifts if we are to combat the global warming problem. It is also involved in preparatory work for the Earth Summit. One of the great strengths of PGA-and the main reason why it is so well placed to contribute to some of the preparatory work for UNCED-is that its members come from many parliaments in many different countries. Importantly, both developed and developing nations have active representation in PGA. The importance of this fact is very simple. It is highly unlikely that developing countries will accept any propositions arising out of UNCED which place the major burden of policy change on them, without there being a significant shift in the thinking of developed nations as to their environmental, economic and development assistance priorities. The global distribution of wealth is therefore an important issue which has to be addressed. The example which is most commonly given to illustrate these problems is that of the ongoing destruction of the Amazon rainforests. Removal of tree cover to the extent that has occurred in these forests over the last 100 years has been shown to influence global climate patterns, and ultimately will contribute to the global warming problem. As Brazil attempts to meet its huge debt repayments to the World Bank, it sees its natural resources as a readily accessible form of wealth, easily converted into foreign currency to repay these debts. Recognition of these problems has been around for many years; it is very evident in our region in South East Asia. But proposals which could comprehensively solve the problem have not been forthcoming. That is what UNCED has to face up to. It has to help developing nations and undeveloped nations to come together. If it can achieve only thatthis is the obvious source of great disagreement at UNCED-it will be an enormous success and more than meet its objectives. It is extremely important to me that this Parliament support our country's efforts as we prepare for UNCED. For that reason I commend this motion to the House.",32
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?,35
24,Mr NUGENT,DEVELOPMENT,"I second the motion. I commend the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) on her motion, which first urges this House to take an active interest in and, where possible, contribute to Australia's preparation for, and participation in, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which is to take place in Brazil next year. Secondly, the motion urges all honourable members to support Australia's role in the development of the Earth Charter document of principles, an Agenda 21 action document, and the international conventions on climate change and biodiversity. Whilst I am not a member of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which the honourable member for Phillip referred to, I am sure all in this support the intent of the motion. It is important that we make sure that we do not just indulge in pious and nice thoughts, but that we actually look at some substantive action. During my contribution this morning, I will make a few comments along those lines. The agenda of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, of course, deals with three major areas: conventions, the Earth Charter and the action plan or Agenda 21. The conventions are the global climate change convention and the biodiversity convention. They are actually being negotiated separately from the UNCED proper, but they will be signed or, as I understand it, agreed to at the conference. The Earth Charter is there to set up the basic principles for the conduct of peoples and of nations towards each other and the Earth to ensure a sustainable common future. The action plan, Agenda 21, is to provide an agenda and concrete measures for the implementation of the Earth Charter principles through an agreed international work program in the period leading into the twenty-first century. In a sense, that is almost the most important part. We can talk all we like but, if we do not have some committed plans for action, we will get nowhere. We were told by the then acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett), in a press release on 23 October, that the UN conference to be held next year in Brazil would be the largest gathering of heads of government and senior Ministers in recent history. That is an indication of the significance of this conference. Australia's Ambassador for the Environment, Sir Ninian Stephen, led Australia's delegation to the preparatory meeting, which was attended by representatives of 160 countries and 300 non-government organisations. We are talking about getting a very large scale movement under way. I was pleased to note that at the outset Sir Ninian Stephen highlighted the need for a very realistic approach. He said that the concern of developing countries, their fight to overcome poverty and achieve economic House growth, should not be compromised by anxiety to protect the environment. Looking after those countries economically will be important, as will encouraging them to do the right thing environmentally. Developing countries want to ensure that any ilimit on their development efforts is balanced by enhanced aid, and the transfer on concessional terms of relevant environment friendly technology. Those seeking to strengthen the international legal regime have to take note of those arguments. It may well be that the most appropriate response in some cases is political and economic rather than legal. We were reminded just last month that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced at the recent Harare CHOGM that he intended to attend UNCED in Brazil next year. I hope he will go through with that because it will be an important meeting. For example, President Bush from the United States and Prime Minister Major from the United Kingdom have indicated that they will attend. It is important that we be represented at the highest level. I urge the Prime Minister, if he goes, to concentrate on getting some results and not just a lot of talk. I say this in the best possible spirit, but I do have to say that the Prime Minister unfortunately has a record of sometimes trying to politicise the environmental debate in this country. He really does need to concentrate on substance and not theatre. We do not need lots of big statements; we need some actual implementations. As I understand it, the Government is seeking bipartisan support for the conference in Brazil. I know the coalition welcomes the approach of a bipartisan attitude to that conference. In fact, we would like to see Australia send a bipartisan delegation. The shadow Minister for the environment, my friend and colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who is at the table at the moment, wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) on 4 October to offer that suggestion. If the honourable member for Phillip and her colleagues can encourage the Minister to respond in a positive sense, because she has not responded as yet, we would obviously be most encouraged and pleased. It is a test of perhaps how serious the Government is. If it really wants to be bipartisan, it needs to allow for full participation. This would be a test of the Government's bona fides. There are, of course, precedents for this. We have bipartisan representation at the ILO and at many other international conferences. Just last month I was in Tonga at the South Pacific Commission conference with members of the Government as a bipartisan delegation. I think this is necessary if we are to project ourselves adequately outside this country. The conference outcomes will be long term. Thus, we do need both sides of politics involved to ensure that there is continuity on an ongoing basis. Whoever is in government needs to progress those outcomes in a consistent way. In Australia we have sometimes had difficulties in terms of implementing environmental policies, particularly in that environmental and biodiversity area, because we have this Federal-State relationship under which we often seem to be at war. Rather than indulging in productive issues, we actually fight each other. We need cooperation between the Federal and State governments because we do not have the time and we cannot afford the cost of the legal battles. We need to talk and we need complementary legislation. We all know that the air does not change when we get to the border between Victoria and New South Wales. It is a national thing. We all know that the air does not change when we get to the border between New South Wales and Queensland, though perhaps some of us from outside Queensland might have a slightly different view. We all know that land degradation in this country is an important national issue and we are all committed to ozone protection. It is also important, not only here but overseas, to make sure we get the economics right. A sound economy, a strong economy, means that one can have strong environmental policies. A weak economy invariably means that countries have weak environmental policies. One can look at Russia and eastern Europe. Eastern Europe economically is a wasteland; environmentally it is an absolute disaster. Even in Brazil, where the conference will be held, trees are being cut down-purely because there is the economic need-and that is causing a lot of environmental problems. It is hard to be an environmentalist when one is sick and starving. Many of the countries causing environmental problems are poor, so the developed world must help. I understand that recently Japan suggested it will contribute $15 billion to aid some of the underdeveloped countries along the path of development so they will not have to indulge in a lot of these environmentally damaging practices. That is to be commended. Australia in itself is a relatively minor polluter. That is not to say we are clean, but in percentage terms-in terms of the whole world situation-we are a relatively minor polluter. It means also that whatever we do here, however right we get it, our impact in global terms will be small. That is why perhaps some of our most effective action is not necessarily what we actually do here, but the impact we can have in international forums. We do have good skills in Australia in the environmental sciences area, so we can help our smaller neighbours. We can contribute to international research. The diversity in our own huge country means that we actually have a tremendous width and range of environments in which we can develop skills and knowledge that we can pass on to others. Just to sum up, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in June next year will be a very critically important conference for all of us. When I say all of us, I do not just mean in Australia - I mean for everyone across the world. The Prime Minister should go and should concentrate on results. I think it is important that we do not make it a political football. For the sake of all of us, let us make it a bipartisure san approach, let us have the Opposition in the delegation and let us make sure, therefore, that we get some continuity and agreed action that can then be implemented on an ongoing basis. We must remember not to dictate to the Third World. We must offer it some real help so it can do the right thing as we would perceive it. Australia should become a strong player, not only at the conference but in the work prior to it and in the subsequent action plan coming out of that conference. I commend the honourable member for Phillip. I support her wholeheartedly, and I urge the House to support the motion.",35
25,Mr JOHNS,DEVELOPMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) for working so hard to have this motion put before the House. I note also that she wants the Parliament itself to take a part in the fonnation of the ideas and processes leading up to UNCED. Also, we should congratulate Sir Ninian Stephen, Australia's Ambassador on the Environment, for his work in preparation for UNCED. I want to pick up a particular theme that will be most impOItant at UNCED. Australia understands that UNCED seeks to achieve the effective integration of economic and environmental considerations. One of the most important issues here is how we price our resources. Two of the most important principles concerning resource pricing are polluter pays, that is, those who generate or benefit from pollution and waste should bear the cost; and user pays, that is, the users of goods and services should pay prices based on the full life cycle costs of providing the goods and services, including the use of natural resources, including the global commons, and the ultimate disposal of any wastes. In the sense that all parties in this Parliament ought to share those views, J want to take up the point whereby currently the Opposition has a view that it should drop the price of petrol in this country by means of taking off some excise tax. Irrespective of debate about whether that will be achieved, I want to make the point that if we do drop the price of a resource, we run the risk of, firstly, making that that resource is used inefficiently, so it is not necessarily economically a smart thing to do; and, secondly, overusing that resource so it is not environmentally particularly satisfactory either. If we are to work together in developing an Australian position for UNCED, we ought to be careful about how we price things like petrol in this country so we ensure that we get the best-that is, the most efficient-use of the resource for economic purposes. That docs not mean to say we have a cheaper resource. The two oil crises of the early 1970s and the early 1980s, which put up the price of oil and, by translation, petrol, around the world, translated into a more efficient use of oil products, especially in countries like Japan which is heavily oil dependent. Japan realised that, if the price of oil stayed high, it had to use less of it in its productive processes. So it worked for the more efficient and effective use of oil. Whilst it was an economically sensible thing to do, the spin-off of using less oil for a given amount of production is that it is an environmentally sensible thing to achieve that is, there is less pollution generated because of the consequence of the higher oil price. I do not say that we should deliberately go out and jack up the price of all carbon products. I know that is an extremely complicated debate which we will have to enter into at some stage or another. But to actually drop the price of a resource will not bring a more efficient use of the resource. It will almost certainly lead to an overuse of the resource and, therefore, greater pollution for a given amount of production. I urge the Opposition to reconsider its idea of lowering the price of petrol in this country because it does not sit well with our views in UNCED, where we want to consider resource pricing under the principles of polluter pays and user pays. I urge the Opposition that at least leaving the price of petrol or in time lifting it, so that we might use it more cautiously and effectively and sensibly, will be economically smart as well as environmentally smart.",37
26,Mr CHANEY,DEVELOPMENT,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) and to confirm the bipartisan support for Australia's participation in this conference. I would like to say to the House and to the honourable member for Phillip, who has brought this forward, that the Opposition is not declaring this position for the first time and that it is not merely because she has brought this useful motion forward that leads us to make that declaration. For example, on 14 September I addressed a United Nations Association conference here in Canberra and issued a statement pursuant to that paper in which I indicated that the Opposition would welcome a bipartisan approach to this most important conference. I give that assurance to the House. I hope that the bipartisan approach we seek and the support we offer for this conference will see a reciprocal response from the Government and a preparedness to involve the Opposition in something which, I think, should be beyond party politics. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) has already made the point that the Opposition has sought representation at the international conference, and we believe that that would confirm the broad support within this country for sensible environmental programs on a worldwide basis. In making that request of the Government, I pointed out to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) that there has been bipartisan support for many significant environmental objectives. We have a competitive political situation: politics in Australia, like the legal system in Australia, is based on adversarial presentations. But the fact of the matter is that on very significant and particularly significant international environment issues there has been a high degree of bipartisanship. For example, it was in fact the Opposition which in 1989 adopted the principle of having targets for Australia for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We welcome the fact that in December 1990 the Government adopted targets which were very similar to those of the Opposition. I think, in fairness, the Government in tum qualified its targets but in a way which, the Opposition publicly conceded, was a sensible meeting of the concerns about the economic impact on Australia and the great uncertainties that exist in this area. When we actually get down to it there is a high degree of bipartisanship, as there was with another great and important international initiative with respect to ozone depleting substances. I think this reflects the politicians' response to the broad community concerns that these issues should be tackled as a matter of substance. I hope that we will be able to maintain a broadly bipartisan approach to such key issues. The additional point I wish to make this morning, though, is that I think it is very important that Australia, as a relatively wealthy country-and, even at a time of some economic stress, we are a relatively wealthy country when we look at the great range of countries who will participate in this conference-should go to the conference not merely preaching what others should do, but providing a lead by our own actions. In that respect, as far as greenhouse is concerned, I would commend to Government members the comment made in our Fightback program which does touch on our environmental concerns. With respect to greenhouse, we say that it is important that the Commonwealth itself be prepared to play a leadership role in this matter. It should be a matter of doing things as we do rather than as we say. To actually quote the document, we say that we should: ... ensure that Federal Government agencies maintain the best energy management practices so that the Commonwealth plays a leadership role and is able to urge the rest of the community to do as we do (rather than do as we say); The other thing that I think is vitally important-and we are reminded of this by the horrific situation in the Darling River-is that we have major environmental challenges here in Australia which are purely Australian, within Australia. And I would commend to the Government our view that, whilst existing programs are very worthy of support, much more needs to be done. The blooms of poisonous algae in so many of our watercourses are a great warning of the fact that we have much more to do than we have realised to this point. Again, I hope that would be a matter in respect of which we can say to the world, 'We are tackling these key Australian issues which go to so many things, including biodiversity, in a positive and constructive way here within Australia', as we join in broader international efforts to handle these things on an international basis.",38
27,Mr JENKINS,DEVELOPMENT,"I have pleasure in joining this debate and supporting the motion moved by the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh). Some of the issues that have been skirted around during the debate would perhaps suggest a debate that could go down the track of being party political, but I do not think that this is the time to have that type of debate. The concerns that are to be tackled by the UNCED conference are too important and too relevant to the whole of society to allow us that indulgence. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), in his comments, talked about how environment knows no political boundaries in the way in which the Australian Federal system works. That is certainly one of the important things about the work of the UNCED conference, and the intent of this' motion is to indicate that the environment in an international sense has no boundaries. That is why international and global environmental policies are so important. Throughout the 1980s-and certainly it is the case now in the 1990s-there was a realisation of this. Popular magazines such as Time, which made the endangered Earth the planet of the year in its annual awards in January 1989, illustrate the types of concerns which have come to the fore in the late 1980s and which are now to be tackled in the 1990s. The conference in Brazil in June 1992 has its genesis in UN resolution 44/228. The UNCED conference follows 20 years after the World Conference on Environment and Development, where there was an attempt to set out a long term global environmental agenda. At this UNCED conference, of course, the world will aim to set an agenda for the next 20 years-Agenda 21. As has been indicated earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Phillip, the UN resolution which I have mentioned lists nine environmental issues. They are not in any order of priority, but they are issues that need to be tackled in a global sense. Briefly, they include the protection of the atmosphere, including considerations of ozone, climate change and greenhouse; protection of the quality and supply of fresh water resources; protection of the oceans and of coastal areas; protection and management of land resources, encompassing consideration of forms of land degradation and deforestation; the conservation of biological diversity, a matter. which was alluded to by the honourable member for Phillip; and environmentally sound management of biotechnology, an issue that the honourable member for Aston and I, as members of the House of Representatives Industry, Science and Technology Committee, are currently trying to come to grips with. A further issue is the environmentally sound management of waste, particularly hazardous wastes and toxic chemicals. Again, that is an issue that has been tackled by committees of this Parliament. Finally, there are the issues of the improvement of the living and working environments of the poor and the protection of human health conditions and the improvement of the quality of life. These are the types of economic issues that the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) introduced. It must not be thought that we will be able to look in some isolated way at environmental issues without thinking of the social and economic consequences. In conclusion, the honourable member for Phillip has called for the House to take an active interest in the issues before the conference and, indeed, to take an active interest in the conference itself. Standing Order 28B, which sets out what standing committees may do, indicates that the House of Representatives environment committee might be called upon to playa more active role-even a role in the preparation of the conference. That would embrace honourable members on both sides of this chamber and would include all political views. Already in the run-up to the conference the non-government agencies have been given an excellent opportunity to be involved. (Time expired)",39
28,Mr BROADBENT,DEVELOPMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on the motion moved by the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh). The honourable member has been congratulated by each speaker on bringing this matter to the attention of the House, so I do not intend to take up my short time with further congratulations. The honourable member has moved: That this House: (1) take an active interest in and, where possible contribute to, Australia's preparation for and participation in the UN Conference on Environment and Development which is to take place in Brazil in June 1992; As I would expect of him, the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has just said-this is my assessment of what he said that this issue of the environment has run out of legs as a party political issue. It has become so important to each and every family across this nation that it has run out of legs for side votes or as a means of support to get a government over the line. This is especially so since the 1990 election campaign. Therefore, it is not for me to be political this morning. But I want to reflect on what will be the outcome of a group of Australians - whoever they may be, but including the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), our shadow Minister and, I would hope, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), as well as honourable members and people from groups who may learn something-attending the conference. As an outcome of that conference water might be better in Westernport Bay-a boundary of my electorate; water off Sydney may be better; and we may learn new ways to treat sewage in Australia. We may pick up some ideas from the people who attend that conference-ideas that may change what we do here in Australia. Each member who has spoken in this debate has approached the matter in a different way. However, I think it is terribly important that the motion moved by the honourable member for Phillip be supported, not only by honourable members speaking on the issue but also by my other colleagues. What we are saying is that, although we have a great country with clean air in many parts, we still have some pockets with dirty air. That means that pollution is affecting somebody we know. Anyone living in Corinella or in South Dandenong would realise that there is a black haze over those areas that is a disgrace. We have to change the way we go about affecting our cities. If this group attending the conference is able to learn and to pick up new ideas on how to change the way we affect our environment here, it will be worth it. I hope that the Government will look closely at who it decides to send to the conference. I hope that the Government will recognise the importance of the conference. I hope it will recognise that Australia has a major role to play in the rest of the world in this regard. Equally, we have an opportunity to learn from the conference. I would not be one of those people going to the conference, but I would be the recipient-as would other Australians-of the information derived from the conference. Our standing would be enhanced by our being at that conference. I think that this is a real opportunity for us, for the first time, to lay down the iss,ue of the environment as a political football-as was mentioned by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). I want to say to honourable members that we are quite prepared to lay the issue down if honourable members opposite are prepared to lay it down and to get on with the job of effecting change in Australia. I do not want to see filth coming out of our ocean outfalls. I do not want fishermen comgreat plaining to me about the filth that they catching their fish from. I do not want people complaining to me about the degradation our land. I do not want to hear about another 1,000 kilometres of river that has the capabiliabout, ty not only of destroying stock but also of affecting the lives of people. I think that time has come for us as a House to say, 'We have some major problems. Here is one opgas portunity to present ourselves and our credenbring tials to the international community'. I comthe mend the honourable member for Phillip and thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the motion.",40
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT,Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. NA,41
30,Mr HICKS,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I move: That this House acknowledges the importance of our primary industry sector to Australia's national economy. In speaking to this motion on the importance of Australia's primary industry, I must first acknowledge the tremendous contribution that the mining industry has made, and is continuing to make, to Australia's economic welfare. A case in point with which I am cent - amiliar is the silver, lead and zinc mining mdustry of Broken Hill, which is still in operation after 100 years of mining. Not only has the Barrier field provided great wealth to State and Federal governments and added to - he standard of living of all Australians, but lts resources have provided the foundation for much of Australia's industrial growth. In addition, the names of many people whose initial training took place in the Broken Hill mines permeate Australian business and, indeed, industrial establishments throughout the world. One needs only to mention John Ralph, the late Sir Maurice Mawby, Dinni O'Leary, Liebelt and Espie. All of these names, of course, are well known to most Australians. Some of them have become household names. No doubt, Broken Hill, although outstanding, is only a representative sample of other Australian mining fields. Of course, we are now have great gas and oil fields. We have Mount Isa Mines, Mount Morgan-one could of go on and on. One field which is underestimated and which not many people know although I know that many honourable members have certainly travelled there, is the the great North West Shelf development. That development of natural liquefied petroleum to be sold in the Japanese market will in income of $2 billion per annum to Australian economy. Indeed, it represents a great contribution to our national wealth. While today the mining industry contributes velY significantly to Australia's wealth, I wish to speak about the rural industry's contribution to the Australian economy. From slow and difficult beginnings in the early days of European settlement, primary industries developed rapidly and have featured prominently in the Australian economy since about the 1820s. Those industries now account for approximately 10 per cent of our gross domestic production. Although that figure may not seem very large, our primary industries are basically export oriented. It is these exports that are extremely important to Australia because of the expOlt income they generate. Pri-ary products make up about 70 per of the total value of all our exports. This export income enables us to finance the import of the goods and services that we have no comparative advantage in producing. In this way, thanks to our rural and mining sectors, Australians enjoy a higher standard of living than they might otherwise do. A recent phenomenon which has not had a precedent for many years is the coverage that rural areas are receiving in the media while the economy is in depression, commodity prices are at their lowest levels for many years and drought is gripping most of eastern Australia. Over many years, the only news we would get in most of the printed media would be that giving readers an impression that most people who lived in rural Australia, particularly if they worked on the land, were very wealthy. But now, to use the words of Morris West, 'Many farmers have been reduced to peonage'-that is, almost to the status of serfs. At last, however, a few photos of drought and desolation are appearing on page three of the capital city media, but I am still sure Mr and Mrs Average Australia are not aware of the pain being felt by families in the bush and how this will spread and eventually affect them. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said recently in Parliament, the interest rates of 18 months to two years ago have had an effect only quite recently. So the present drought in eastern Australia and the rural downturn will not have an effect on most Australians for perhaps another six to 12 months. Then, unfortunately, I am sure that most Australians will understand what recession and depression really mean. Most people would now be aware just how wrong the media image of farmers has been and indeed how poor many of our farmers are. But how did this poverty come about? How can the farming sector, which has played major part in carrying the Australian economy for so long, find itself in such a precarious situation? There are many reasons. The major ones include low commodity prices, the colcould lapse of the communist empire, the EC subbelieve sidy programs, the United States export enhancement program, and of course now the drought, just to name a few. Many of these we can do little about, but we can certainly do something about the farmers' greatest handicap, namely, an inadequate government. We can do something about getting government off the back of our rural industries and in providing a framework that will enable the rural sector to get on with the job. That is one of the reasons why the National Party in partnership with our Liberal colleagues is proposing a wide range of fundamental reforms that will be of enormous benefit to regional and rural Australia and will recognise the important contribution rural Australia makes to our economy. Mr Bruce Scott-Abolish fuel taxes.",41
31,Mr HICKS,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"For starters-as the honourable member for Maranoa says-under our tax reform package, fuel prices for the average motorist will fall by 19c per litre, and every time an average car tank is filled it will cost $11 less. That will be a great boost to country people because it is normally country people who travel the longest distances on our worse roads. I will give an example. As the member for Riverina-Darling, I find that the trip between my two major centres, Broken Hill and Griffith, takes about 7112 hours if I drive on the bitumen road and about 5 112 hours if I drive on the dirt road. However, it is not always possible to use the dirt road. One can imagine how much fuel is used on such a trip and what the cost is to the taxpayer. The costs to the people who live in an environment such as that are prohibitive. I heard the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) say earlier that lowering the cost of fuel would cause environmental damage. It is my belief that world parity pricing was latched on to in the early days because it provided a milch cow to allow government to get excess taxes. It would have been all right had those taxes been spent on roads, but a a number of governments have not spent those taxes on roads; they have added them to their income. The honourable member for Petrie said something about the environment. We always walk or get onto a horse, but I the environmental problems caused by horses, particularly in New York at the tum of the century, were far worse as far as greenhouse gas emissions go than those caused by cars, particularly in outback Australia. We really do need cheaper fuel in outback Australia because the price of fuel has a cascading effect as it moves through the economy; it is very important to people in outback Australia. The coalition will also abolish for farmers the excise on fuel used on and off farm. This will save farmers 26c per litre, or over $1 billion per year. Under our policy they will pay no excise or GST on diesel fuel or petrol used on or off farm for business purposes. That will be a reat' bonus for farmers. The excise abolition will also apply to fuel oil, heating oil, kerosene and aviation gasoline, Avgas. The Avgas price will fall even further than that of petrol because the current excise on it is higher. This will mean cheaper fuel for general aviation. Mr Lavarch interjecting Mr mCKS-Could I say to the honourable member who is interjecting that to travel between my two major centres, Broken Hill to Griffith, costs $1,200 per charter, and that is the cost to the taxpayer. I know that the honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) will vouch for what I am saying, that the cost of fuel, particularly of Avgas, is exorbitant and is adding to the restriction of movement of people in the outback. We cannot allow that to happen. Regional airlines will also be more competitive, which will be great news for mral Australia. Hopefully, the expected lower prices will see the reintroduction of some airline routes that regional and commuter airlines have been forced to drop owing to high government costs, which resulted in high fares and low patronage. Crop dusting and other aerial agricultural work will also be cheaper, which will be welcomed particularly by the irrigation districts in my electorate. Freight costs to country and remote areas will be reduced as a result of our package. This will be of great assistance to everyone living in IUral Australia, as it will result in lower prices of goods across the counter. We further recognise the benefit of IUral Australia to our overall economy by promising a further range of measures that will be of great assistance to people living in country areas. The National Party in coalition will increase the children's boarding allowance to $2,400 and it will abolish Labor's assets test for the assistance for isolated children scheme. This is most important. Many people in my electorate, because they cannot afford it for one reason or another, but mainly because of the lural depression, are withdrawing their children from boarding schools and hostels. It is a tragedy for those people in IUral Australia who are disadvantaged as far as eduction is concerned compared with their capital city counterparts. We will abolish the assets test for retirees living on the family farm as well as for families suffering extreme economic difficulties and receiving Austudy, family allowance and other welfare payments. The remote area allowance and zone rebates will increase by at least 25 per cent, and fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax will be lowered. We will go further. We will abolish payroll tax, one of the greatest imposts on employment, and we will review the depreciation allowance and income equalisation deposits as well as the fringe benefits tax and its effect on remote areas. I call on the Government to match these moves that are being made by the coalition, because those of us in rural Australia are in dire straits. The nation relies so much on rural Australia. It has a great future and its potential is enormous, but we do need government to do something to set up the framework to assist rural industries. (TIme expired)",42
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,Is the motion seconded? Mr Bruce Scott-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,43
33,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,Hinkler) (11.37 a.m.) Mr Deputy Speaker Mr MCGauran interjecting,43
34,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"The honourable member should not run away; I have something to say to him and all of his mates. At the outset, I think that all honourable members would endorse the motion moved by the honourable member for Riverina-Dar1ing (Mr Hicks) because he is a genuine member and I think he is genuine in his concern about agriculture. But what confuses me is that he would endorse the Opposition's policy not only on a goods and services tax but also on the policies that have supported drought rorts. In Queensland, of course, there was the worse debauchery that Australia has ever seen under the National Party Government of Queensland. But we have been accused over the last few weeks of not reading the Fightback! documentsMr MCGauran-It is not worth staying for this.",43
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will not talk in the aisles. He may not consider this an important debate, but other members do.",44
36,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"It is true that the honourable member for Gippsland is running away. So he should. I would like to quote from page 68 of Fightback! where it states: There are two major problems with a retail sales tax. A single stage tax is easier to avoid than a multi-stage tax. In addition, sales by wholesalers, manufacturers and others also go into final consumption. Furthermore, small businesses, farmers and others frequently purchase inputs at the retail level. It then goes on to say: Only a value added tax guarantees that business inputs for further processing and distribution are free of the sales tax. That is fine in essence, but in the Executive summary on page 5, where taxes on businesses are listed, it says this: rebate Goods and Services Tax paid on mostI repeaton most business inputs, including businesses competing with imports; It does not say 'all'; it says 'most'. That means that people are going to have to get an opinion from the Australian Taxation Officea decision, a ruling. It does not say 'all'; it says 'most'. So not only would we have the tax that we have to have, which those opposite want to introduce, but as well the statement is not clear in what it says. It says 'most'. That may not seem a big point, but it will become one over time when people start to think about it. The other thing that has not been thought out is what the cost is going to be to farmers and to business to implement this GST. There has been no costing on the cost of implementation. More than a million small businesses and farmers across the country are going to have to be tax collecting agents and are going to have to do increased paperwork just to comply with this redistribution of wealth from the bottom end of the market to the top end. We should look at what hils been said in the debate up to now and look at the problems that the GST will bring to farmers. I see that the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) is sitting in the chamber. He represents part of the Lockyer Valley, which produces primary products-fruit and vegetables-for the domestic market. Those producers are finding it very tough at present. Under his Party's policies they will cop a 15 per tax on their fruit and vegetables. When they sell their produce in the markets there will be a tax of 15 per cent levied at the retail end. That means that there will be less produce sold and that the 15 per cent at the top end will go into the pocket of the tax collection agents, not into the producers' pockets. That is what the Opposition will give to them. Worse than that, as the honourable member for Riverina-Darling said, many farmers are doing it tough at present. Some will not earn any income this year, but under the Opposition's GST they will pay 15 per cent tax. Mr Bruce Scott-Tax on what?",44
37,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,That is how much the Opposition cares for the primary producers. It showed how little it cared when its State National Party Government allowed a bunch of rip-off merchants to take $30m out of NDRA while farmers were going broke during the drought in 1988. Now it is going to throw a tax of 15 per cent on the same farmers. It ran out to the crisis rallies of 12 months ago and cried puppy dog tears. What is the Opposition going to give them for their time? A tax of 15 per cent. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting,44
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"The honourable member for Maranoa is going to speak in this debate, if he is still in the chamber.",44
39,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,The problem is that it has had it all its own way for so long because no-one has ever stood up and stated the real facts of the matter. In its own constituencies its has had its own way for too long. The other week in Maranoa I found that a lot of people were not aware of the wholesale sales tax exemptions-half a billion dollars that we have just introduced across the primary industry sector.,45
40,Mr LAVARCH,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,Have they heard of their member?,45
41,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"No, they have not heard of their member. They have asked me to send some pensioner kits, veterans' affairs kits other information to some of the councils. Of course they have not heard of the National Party. Who would want to hear of them after the sorry arrangement in Queensland?",45
42,Mr LAVARCH,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,That's right.,45
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,I will give the honourable member for Fisher the same warning.,45
44,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"The fact is that many farmers are not aware yet. If we on this side are open to criticism, perhaps it is because we have not actually told people about the exemptions we have brought in on wholesale sales tax. It is a good story. We have wiped out half a billion dollars in import costs. The Opposition is going to exempt what we have already exempted and then lob a 15 per cent tax on their shoulders. That does not make much sense for the rural sector. The honourable member for RiverinaDarling talked about exemption for fuels. Already half a billion dollars in diesel fuel rebate is there for primary producers out of a total of about $850m-plus in the last 12 months. I turn to roads and the argument about excise. It is often forgotten that about 3c a litre goes back into roads and road trauma. The other 3c a litre or thereabouts goes into health, housing and education, and into the aged, and into the HACC programs. I do not apologise for that, not one little We have to have world parity pricing. I have had to spend a lot of time arguing in the electorate because of the disinformation the National Party spread in Queensland about the virtues of world parity pricing. Without it we would not have the exploration and development of our own resources so that we can be strong and so that we can be less influenced by the behaviour of Middle East countries. Mr Beale-We have got world parity pricing.",45
45,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Of course we have. That is .what I have just said, if the honourable member would listen, the donkey. The problem is that the National Party has been spreading this disinformation for years. We have to point out the virtues of world parity pricing. That is a classic case in point; the and shadow Minister for privatisation, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), does not know which side of the fence he is on. I would hate to see him with the sheep and the cattle. Mr Beale-We have world parity pricing.",45
46,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Of course we have. I have just said that. Again the honourable member should listen. The real problem is that when it comes to real issues members of the National Party have two stories: one down here when they try to sound like statesmennot that they can-and one back home in their own electorates when it comes to squeezing out another vote, when it comes to trying to get preselection and maintaining their support of the League of Rights, the Ku Klux Klan without bed sheets, and the other looney tunes that run some of their branches. This is the problem that is affecting rural Australia today. All farmers want to know is the truth and the facts, not the gobbledegook that comes out of the Liberal Party and the National Party about the real problems that are affecting rural Australia. The other issue relates to imports. I do not all bar know how many times we have to keep saying in this House that we have a trade surplus with Asia and the Pacific Rim of $7 112 billion. I say to the clowns who want to put up tariff barriers and ban imported products, bit. 'Go out and tell the beef producers in the electorates of Maranoa and Groom, right across the State, that you want to dud our export industries. Go and tell the coal producers and the wheat growers that putting up the tariff barriers will help them'. It will not; we will lose a surplus of $7 1/2 billion. It would make it much easier if those on the other side of the House could put aside political expediency and put Australia first. They should stop talking Australia down, stop telling people what they may want to hear and tell them the truth. At the end of the day farmers really want to know the truth. Finally, the truth is getting out - on world trade, on the Cairns Group and on the GAIT. We have to have a win there and we have to fight for liberalised trade, not go down the track of protection. Now we come to the real debate in this House. The Clerks of the House may be bored with hearing the same words and rhetoric over and over again for 12 months, but we are going to keep going on about the effect that the goods and services tax will have on rural and regional Australia. There is another industry, apart from agriculture, that is very important in regional Australia. It is called tourism. We have some great opportunities in tourism, as I saw in Miles the other day and in Roma, Chinchilla, Barcaldine and Longreach. So what is the tourism industry going to get for its time under the conservatives? A tax of 15 per cent. If a yuppie from Melbourne or someone who has a pinstriped suit wants to go to Hawaii, their holiday is exempt. They can go to Hawaii and have a holiday and not pay 15 per cent. If they want to have a holiday in Australia, they have to pay it. Worse still, they have to pay it on fruit and vegetables, meat, milk and bread. I am sure that the honourable member for Groom will have an easy time in the Lockyer Valley telling his growers that they will have to pay 15 per cent on the necessities of life and put 15 per cent tax on their fruit and vegetables in the market, but a yuppie from Melbourne who wants to go on a holiday to Hawaii is exempt. If that is equity, backwards to Bourke. I would be pleased to walk backwards to Bourke if the other side were to abolish the stupid GST, which will have a bigger impact than the drought has had. (Time expired)",45
47,Mr TAYLOR,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Groom) (11.47 a.m.)Whilst the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) may wish to walk backwards to Bourke, he obviously did not address the motion before the House this morning-which is what I intend to do. I simply say to the honourable member that he should watch this space as far as the tax reform package is concerned. We are delighted to debate all aspects of that most commendable package. Our current rural crisis is arguably a crisis of the greatest proportions for 50 years, with a range of international commodity downturns perhaps unparalleled. This feeds into provincial centres, such as Toowoomba in my electorate, where people who service rural producers are no longer able to generate reasonable incomes. Undeniably, we are seeing a drastic wind-down in rural infrastructure both on and off farm. The mood out there in the bush is one of increasing desperation as the drought continues to bite and spreads beyond the worse hit areas of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Arguably, the cumulative impact of this drought is so profound that more than one in 10 of the farming community as we know it today may be forced off the land in the next two or three years. We have in prospect a slump in rural incomes of about 60 per cent over that period of time. This cannot continue without doing permanent damage to the rural sector and the economy as a whole. I agree with the recent comments by my coalition colleague the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) that this drought could push the economy into a depression unless urgent policy remedial measures are taken. Regrettably-and I have heard nothing from the honourable member for Hinkler this morning to indicate the contrary - the Government seems oblivious to the extent of the destruction of one of our greatest national assets, on which our economic well-being I will walk relies in very large part. I would simply like to say to those honourable members opposite, 'Let there be no doubt about it-we have a national disaster on our hands, not only in terms of its geographic spread but also at the individual family farm level and in terms of the many millions of dollars likely to be lost to our export revenue'. We need to avoid blinkered vision and the belief that the problem is a minor cyclical one, and should realise the extent of its potential to threaten our social fabric and further degrade our national economic performance. At the recent ABARE Agricultural Outlook Conference in Toowoomba the point was made that around 40 per cent of broadacre farmers are likely to have negative farm incomes this financial year and that almost half of all farm families had taxable incomes, including off farm incomes, of less than $10,000 last financial year, with prospects worsening. Regrettably, as the rural sector turns to this Parliament in general and this leaderless Government in particular, it finds few, if any, solutions. My colleague the honourable member for Riverina-DarIing (Mr Hicks) spoke in this place in April this year of the spiralling and unsustainable on-farm costs. Whilst it is clear that some farmers have extended themselves financially, very few people are seeking simply a government hand-out to redress their situation. This is the point we heard the honourable member for Hinkler make in Toowoomba last week. He talks about welfare. Farmers do not want welfare. They simply want to get on and do the job that, unfortunately, they are not being paid to do at the moment. What the farmers are looking for from the Government, with the support of this Opposition, is a reversal of a situation which has in large part been generated by a government that increasingly does not want to know the real situation. We have heard a lot of rhetoric from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in recent months and, to his credit, he is listening and attempting to come to grips with the problems. Mr Courtice-Tell the vegetable growers that - lor) go back Mr Beale-Tell the watermelon growers that. Goss is going to ruin the watermelon growers. Mr Snowdon interjecting",46
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Order! I do not want to interrupt the honourable member's last minute. I suggest that other honourable members, including the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, give him the opportunity to address the House.",47
49,Mr TAYLOR,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"However, much of the emphasis is rhetorical and seems to be on the periphery of the problem. Much of what has been achieved in recent months, in conjunction with the States, is simply window-dressing, a point which a number of Queensland ALP Ministers have also made. I simply say to the Minister, and to the honourable member for Hinkler in particular, that we need urgent action, not more confusing Cabinet rhetoric. Time is running out fast for many out there on the land.",47
50,Mr LAVARCH,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I welcome this opportunity to speak on the motion moved by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks). I know that the honourable member is genuine. I have heard him speak in the House on many occasions about concerns within his local electorate. However, I cannot allow to go unanswered the sorts of platitudes he has dished out to us today concerning the Opposition's so-called Fightback policy, more properly known as the Throwback tax policy. I have sat in this House for four years and listened to those opposite saying that this is a high taxing Government and that we should reduce taxes. What is the Opposition's solution for Australia's economic position? Impose a tax. That is all it is interested in. There will be a tax on every aspect of Australian life if the National Party ever got its way. Of course, it will not get its way. By the time we get to the next election it will have walked a million miles away from this policy. When the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and his Liberal colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Tayto their electorates, the reality of this package will start to sink in. The honourable member for Groom said that 40 per cent of farmers will have negative or extremely low incomes this year and, hence, will be paying no income tax whatsoever. But when it starts sinking into those people and they say, 'Look, I am not paying any income tax, but suddenly the Opposition wants me to pay tax on my food, tax on the clothes I put on my children's backs and tax on the bus fare that my kid has to pay to get to school', they will realise all the imposts this Opposition wants to put on them and they will walk away from the Opposition in droves. The honourable member for Groom and the honourable member for Maranoa had better be a bit worried about their respective positions when the true nature of this proposal is understood. Throughout the entire Australian 'society this tax will impact more harshly on Australians living outside the non-metropolitan areas-rural Australians. They are the people who will suffer most under this package. There are these great platitudes from those opposite: 'Look, we are removing a tax on inputs to business, which is particularly going to help our export industries'. Like the honourable member for Groom, my electorate has many primary producers-banana growers, tropical fruit growers and strawberry growers-but on the whole they produce for the domestic market. They are not exporters; they produce for the local market. There is no great benefit in terms of so-called hand-outs to exporters, but they get hit with the tax. They become tax collectors for the first time in their lives. The same party says, 'We will get the burden of Government off people's backs'. We are saying, 'You are now a tax collector'. They are saying, 'My crime is to be a banana grower, but now I am a tax collector, and I have to fill in all the forms and get it all right'. Many of them will not do it. The Opposition is saying that there is a certain policy which is going to crack down on the black economy. We say that it will contribute to it. These people will not bother to become tax collectors. They are not earning enough income to be paying income tax, yet they are going to be paying tax on everything they buy for their family. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling and his colleagues have the nerve to come in here and try to pretend that this package is going to be of some benefit for people in rural Australia. It will not be a benefit. It will be the biggest slap in the face that they have ever received. As that message is understood they will walk a million miles away from it. The honourable member for Maranoa will be joining the debate shortly. If the honourable member understands the package, I ask him to explain how this package will benefit the growers who produce in his electorate, the 40 per cent described by the honourable member for Groom who are not paying any income tax. How will it benefit those producers when they are paying tax on all their consumption? I ask the honourable member for Maranoa to explain that to me. He will not be able to do it because there is no explanation. It is a slap in the face. It is a kick in the guts to Australians living in rural communities. 1t will not be accepted by the Australian people. This Government looks forward to meeting the Opposition on the hustings to debate these issues.",47
51,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), unlike the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). They were right off the track. I think they were both very concerned about their prospects at the next election. At the recently augmented hearings the honourable member for Fisher was trying to gerrymander a seat at the next election. That appals me. That is exactly what he was doing. I was there and I could not believe what I was hearing. In the short time available I want to debate this issue. It is an indisputable fact that the agricultural sector has given Australians the quality and standard of life that they enjoy today. While our mineral industry has boomed in recent years, this is very much a finite resource. Australia has an abundance of land and resources that can continue in a productive capacity long after our mineral deposits have dried up. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling has said that many of these mines are still in operation and will go on for a long time. Ultimately, however, they will dry up. The present Labor Government is actively engaged in a policy to eliminate farmers. The latest ABARE figures suggest that the average farmer in Australia in the next 12 months faces a deficit income of $30,000, and this must send alarm. bells right across the nation. This has to be compared with what ABARE said only six months ago. It was then predicted that fanners would have a negative income of only $3,000. If this Government takes that sort of advice, I would suggest that it bring some private consultants into ABARE to get the real picture, because ABARE is obviously providing historical information. The question we have to ask ourselves and the question this Parliament must ask itself is: do we want an agricultural sector? ABARE's figures once again suggest that in the next four to five years we are going to lose 20,000 farmers from agriculture-they are going to leave the land. As we sit in this Parliament today, six will leave the land. They are leaving at the rate of six per day, even today. Mr Courtice-They will leave quicker with a GST.",48
52,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"This is a very good reason why we must reform the tax system in Australia. The scaremongering coming from the other side demonstrates that those in Government have no understanding and that they have not even read the full document. I wish they would before they come in here loudmouthing to Parliament. The most efficient farmers in the world are being forced off the land by nine years of Labor Party policy. Do we want an agricultural sector or not? Can Australia afford to lose the $13 1/2 billion in export income generated by the agricultural sector? The value of primary industries to the nation's economy is indisputable. As demonstrated by the motion put forward by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling, this side of the House acknowledges that agriculture does play a vital role in Australia's economy and in the well-being of all Australians. I want to mention the wool industry. The financial collapse of the Collinsville merino stud two weeks ago must be sending a shiver down the spines of the deregulation advocates on other side of the House. If we see further deregulation of the export of merino ramsMr Snowdon interjecting",49
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory!,49
54,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"The honourable member for the Northern Territory will have his say. I will tell him what our policy isour policy on the export of merino rams involves semen only. My concern is that the other side will introduce a policy which will allow merino rams and ewes to be sold overseas, which would mean that the entire Collinsville merino stud could be exported from Australia to another land and we would lose that stud forever. The Collinsville merino stud influences one-third of the Australian wool industry, and I believe that is too significant an influence to discount in a lighthearted way, as the other side of the House is doing. The wool industry this year will generate $3 billion worth of export income for Australia. That significantly improves the living standards of all Australians. It is a vital industry. I have much pleasure today, in the limited time. I have, in supporting the motion of the honourable member for Riverina-Darling. I think it is high time we paid more attention to the importance of our agricultural sector.",49
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,49
56,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,We should recognise its value to the Australian economy and to the well-being of all Australians-future generations as well.,49
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,Order! The honourable member's time has expired! I warn the honourable member for Maranoa. This is a limited time debate and he is taking up other honourable members' time with his improper behaviour.,49
58,Mr NEWELL,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I join my colleagues on both sides of the House in supporting this motion moved by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks). I also commend the fine work of my two colleagues on this side of the House in supporting the rural industries in their electorates, .as other members on this side of the House nave supported rural industries in their electorates. In my concluding remarks I will comment on how much support we can expect from some members of the National Party when it comes down to the nitty-gritty and to farming industries in general. In this debate some comments were made about the impact of the Fightback packageor the Throwback package, as the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) has indicated. It is of great concern to me that the ourable member for Riverina-Darling and others have indicated that there will be a transfer of the taxation burden from those industries involved in the export of primary products at this stage. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling did indicate how important they are to the Australian economy, and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) pointed out that from the near Asian region Australia receives the benefit of an approximately $7 billion trade surplus on agricultural products. The effect of the transferring of tax from one section of primary production to another will be horrendous. It will be transferred to the domestic side of primary production. The Opposition is saying, 'It doesn't matter about the domestic industries-we'll tax the daylights out of them'. At the moment the primary producers pay almost no tax, for a number of reasons which have been mentioned on both sides of the House. This is, regrettably, because of the economic conditions prevailing around the world at the moment. Under the Fightback package they will start paying tax at an enormous amount-some 15 per centon everything they buy. Under the present taxation system, much of the income the farmers are able to derive and the money their families are permitted to spend does not attract any tax. They will have to reduce their spending because 15 per cent will be handed straight across to the Government. There was much made of the proposed impact on fuel prices and the fact that the Opposition will very gratuitously remove some 26c of the fuel excise. At the moment, that excise is not paid by primary producers, however they will start to pay a 12 per cent goods and services tax on itMr CourticeFifteen.",49
59,Mr NEWELL,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Fifteen-and it will go up. It will have to go up because, as the honourable member for Fisher pointed out, it will contribute to a black economy. Not everyone will be interested in keeping all the paperwork and not everyone will be so nice as to come across and become a tax collector for the Government. Instead of having less than 100,000 people collecting sales tax, as we hon- have at present, somewhere near one million people will have to do the paperwork. If we multiply that by the hours of work that will have to be put in by primary producers, it is little wonder that they will start to reject that package as they see more of it. I have some very good primary industries in my electorate. Some of them are involved in export, particularly beef and sugar, but a lot of them rely on the domestic market. We should not rule out the domestic market. These industries, particularly fishing, macadamias, dairying and bananas, are most important to the economy of the north coast. With the impost of a 15 per cent goods and services tax, the domestic consumption of those products will fall. The industries will become tax collectors and their efficiency will be reduced. I said I would return in my concluding remarks to the real nature of the National Party and how it feels about the farmers and how it will protect them. I represent an area that was once a dairy farming area. It was once represented by the National Party. The Leader of the National Party at the time told dairy farmers, 'You either get big or get out'. He said to them, 'Get out of the industry. We don't want you farming'. That was the attitude the National party had. It did not care about the primary industries.",50
60,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is concluded. NA BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 September, on motion by Mr Webster: That the Bill be now read a second time.",50
61,Mr MILES,ABORTION FUNDING ABOLITION,"The purpose of the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1991 is to stop the payment of Medicare benefits for certain pregnancy termination procedures. This Bill has been before the Parliament for over three years-three years of procrastination, stalling, diversion and avoidance. Is it any wonder that the Australian people are crying out for leadership and guidance from their elected representatives when they cannot take a definitive decision regarding $7m or $8m annually that is used to fund a growth industry in the most unsatisfactory birth control mechanism in the world? Is it any wonder that Australian people are deeply concerned about the leadership in this social area of Australia? I do not believe it is, because here is a situation in which for three years this Parliament has procrastinated and avoided the issue. It did not want to debate it and now does not want to bring it on for a vote, because it cannot justify spending $7m or $8m a year on what is, as I say, the most unsatisfactory birth control mechanism in the world. Today, with the easy availability of cheap contraceptive measures, no leader should continue to provide government funding for the premeditated taking of the life of another human being. What kind of leadership do we have when the taking of life is assisted by governments? Disregard for the sanctity of human life has now reached the highest level of society, which now disregards the sanctity of life. We have lost our sense of decency and of what is important when the unborn is abandonedand that is exactly what is happening today. The leaders of this nation-all of us collectively-are abandoning the very heavy responsibility which we have for unborn children. But instead of getting bitter or emotional, or allowing a sense of despair to overcome us, we in this Parliament should start to show the compassion and courage that are required, by fe-establishing the value of respect for life, for procreation, for fathering and for mothering. Would it not be an exciting thing for the people of this country if they could look up to the people whom they have elected to see all of us espousing a very, very high regard, if not the highest regard possible, for life, for procreation, for the process of sexuality and sexual union, and to observe us uplifting these activities in our society and putting a great emphasis on the need for fathers to be dedicated to nurturing, fathering and caring and on the need for mothering and that kind of care? If we uplifted those traits in this nation, I am sure that many of the economic ills and budget problems which we face because of the massive fallout-the lack of fathering, the lack of mothering and the lack of respect for life--would not be anywhere near as severe as they are. Pregnancy should not in any circumstances command a surreptitious, hidden and unconscionable solution. It should command financial and emotional support-love, friendship and compassion-but at the moment we are divided as a society between accepting, on the one hand, that responsibility to care for, nurture and have compassion for the unborn and the mother in all circumstances and allowing, on the other, what I say is unconscionable-the taking of a young life. Is this great country of ours unable to show or incapable of showing that emotional support for which I plead? I do not believe so. But it is up to us to give to the community the lead that is necessary so that other people can follow. Today we have had a debate about the environment, and people have been passionate about the importance of the environment. Over the last decade, we have seen people passionate about saving whales, about the orange-bellied parrots, banded bandicoots, eucalypts, rainforests and staghorns. And that is quite proper. But what about humankind? Why is it in our society today that we can be compassionate about the animals and plants of this world but lack compassion for the possible new life of a human being? I believe that humankind was created to manage and to be good stewards of the world-and that includes the unborn. I do not believe future generations will regard us well if we are seen to have cared more for the bandicoot.s than for the babies-and that is exactly what is happening today in Australia. Only today in the Sydney Morning Herald many people probably would have noticed a headline 'Doctor suspended after botching abortions'. This is the difficulty we are faced with. We as a parliament are continuing to encourage these procedures in this country, and it is time we stopped that encouragement. Let me just illustrate what is occurring as a consequence of our allowing this procedure to go on in what we call our civilised society. This doctor's medical licence was suspended because he severed the arm of a foetus who later was born. Is that not a tragic set of circumstances, absolutely tragic? That particular incident occurred in another country, one in which this process goes on. But of course, that process, which we support as a parliament, goes on in our own country, and maybe there have been similar occurrenfund ces which could have been used as ilof lustrations. But today's paper today reports that a child was born without an arm because of a botched abortion. Can we allow this go on? I do not believe we can. debate in this Parliament only yesterday about the massacre in East Timor-about life, about the importance of life. We make a lot of it, we should. But why do we not show the same compassion and thought for the nurturing caring of the child in the womb? Sometimes in this Parliament we try to divide things up in the words that we use, and we split hairs. Maybe that is a consequence of having a lot of legal minded people here. They are important to the process, but believe that in this particular instance as civilised society we are indeed splitting hairs as we have never split them anywhere else. Let me illustrate the point. If we are doing vitro fertilisation with animals, we take living embryo and implant it at a very early stage, when there are eight, 10, 16 or 32 in the formation of the new animal. the essence-life begins at the point of fusion. There is no doubt about that. We all know that; yet here we reject it. (TIme expired)",51
62,Mr JOHNS,ABORTION FUNDING ABOLITION,"by leave-I thank the House, as I have spoken before on the Aborreadily tion Funding Abolition Bill, which is now before the House. I cannot support the Bill, but I do support this: Parliament should have a vote on the matter and dispose of it because it has gone on for a number of years. Each of us has views that each of us holds dear, and I do not think we can allow this debate to go on and on and on without the resolution of the Parliament. So I do agree with members opposite that we should bring it on and vote on the matter. However, the reason I object to the Bill is simple: State law determines the legality of abortion in Australia and, by and large, State law-or, at least, the judges' interpretation of that law-has determined that abortion is legal in Australia. My view-and I would bet the view of the majority of Australians-is that where there is a legal procedure Medicare should fund that procedure. What members are attempting to do by not having Medicare this procedure is impose a harsher view abortion than is the case under State law. This is a matter for State law. We should not override the interpretation of current State law to in Australia by suggesting that Medicare We had a should not fund abortions. Abortions under certain circumstances are legal in Australia. Those people who have to as make the very difficult decision to have an abortion are entitled, I think, to have Mediand care funding for that procedure. What I am saying is that women who have to make such a difficult decision should not, when approaching the abortion, have the added difficulty of paying the full cost of that abortion. It seems to me that this is a debate by I proxy. It is a debate that is really about a abortion itself. I understand the views held by those opposite, and I wish and hope that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will allow in us to bring on a vote in this place. I argue the that he should do so. I know that the vast majority of honourable members will support cells my view that we will not support abortion That is funding abolition. The essence of this is that Medicare funds most legal procedures-though not all; we know that. Abortion is a fundamental and important procedure; it is not one that is accepted by all in the community but it is an important and essential medical procedure, important to the well-being of women. If women make the decision, if their conscience allows them to have an abortion, then we have no business whatsoever in interfering in the matter. The question of the funding of abortions should never become a substitute for the question of the morality of abortions. If we want to debate the morality of abortions, let us have the debate, but let us not have it under the guise of the question of funding. I know people want to air the question of the morality of abortion and they do it by these means. That is a reasonable thing to do, but it is not a decent substitute. I make the point again that under State law, which controls the legality of abortion, abortion under certain circumstances is legal in Australia. We should not seek in effect to overturn that by removing Medicare funding of abortions. That would mean that the Australian Parliament would impose a harsher penalty, a harsher view, on the question of abortion than does any State government in this country. The proposition contained in this Bill is silly. We should not entertain it. We should have the vote in this place. We should let individuals decide. It is not a matter for parties but for individuals. If we had the vote, I think that would settle the matter at least some years to come.",52
63,Mr BROADBENT,ABORTION FUNDING ABOLITION,"This is a debate on the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990. I concur with the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) that it is time this Bill was brought before the House for a vote. I want to mention a couple of other things aboutithe honourable member's remarks. This Bill has regard for the fact that this Commonwealth Parliament has responsibility for Medicare. Medicare is not a State issue; it is the responsibility of this Federal Parliament. I also remind the honourable member for Petrie that this Bill has support on both sides of this House. It is recognised by many members of this Parliament that there is a tragedy continuing in our community. It is a tragedy that, with our hands, we fund. As we pass the Bills that come before this House, we fund, through Medicare, the abortions that take place under the sections provided in the legislation. We never have the conscience to remark that it is also legal to smoke and drink, but this House promotes and spend millions of dollars on health campaigns. The fact that it is legal in Australia to go through certain procedures does not mean that this House should turn away and wash its hands of what is an existing problem for families in Australia-a problem, I say sadly, daily. When I was elected to this House by the people of CorineIla, they knew exactly where I stood on this issue. I have never denied that I am pro-life. I also say to the honourable member for Petrie that it is some women, not all women, who will have their well-being threatened due to their pregnancy. Not all women have their well-being threatened. But do we deny that our medical fraternity has the ability or the discernment to judge when a patient is under threat? Have we not got the right to stand before this House and say, 'I am standing for the child, the unborn child, and I am standing for parents who have to deal with a most difficult decision'. I am also standing for the people with the seared hearts, the nurses and doctors who perform these procedures. We as Federal politicians have an input and here is an opportunity for us to say that we for stand against the funding of abortion through the Medicare system. We have a very good safety net. It is administered through our medical system, our hospital system, our doctors. Here is a chance for the members of this House to stand up and say, 'This is unacceptable in thi- nation'. I am sure the people who are so passionate at the AIDEX exhibition honestly believe that by their actions, by their protests, they are saving lives. We desperately need to save lives in the Australian community today. We must stop the deaths of so many unborn Australian children. It is time to turn the nation back and say, 'Let us have a good look at ourselves, because we can no longer go on with the death of unborn children through abortion'. If we have to draw the matter to the attention of the House through the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill and we are left no other option, that is the Wl,ly to do it. I believe that in State Houses ahd local government councils across Australia, and in this House, there are men and women prepared now to stand up for unborn children. When the time is right, I believe that this House will vote on the issue and that the Bill will be passed. It will send a signal to Australia that it is time to tum around on this issue. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I was given two minutes, and I have gone too long, but if it saves one unborn child it will have been worth every second. (TIme expired).",53
64,Mr CAMPBELL,ABORTION FUNDING ABOLITION,"I speak on the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill because if there is one thing that annoys me in society it is the hypocrisy and hyperbole with which we are constantly faced. People exhort us about the rights of the unborn child. Very little is spoken by these people about the rights of the living child. I have been involved in an abortion and I know just how traumatic it can be. 1\venty years later I still regret it. The other party did not feel the same way, and, since she was having the child, it was, in my view, entirely up to her. I think anything that takes away the rights of women in this case is clearly a reduction in their quality of life. I feel very strongly about it. What we are doing here by attacking abortion funding is, in my view, extremely cynical. Does anyone seriously think this will stop abortions in Australia? Of course it will not. It will mean that rich women get abortions while poor women either do not get them or are forced into backyard procedures. That is where we will get the botched abortions. The real risk to the life of the mother is in these backyard operations. It is abundantly clearand everyone knows it in their hearts-that if we stop this funding we will simply force abortion back into that dark age. We are exhorted about the quality of life. Because of cost, we are told, in society we do not do many things that would add immeasurably to life and would save life. For instance, it would certainly improve enormously the quality of life of a lot of children if we were to have a complete immunisation campaign for hepatitis B. At the moment the campaign is very selective and many children are at risk in society. We are told that the life of the unborn child is important. I do not want a technical argument about where life begins. There is no doubt that a cabbage is a form of life; it is the value that one puts on this life that is important. The reason that embryo transplants for stock are done at that early level is that it has to be done before they settle. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Unemployment",54
65,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"O'Connor) (12.31 p.m.)Today I grieve for a damaged national reputation for one million unemployed people within Australia. I grieve for the subsequent loss of living standards, and the huge loss of confidence and prestige that has occurred to many Australians who have been in the habit of supporting their own families and their own opportunities. It is a tragedy that has been very clear to us for quite some time. I am a great collector of articles that I think are important. In returning to my files a little while ago, I took out an article written in the Business Review Weekly on 16 October 1987 reporting the address of Professor Boris Schedvin of the Melbourne University, one of Australia's leading historians. In October 1987 he was warning Australia, warning the Treasurer of the country, presumably-if he bothered to read this article-of what we confronted if we did not do something about our economy and, most importantly, our growing foreign debt. There is a graph included in this particular article, which I have shown to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table. I seek leave to incorporate the graph in Hansard. Leave granted. The graph read as follows% 40 30 20 10 0, , , 1860 1880",54
66,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Professor Schedvin told this particular conference that there have been two occasions in practically the last century when the cost of servicing Australia's overseas debt exceeded 25 per cent of the value of our exports. The first occasion was during the late 1880s and early 1890s; the second occasion was in the late 1920s and early 1930s. We do not have to be told what that was as a situation in Australia. I will quote from a few places in this article: The accompanying chart prepared by Schedvin makes it clear that Australia is no stranger to indebtedness, and that its debt has been sustainable only when the annual level of debt service payable abroad remains less than about 20% of the annual value of exports. Schedvin argues that above the 20% level is a danger zone. When debt moves to more than 25% of exports, as it has in two notable episodes before now, the economy simply cannot afford it. At June 1987, Australia's debt-service ratio stood at 29.76% The alann bells were ringing, but typical this reactionary Government-I say 'reactionsponsored ary' as it has never taken any initiative of consequence in its nine-year history; it always reacted to the circumstances of the day-its reaction was to bury its head in the sand and, in Micawber-like fashion, hope that something would turn up. Of course, had listened to this noted economic historian, might have heard some of the other things he had to say. More importantly, in the end, article says: NA Australia's debt as a percentage of exports -----1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 Schedvin says that in the past debt levels approaching those we are experiencing now have been ""solved"" brutally and autonomously. ""It is hard to think of any previous occasion where policy had in fact produced much in the way of correction of debt. Adjustment to debt problems has always been resolved by lenders, or the market in general taking a sudden view about the unsustainable level of debt, he says. II ""In the 1890s the purgative was mass unemployment accompanied by severe market restructuring. In the 1930s we also had mass unemployment accompanied by something approaching autarchy, a withdrawal from the world economy. It was amazing, because Schedvin also says: This timeand he is talking about the 1980sthe increase in indebtedness has been remarkably rapid. The danger zone of a debt-service ratio over 20% was pierced more swiftly than in any other period, except possibly the mid-1880s. Between 1983 and 1985 we moved from 12% to 25%. These are the facts as presented to Australia of in that particular conference, which was by the IPA. These facts have been ignored by this Government, but they certainhas ly were not ignored by me. Madam Deputy Speaker, I think you have been in my company time and again in public speaking when I have warned about the growth of this debt it and what it will do to us. The historic it evidence of what will happen is still ignored and we are still in this situation. But we are the told that it is not a depression. It was a depression in the 1930s and it was a depression in the 1890s. We are told, 'There is some miracle about to happen. Don't you worry about that'. Yet all the evidence is, by that indicator alone, that Australia has huge financial problems. It is notable that in reading into the depth of articles quoting our new and possibly temporary Treasurer, Mr Kerin, he is often heard saying, 'Of course, we have not got the options of 1983 to fix the problem'. The option used in 1983 was massive borrowing by government and massive encouragement of the private sector to borrow by an irresponsible deregulation of the financial sector. I am not opposed to saying that deregulation was wrong; it was irresponsible in its application and, because it was reactionary, it seemed to be a good idea at the time. It is equally a problem that we had an irresponsible and reactionary deregulation and float of our currency. Nobody sat down and considered what might happen when we did it-a good idea applied incorrectly. What has happened is that we have become the spectators' darling. We see our currency at a massively high level-still pushing US80cwhen we have got a depression at home. The Aussie dollar is the share certificate of Australia. I would like to say , Australia Incorporated', but that has another meaning in Australia today. It means dirty government deals in Western Australia, and Victoria in particular. The Aussie dollar is our share certificate. Who would pay US80c for a share certificate in Australia after the mess that these people opposite have put us in because of their lack of financial management? The simple fact today is that each month 500 billion Aussie dollars change hands on foreign exchange markets; we need $8 billion to finance our normal trading activities. The rest is all funny money, shuffling backwards and forwards. We have very large institutions in the rest of world dictating to Australia what its currency will be valued at, because it is the value that suits them. Honourable members should remember that they are the repository of this $133 billion-they probably hold $166 billion, because $133 billion is the net figure of our overseas debt. Mr Wright-Whose overseas debt?",55
67,Mr TUCKEY,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,"Australia's overseas debt, created by the stupid economic management of those opposite because not one of them has a brain in their head. Mr Wright-Private sector overseas debt.",56
68,Mr TUCKEY,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,"Do not worry about that. I have mentioned how it happened. Those opposite are the controllers who let it happen. Of course, that is another aspect of the Professor's comments. He said: The bad news is that the 1980s share the classical symptoms of fundamental crisis, namely, a spectacular inflation of financial and property values, associated speculation, deteriorating terms of trade and very sudden acceleration of aggregate foreign debt. All those figures were available to honourable members opposite. They just could not see them. They are the regulators, they messed it up, and one million Australians are paying the price through unemployment and unhappiness to an outrageous degree. The point I make is that these decisions were bad. Honourable members opposite did not think that our Reserve Bank was unable to control the currency markets. Those people who hold our debt do not want our currency devalued, and they will not let it happen. One foreign exchange dealer recently thanked the Australian Reserve Bank for giving him some more cheap dollars to buy. He said it was good fun. That is the sort of problem we have, and that is what I grieve for todayabsolutely rotten economic management by the Government over eight years, taking all the wrong decisions at the wrong time and leaving a million Australians unemployed. The Government should not think it can escape the blame by blaming somebody else. (TIme expired)",56
69,Mr WRIGHT,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,"Capricornia) (12.41 p.m.) Approximately three months ago I was asked to chair a breakfast meeting in Rockhampton to hear a fellow called Jack Sonnemann from the Australian Federation for the Family. I was asked to go along simply to hear his presentation because he was arguing that children were at risk because of the availability, the visibility and the accessibility of soft pornographic publications throughout Australia. I went along, I suppose, with specific and built-in views because over a period of time. I have waged my own campaign against stores in my own area, one of which had edible condoms in amongst children's toys and cards in one of the shopping centres. Another newsagent sold comics that promoted incest and bestiality. So I have had an interest. When I went along I was somewhat surprised because what I suddenly saw at this meeting was a way around the problem, a very cheap and efficient way to protect kids. Jack Sonnemann was saying we needed to use blinder racks in our newsagencies and retail outlets. Soft porn magazines-and we can include all sorts in that, including Penthouse, Playboy and even Picture and People, as I will demonstrate as I speak-ought to be put up on high shelves with blinder racks so that kids cannot see them or easily access them. I went away from the meeting thinking about this. I thought it was a very good idea, so I took the matter up. We now have had a campaign in central Queensland that is spreading not only through Rockhampton but throughout the whole of Queensland. I put out a press release saying that the campaign was hoping to light a bonfire against the sale and exhibition of soft pornographic material and I was hoping that it would rage across the nation. Unfortunately, one of the journalists misunderstood this, whether intentionally or otherwise, and wrote that I wanted to bum and ban everything. He even misrepresented the issue to Terry O'Gorman, the President of the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties. But in a phone call to him, in the presence of Jeff Jones from the TLC, he indicated that he personally saw nothing wrong with what we were suggesting. The idea has caught on. Thousands of people have signed petitions that will go to the Premier, Wayne Goss, asking that we voluntarily have newsagents and retailers do this. It has the personal support of Wayne Goss. It now has the support of the Rockhampton City Council. In fact, the Council has now declared Rockhampton a porn free area for the visibility and accessibility of porn. We have had support from the Queensbrochure land Newsagents Federation, which says it been concerned for 18 months, and not cause of this campaign. It is now asking its newsagents to adopt the practice. The service station division of the Motor Trades Association of Queensland is now backing it. Churches, schools, community groups, P&Cs and the Central Queensland Consumers Association support it. In fact, the list goes on and on. I hope it will go further, on and on across the nation like a bonfire or like a bushfire. I hope it will rage and make people realise that our kids are at risk. I picked up the preamble to the Office of Film and Literature Classification, commonly know as the Film Censorship Board. It says: Our right to see what we please cannot be allowed to infringe the rights of others. Children and young people, in particular, must be adequately protected from material likely to harm or disturb them, and people who may be offended by certain material have a right to expect that it will not be thrust upon them against their will or without warning. That is what the campaign is about. It is saying that we need to protect our kids from those who talk only through their cash registers, that is, those who promote the porn of this nation. I am not having a go at newsagencies, because it has been innovative newsagents who have come up with an idea different from that in America. They recommend that instead of building in blinder racks, agents should simply put the magazines on high shelves so that the magazine in front hides the cover of the one behind-so simple; no cost. One newsagent did it because, with his staff, he had to go repeatedly through the comics because kids were coming into his stores, taking these magazines and going over near the comics to read them. When someone came along they would hide them amongst the comics. What he has done is put them on high shelves up front near the cash register. I hope that this innovation will spread because we are faced with a dilemma. The evidence that I have gathered needs a comsoft munity verdict. In fact, I have prepared a that I will send to all members. The has brochure contains 50 different case studies beand examples across the world that demonstrate that our young people are at risk because of the availability and accessibility of soft porn. What concerns me most is that the publishers of People magazine and Picture magazine say publicly, as they did in Rockhampton, that they are family magazines and ought to be displayed everywhere. The 18 September 1991 issue of the People magazine included a six-page glossy catalogue; it was an insert. It depicted group sex, two women in a lesbian act, a woman on her stomach pulling the cheeks of her bottom apart and explicit sexual acts. Yet the publisher of the magazine People said it was a family magazine. I also looked at some other issues and amazed. When this fellow said this publicly, he did not bother to tell the reporter that on the back of this very magazine was a fullpage advertisement about Disney World books featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. I wonder how we can possibly have a publisher promoting magazines that have this sort of rubbish between the covers when on the back cover Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck appear. Picture has done exactly the same thing. It is using what we call 'child magnets'. The children come along, pick them up and flick through them. One magazine has a pictorial depiction of a woman on her knees-I will not go into the full details of what she is doing-under the headline 'All she did was have an oral'. All she did was 'have an oral' and she was banned from having this prize on stage. Adults know what is meant by 'having an oral'. This is in the middle of a magazine sold in stores across Australia. What do we find on the back cover of the magazine? We find not just Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, but also Big Bird and Ernie, the Sesame Street characters, Dr Seuss and friends, such as the Cat in the Hat and so on. I say enough is enough and we ought to do something about. We do not want to restrict adults from seeing, reading or viewing anything, but let us go along with what the Office of Film and Literature Classification says. It says: Children ... must be adequately protected from material likely to harm or disturb ... The cases that I have gathered here come from all over the world. They come from all over Australia. They come from the police. I spoke to a superintendent of police in Victoria. Superintendent Mackievic. I spoke to Richard Read, who prepared major cases. There was the case of a 10-year-old boy who raped a 6-year-old girl after watching videos that his brother had. There are cases of unbelievable atrocities against women and children. A 1982 report from the Indiana University states: The findings showed that massive exposure to standard pomographyI am not talking about hard pornresulted in a loss of compassion towards women as I was rape victims and towards women in general. Another study was done in 1984 by the Delancey Street Foundation in San Francisco. Its report says: The study lent considerable weight to the claim that readers and viewers of pornography imitate what they see and read. A 1990 study carried out in Toronto, Canada, found: ... that mood disturbance increased significantly from the pre-exposure to the post exposure in the violent and non violent pornographic conditions. People in the study had been asked to watch all types of videos and slides of soft and hard pornography. The evidence is there. I say it demands a community verdict and that verdict ought to be to restrict-simply, cheaply and efficiently-the visibility and accessibility of these types of magazines in retail outlets. This can be done by putting them on high shelves. They should be displayed where kids cannot reach them and the magazine in the front should hide the cover of the one behind it. I suggest to the House that there is evidence not only around the world but even in this nation of ours that demonstrates there is a link between pornography and rape and a link between pornography and violence against kids and women. I would urge members of parliament everywhere and families to join in this campaign because it is not inhibiting any adults from doing what they like. It is simply protecting the kids. It is saying that we have a responsibility to do something about this. We have a responsibility to women and children and we can so simply do it. I urge communities everywhere to join in this campaign with Rockhampton, Gladstone, Bundaberg and Central Queensland generally. Let us light a bushfire; let us have a bonfire that sends a signal to these porn pushers, those who speak through their cash registers, that we will not have any more to do with it. We are going to protect our kids because the evidence is there-I believe that evidence demands a community verdict. Mr Mark Leibler",56
70,Mr FORD,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,"It has come to my attention that a leading taxation lawyer and respected member of the Jewish community has been subject to personal attack from a member of this Parliament under privilege. As Mark Leibler has no other redress against the comments made about him in this place, I take the opportunity to place on the parliamentary record a letter from Mr Leibler which gives his response to comments which have been made by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). Mr Leibler has a house in Frankston in the heart of my electorate. It is a pleasure to place his letter on the record. The letter reads as follows: Dear Mr Ford, I confinn that on three recent occasions Mr Ken Aldred launched personal attacks directed at me from the floor of Parliament. Mr Aldred enjoys the protection of absolute privilege which effectively denies me legal redress in respect of his overt acts of defamation against my character and reputation. Mr Aldred alleges that my activities as a taxation lawyer put me ""in a position of acute conflict of interest and potentially compromise the integrity of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)"" because of the allegedly ""enonnous influence"" which I wield as a member of three I'key tax advisory bodies"". In summary, the activities identified by Mr Aldred are as follows: (a) In common with virtually all tax practitioners, I have, on occasion, tendered advice to clients in relation to proposed arrangements which are quite legal but could reasonably be labelled as ""tax avoidance"" or ""tax minimisation. (b) I have, on occasions, differed with the Commissioner of Taxation on his approach to particular tax avoidance problems. (c) I have not hesitated to make representations to tax officers at an appropriate level of seniority where, in my view, Tax Office activities were open to criticism. (d) My finn has sought access to certain Tax Office documents under the Freedom of Infonnation Act. (e) Whilst I respect and admire those who are responsible for the conduct of our tax administration, there have been some exceptions who have been the target of criticism from myself and others. (t) I have been publicly critical of certain allegations made by the Martin Committee. (g) I have passed on advice to shareholders in particular companies spelling out the impact of those provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act which relate to capital gains. All of the foregoing activities are of the kind that one would usually associate with the professional work of a taxation lawyer. Any suggestion of ""conflict of interest"" can only be attributed to Mr Aldred's deliberate attempt to discredit me by distorting the role of the representatives of the various external bodies on the Commissioner's Advisory Panel, the National Tax Liaison Group and the Capital Gains Tax Subcommittee. As Mr Aldred well knows, the relevant advisory bodies to the Commissioner of Taxation serve merely as a conduit through which the Tax Office receives input from a variety of professional, tax practitioner and industry-based groups. Full and detailed minutes of the proceedings of meetings of those bodies are published. Tax advisory bodies are not possessed of any statutory authority and the Commissioner of Taxation is free to reject any advice given. The Commissioner of Taxation understands that those representing tax practitioner groups on these bodies wiIJ continue to represent their taxpayer clients in disputes and litigation with the Tax Office. Indeed, the whole point of external representation on these bodies is to allow for a free flow of ideas, information, feedback and suggestions from the Tax Office's clients (ie taxpayers) to the Commissioner of Taxation. It is precisely because of my credentials, to quote Mr Aldred, as ""a taxation lawyer of long standing"", that the Law Council of Australia (not the Commissioner of Taxation) has seen fit to nominate me as its representative on the relevant advisory bodies. This is a role which, according to the Taxation Institute of Australia, can only be filled by an experienced tax practitioner. Given this context, there can be no question of a conflict of interest. As a member of these advisory bodies I do not receive any remuneration whatsoever. I do, however, devote a considerable amount of time to providing constructive input on issues relating to the administration of our taxation system. For example, oVer recent months I have been consulting closely with the Victorian Law Reform Commission on a pilot project involving a plain English redraft of a selected part of the Income Tax Assessment Act. At the same time, I have been spending many hours at home-and many days in Canberra-working with senior tax officers and other representatives of professional bodies on the detail of the Government's proposals for introducing a system of full self-assessment. The Commissioner of Taxation and I do not agree on everything. However, I believe that the Commissioner would readily confirm that, over a period of years, I have made a constructive and welcome input on a range of issues relevant to tax administration in this country. Any ""influence"" which those representing various external groups have been able to exert is totally unrelated to their length of service on the relevant taxation advisory bodies. Such influence, to the extent that it exists at all, is solely related to the ability of the representatives in question to put forward solid, constructive and sensible arguments which stand up on their own merits. Indeed, that is precisely the function of persons appointed to represent external groups on the National Tax Liaison Group and the Commissioner's Advisory Panel, and that is precisely the sort of input which the Commissioner of Taxation welcomes. Is Mr Aldred seriously suggesting that I have some special ""hold"" or ""influence"" over the Commissioner of Taxation? Such a suggestion is not only ridiculous but is also clearly offensive in that it directly challenges the integrity and credibility of the Commissioner of Taxation. Contrary to what was alleged in Parliament by Mr Aldred, the Law Council of Australia has never dissociated itself from anything I have said or done on its behalf. Indeed, in a letter to me dated 24 October 1991, the President of the Law Council, Mr David Miles, makes the following observations: ""I appreciate that you are fighting to protect reputation with one hand tied behind your back when Mr Aldred is continuing to use the shield of Parliamentary privilege. Much has been made of your membership of taxation advisory bodies. On two of those bodies, the National Tax Liaison Group and the Commissioner's Advisory Panel, you are the nominee of the Law Council of Australia pursuant to an invitation by the Commissioner to the Law Council to nominate a representative. The Law Council greatly appreciates your long and committed service on a voluntary basis in the very important area of taxation law. Your work over two years as Chairman of the extremely busy and highly regarded Taxation Committee of the Business Law Section was invaluable. Your appointment by the Law Council as its representative on the above advisory bodies reflects the high regard in which you are held as a senior and highly experienced practitioner in taxation law. I trust that you will not be discouraged from continuing to serve the Law Council of Australia, and thereby Australian taxpayers, by Mr Aldred's utterances in Parliament. Mr Aldred's allegations are both outrageous and unsubstantiated. My role on the various taxation advisory bodies and my ""record over an extended period"" have never placed me ""in a position of acute conflict of interest"" or in any way ""potentially compromis[ed] the integrity of the ATO."" On the contrary, my record over a period of years can fairly be described as one of constructive input into the on-going problems of tax administration in this country. The Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson, has confirmed to me in a letter dated 2 October 1991 ""that Mr Aldred's statements were made independently and did not represent a position taken by the Opposition as a whole. Mr Aldred's unjustified personal attacks on me do him no credit and undoubtedly will be treated with the contempt they deserve. I have challenged Mr Aldred either to withdraw his offensive and baseless allegations or to repeat them outside the protection of Parliament. So far he has declined to do either. In the circumstances, I ask that steps be taken to ensure that the truth of the matter is incorporated in the Parliamentary Record. Yours sincerely, Mark Leibler AO I have met Mr Leibler but I do not know him well. However, my colleagues who have known Mr Leibler over the years speak of him in the highest teons with respect to his your competence and integrity. Accordingly, while I cannot vouch for the authenticity of what is contained in Mr Leibler's letters, I have no reason to doubt that he has done anything other than represent those committees correctly and that the unprovoked attacks on him by the honourable member for Deakin are unfounded. The honourable member for Deakin has, on a number of occasions, used the privilege of this House for personal attacks which he has not been prepared to repeat outside. He has not been prepared to do it in Mr Leibler's case. This further leads me to conclude that his charges against Mr Leibler cannot be substantiated. (Time expired) Fightback Package",59
71,Mr BEVIS,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,"As each day has passed since last Thursday and the opportunity to examine the Opposition's tax package has increased, we find more and more areas of doubt, question and camouflage in the package which it has put before the Australian people. I want to address a couple of those areas which those opposite in the Liberal and National parties have avoided commenting on throughout that period of time. Central to the Opposition's platform is a GST as a replacement for the wholesale sales tax system that we currently have. That wholesale sales tax system has a number of features that commend it to the population and to the Parliament. However, I would like to draw attention in particular to the fact that in the coverage that has been given to date on this matter there has been a superficial assumption that wholesale sales tax levied at the rate of 20 per cent increases the cost of goods more than the GST levied at 15 per cent. I will not talk about this in detail because I had the opportunity to refer to some of these matters in a debate earlier in the week. However, I do wish to point out to the House the comments of the Indirect Tax Manager of KPMG Peat Marwick, Mr Robert aIding, as reported in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of last Friday: He said items presently sales taxed at 20 percent or 30 percent would not necessarily fall in price. This was because sales tax was levied on the retailer's purchase price, whereas the goods and services tax would be levied on the retailer's selling price, which is higher than the purchase price due to retail mark-up. The other day in the House I gave a number of examples which identified that difference. I wish only on this occasion to make reference to a couple of those which relate to vehicles. Of course, there is a wholesale sales tax on vehicles which the Opposition says it will abolish. However, the tax regime that this Government has in place ensures that the tax on vehicles which the ordinary person buys is kept at a minimum. The tax on prestige vehicles is at a much higher rate. So a person who purchases a standard family vehicle such as a Ford Falcon or a Holden Commodore for $24,000 to $25,000 would receive a GST benefit of about $100 on the purchase of that vehicle. If one bought a small four-cylinder car like a Mazda 323, the saving would barely be $75. However, where the real saving comes into play is for those prestige vehicles that are in the above $45,000 bracket. For example, if one were to buy a Mercedes-Benz 300E there would be a saving of nearly $7,000, which is a substantial cut in tax revenue afforded by the Opposition to the rich. Similarly, if one were to buy a prestige vehicle such as a Porsche or a Ferrari there would be a saving of up to $15,000. What is more stark, though, is the contrast with second-hand vehicles where, at present, there is no tax whatsoever levied by the Commonwealth. The Opposition policy would introduce a goods and services tax on those second-hand vehicles and increase the cost of that second-hand car to the average Australian, who in most cases purchases a second hand vehicle, not a brand new, off-the-showroom-floor car. That, of course, leads us to the point of tax free goods generally. There has been a good deal of publicity about the fact that most supermarket items are tax free now, but will not be under the Opposition's policy. I do not propose to go into those now, given the time constraints on me. This also leads us to the question of services-which are currently tax free but which will be subjected to a GST of 15 per cent-such as bus fares, theatre tickets, football game tickets and so on. Yesterday, somebody dubbed this tax, I think quite appropriately, the 'Midas tax'; everything one touches is taxed. It will be remembered by the people of Australia when they review this in 18 months time. Every time they put their hands in their purses or wallets the hand of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will go in with it. What I want to look at is not just the wholesale sales tax debate; I want to look at a couple of the issues that the Opposition has carefully avoided in its presentation of the package. I will come to education shortly-I hope the !shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), will still be in the House. Firstly, I will go to the question of road user charges. The Leader of the Opposition is quoted in today's press as reiterating the Opposition's view that it will drop the Federal excise on fuel and that there will be no Federal road user charge. The Leader of the Opposition has chosen his words carefully by saying that his party will not impose a Federal government road user charge. However, there is absolutely no doubt about the Opposition's policy, should it be given the opportunity to introduce it. Page 82 of the main volume of the Fightback! document states: The incoming Coalition Government, therefore, request the newly established National Road Transport Commission to review a national system of road user charges to apply following implementation of our tax reform package. It goes on to state: The overall level of road user charges and road people. expenditures will be the responsibility of the National Road Transport Commission. The document clearly commits the Liberal Party and the National Party to the introducand tion of a road user charge which is currently under consideration by the States and the Commonwealth. In choosing his words carefully, the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite are seeking to deceive the Australian public playing with words. They may well introduce a charge which will not be levied by the Commonwealth, nonetheless it charge authorised by an instrumentality set by this Parliament and either levied directly by that instrumentality, by this Parliament or through the instrumentalities of the The level of that user charge has been costed by the State and Commonwealth authorities need investigating the matter presently a litre which is, coincidentally, roughly savings that the Opposition claims will made in the price of petrol. In contrast, the Government has committed itself to the road user charge but pointed out quite clearly that it will be offset against the current excise duty so that there will be increase in the petrol pump price. The major part of the Opposition's claim on road charges and on petrol prices is a deception; it is a deception and fraud which will not be sustained in the 18 months ahead. There is, in fact, an even greater deception that has been put upon the people of Australia in this package. That deception goes to the very heart of people's take-home pay and their wages. I might add that the document is a 700-page epic that has been constructed in a very user-unfriendly way. It has been constructed quite deliberately to require people to go from section to section to section, rather than looking at particular issues in to to. It is not, in fact, designed to encourage people to go through it at all. Rather, it is designed in will the hope that people will take the superficial view put by those opposite and look no further. Let me tell the Opposition that that will the not be the situation. The document will be subjected to scrutiny not only by this Government and this Parliament but also by the Let us look at what the document actually says about wages. It projects an outcome for the rest of this decade of zero real growththat is the optimistic estimate. It means a wage freeze on all Australian workers to the year 2000. That is, in fact, the best that the workers of Australia can hope for under the Liberal Party and National Party package. On this point I also refer to an article in the by Australian Financial Review of Friday, 22 November. Under the heading 'Strategy on jobs relies on wage cuts', the Financial will be a Review reported this: up A cut in real wages underpins the coalition's strategy for winding back the dole queues and restoring 'full employment' by the tum of century. States. The article went on to say: However, its entire strategy is founded upon the for 1.8 per cent fall in real wages over the at about 16c rest of the decade. the The people of Australia have not been told be that by those opposite. They have not been told that the Opposition's plan for their incomes is, at best, to freeze their salaries until the end of this century or, under one of its other scenarios, to reduce their incomes in no real terms by 1.8 per cent. That deception which is buried in the Opposition's document user will be exposed in the months ahead. I tum t6 the question of education because education has been trumpeted as one of the great winners of the GST package. Again, when one turns to the documents on education and looks at the supplementary papers, one has to go through the three volumes to actually get the full gist of what the Opposition is on about. But, having done that, one finds that instruction in courses which are part of a program to develop or enhance students' occupational skills will be included in the zero rating. I ask the Opposition shadow Minister at the table: what is the Opposition going to do to the inputs which are now tax free? All the items that are purchased by schools-the equipment and facilities which the schools purchase and which this Government exempts from tax-the Opposition will impose a GST on. The inputs into the school system will be taxed by the Opposition, and that will not be appreciated by the education community. (Time expired) Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Earlier today the honourable member for O'Connor sought to incorporate a table in Hansard and I said that I would get advice from Hansard on its suitability. I am informed that it is technically possible to incorporate the graph, and it will appear at the point where the honourable member for O'Connor sought leave to do so. However, the reproduction will not be as clear as the graph supplied. Higher Education",61
72,Mr ANDREWS,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,"I am sure the graph incorporated by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) will be a lot clearer than what we have just heard from the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). I am pleased that the honourable member for Brisbane noted that this was a Midas tax. Of course, Midas was the one for whom everything he touched turned to gold. That is what will happen under this tax package. The people of Australia will be better off with more money in their pockets. I am also pleased that the honourable member for Brisbane mentioned education, because I wish to speak about the screaming spires of higher education, which might be subtitled 'The Revenge of Dawkins'. The antics of the present Government are like something out of an afternoon soap opera, except that the latter is better acted. Will the tempest-tossed lovebirds, Hawkey and Keating, ever kiss and make up or is their house about to be torn asunder? This Government lurches from crisis to crisis, each of its own making. The crisis in our tertiary education system is due to the overwhelming of facilities by a flood of students who have not been able to obtain work. For some 18,000 students, there are not even the places for them to be able to stand or sit in lecture theatres-if they are lucky enough to be able to get in-to take notes. The strain on our laboratories and libraries is not something which can be said to improve the quality of education. In fact, this Government has no interest in the three Rs; for the Government, it is the four Bs which it constantly exercises its fervid imagination with. This is a Government of blunder, of bludgeon, of bluster and of brochures. If you make a blunder, then you bluster that the Opposition has got it wrong. You bludgeon your policy into operation and then you publish a nice glossy brochure, produced of course with the bounty of the taxpayer, in which you couch in beautiful cliches the sort of policy that you want to blunder through. Just as patriotism is all too often the refuge of the scoundrel, as Samuel Johnson once said, so bluster is the resort of the Billy Bunter bully. Not to put too fine a point on it, education policy, since the advent of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) in 1987 as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, has the tread marks of armoured tanks and jack boots written right across it. The spires of academe no longer dream, if they ever did. They scream in pain at the nightmare imposition of bureaucratic centralism by the champagne socialists of this Government. The buzz bluster is 'the clever country'. It is indeed apt that the original meaning of the word 'clever' is 'vicious' and it is related to a word which means 'expert in seizing'. Its current meaning tends toward the smart alec. Alfred Deakin's prescient observation about Federal-State relations that purse strings governs Australia has no more obvious manifestation than in the organisation of higher education in the past five years. The history of higher education over these past years reflects an increasing concentration of power, not only federally but particularly in the the hands of the Minister himself. This drive tion. towards the centralist, coercive, corporatist control of higher education is the abiding feature of the Dawkins era, which unhappily is not yet dead except in the quality of its conceptualisation. The Dawkins conceptualisation makes higher education nothing more than an amalgam of through-put, input and output, a mere species of industry and subject to the same mercantilist management. Let us review the emergence of this prosaw cess. The Commonwealth assumed full finanand cial responsibility for education in 1974 part of the expansionist dreams of empire the then Whitlam Government. But the Unieducation, versities Commission, as it was then-later the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Comners: mission-was a salutary buffer between the dreaming spires and the new red bricks attending amongst the brolgas, and the Government. The triennial reports of the Commission which existed at arm's length from the ernment, liaison with State bodies and the resultant public discussions promoted dialogue between the tertiary sector and the Governforce. ment. That dialogue is virtually non-existent today with communication consisting chiefly of fiats from Canberra. In place of the mous Schools Commission and Tertiary Edution, cation Commission, the Minister created his own creature, the small, exclusive National Board of Employment, Education and Trainthe chaos. ing, with understaffed sub-councils for schools and higher education. In The Challenge of Higher Education Australia, Minister Dawkins laid down the gauntlet to academia and followed his green and white papers. Dawkins's attack on the universities has united academics from the right through to the left of the political spectrum. The left-wing professor of English literature, Stephen Knight, commented in The Challenge Ahead that the only model offered for what Australia should become was South whoever holds the Korea. He said: What the Federal education ministers and their powerful advisers want is a one-day cricket version of university education-quick, garish and profitable-without its own history and without its own organic development and above all, not allowing time that is crucial to let something mature whether it is a double century or a powerful educaAccording to the Dawkins's blueprint for creating an Albania of the south, existing institutions were made megalithic through amalgamation in order to be easier to control centrally. The number of tertiary institutions was reduced from 76 at the end of 1989 to just 36 at the beginning of 1991, achieved largely through threatening the funding of the reluctant partners. The binary divide which the happy co-existence of the universities the colleges and institutes of technology as was destroyed. Instead, we now have combiof nes of universities and colleges of advanced some of which are geographically far removed from their forced marriage partall this in the simplistic belief that if somehow the old college or tech that you are is called a university, you will get a university level education and status. This Labor Government is hooked on names and Govimage creation. Never mind the substance. People doing university courses en masse do not automatically make for a skilled work Japan, for example, has proportionately much less of its youth in university education. As for the savings which we were told-most autonoimprobably-would occur due to amalgamathe reverse has often been true. The creation of multi-campus universities requires a new layer of middle managers to coordinate In 1987, DEBT made the projection that the Lincoln Institute-La Trobe University amalin gamation would save $1.4m a year. La Trobe University says the actual cost to the univerthis with sity to date is $3m. According to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, Professor Fay Gale, the Government has a misguided notion of equity. She says that the Government confuses equity with uniformity of outcome. Professor Gale says that real equity, rather than the pretend Labor version, is about 'giving the best opportunities to people who should have those opportunities, who need them and want them and could make use of them'; that is, opportunity should be provided to the most able people, regardless of wealth, race or class. Notwithstanding the Labor rhetoric, the Australian Council for Educational Research report commissioned by DEET found that the gap in university enrolment between students from the poorest and wealthiest backgrounds actually widened by 13 per cent during the 1980s. The participation rate gap between students with poorly educated parents and those with highly educated parents has more than tripled in the past decade. This Governrnent has failed to monitor the effects of its clawing back of money from the universities. It simply does not know what effects its policies have had; nor has it shown itself willing to consider alternative financing arrangements. The Minister has dismissed out of hand, for example, the concept of vouchers, even though there is widespread support for that idea. The universities are the repositories of our civilisation. The social orderliness of this country is thought to have much to do with the influence and popularity of the humanities taught within their walls. By far the biggest increase in participation in the institutions of higher learning has been by women. In the last 10 years female enrolments have shot up by 91 per cent, compared to 25 per cent for men. Fifty-eight per cent of women are enrolled in arts and education courses. Their courses, according to the Dawkins theory of imminent economic return, are supposed to get short shrift. Professor Knight tells an anecdote: Mr Dawkins was at the university a few years ago and was asked why the humanities were not being treated better. 'Not so', he said, 'we are doing a lot for the humanities. We are putting a lot of money into businesses studies'. For this Governrnent, words no longer mean anything and individualism and creativity are merely messy nuisances that have to be harnessed and suppressed in the interests of Big Brother confonnity and mass mediocrity. This is the vicious and smart alec Australia to which this bankrupt Governrnent is leading us. Child Support Agency",63
73,Mrs CROSIO,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,"My grievance today is to do with the Child Support Agency, an organisation which we are all aware has been operating within the Australian Taxation Office since June 1988. Before I begin on my grievance, I would like to commend the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) for some of his honesty in his statements. But when he previously heard his colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) describe his concerns about another colleague, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), I was quite amazed he did not bring that to the forefront. I thought, 'Finally, we are going to get some honesty from the Opposition about what is happening on those benches.' My grievance concerns the Child Support Agency and I will give some background information about that Agency. In 1986 the Governrnent announced its intention to undertake a major reform of the child support and maintenance system within Australia. This announcement marked the end of a debate which had been going on sinGe the early 1980s considering the faults of the existing system and the urgent need of reform. In 1980, a parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act recommended the creation of a maintenance collection and enforcement agency. This recommendation was endorsed by the report of the national maintenance inquiry in 1984, which made detailed recommendations for the creation of a national maintenance agency. In 1985 a ministerial committee was set up to develop governrnent policy in this area. Finally, in 1986 the Government proposed to introduce a system of formula based assessment of maintenance administered by a Child Support Agency attached to the Taxation Office. Collection of maintenance was to be through the withholding of payments at point of payment of wages or salary, wherever possible. I might add that prior to the introduction of the Child Support Agency only 30 per cent of child maintenance was paid at all and the few available statistics indicate that very little of this was paid regularly. It was apparently accepted practice for the children of separated families to be supported from the public purse through the social security system, with some top-up in the form of child maintenance. Following the inception of the Child Support Agency, about 70 per cent of all liabilities registered with the agency are now paid. The average level of court ordered maintenance per child per week rose from $27 in April of 1988 to $39 in June of 1991. The average amount of assessment per child per week for 1991-92 is $50. There are more than 90,000 sole parent pensioners declaring receipt of maintenance and this number continues to rise by some 1,000 a month. This saved the taxpayer $56m in sole parent pension pay-outs last financial year alone. The percentage of sole parent pensioners declaring maintenance rose, I am pleased to say, from 25.6 per cent prior to the scheme to some 37 per cent now. Each month the Child Support Agency collects and distributes $12m in child support payments. Despite the fact that the CSA has obviously improved the system of gathering maintenance payments and ensuring these payments reach the children in need of them, there are still a number of problems with this relatively new Agency. The Agency, I believe, is too far advanced now for me to call these problems teething problems, yet I sincerely hope that they can be quickly addressed and rectified. Before I cite the particular case of one of my constituents which deeply concerns me, I would like to share some statistics with the chamber. According to the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman's annual report, which was tabled in this place yesterday, the CSA was the source of the fifth largest number of complaints received by the Ombudsman in 1990-91. Telecom and the Department of Social Security had the dubious honour of being the sources of the most complaints overall to the Ombudsman, but when we consider the number of people affected by these two bodies in comparison to the number of people affected by the CSA, we realise there must be something wrong for a body of this nature to be receiving so many complaints. I realise that the staff of the Child Support Agency have an extremely stressful job, having to deal with highly emotional issues of relationship breakdowns and maintenance payments to children of these relationships. But surely something could be done about the number of complaints about the Agency which have now been raised with the Ombudsman. According to the report, the total number of complaints received by the Ombudsman's Office about the CSA rose from 330 in 198990 to 922 in 1990-91. Of the 163 written complaints that were finalised during the year, 136 were investigated, with 83 per cent of those resolved in favour of the complainant and 17 per cent in favour of the CSA. Of the oral complaints that were received and finalised, 76 per cent were resolved in favour of the complainant and 24 per cent in favour of the CSA. The report stated: By early 1990 it was apparent that there were significant administrative problems within the CSA. Large numbers of payees complained about delays in registering maintenance agreements and orders, in collecting arrears of maintenance, and in commencing deductions from payers' salaries. Others complained about CSA staff failing to return telephone calls or answer correspondence. Obviously the Child Support Agency has a lot of pressure on it, with some 135,000 cases currently registered. and 1,100 new registrations a week. Also, admittedly, the CSA has the highest collection rate in the world for a child support scheme and is now, as I stated, paying out some $12m a month to children. One of the main reasons for this high collection rate is that the CSA is part of the Taxation Office and has access to a wide range of taxation information. Currently, 30 per cent of the child support debt remains uncollected; the reason that 22 per cent of this amount has not been collected is that the payer is still being traced. The information available to the Child Support Agency from the Tax Office is used in its attempts to trace non-custodial parents to make them pay maintenance. It is this access to the Taxation Office information that I am most concerned about. The CSA has access to employment declarations, which are the forms that everyone fills out with a tax file number when commencing a job. These forms provide the Child Support Agency with up-to-date employment information to enable it to trace delinquent noncustodial parents. What happens, however, if the information the CSA takes and uses from the tax office is incorrect or, worse still, belongs to the wrong person? In September of this year one of my constituents came to me because he had been in receipt of a number of letters from the CSA demanding that he pay in excess of $4,000 in maintenance payments. The letters stated that, if he did not pay the required amount by the date specified, the money would be deducted from his pay. The letters also said that he would be required to pay 20 per cent of the amount owing as a late payment penalty. There was one major problem with all this - the Child Support Agency had traced the wrong person. It took my constituent a number of visits to the local CSA office, and representations from me, before the CSA would do anything about his problem. He was also required to submit a statutory declaration saying who he was, when he was born, whom he was married to and what children he had. My constituent is on a low income. He had to forfeit a day's wages to make his visit to the CSA office. Even after the CSA admitted to him over the counter that it was a case of mistaken identity, he received another letter asking him to pay maintenance a week later. Consequently, I made written representations to the Minister responsible. Earlier this month, following a briefing by the CSA Child Support Registrar, I approached Senator Bob MCMullan's office to get some more answers. During that briefing my constituent's story was related to the representatives of the CSA and my office was advised that a formal and written apology should have been forthcoming from the agency and that it would follow this case through on behalf of my constituent. I am appreciative of the help that I received from Senator MCMullan's office and, with the matter being investigated, I was assured that answers to my questions would be found. I was particularly concerned to find out that it was definitely a case of mistaken identity and I then inquired as to what checks and balances were used by CSA to ensure that it was chasing the right person before beginning to send letters to him requesting money. I also wanted to find out what checks and balances were used by the Australian Taxation Office before giving the CSA my constituent's tax file number and if issuing the tax file number of the wrong person for such a purpose was a breach of privacy provisions. I am still very curious as to why there has been no formal or written apology sent to my constituent. My further investigations found that the CSA has confirmed that it definitely was a case of mistaken identity. It did not think it was necessary to put a confirmation of this mistake or an apology in writing to my constituent because, after all, he had been told that information over the counter-a lot of help that was to his wife and family. The CSA admitted that the officer handling the case should have looked more closely at the details of my constituent before using his tax file number. I believe action should be taken in this matter. (Time expired) Fringe Benefits Tax",65
74,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,"My grievance concerns the levelling of a fringe benefits tax on rural and remote Australia. A fringe benefits tax is imposed on the value of certain perceived benefits provided by employers to their employees. Under many Queensland State awards the provision of free food and accommodation is mandatory. Free board, or keep as it is known, has been an award specification since the first Sheep and Cattle Station Employees AwardState came into being in 1918. Free accommodation has been a State Worker Accommodation Act provision since 1915. These provisions have not evolved over recent years, as suggested by the then Treasurer, now the high-flying back bencher from the other side of the House the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), in his second reading speech on the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1986, as a conspiracy industry to avoid the type of tax on remuneration that has now been identified as a fringe benefits tax. Workers under these awards are not high income earners or high-fliers out to impress big business with fancy lunches. These people work in remote areas of Australia and are provided with what I call compensation to alleviate particular hardship they endure as a result of distance and isolation. Queensland awards have provided for the mandatory provision of free food and accommodation for the best part of 70 years. These Queensland award structures are entirely different to those under the terms of the Federal Pastoral Industry Award of 1965. Under that award the employer has the choice of either employing workers on a without-keep basis and negotiating the charge for use of the mises and power or employing workers on a with-keep basis and charging a set amount fixed by the award for the provision of accommodation and food. Employers in Queensland are not committed by law to charge found or fully kept employees for accommodation or food. The mandatory provision of free accommodation and meals under the Queensland awards prohibits employers from negotiating the value of any non-cash benefit, renegotiating the value of any provided benefit, or withdrawing any benefit which has been provided in accordance with the requirement of the award. The Australian Taxation Office clearly defines a taxable housing fringe benefit as one where an employee is granted a right to occupy a unit of accommodation as the employee's usual place of residence. In Queensland this right is not granted; it is mandatory under the Station Hands Award and Pastoral Workers Accommodation Act. The employer in Queensland has no right to exercise any choice. The employer is forced by law to provide a benefit and then is taxed on that provision while the recipient is not taxed on that benefit. The result of such an incongruous arrangement has resulted in the withdrawal of all the minor benefits previously enjoyed by employees such as free meat and eggs and some provisions, electricity, the use of shops for work on private vehicles, provision of accommodation above the award, the use of employer's land for running of a few livestock and, in some cases, children's ponies. The Government's answer has been to suggest that industry orgarusations apply to the State Industrial Commission for a variation of the Station Hands Award enabling employees to be paid on either a without keep basis or a with-keep basis. Since 1960 on four or five occasions industry orgarusations have indeed sought to do just that to address this anomaly. However, they have been unsuccessful. The industry organisations have been restricted in tenus of opportunity to have this matter addressed. It is often the unions, and in Queensland's case the AWU, which are reluctant to address this issue because it opens up the pre- debate on voluntary employment agreements. That is largely what has hampered the discussion on this very issue. The Commission, largely also in Queensland, remains very unsympathetic to the industry'S request to have this issue addressed. The blatant anomaly between the Federal and State awards continues to cause havoc in Queensland, particularly to primary producers when calculating their fringe benefits tax liability. A pertinent example for the members of this House is the dispute now being waged between the AWU in Queensland and a farmer in my electorate. The farmer has been engaged in what is known as cashing out. He pays his station hand a certain amount over the award and deducts a specific amount to reduce his fringe benefits tax to zero. However, this procedure is illegal in Queensland and, as a result, the farmer now owes the Taxation Office $10,000. This is a very clear example of how a farmer in this case has negotiated something with his employee to their mutual agreement and, because it is illegal and because of the reluctance of the Industrial Commission and also the uruons to discuss voluntary employment agreements, that fanner in my electorate now owes the Taxation Office $10,000. Where a provision of free accommodation and meals is stipulated in various State awards, work- employers should be exempt from fringe benefits tax requirements. Agricultural industries operating in remote areas should be exempt from the fringe benefits tax requirement. The mining industry provides another example of the inequity of levelling a fringe benefits tax on remote area food and accommodation. In calculating a mining company's fringe benefits tax liability, the value of onsite housing must be determined. Often a discrepancy arises between the mining company's housing rental valuation and the Australian Taxation Office's valuation. The question is: how is the commercial value of housing in a mining town determined? Clearly, without the mine one does not have the town. If one takes the mine away, the town goes. So it is very difficult to determine the value of that housing in these situations. While mining companies are liable for this fringe benefits tax on housing, electricity and water, and vehicle allowance is paid to staff, they are not subject to fringe benefits tax on the cost of transporting their staff to the sites on a regular basis. The so-called fly-in fly-out arrangements are not subject to any fringe benefits tax requirements. Increases in fringe benefits tax are inevitably going to lead to the demise of many of these mining towns in rural Australia. One such town in my electorate is Blackwater in the north, almost entirely settled by miners and there to service the central Queensland mining region around it and on the central highlands. Companies will reject the idea of setting up pelmanent town sites in preference to fly-in fly-out arrangements. This situation makes a mockery of the Government's regional development policy. Decentralisation sponsored by mining companies will be terminated forevermore unless this issue is addressed. Rural and remote Australia deserves special consideration when considering fringe benefits tax. The lurks and perks do not enter the equation. Workers in the agricultural and mining sector are after a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Employers demand consideration of the difficulties of attracting appropriate people to these isolated communities. Those working in the agricultural industry under many Queensland awards are not provided with free accommodation and food. I stress: this is a mandatory provision and should not be taxable in the hands of the employer. The value of housing in agriculture and mining is reliant upon the existence of those respective industries. Valuation discrepancies arising between companies and the Australian Taxation Office are best avoided by exempting remote area accommodation from fringe benefits tax. Any increases in fringe benefits tax threatens the rural mining towns, undermines the Queensland rural awards and repels an equality of education and health opportunities in so many parts of Australia because of the vital infrastructure which is built up as a consequence of these mining towns. (TIme expired) Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport  to draw to the attention of the House today a number of reports-in fact, 16 that I have researched-in relation to a very small area of my electorate around Bestic Street, Rockdale where substantial damage to residential properties has resulted from severe air turbulence generated by the low overpass of . aircraft making a landing approach to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. As a result of a chasing operatjon that I had to do through the office of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), the Civil Aviation Authority has granted a number of ex gratia payments to some of my constituents towards the cost of effecting repairs. It is very important to note that, all the while in doing so, the Civil Aviation Authority appears to be going out of its way to advise my constituents that 'the Authority is not obliged to pay compensation for such damage'. I very quickly draw to the House's attention today three claims made to the Civil Aviation Authority. The first was a claim for $8,100 resulting in a $2,720 ex gratia payment being made; the second was a claim for $16,000 resulting in a payment of $1,300; and no payment at all appears to be in prospect with regard to the third case. The damage to these properties is substantial. In one case, two windows-both measuring two metres by one metre-were blown out in a small former shop. In another case, a large part of a roof was dislodged after which tiles flew around backyards. It is very fortunate indeed that no children were killed or seriously hurt in these instances. It is simply not good enough for the Civil Aviation Authority to make these ex gratia payments without there being some entitlement for my constituents. I suspect that when air traffic increases at Kingsford-Smith Airport-and I speak on behalf of a number of other members' constituents-these people will have no discernible legal entitlement to the correction of damage to their property. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! It being 1.45 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106, as amended for this session, the debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Unemployment",67
75,Mrs BAILEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"1\vo weeks ago we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) pledge his support in this House for the unemployed. His job statement was supposed to provide the framework for economic recovery, but all it represented was a blatantly political and unfunded document which will do little to solve the problem of unemployment and even less to ease the heartache of the unemployed and their families. Only this morning I was informed that a small rural town in my electorate, Heathcote, has been dealt a savage blow. Heathcote's largest private industry employer, Heathcote Treated Timber, has shut down all green mill operations, the most labour intensive section of the mill. This has resulted in the dismissal of all timber yard workers and a total loss of 28 jobs. This coincided with the release last week of unemployment figures that showed that Heathcote had one of the highest unemployment rates in Victoria. In fact, unemployment in Heathcote has risen from 7.7 per cent to a massive 19.3 per cent in the past 12 months. Unemployment will continue to rise as long as the Prime Minister and his Government persist in tinkering around the edges of the problem. They lack any resolve or vision to solve these problems. Mr Mark Leibler",70
76,Mr HOLDING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I refer the House to the statement made today during the grievance debate by the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford), who sought on behalf of the Opposition to rectify the parliamentary record following a scandalous and defamatory attack under privilege on Mr Mark Leibler, a distinguished member of the legal profession and a leader of the Jewish community in Victoria. I want the House to be aware that, on behalf of Mr Leibler, who is a constituent of mine, I wrote to the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), indicating to him that his allegations were without foundation and that, once he knew that, he should have had the decency to withdraw those allegations in this House and offer Mr Leibler an apology. Having regard to the honourable member's past abuse of the privileges of this House it is regrettable, but not surprising, that he made no response to this request. I would like to thank the honourable member who spoke on behalf of the Opposition for having today publicly dissociated both himself and the Opposition from the honourable member for Deakin's statements and for having indicated that they, at least, are prepared to acknowledge that when a prominent citizen is the subject of this sort of attack they will not stand by the person who makes those attacks after he has been given an opportunity to withdraw those comments and to set the parliamentary record straight. Victoria",70
77,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was shocked this morning when I read in the Victorian HeraldSun that Victorians are leaving their financially crippled State in droves. What was once the garden State of Victoria and the most vital part of the Australian economic community has been hard hit. In the last financial year, 16,200 people moved away from Victoria-an increase of 100 per cent from the previous year and the greatest number in 20 years. What is driving them out of the leading Australian State, Victoria? I will tell the House what is driving them out. It is a State Government, hopelessly incompetent, overseen by a Premier who proved in her first Ministry that she had not a clue about financial management. She would not even pay the bills for her Department-180,OOO accounts to be exact. The Minister even forgot to pay her motor vehicle fleet registration one year. Combine that with a tired, visionless, incompetent Federal Government with a divided, fighting and desperate leadership-a Party riddled with factions that has lost its way. Labor must go, both in Victoria and at the Federal level. Nuclear Weapons",70
78,Mr DUNCAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The children of the Wynn Vale School in my electorate have raised with me their concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and they have sent me a poem which I want to share with the House. It reads: OUR FEELINGS ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS: It's scary that if someone wants to blow up the world they can. Some people are dying right now because of nuclear radiation. I feel scared that we might die. We could get diseases from radiation. I feel worried that a nuclear bomb could drop us tomorrow. We made these weapons, why don't we get rid of them? I feel like an endangered animal. I feel ashamed that we made them (nuclear weapons) in the first place. All they are useful for is killing! Peace isn't complete until they are destroyed. I feel as though we should be doing something about it. Everyone is running and hiding. No one is facing up to the problem. That was by the children of Ms Hanlon's class. They also asked me to raise their concerns about the proliferation which has been, or may be, caused by the break-up of the Soviet Union, with the different republics going their own ways and possibly obtaining control of nuclear weapons which were formerly controlled by the Soviet Union. I have undertaken to raise this matter in the Parliament with a view to the Government taking up this matter at the highest levels and raising it with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Federation, when he visits Australia next year. The children of the Wynn Vale School believe this would be a very useful way for our Prime Minister and others to spend their time with Mr Yeltsin. It is a matter of great concern to the children of not only this country, but the world. I hope that the Government will take up the suggestion of speaking to Mr Yeltsin about the matter when he visits our country. Fightback Package",71
79,Mr SOMLYAY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"One section of the media which has had a field day since the announcement of the Opposition's Fightback package has been the cartoonists. The cartoonists are quite clever, quite funny and very enjoyable, but they are not subject to answerability. On that note, I would like to ,congratulate my constituent Claire Jolliffe, who today wrote the following letter to the Sunshine Coast Daily : on REGARDING Moir's cartoon (Daily, November 22), if the point was that as a nation we shall all be worse off after GST, then to me it would be preferable to be 'poor' under a thinking, positive Liberal government than 'poor' under a Labor Government which has built a legacy of destruction of rural Australia and disincentive in the business sector and used sporting wins, leadership tussles and factionalism as keystones for 'successful' party rule. Surely we are clever enough people to have a vision of excellence for the next couple of generations, with hard work and motivation not regarded with suspicion and as some kind of capitalist plot. Congratulations to John Hewson and Co on their vision and sheer guts. Positive policies will encourage positive people to prosper. The scare Icampaign will not work. Railway Workers: Redundancy Package",71
80,Mr ONEIL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to raise in this House the dreadful decision that the Government has taken over voluntary redundancy payments to railway workers. In the late 1970s, when the South Australian railway system was taken over by the Commonwealth Government, a voluntary redundancy package was offered to former South Australian railway workers who were then in the Commonwealth's employ. The package offered four weeks pay for every year of service, uncapped. The Commonwealth railway peoplethis has been the only successful railway system in the world, particularly here in Australia-are on 76 weeks pay, capped. For instance, a former South Australian railway employee with 43 years in service, would get 172 weeks pay. The person working alongside him who had spent the same amount of time with Australian National would get 76 weeks pay. I think that is completely outrageous. I call on the Government to overturn that decision. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is a former President of the ACTU and has compassion for the workers. I have approached the Prime Minister about this. I understand that a decision will be made today. I certainly hope that the Prime Minister comes down with some equality of treatment for all workers. I think the railway system is a classic example. It is quite outrageous that Peter Cook. the Minister for Industrial Relations, has put forward such an ad hoc policy, one which can cause only division amongst workers. I certainly hope that the Cabinet and the Prime Minister will overturn this terrible decision. State Electricity Commission of Victoria",72
81,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Government of Victoria has again shown itself incapable of governing its State by its actions in a dispute over the commencement of an $84m private contract to remove clay and soil from the black coal deposits of the Latrobe Valley. The Gippsland Trades and Labour Council has demanded that all moves aimed at privatisation cease. Another implication is that the current work practices and equipment of the SEC be effectively retained, supposedly to maximise value for the taxpayers. The Victorian Government, faced with the threat of a 48-hour electricity strike, has done its usual backdown. The agreement between the Government and the 23 unions on the site gives the union an effective veto over work practices such as the introduction of private contractors and the overall privatisation program. At least that was the understanding of 5,000 unionists at a mass meeting on Wednesday. The Victorian Minister for Manufacturing and Industry Development, Mr White, has suggested that the SEC has only to consult the unions and that he has the final say. Disinformation under the Kirner Government has, of course, been at dizzy heights. The claim of the Government that it, not the unions, is in charge of the SEC must be viewed sceptically. Mr John Halfpenny of the Victorian Trades Council stated today that it had never been suggested that Mr White would have the final say. Mr Halfpenny further said in the HeraldSun this moming: There will be no privatisation, no contracting out of work currently done by SEC people without the agreement of the relevant unions ... Who is running the State: Mrs Kirner, Mr White or Mr Halfpenny? Fightback Package",72
82,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Over the next 12 months we will have many passionate debates in this House about the goods and services tax and the full package that the Opposition is putting forward, a package which will discriminate against working class families, farmers and average Australians. One of the disappointing things about the initial package is the way in which some editors of some papers-like the Queensland Country Life, which has been an apologist for the corrupt National Party in Queensland for years-have rushed into defend it. As the issues are clearly explained and as the facade is pulled away and this tax package is seen for what it is, a wolf in sheep's clothing, these people who have rushed into defend it will look silly. If one looks at what it is going to do to country people, one will see that it is going to downgrade health services, which will cost more, and put a tax of 15 per cent on primary producers selling in the domestic market. In addition, petrol prices are not going to be any cheaper. Even if there were to be a decrease of 2c or 3c a litre, the Opposition would have to convince everyone out there that it would be passed on to the consumer. If the Opposition thinks that is right, it believes in fairies at the bottom. of the garden. Industrial Relations Commission",72
83,Mr CHARLES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am delighted to have the opportunity today to bring to the, attention of this House a statement reported in the Age on 10 October 1991. The article states: In another controversial move, the Government is expected next year to look at amending section 299 of the Industrial Relations Act, which in effect prohibits any criticism of the Industrial Relations Commission that brings either the commission or a member of it into disrepute. I remind the House that after the 30 April national wage case decision the Secretary of the ACTU, Bill Kelty, said that the Commission had brought down a decision which was sickening, but that the trade union movement would not eat the vomit. Further to that, the 'honourable' Wally Cunan, Secretary of the Meat Workers Union, our friend of free enterprise in Victoria, said that the Commission was incompetent, irrelevant, obviously biased and full of hypocrisy. I am delighted that the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has seen the wisdom of revising the Industrial Relations Act. I suggest to the House that the honourable senator accept my private member's Bill, which would eliminate section 299(1)(d)(ii) which says that anyone who says anything naughty about the Commission has to pay a fine or go to gaol. If the Government would simply accept my private member's Bill, I would be happy to bring it back into the House and retable it; we could have three readings straight away. (TIme expired) Goods and Services Tax",73
84,Mr LES SCOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I draw the House's attention to the fact that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) actually has a friend in Australia. He is a new import from New Zealand actually; I do not know what he has come here for. I thought he was a member of the Young Liberals, but I think he must be a member of the Young Nationals, because just recently he rang the Leader of the National Party who was speaking on a talkback program in Brisbane. He had one of those questions that appeared to have come out of his head, but he was obviously well organised. But the first thing he admitted was that he always watches the Leader of the National Party in Parliament at Question Time. Of course, when he admitted that, the Leader of the National Party certainly admitted that he was a tiger for punishment. I think anyone who found it entertaining to watch the Leader of the National Party in Question Time would be a glutton for punishment. The question related to the goods and services tax, of course. Once again, it referred to the costs that a lot of people were going to have to meet. In my electorate most people who buy essential items such as groceries, meat, bread and milk are going to be severely disadvantaged by a 15 per cent tax. But what did the Leader of the National Party do? He went on with more fraudulent, inaccurate statements suggesting that people would not be affected by the 15 per cent tax. They certainly will be in my electorate. I know that as time goes on people will realise that the whole GST package is a fraud.",73
85,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with sessional order 106A, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Fightback Package: Pensioners",73
86,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the initial advice prepared by the Public Service on our Fightback package confirms that the proposed 8 per cent compensation measures for pensioners will adequately compensate them for the effects of the GST?,73
87,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The figuring that is being done wi-hin the departments is not yet complete.' Mr Reith-Here it is, Bob. What about this document, Bob? Will you do it, or Paul?",73
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,74
89,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It took those opposite years to get this together. But in view of the factMr Reith interjecting ,74
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,74
91,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In view of the fact that the Opposition has left out from its inflation calculations the change to the health care arrangements, road user charges and the impact on interest rates, it is inevitable-I make this assertion here in this place-that its inflation forecast will be a substantial underestimate of the inflationary impact of its package. There is simply no question about that. Of course, that obviously also means, as the Opposition's inflation estimate is an underestimate for the reason of the factors that have been excluded, that the compensation package will be manifestly inadequate. When the total analysis is complete we will be delighted to highlight, as we will, the complete inadequacy of the package in all its respects. Interest Rates",74
92,Mrs CROSIO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform us whether the reduction in interest rates has been facilitated by the decline in the inflation rate? Mr MCGauran-He won't understand it even though he wrote it. Mr Costello-Watch out for car headlights.,74
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. I warn the member for Gippsland and the member for Higgins.,74
94,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australians understand that there is a clear and direct link between inflation, inflationary expectations and interest rates, and over the last 18 months we have witnessed a substantial decline both in inflation and in inflationary expectations. As a consequence, interest rates have fallen dramatically. Sustained low inflation, with consequent low rates of sustained interest, provides the basis for employment growth, increased competitiveness and more productive investment. Nominal interest rates are defined as the real rate of interest and an additional inflation component correctly defined as an inflationary expectation but approximated by the prevailing rate of inflation. This brings me to my first major point. Interest rates increase as a consequence of increases in inflation and as a consequence of expected increases in inflation. Were a new indirect tax to be introduced, then interest rates would increase prior to the actual implementation of such a tax. In anticipation of higher rates of inflation, lenders would demand a premium on the interest payments which they receive. Borrowers would face increased repayments, not from the date of implementation but from the time when it became clear that such a new inflationary tax would be introduced. Given that the administrative task of introducing such a tax could take up to 18 months, families and households who are borrowers would face a prolonged period of increased repayments. That brings me to the second major point. The fact of life is that the major loan which Australians take out is the home mortgage. Increased inflation and higher interest rates mean increased repayments. The size of the average mortgage in Australia is about $40,000. That equates to a monthly repayment of about $420. The average size of new mortgages is approximately $75,000, and therefore the average monthly repayment is about $850. So I will be generous to the Opposition. I will assume that the increase in interest rates resulting from the coalition's own calculations of a 4.7 per cent jump in inflation is a mere 2 per cent. It is an heroic assumption, but I am generous. The increase in mortgage repayments as a consequence of an increase in interest rates of 2 per cent is unambiguously rotten news for Australian families. A 2 per cent increase on a mortgage of $40,000 means an increase in repayments of $60 a month. A 2 per cent increase on a mortgage of $75,000 means an increase in repayments of $113 a month. Those opposite propose to introduce a new tax if they ever get government. The result will be high inflation and high interest rates, and they assert that Australians will be compensated. That is wrong-dead wrong. Nowhere in the manifesto of the conservative parties are mortgage holders compensated for interest rate increases. The arithmetic is brutal for those requiring to purchase homes because they are just not adequately compensated.",74
95,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You wouldn't even count it in the CPI.,75
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mitchell.,75
97,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They would not be adequately compensated. Let me provide an example. Consider the individual earning $20,000, remembering that 50 per cent of Australians in the work force earn less than $23,000. The Opposition proposes a cut in income tax of $15.60 per week. However, that individual would pay an additional $13.80 per week on his mortgage of $40,000. That just about wipes out the tax cut of $15.60. It leaves $1.80 to cover the price increases everywhere else-in food, in clothing, in health and in State charges and taxes. Let me provide another example. An individual earns about $30,OOO-about average weekly earnings-and has a mortgage of $75,000. The tax cut is $30.40 per week, the increase in repayments is $26 and the net gain is $4.40. That again has to compensate for an the other price increases. Recently the Sydney Morning Herald ran the headline: 'Vote Dr Hewson for High Interest Rates'. That is a serious aUegation. I can tell this House that it is fundamentally inaccurate and misleading. In fact, the headline should have said this: 'Vote Dr Hewson for ruinous inflation, high interest rates, increases in unemployment, fraudulent compensation proposals and increases in mortgage repayments' . Fightback Package: Housing",75
98,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.

103,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When we have completed that analysis, members of the Opposition and, more importantly, the Australian public will be made aware of the consequences of that analysis. When one looks at what is proposed in telms of housing policy, one can certainly look at that compensation in relation to what the average price of new dwellings might be around Australia. Mr Sharp interjecting",75
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Gilmore.,75
105,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One can also look at that compensation as it might apply to various housing markets in Australia. When we do that, we have very different equations. We have one situation in terms of averages; we have different situations when we look at different housing markets. For instance, one needs to take account of the fact that it is currently expected that there will be very strong growth over the balance of this financial year and into next financial year in housing starts and in the housing industry in Australia. That has been revised upwards by the Indicative Planning Council on the basis of certain assumptions about what might occur in relation to inflation. When we begin to shift our expectations about inflation, then we know what the implications are in terms of the cost structure for the housing industry. The impact of a consumption tax on those buying homesparticularly in atypical markets and larger markets; I refer particularly to what is likely in New South Wales-is very serious indeed. It is serious in terms of both its impact on new purchasers and-just as importantly with the high unemployment that prevails at the moment-its impact in relation to employment levels. The Opposition is talking about a range of measures which interact. It is not the assessment which is made in relation to housing alone. Mr Reith-So you accept that, do you?",75

109,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not a matter of any assessment being made in isolation. As the Prime Minister indicated in relation to a previous question, we could, for example, link housing to what might happen in relation to health. We have the honourable member for Lowe grinning away there on the front bench. The fact of the matter is that the shifts· that might occur in relation to health policy and their impact on services are unknowable, as the Leader of the Opposition has already indicated, but their impact on inflation is quite certain. So we have to take account not only of any individual assessment but of the overall assessment. 1 believe that, when we complete that overall assessment, selling the various elements of the Opposition's proposal will become increasingly difficult. Aviation: Taxation",76
110,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Minister for Transport and Communications whether he is aware of calls for air fares in Australia to be taxed according to the New Zealand system? Can the Minister advise the House whether the introduction of such a measure would affect air travel activity in Australia, and how? Does the Government intend to adopt that system?",76
111,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the suggestion being circulated around the place that we ought to adopt the New Zealand system. Of course, it could not possibly emanate from the Opposition because, when the Leader of the Opposition was questioned on this issue on Lateline, he said: There are elements obviously of similarity in some of the Reagan ideas and some of the Thatcher ideas, but these are totally home grown based on the Australian scene as we see it, and putting our faith in Australians. More recently we had the statement by the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations. He said: It is an Australian package designed by people who have an understanding of the Australian people and the Australian economy. I don't enslave myself or see my party enslaved to any particular overseas stream of political thought. Of course, that is why 1 paid some attention to the parts of the Fightback! document that were of particular interest to me-those dealing with the subject of air fares. 1 note the heading 'Certain ""Exported Services''', under which paragraph 5.4.13 of Supplementary Paper No.5 states: Services performed outside Australia, and some services performed in Australia, are regarded as ""export"" services and are zero-rated. It goes on. There are other things as well. For example, there are subparagraphs headed 'Services Related to Land Outside Australia'; 'Services Related to Moveable Personal Property'; and 'Services Related to Goods Temporarily Imported Into Australia'. Then I picked up the New Zealand GST guide. It has the headings 'Goods Not in New Zealand at the Time of Supply'; 'Certain ""Exported"" Services'; 'Services Related to Property Outside New Zealand'-here it is: 'land'; 'Services Related to Goods Temporarily Imported Into New Zealand'; 'Services Performed Outside New Zealand'; and 'Services Supplied to Non-Residents Outside New Zealand'.",76

As the package is considered to be ""international carriage"", GST is charged at zero per cent on both flights. What do we see in the New Zealand document? It states: . the international journey and air travel within New Zealand, provided that it constitutes national carriage, is booked at the same time as the international journey and is provided through same agent supplier; Then comes the example: A person visits a local travel agent and purchases an air ticket package which provides a flight from Napier to Auckland and on to PeIth. As the package is considered to be ""international carriage"", GST is charged at zero per cent on both flights. This is a totally, completely, absolutely, comprehensively plagiarised package from people who are not Australian-people who are not home-grown Australian products, people who are from a country totally different from this.

Or, if one comes from the universities in the country from which this package has been derived, the effective term for expulsion is being 'sent down'. So, perhaps I ought to use in this case, to ensure that there is no plagiarism, not the word 'expulsion' for the drafters of this document but the words 'sent down'. If we did, of course, it would be plagiarism-as it means effectively the same in both cases. I have read out the headings for the GST on a plethora of goods and services.

134,Mr WRIGHT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Has he seen reports that the introduction of a consumption tax would lead to substantial job growth? What would be the real effect on employment of such a measure? Is it the intention of the Hawke Labor Government to introduce such a tax?,78
135,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his question. Indeed, it has a very special relevance in the light of the answer that has just been given by my friend and colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications, because on 20 August 1985 the then Minister for Finance in New Zealand announced the introduction of a 10 per cent consumption tax together with substantial cuts in marginal tax rates. The rhetoric, I inform the honourable member, was grand. The Minister for Finance, Roger Douglas, concluded his speech to the Parliament with the following remarks: Tonight's announcements will help us to achieve greater and more lasting economic growth. It will allow our economy to produce the jobs and living standards that all New Zealanders want. Indeed, the rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition here has been similarly grand, as will no doubt not have escaped the honourable member who has asked the question, because the Leader of the Opposition here in introducing his package said: . We can have full employment once again, along with low interest rates and a rising standard of living. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",78
136,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Hear, hear!' they say, 'Good on you'. On page 44 of the summary document, once again it is claimed that a consumption tax will mean a lasting gain in jobs. So I suggest to the honourable member who has asked the question that it is a very interesting and educative exercise to look at the promises. Those opposite have relied on New Zealand. They have plagiarised it; their whole package is couched in terms of the New Zealand experience. That is what they have put in their package. I suggest it is a very revealing and educative job to compare the promises that were made with the introduction of the consumption tax in New Zealand. Compare the promises and the results. First, there is promise No.1, which is greater and more lasting economic growth. That was the promise made in 1985 with the introduction of the consumption tax-greater and more lasting economic growth. What was the result? A five-year recession in New Zealand.",78

That is the outcome; that is the result against the promise. Incredibly, there is still no sign in New Zealand of the recession ending. But by way of contrast, whereas there has been a 5 per cent decline in GDP in New Zealand, in Australia GDP has risen by over 13 per cent in the same period. Dr Hewson interjecting",78

141,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Promise No.2 that was made in New Zealand with the introduction of the consumption tax was this: more jobs and improved living standards. That was the promise. The result is that employment has fallen by 6 per cent in New Zealand since the introduction of the consumption tax. Of course, as the honourable member for Capricornia will appreciate, with there not being the increase in jobs as promised, but with a massive reduction in employment, living standards have been devastated. In contrast to that massive fall in employment in New Zealand, over the same period employment in Australia has risen by almost 10 per cent. Those opposite have chosen to found themselves on and in New Zealand. We have had the opportunity of seeing the same promises made in New Zealand, and we have seen the results.

145,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable gentleman keeps referring to a document that he says he has in his hand that comes from the Public Service.

I do not get a lot of paper from the Public Service in general. Industrial Reform",79
146,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance in his capacity as the acting Minister for Industrial Relations. Is he aware of recent proposals for industrial relations reforms? What is the Government's response to these proposals? Can the Minister inform the House of what progress has been made in relation to industrial reform in this country?,79
147,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware that in the context of the release of its 'tax everything in sight' package last week, the Opposition had some things to say about industrial relations. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition elevated this area to the top of the reform pile. When he launched this package at the Press Club he said, 'Our industrial relations package is probably the single most important element of the entire package'. He did not shirk in putting it to the top of the pile. This most important element of the entire package took up about two pages out of several hundred pages. Most of that was about expenditure cuts. There was practically nothing about industrial relations policy per se. The reason for that is that the in so far as it has been enunciated by the spokesman, is a pretty simple policy. It provides a licence for exploitation and breakdown of long provided minimum conditions of employment in this country. Mr Sharp-Rubbish. You know that is not so.",79
148,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why is the honourable member shouting? This is the Opposition's policy. He should be proud of it. The Opposition does that in the name of enterprise bargaining. The policy enables so-called voluntary enterprise agreements to be reached between employers and employees which would be subject only to the protection of a yet to be defined minimum wage on a per hour basis. There would be no protection for any other conditions of employment, such as standard hours, overtime rates, annual leave, sick leave, lunch breaks, long service leave, amenities and so on. Mr Tuckey interjecting",79
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for O'Connor.,79
150,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"None of those protections which are set out in awards which cover the vast majority of employees in this country would be in these agreements unless the agreements specified them. Certainly, there would not be the protection of some award provided in such agreements. The employees' ability to protect themselves would depend on their bargaining position. Those in a weak bargaining position would be open to exploitation. Interestingly, in light of what has already occurred in Question Time, all this is very similar to what has happened in New Zealand. In fact, it is worse, because New Zealand has set some minima for conditions such as annual leave and sick leave. But the Opposition in Australia has no apparent intention to do that. New Zealand has set no minimum wage for teenagers, which has meant that teenagers have been open to widespread exploitation. The Opposition in this country has not, to my knowledge, said whether the minimum wage that it proposes would apply to teenagers. We simply do not know whether it intends to emulate the New Zealanders even further. The Opposition will doubtless argue that all this will pay off in jobs and opportunities to improve real incomes through enterprise productivity bargaining, but there is absolutely no reason to expect that. If we look at its scenario C, which it says depicts the outcome of all its reforms, and then look at real wages, where are they in the year 2000? They are less than they are now. All of this enterprise bargaining, which is supposed to open the door to a brave new world for workers of this country, would result in lower real wages than they have at present. With regard to jobs, in New Zealand, as has already been mentioned by the Prime Minister, there is absolutely no evidence of an explosion in jobs as a result of reforms of the kind that are now being proposed by this Opposition. Scenario C, which it says is the indicator of the two million jobs and the halving of the unemployment rate, does not include the goods and services tax. Scenario C, which is supposed to be the high road, the way in which we can see the future-the vision of the year 2000-does not include the goods and services tax. What an absurd situation! Mr Halverson interjecting",80

What an extraordinary fOrt! What a fraud!",80
153,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are the fraud.,80
154,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition can say to the Australian people that his package would produce these outcomes,80
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,80
156,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He bases it on a model which does not even include the central reform in his package-the goods and services tax. Finally, in relation to the question, which asked me about the Government's proposal in relation to industrial relations reform, in contrast to the Opposition, we are about making major improvements to industrial relations but without destroying the essential levels of protection against exploitation. We have achieved dramatic change. In the area of industrial disputes we have seen a 60 per cent reduction in time lost per 1,000 employees compared with the previous Government. In the area of wages, we have seen a level of increase on average of 61/2 per cent per annum under us, compared with 11th per cent under the previous Government. That is why our international labour cost competitiveness index is down 17 per cent under us, not up 17 per cent as the Leader of the Opposition said in a speech a couple of weeks ago when he read the index round the wrong way. It is down 17 per cent because of the effective industrial relations policies which we have been able to pursue. We are increasing labour market flexibility, particularly through award restructuring, which means that there is now available for the use of the work force within an enterprise an enormous amount of flexibility which simply was not there previously. We are moving to enterprise and workplace bargaining, firstly, through certified agreements and, most recently, through the enterprise bargaining principle which has been accepted by the Industrial Relations Commission and welcomed by all parties, including .all of the employer organisations in this country. It has been sneered at by the Opposition as not being true enterprise bargaining because it retains award protections. The Opposition says that therefore it is not true enterprise bargaining because it stops exploitation. What an absurd suggestion! When we look at whether it is true enterprise bargaining or not, the first one which has been endorsed by the Commission relates to the company Rheem in its water heater division in Sydney. Mr Charles-Boring!",80
157,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thought that this was the Opposition's central reform; that the most important reform was industrial relations. This is about enterprise bargaining. I thought the Opposition would like to know about it. Mrs Sullivan interjecting,81

Further wage increases are projected, linked to the achievement of further reductions in the hours taken to produce each water heater. The Opposition reckons that that is not enterprise bargaining or productivity bargaining. What does it expect it to be? It is a perfect example of the kind of thing which will happen on a very wide scale now because of the enterprise bargaining clause which has been endorsed by the Commission and which is available to the workers of this country.

This morning he was arguing that families would not have additional costs because 'doctors would discount fees'. He said: The competitive pressures from their colleagues will still be there and will keep fees down to Medicare schedule levels. There are three elements relevant to most Australian families. Firstly, under this policy put out by the Leader of the Opposition, all doctors would be prohibited from direct billing-that is everyone except cardholders. Let us make·· that clear: everyone except cardholders' doctors would be prohibited from direct bulkbilling. Secondly, private insurance rebates would be lifted to 85 per cent of the exorbitant AMA schedule-that is, not of the Medicare schedule, but of the AMA schedule. Thirdly, to quote the policy: We will require co-payments as part cal insurance cover options. So doctors will be required to 85 per cent of the AMA schedule, plus a copayment.

192,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The importance of attaining and sustaining a low level of inflation is clearly not understood by those on the other side of this House. It does not compare, for example, with the thrill of releasing a new policy document. It requires more intellectual effort than shouting slogans about the need for a zero to 2 per cent inflation outcome. Of course, that came from New Zealand, too. The importance of maintaining the gains this Government has made on inflation cannot be understated. It is a prerequisite for iroproved competitiveness and sustained growth in both employment and living standards. Yet the Opposition wants us to waste all the efforts made by Australian workers, Australian business and the Government for the sake of a consumption tax. A consumption tax will do little, if anything, to improve our trading performance and will categorically wreck our chances of benefiting from the gains that we have actually made on inflation. Let me remind honourable members what those gains are: inflation is now at its lowest level in 20 years; inflation is now below the OECD average; and, more importantly, inflation is now below the level of our major trading partners.

195,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,83
196,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In order to boost investment and employment, achieving a permanent reInflation duction in the rate of inflation, these things must remain a key objective for all governments and for all Australians. The fundamental reality, of which all Australians need to be aware, is that, if the Opposition introduces a new consumption tax in the absence of an effective wages policy, inflation will soar. Members of the Opposition not only lack a wages policy, they are proud of it. It is not scaremongering to say that inflation will skyrocket. Experts who have lived through the introduction of these taxes are agreed that the inflation bear will break out of its cage. Opposition members-Ooh!",83
197,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,83
198,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The chief economist of Britain's National Westminster Bank, Mr David Kern, is quoted as saying that the VAT as an engine for inflation is unparalleled. He is repOlted to have said: It was an inflationary factor because wage earners could demand higher wages on the back of value added tax rises. He is not alone in this view. Vicki Pryce from KPMG Peat Marwick, one of the most respected accounting firms in the world, is reported to have said that Australia could face two years of rising inflation from the GST if Britain's VAT system was any guide. She is quoted as saying: High inflation could last for a good couple of years following the introduction of a GST, which means interest rates have to start going up. What the Opposition fails to acknowledge is that, in the absence of an effective wages policy, inflation will soar and interest rates will need to rise to prevent inflationary expectations rising and an explosion in wages growth. It is not just the Government making this claim. John Stone, a former National Party senator, of all things, says that the claim that the inflation effect of 4.7 per cent will merely be 'a one-off blip' is unduly glib. John Stone goes on to say that the Opposition 'should have been even more up front about the need for monetary policy to maintain price stability'. This is the same old trick: screw them down with monetary policy. The only tool available to the Opposition is monetary policy. That is shorthand for crippling interest ratesOpposition members-Page three.",83
199,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Orderl,84
200,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ultimate dishonesty of those on the other side of this House is shown by the fact that their own castings of the inflationary impact of GST assumes that nominal interest rates stay at present levels. That is absolute and utter dishonesty. Interest rates will have to increase to prevent inflation soaring into double digits. But, at worse, even if they could hold to their 5 per cent increase in inflation, interest rates will still have to increase. Financial institutions will not continue to lend for housing at today's 12 per cent rate if inflation soars to double digits. So let there be no doubt-interest rates must rise if the Opposition's package were ever to be introduced. Fightback Package",84

206,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know my dear friend Gough would excuse me if I said that on a number of occasions I have some difficulty in following everything that he says. All I want to say about what I have seen attributed to Gough Whitlam on this issue is his very correct assessment that the imposition of the Hewson package would be an unmitigated disaster for this country. I have had reason at times to disagree with Gough, but on that one he is 100 per cent right. Road User Charges",84
207,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Prime Minister aware of recent proposals for the collection of road user taxes? Can he advise the House of the implications for road users of these proposals?,84
208,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am indebted to the honourable member for Fowler for his question. The answer is yes, I am aware of the most recent proposals. When I say 'most recent', I am not talking about those of the Leader of the Opposition; I am talking about yesterday'S position as distinct from last Thursday'S. I have seen what he had to say yesterday on this issue. Unfortunately, what the Leader of the Opposition has issued now, in his latest twisting and turning, raises more questions than it answers. It is clear that the pressure from the National Party has proved too much for the 'strong and durable' doctor and that in the face of National Party pressure he has had to back down and back away from any sensible distance related road user charges. First he tries to argue that the consumption tax on fuel is a road user charge. I ask him one question about that. Since we clearly cannot rebate a road user charge, does this mean that the consumption tax on fuel will not be rebatable for business users? He may ponder the question. It gets better. Come on, John look at us. Tum around, John. What does'he do then? He then suggests-and this is truly incredible-they might use hub meters. Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition and the House what the Australian Road Transport Federation said about hub meters in its submission to the Inter-State Commission. It said: The set-up costs alone for a heavy vehicle could be $30,000. That is what he is promising them-a cost of $30,000 to put these meters in. It goes on to say: Dust tends to clog the workings. Rough roads can vibrate the internal workings and often cause the device to fall off altogether. Foreign objects such as sticks, stones, and the odd kangaroo, can also cause damage or total loss. Is it not a beauty that this great micro-economic reformer has come up with now? A hub meter which costs $30,000 to put on and can be knocked off or damaged by the odd kangaroo! What a great economic reformer he has turned out to be! The only option left for the Leader of the Opposition is to collect all the road user charges through the registration fees. This means that registration fees would, on average, more than triple. On June 1991 figures, for the private motorist in South Australia and Tasmania, registration would rise from $108 to $350; in New South Wales, from $170 to $556; and in Queensland, from $238 to $778. And, of course, there is third party insurance on top of that. Mr a 'Keefe interjecting",84

At the end of the day, and at the end of all this twisting and turning by the Leader of the Opposition, it gains him nothing. This horrendous up-front cost burden that he would impose on industry and consumers affects prices and living standards every bit as much as a more sensible fuel based road user charge. His figures are still wrong, and after all his twisting and turning he is still a fraud. Unemployment",85
212,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Treasurer to his answer yesterday when he backed his judgment against that of Reserve Bank Director, Professor Gregory.

221,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. Professor Gregory is a valued member of the Reserve Bank Board. He has made a number of academic contributions to our understanding of unemployment. My view, the Government's view, and the Reserve Bank Board's view as a whole, is that the opinion that Professor Gregory has put forward is too pessimistic. The Opposition apparently has a leaked document from one of the Government's committees. I was not at the meeting that Profesthe sor Gregory addressed. I understand that his comments were based on the assumption that there will be a slow recovery from the recession, that job growth will be predominantly female dominated occupations, and that these will be filled by people not currently in the work force. The Government has never suggested that a recovery would be very rapid. We have always said that a recovery will be moderately paced but will deliver sustainable increases in employment.",86

The Leader of the Opposition, with his 'Frightpack' package, has also said that there would be increases in unemployment under his government, if his Party was ever to become the government. The difference is that this Government regards high unemployment as totally unacceptable and is doing everything in its power to generate sustainable growth and employment. Mr Reith-No-one will believe you.",86

227,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And these hypocrites have the gall to criticise the Government. The Budget forecasts were for a growth of around 33/4 per cent in GDP in the course of 1991-92. Indicators released since the Budget support view that we are coming out of recession. It seems very likely that the loss of employment is stabilising.

Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The last part of the question, I would submit, is out of order in terms of the Standing Orders pertaining to Question Time.",87
239,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member is asking the Minister to announce Government policy, that is out of order. The first parts of the question are in order.",87
240,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister has already referred to that quite incredible media release that the Leader of the Opposition put out yesterday. He indicated, quite correctly of course-as the Leader of the Opposition himself knows-that it was put out as a result of panic and the Opposition's concern that the package itself was just being smashed apart. That media release yesterday simply confirms that the members of the coalition intend, as they say, to abolish Federal fuel excise and to save private motorists approximately 19c a litre. He said that 'down the track' - whenever that might be-a future coalition Government would want to see a form of road user charge for commercial vehicles, especially heavy transport. So they are going to abolish the fuel excise, in government, and then down the track they intend to put in some sort of road user charge. But the Leader of the Opposition says: But this will not-repeat not-take the form of a fuel tax'. Probably more than anything else these elements of road funding and fuel excise and the GST in relation to fuel highlight the basic deficiencies of that whole package, and that was the reason why the Leader of the Opposition responded yesterday as he did. It leaves a gaping hole in the whole of the financial arrangements of that particular package. Members of the coalition have indicated on a number of occasions that they accept the principle of user pays or road user charging for the road asset. That has been reflected in all of the statements that they have made, including the speech that the Leader of the Opposition made to the VRTA Congress in Melbourne in July. Quoting his exact words, he said: There was no alternative other than, in our view, to implement user pays pricing principles for roads. No alternative, no qualification-an absolute commitment to do that. Let us have a look at the calculations which underlie that package. Firstly, the coalition claims that its package will reduce fuel prices by 19c a litre. Let us see whether they will. two The present fuel excise, which the coalition claims it will abolish, is 27c per litre. Therefore, the GST clearly will be 8c a litre on fuel. But all of the road user charging analysis shows that not 8c a litre but 16c a litre is required from motorists out of the present 27c fuel excise as their contribution to the construction and maintenance of the road network. There are three options only available to the Opposition in its package in that context. The first option is that the coalition could add the 16c per litre road user charge to its 8c per litre goods and services tax in order to finance the $4.5 billion road program. It could do that, but the statement of the Opposition Leader yesterday specifically ruled out that possibility. He said that the road user charge for commercial vehicles, to repeat it again, 'will not-repeat not-take the form of a fuel tax'. The second option available to him is for the coalition to collect the $4.5 billion by direct charges on motorists and on commercial vehicles. But the commercial road transport industry itself has indicated to us and we have acceptedDr Hewson interjecting",87
241,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting!,88
242,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That the most efficient and equitable way to collect the distance element of road user charges is by way of a payment at the bowser. That is what we are doing. The only option remaining to the Opposition is to finance that $4 billion gap out of general revenue. But where would the $4 billion come from to cover that gap? Honourable members opposite are going to abolish fuel excise on taking government and 'down the track' they are going to establish some sort of road user charge in order to provide them with that $4 billion. Where will they get the $4 billion in the interim?,88

247,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order!,88
248,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are committed to it. For that reason, unless the Opposition is to suspend $4 billion of roadworks per year, it must maintain fuel exciseMr Tim Fischer interjecting",88
249,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the Leader of the National Party!,88
250,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At 16c a litre as well as its GST, which is a general revenue tax, of 8c a litre for private motorists. The implication of that is that the price of petrol could not be reduced by 19c. It could be reduced, at a maximum, by 3c-and the Leader of the Opposition knows it. Mr Beale-Rubbish! That is rubbish!",88
251,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition and honourable members opposite know it. For commercial vehicles which would not pay that 8c goods and services tax, the greatest price reduction possible is 9c per litre and not 19c per litre. The Leader of the National Party has also committed a coalition government-and he has never refuted this; the leader of the National Party in Queensland and all Queensland members know it-to giving the State of Queensland another $1 billion a year for road funding. But Queensland only has about 20 per cent of our total funding. The coalition is not going to treat all of the other States disproportionately; they will get their share. So if $1 billion goes into Queensland, an extra $5 billion every year goes into the national network. He has never refuted or retreated from that. Mr Tim Fischer-Wrong! You are wrong!",88
252,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. I,88
253,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So it becomes quite clear that the $4 billion gap that is already in the package, added to the $5 billion gap created in Queensland",88

259,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is quite clear that the Leader of the Opposition and all of those people who sit with him know the position in which they have placed themselves, and that provides the justification, the reason, the excuse, for that absurd statement that he put out yesterday. He has chosen the confusion path. He has chosen to muddy the waters. He believes that feeding as much confusion as possible into the community will so frustrate people that they will tum their backs on the issues as a whole. In conclusion, the people who sit on the other side of this chamber and the people who preceded them in this chamber have always held the arrogant opinion that the Australian people are stupid. Let me assure the professor and all of his colleagues that the Australian people are not as stupid as those opposite have sometimes, in the past, believed them to be. The Australian people are much more perceptive now. They understand what those opposite are about. The Australian electorate will not let those opposite get away with it, and neither will we.",89
260,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Me Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Motion of Censure",89
261,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"by leave-I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister his failure to formally respond to the coalition's Fightback program notwithstanding that the Government has received from its advisers a detailed report that comments favourably on essential ments of the Fightback program. There are essentially two groups of people in this chamber today. There is the real government in this country, the group of people who have ideas, vision and a sense of direction for the future of this nation-that is the group that I lead-and there is the real Opposition, the Opposition in waiting on the other side, which is totally demoralised, carping and whingeing and which is led by an individual who has lost the respect of his colleagues and the respect of the Australian people. For 18 months the Prime Minister (Me Hawke) has chastised us, demanding that we produce the details of our package. In a week, despite the fact that he has had available to him detailed assessments from the Public Service, he has not been prepared to come into this place and debate the issues. He comes in here, he misrepresents the situation, he lies, he distorts the facts, he cracks jokes, scaremongers and deliberately sets out to mislead the people of Australia. This Prime Minister, who has no vision, no sense of direction, no authority, is so paralysed in his Government that he cannot move. He cannot move anywhere. He has done so many deals over eight years and he is so scared that the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) will gradually and carefully pull the numbers to him",89
262,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,Really?,89
263,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"You should not start poking fun at me because you are in for strife. I challenge you to an electoral test on this package today. Let us put it to the people; let us see who has confidence in the people of Australia. We have confidence in the people of Australia. We know that we have taken a direction that will appeal to the people of Australia while you hide behind a blatant attempt to misrepresent the situation, as a scaremonger. Let us have a look at your concept of Australia, the concept that you believe in, the concept that you, as the Labor leader, say you stand up for. Let us begin with the greatest achievement of your time in government-nearly one for million Australians unemployed, one in three of our young people unable to get a job, with little hope of getting one. You get up here ele- and make deliberately misleading and false statements about the nature of the issues that are subject to debate. You cannot get out of the mire; you are locked in. All the time those one million people sit out there and suffer as a result of your policies. Nearly 31f2 million Australians are living on some form of government benefit, many of them in poverty, as a result of your policies. People from the ACTU have a special role in your Government; they get to sit in the Cabinet room and predetermine the fact that you will not take any substantive decisions that will help their constituency or your constituency. How on earth can you call yourself a Labor leader when you have let down the Labor movement as badly as you have, when you have let down the Australian workers as badly as you have. Under your Government, union officials are sitting in the boardrooms around this country telling managers what to do. What a strange concept of government! You allow the greenies to tell companies all over this country what is wrong; they have you so tied up you cannot approve a major development project in this country which would create jobs. You allow Joe Dawkins to determine the standard of the universities and what our children read. You let him tell parents what books their kids should look at. Under your Government, you allow the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to be responsible for the better cities program-so he can build better gutters and better sewers which he can climb out of. That is what this man is capable of. That is the type of government that you build. You have bureaucrats telling people what to do, other countries telling us what to do. You have no sense of direction, no sense of vision, no sense of understanding of what is of particular interest and benefit to the people of Australia. The centenary year of the ALP will stand as a monument to your failure: nearly one million Australians are unemployed and have no hope of being employed under the policies you pursue. The alternative vision is one that has a understanding of what is in the interests of Australian business and Australian families. We are prepared to take the policy decisions that are necessary to tum this country around. We want families to have a greater control over their lives. We want them to have the chance for work, the chance to earn a living, the chance to keep more of what they earn, the chance to educate their children and look after the health of their children without being in constant fear that they will lose their jobs and lose their capacity to look after their families. We want young people in this country who can go out and buy a home-who can look forward not only to getting a job but also to getting married, settling down, buying a home and getting on and leading a decent life in this country. We want farmers who can keep the land that they and their families have worked for and fought for over the years. That is the sort of country we want to build. We want businessmen who can get on with the job of doing what they do best, which is creating jobs--creating jobs for the nearly one million Australians who are out of work and the other 600,000 Australians who cannot get the work they want. We will not allow them to be overburdened with mountainous taxes, green tape, black tape.",89
264,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,Red tape.,90
265,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"Red tape. They are all the outcomes of your sort of government. We want a vision that gives people a chance to look forward to the future, to recognise that the current generation will not leave to their children a lower standard of living than they have enjoyed themselves. That is what your Government is on about at the present time. Mr Hawke interjecting",90
266,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"You can sit there and joke; you can sit there and interject; you can sit there and be a smart alec. But the people of Australia will never forgive you for the type of country that you have built for them. Those children who are leaving school today have fewer opportunities than you and I had when we left school. They have no real chance of getting work. They have no real chance of clear getting a decent education, because Jo Dawkins continues to erode the standard of education. They have no real prospect of buying a home. If that is the SOlt of country you want to stand up for, you go right ahead. We will be delighted to take you on. In recent days all we have seen by you in this place is attempt after attempt to look to the past. Every time you get a question about the Fightback program, which looks to the future, you look to the past. You live in the past; you are the past. You are yesterday's man. The people of Australia will make sure that you go out as yesterday'S man. When they look back they will say that Hawke made a huge mistake because he did not go two or three years earlier and the consequences of all his policies and all the policies of his Treasurer are stuck all over him. The monuments will be there-the one million unemployed and the lower standard of living for the next generation. You stand up and try to defend that past record when everybody knows that you are defending the indefensible. We do not have to stand up like you do and boast that we have cut real wages and real living standards and try to sell that as a plus. We do not have to stand up and say to the workers, 'We have really looked after you lot, we have cut your real wages by about 10 per cent over the last eight years'. We do not have to defend the indefensible. We do not have to defend a centralised wage detenuination process, which is a major reason why so many do not have jobs. Many workers are going to lose their jobs in the course of the next 12 to 18 months as a result of your policies, which continue to flow through. It should not go unnoticed that on a series of questions in Parliament this week, you have been unable to say anything about where you think the level of unemployment will go in this country in the course of the next few months or years. You mock us; but we have done the detailed work to suggest that we can, if we take the right decisions, return to a situation of full employment in this country. Yet you cannot even answer a simple question about whether unemployment will hit the Budget target, whether it will go higher or whether Professor Gregory is right or whatever. You have no sense of direction beyond today and you spend the whole time, every day, worrying about your job at the expense of everyone else's job. Similarly, we do not have to go out and deliberately mislead the people of Australia. The sort of 'analysis' we heard today about what is going to happen to inflation under our Fightback package was a total and deliberate misrepresentation of the direction of change under our policies. We have shown that you can get inflation under control, you can achieve full employment and you can give Australians the sort of lifestyle that they really want if you are prepared to show some leadership and take some of the decisions that need to be taken that will tum this country around. Let me just pick up a few items that have appeared in the debate this week and deal with some of them to show the extent of the misrepresentation by this Prime Minister and his Ministers. One of them has related to the decision of the coalition in the Fightback package that there will be no petrol excise. The fact is that that would flow through to a 19c per litre fall in the price of petrol to average motorists and a 26c per litre fall in the price of petrol to business users. The Prime Minister is obviously shaken by that decision. He has focused on that decision, and I will bet that he has polled that decision. Do you know what he found when he polled that decision? He found that an overwhelming volume of Australians think it is precisely the sort of decision that ought to be taken until we get this country back on its tracks. When they see it as part of an overall package to eliminate $20 billion of taxes on the business community, they understand what we mean when we say you can create two million jobs in this country. The business community is going to have the central part of creating the jobs that the average Austr-lians want. Fundamental to that is eliminating that mountain of taxes-that batch of hidden taxes-that you have used behind the scenes to fund your programs. That batch of hidden taxes needs to be abolished if business is to get on and do the job that it is supposed to do in tenus of giving Australians the opportunities of employment that they reaI\y want. In order to respond to what you know is not only a correct economic decision, but a correct political decision, you have started this mindless scare campaign about how we cannot deliver that cut in petrol excise. Let me give you an absolute guarantee, Prime Minister, and see if this can go through and stick in the middle of your head: we will abolish petrol excise, the excise on petroleum products. We will abolish it totally and we will not reinstate it. If that is not a clear enough message to the people of Australia, they will not be swayed by your mindless misrepresentation of the facts. In the background, of course, the Prime Minister comes up and says, 'There is a whole structure there, a user charge structure that has to be put in place and a clear sense of direction for my Government as to the way we have got to go, and you are going to tear all that up and throw it away'. The answer is yes, we are. We are going to tear it up and throw it away because it is a total shambles. You have had three sets of reports coming before you-two from the Inter-State Commission, which had one go and was not too popular so it had another go, and one from the Industry Commission. They give quite different views about the way to price road use in Australia. You also misrepresent the fact that you have an agreement with the State Premiers about the nature of user charging on road transport. The nature of that agreement runs to just 5 per cent of road transport-heavy trucks-and the detail of that agreement has not been settled. It may well have been settled a little more if you had been able to go to the last Premiers conference, but you did not make it. The fact is that you have no agreement, you have no policy and you have nowhere to go. All you are doing is scaremongering and trying to divert attention from the fact that you have used petrol excise as a milch cow. You have raised about $42 billion gross from petrol excise and the Commonwealth has spent $12 billion or $13 billion on roads. The difference-nearly $30 billionhas gone into your kick. When we think about that-$30 billion in a Budget of $100 billion-you have used petrol excise as a milch cow. We add to that the fact that you have stolen from the people of Australia a host of other revenue by backdoor means-the use of sales tax and bracket creep. You have collected $22 billion worth of bracket creep. You have no,t been prepared to give us a commitment this week that you will even hand that back. We cannot get a clear-cut answer from you on any direction in policy. If we put those two or three things together we see that more than half your Budget has been raised in the last eight years by stealth. Your Budget and your public sector would be half the size it is today if you had not relied on those areas as milch cows. That is why, when we see you come out and try to attack us on the nature of road user charges and so on, we start to understand your acute sensitivity. You have no policy and you have no sense of direction. Most of the numbers you have used in the Parliament this week have been a fiction of your imagination or they have been a deliberate misrepresentation of the findings of one or two of those reports. As far as we are concerned, petrol prices in Australia are fundamentally important: they flow through the system, they cascade through the system. The abolition of petrol excise is fundamental to turning around the business community in this country. When we add to that the payroll tax, sales tax, the training levy and so on, we start to understand the extent to which you have used the bj.lsiness community as a milch cow and why you now have one million Australians unemployed. You can laugh and joke about some of the examples that we have given about how much better off people will be under our decision to abolish petrol excise. I will give an example of a major coachline in Queensland: 67 coaches on the road in 1990-91 used 7,500,000 litres of diesel fuel and spent $500,000 on tyres, $1,800,000 on spare parts and servicing, and so on. Under our package, they would save $2m in costs. Think about that. This bimbo here who got up and misrepresented the nature of that debate, his standing with the trucking industry is legendary. I will read a couple of quotes from the Australian Transport News about the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) and his standing with that industry: Mr Brown has not only proven himself over the last year to be incompetent, albeit at times well meaning, but he has also deceived the industry. Brown blathers, but he does not listen, and most importantly he does not have the clout to stand up to the State Premiers and the ministers and the senior bureaucrats. I will read a third one: Would you believe that Kim Beazley, the aspiring Prime Minister, is supposedly the chief transport minister nationally? It may only be if Bob Brown does the right thing and resigns that Beazley will take any notice of this section of his portfolio which is actually bigger than the telecommunications and media industry that has so distracted his attention. The Minister has no standing on that issue in the industry at all. I go back to my main theme, having demolished the gross misrepresentation that has taken place in this Parliament this week on the issue of petrol prices. We are fighting for the future of our children and our grandchildren. That is what this is all about.",90
267,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,You are fighting for your life.,93
268,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"We are not fighting for our life son; you are. You have got one of those grins on your face that tries to look happy and you are talking through your teeth saying, 'Gee whiz, we are finished'. Of course you are finished. You are totally finished because you have not had the capacity to develop any vision. You have not got the capacity to provide any leadership. You have not got the capacity to push even easy decisions through your Caucus and Cabinet, let alone the sorts of decisions that have to be taken to tum this country around. As I say, we have to somehow drag you screaming to a public debate where you are forced to put down your alternative of what this country ought to look like in the course of the 1990s; but you have not got the capacity to do that. In this document we have outlined a 20point plan to rebuild and reward Australia-a 20-point detailed plan, the most comprehensive document ever put down by any Opposition in this country and, I daresay, any government in this country in tenus of the magnitude of the task we have undertaken to demonstrate to the people of Australia that it can be done. Our central tenet is, of course, not faith in government, which is the central tenet of what you do and the way you operate; ours is based on faith in the Australian individual. We believe Australians can do it; we believe Australians can tum this country around. We will give them the opportunity to do just that by taking all those taxes off the business community so businessmen can goon and do what they want to do. We can change the industrial relations system to move to genuine enterprise bargaining which will give workers and their employers the opportunity to sit ' down face to face and determine the tenus and conditions of employment. We can give them the tax system to back that up so that they can take home more to their families. We can give them a better quality and more reliable health system. We can give them a better quality and more reliable education system. We can create a real opportunity for Australians. If they lift their game, they will significantly improve not only their standing but the standing of this nation. That is a very real opportunity that can be provided to the people of Australia under the vision that is included in our Fightback program. Their alternative under you is further falls in living standards, further increases in taxes, further being used, I guess, as a milch cow by you. It does not matter what way you go about it; you are not prepared to tell them up front that you are doing it. You will just milk them anyway. We need to break the mould in Australian politics. We need to ask not just, 'What's in it for me?' but, 'What's in it for my children and my grandchildren?'. We are prepared to ask that question and we are prepared to provide an answer. Compared to you we are the only party-as I say, the real government in this country. We have the sense of vision and the sense of direction and we can deliver to the Australian people just what they need.",93

He said that on the more important economic issues the Hewson document offers an absurdlyoptimistic assessment. In other words, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a con job. It represents an unnecessary and unwarranted tax on the necessities of life for ordinary Australians and it does this in the guise of masquerading as tax cuts.

304,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Resume your seat.,95
305,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"As I say, the Leader of the Opposition says that he has found the universal panacea; he has found the philosopher's stone. Like all fairy tales, it is simply not true. It is, in the words of the Sydney Morning Herald this week, the goods and services hoax. The document is called Fightback!, but the real question is: if you are going to call it Fightback! who does it attack? It would certainly hurt ordinary Australian people. It would hurt those people in the Australian community least able to look after themselves, least able to take the pain. That is why it is a hoax, Mr Deputy Speaker. It pretends to help ordinary Australians. But, instead, it would dramatically and drastically lower the standard of living of ordinary Australians. It would wreck the fundamental reforms that we have made to the Australian economy. We would return to the high inflation of the bad old days under the economic academic opposite, with all the consequences that high inflation would have for living standards and competitiveness. The consumption tax would lead to the polarisation of the Australian people. It would lead to the re-entrenching of privilege and it would lead to a return to confrontation in the workplace. Let me illustrate with just three examples. The first, of course, is in this area of road user charges; and I do not need to spend a great deal of time on that because in Question Time today I have absolutely demolished the twisting and turning, the regression, of the Leader of the Opposition. The simple fact, as the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) said, is that the Leader of the Opposition made his position quite clear on 31 July this year when he said, 'There is no alternative other than, in our view, to implement a user pays principle for roads'. Once you have got that point, then you have the Leader of the Opposition nailed. He has twisted and turned since Thursday of last week when he attempted to perpetrate a central fraud on the people of Australia in regard to this question of road user charges. I dealt with that in Question Time today. Let me deal with the Leader of the Opposition, this so called strong man who is going to undertake the central issue of micro-economic reform head on. As soon as he is confronted with a challenge, as soon as the National Party has said, 'Listen, Leader of the Opposition, you are proving Hawke right. Hawke got up and told the people of Australia in this House that we would run away from you. I tell you what, we are going to start running now if you do not change your position on road user charges', and as soon as the National Party said he had to go to water, he has gone to water. As well as being a fraud, you are a weak fraud. That is in the area of road user charges. Let me move to the area of the $10 billion in spending cuts. Just what is involved in this? We should always remember this fact: Australia is one of the lowest taxed countries in the OECD, and that is in part because we already have achieved one of the leanest and most efficient government sectors. Me Deputy Speaker, if you want to question that, just see what Professor Head has to say about it: Australia, as most economists well know but occasionally seem to forget, stands out clearly among industrialised countries for its relatively low share of taxation and government expenditure as a proportion of GDP. The proposed spending cuts would fall on essential government services and they would be a terrible blow to the least well off in the Australian community. These computer driven men opposite, these men of compassion, propose an incredible $2.4 billion cut in social welfare spending, treating human beings as no more than items on a balance sheet and looking to force economic outcomes with no more regard for people than as just onedimensional economic indicators. They would slash essential spending and they would hit and they would hurt hardest those in the Australian community least able to bear the pain-the sole parents, the unemployed, the disabled, the aged. These spending cuts have been used to finance income tax cuts which the Leader of the Opposition claims are targeted to the workers of Australia. Let me illustrate Dr Hewson's idea of who he thinks the workers of Australia really are. On his figuring, those earning up to $20,000 would receive a gain in after tax income of 4.8 per cent. For those on $30,000, or those earning around about the average weekly rate, the gain is supposed to be 6.8 per cent. But for those on $50,000 the gain is 12.4 per cent, and for those on $75,000, which is 2.5 times average earnings, the gain peaks at a massive 14.7 per cent. In 1991 less than 2 per cent earned $75,000 or more. That 2 per cent of Australians is the Leader of the Opposition's idea of the workers of Australia. That is his idea of lower middle income earners. That is his idea of targeting-give the 2 per cent the massive increase and do not give a damn about those at the bottom. In Dr Hewson's distributional analysis no allowance at all is made for the impact of the $10 billion spending cuts upon those people. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you remember that great Australian book The Magic Pudding. Its motto was 'cut and come again'. That is how Dr Hewson regards lower middle income Australia, as a magic pudding. He thinks he can slash them, cut them and come again, and come again. That is his view-$10 billion in cuts and living standards for those who can least afford it. Let me now tum to industrial relations. What Dr Hewson is promising is a return to the confrontation and the divisiveness of past. Forget about the great contribution working Australians have made to the historic fight against inflation. Australia today would not now have an inflation rate comparable with those of its major trading partners if had not been for the working men and women of this country. But forget about that. And forget about the great contribution that have made to responsible economic management. Throw that all out the window. Forget that, because of their contribution, we had 25 per cent increase in the exports of manumassive factured goods last year and that we have got a better performance in manufacturing exports than the rest of the OECD-made possible but only because of the combination of the entrether, preneurship of enterprise and the great conive structive cooperation of the workers of this country. Forget that. Do not give them any reward for what they have done. Under these divisive ideologues there would be no more national wage cases, and that would have devastating consequences for the lower paid people in this country. Incredibly, the Opposition is going to the people with platform of lower real wages. In his speech here today the Leader of the Opposition ed about lower real wages, and yet in his own document he is saying that by the end of the decade, if he was in government, real wages would be 0.3 per cent lower than when he came to office. That is what they promise. Forget about the rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition about higher real wages under the policies of those opposite. As I say, their own document refutes it. The Leader of the Opposition's proposals are fundamentally inequitable. No more national wage cases means that the living standards of ordinary workers would inex0rably decline through the rest of this decade. How are they going to achieve lower real wages in a deregulated labour market? It can only be, as my Ministers have said, through tighter monetary policy. You have got no wages policy. You have got fixed fiscal policy. In those circumstances, the only answer is tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates. There is only one thing that the Australian people would be certain about at the time the of the next election-which will not be to that morrow but will be in 1993-(Extension of time granted) The only thing that the Australian electorate can be certain of in regard to the Opposition when they go to the election it in 1993 is that the Leader of the Opposition would impose a massive 15 per cent tax on everything that they buy, which would raisethey remember this; do not forget it-a massive $27 billion. That is the measure. As individuals in Australia think with great apprehension, a 'What does it mean for me? It means that increase on everything I buy for myself and the kids', they may to some extent be comforted by the fact that it is not only they also their neighbours, all Australians togewho are going to be slugged for a mass$27 billion. That is what this man is going to impose on them. That is the one thing they can be certain of: a 15 per cent tax on food, a 15 per cent tax on bus fares, a 15 per cent tax on clothing and a 15 per cent tax on all the necessities of life. When it is all stripped away, that is the poison pill that the Leader of the Opposition a is asking the people of Australia to swallow. Everything else is speculation. It is not just a talkgoods and services hoax; it is not just a consumption tax. It is an assumption tax. It assumes that all the numbers add up; that everything will be all right; that no-one will notice that it is based on speculation and conjecture and crazily optimistic modelling. It is a hoax. As the Australian people come to penetrate, as they will with our assistance, all the thickets of those 600 pages, they will see the cold and nakedly opportunistic threat of it all. The Australian people will be facing the fact that as the Leader of the Opposition stands before them, like the emperor with no clothes-surrounded by statistics and rhetoric that add up to precisely nothing-his package is, indeed, a massive fraud. The Leader of the Opposition goes to the question of vision. I will deal with that issue in conclusion. Some of the very real benefits of this Government's reform program are already in evidence, as acknowledged, as I said yesterday, by the Liberal Party's own leader in New South Wales. He has paid tribute to the impact on ordinary Australians now of the programs, the policy and the vision of this Federal Labor Government. He spelt it out. I know what the people of Australia would rather have. Would they rather have the Leader of the Opposition writing down their country, pulling it down, or would they rather have the honesty in this regard of Mr Greiner, who pays tribute to the impact on Australia now of the vision that we brought to government and have been translating through relevant, decent policies so that they are now reflected in the realities of this country? I have no problem in addressing the question of my vision. Let me say that my vision, which is embraced in the Government's reform program, encompasses these things. I proudly stand up and say: this is not only my vision; it is the vision of my Ministers; it is the vision of all the members of this Government; and it is the vision of my Party. I will describe that vision. It is a vision of a tolerant, multicultural society of equal opportunity in which the disadvantaged and the underprivileged receive genuine government assistance. That is at the heart of our vision. Our vision is of a low inflation economy with sustained job growth. Our vision is of the courage to continue to deliver sustained structural adjustment through the sheer hard yakka of negotiation and not through confrontation - through talking with workers on the waterfront and through talking with employers on the waterfront; not by putting troops on the waterfront. My vision also encompasses an environmentally sensitive and more competitive country enmeshed firmly in the Asia-Pacific region. Above all, my vision, and the vision of my Government and of my Party, is one founded on confidence in this nation's future and in its richest resource-that is, the Australian people. We have confidence in those people. In implementing our vision, this side of politics believes in the active and the constructive involvement of government; not the cop-out of government. That is what we believe in. Let me say this-and I wish that those honourable members opposite would understand the truth of this-government is not an experiment in Darwinian theory where only the fittest survive. That is not what government is about. Government is not about an exercise in Darwinian theory where only the fittest survive. The Leader of the Opposition's consumption package is not a vision, but it is a cold, calculated, ideological approach which would see a return to divisiveness, a return to confrontation and a return to polarisation in our community. The Opposition's 15 per cent consumption tax will hit hardest the most vulnerable, weakest people in the Australian community, such as parents, pensioners and low to middle income earners. Whatever the Leader of the Opposition's vision is, one thing we can be sure of is that it does not include those groups. It does not include the poor and the underprivileged-those people who need the help of government. I conclude by saying this to the Leader of the Opposition: he is talking about an election-not an election tomorrow, but an election in 1993. Between now and 1993, not only will he have me, my Ministers, my members and my Party out there explaining and exploding this hoax, but also, increasingly, will great numbers of important and significant interest groups be out there. In 1993 he will suffer the fate that he has suffered in every election since 1983.",95
306,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I take the opportunity that is afforded me by the amendment moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to respond to some of the unbelievably wild accusations and statements made by the Prime Minister in this debate. I will work from the words of the Prime Minister's amendment. The first point that the Prime Minister makes is that the Fightback! document is supposed to a massive fraud on the people of Australia. This is from the man who has perpetrated more massive frauds on the people of Australia and on his colleagues than any other single individual in the history of this country. Was it not a massive fraud when you, Prime Minister, went all over the countrY saying that there would be no recession? Was that not a massive fraud, when you knew that in the run-up to the last election the probability was very high that there would be recession? You denied it and denied it and denied it. That was a massive fraud on the people of Australia. I notice that the Prime Minister is scurrying out with his tail between his legs at this particular time-another massive fraud. He has no genuine interest in what is in the best interests of the people of Australia. He worries only about himself-always has; always will. Second, of course, was the statement we heard to the effect that there would be no child living in poverty. Was that not a massive fraud, when the Prime Minister went ahead with an interest rate policy which one of our church leaders had to point out to him was actually putting more and more Australians in poverty? Was that not a massive fraud on the people of Australia? There are a host of frauds right through his eight years of government. But perhaps the biggest fraud of all was the deal done at Kirribilli House-the Kirribilli House conspiracy-with the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), to pass over the prime ministership of this country, the single most important office in this land, to the then Treasurer after the next election. Who was there to witness that deal, but big business and big unions. Bill Kelty from the union movement and Sir Peter Abeles from the business community were the two people chosen as witnesses to the greatest fraud perpetrated on the people of Australia, in that the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer went out and argued the case for Bob Hawke as Prime Minister. That was a massive fraud. The character of the man is revealed by what happened after the agreement. He welshed on the deal. That is what has precipitated the deepest and most protracted leadership challenge that this country has seen in the last few months. It is a poisonous leadership challenge which has divided and paralysed this Government to the point where the challenge is totally fatal. So, in regard to the Prime Minister's first point about frauds, he is the fraud; his Government is the fraud. There are dozens and dozens of examples to demonstrate that case. The Prime Minister then went on to argue that the Fightback program would do three things: it would polarise the people of Australia; it would re-entrench privilege in Australia; and it would lead to confrontation in Australia. What is more polarising than what has happened in the last 18 months to two years as the recession which the Government said we had to have has been thrust on average Australians and average Australian families? That has fundamentally divided people in this country as they have been forced into the worse financial circumstances since the 1930s. That will polarise this country more than anything else. But, most importantly, let us look at the entrenchment of privilege. What could be a bigger position of privilege than that enjoyed by Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson as they sit in the echelons of government, unelected, and determine the outcome of policy in this country? What could be more privileged than the two people who sat there at Kirribilli House- Sir Peter Abeles and Bill Kelty? What could be more privileged than that, at the expense of the people of Australia? What could be more privileged than the deals that have bee- done over the years that have cost the livelihood of the average Australian? The deals that were done on Coronation Hill, for example, and on Wesley Vale with the Green movement-that is privilege. That is real privilege. That was a couple of Labor mates who led the Green movement getting a deal out of the Government to block major development projects that cost Australians jobs. That is real privilege. What could be more privileged than a waterside worker today? We saw the example of $107,000 for 27 hours of work What could be more privileged when nearly one million Australians have been thrown on the unemployment scrap heap? What could be more privileged than those examples? This Prime Minister is continuing to deliberately mislead the people of Australia about what he is on about and what his Government is on about. We talk about confrontationl Gee whizl We see the confrontation that is now inherent in our system-for which those opposite set the example. What is the best example of confrontation in Australia? It is Hawke versus Keating. That is the great example of confrontation in Australia. That is the example those opposite set for the people of Australia. They are so fundamentally divided that they cannot govern themselves and, as the Prime Minister correctly said in the last election campaign, 'If you can't govern yourselves you can't govern the country'. So the Prime Minister has deliberately and knowingly again misled this Parliament and the people of Australia by the claims about fraud, by the claims about polarisation, by the claims about privilege and by the claims about confrontation. Let us look at the specific points that he made. He focused on our expenditure cuts and said that we were just going to drop all these people onto the scrap heap. He obviously has not read the document to see how we actually target that expenditure and how we do try to identify the genuinely needy, yet at the same time helping those who are desperate to get back into the work force, desperate to get a job, and desperate to be able to look after their own families rather than putting out their hand in the queue. He did not go into any of the processes that we have put in place: the training programs, Austrain, the work for the dole scheme-the phenomenal, innovative changes that are there to help people to help themselves to get back into the workplace. That is what we mean by compassion. We will look after the genuinely needy, and indeed we do look after them in this package. We will give the genuinely needy a significantly bigger increase in their pensions and other benefits than is warranted by the price effects of the goods and services tax. Disabled pensions, carers pensions, widows pensions and age pensions will receive an 8 per cent basic increase against a 4.4 per cent cpr increase, and a host of other benefits is targeted into those groups. It is again a gross misrepresentation of the facts to say that we are cutting these people and do not care about them. We care about them. We have genuine compassion and we back it up with genuine dollars to those who are in genuine need. People will be helped back into the work force by the most innovative set of training programs and other things that this country has ever seen. Firstly, the Prime Minister focused on industrial relations. He said that the workers of Australia had made a great contribution to this country. By that he meant that he had cut their standards of living and they had not yet voted him out; that is what he meant. He cut their standard of living like you have never seen over the course of this Government. The Fightback! document shows the fate of the average single income and double income family with kids under the administration of Bob Hawke. They know what has happened. They have been sold down the river. They were sold down the river by this document and this industrial relations system built around the accord. What a funny document. It makes us internationally uncompetitive because our nominal unit labour costs-the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) should look it up--have gone about double those of our trading partners over the life of this Government and we have become increasingly uncompetitive. Secondly, those opposite were supposed to have looked after the interests of the workers. What have they done? They have cut real wages and real living standards of workers. What a perverted sense of success. Thirdly, they elevate Bill Kelty to that privileged position-the third failing of the accord-so that he can block all the reforms. That document, their industrial relations poliey, is a sham. There is only one way to develop an effective system of industrial relations in a country such as Australia. To do that we have to jettison the ideas and the values and the attitudes that have been built up over the last 90 or 100 years under the centralised process of wage determination. We have to break away from the centralised wage determination process and put the decision on wages and conditions back at the workplace level. That is where we will get wages related to performance. That is where we will get workers lifting their game. They will not raise their productivity under you. Why should they? Every time they tum up-that is, if they manage to keep their job-they get 5, 6 or 7 per cent a year without doing any more. You will never get productivity and this country will never become internationally competitive under that system. There is only one way to do it. It is to get the Government out of the way and to get the workers and the employers to sit down together at the workplace to negotiate the terms and conditions-a common shared sense of direction for their company, just as we all have to have a common shared sense of direction for this nation. The third area the Prime Minister picked on was tighter monetary policy. How on earth are we going to have a tighter monetary poliey when we are running surpluses year after year in fiscal policy? We are not like you, starting off with a fictional surplus a couple of years ago at $9 billion, and turning that to a deficit this year of about $5 billion, on your numbers. That is a massive stimulus. That is going to keep our real interest rates where they are, which is 3 or 4 per cent above those in the rest of the world. That is why Australians are still suffering, business is still sufferworse ing and house buyers are still suffering under the legacies of your policies. You are the high priests of high interest rates-and you have got the hide to say that we are going to put them up. Have a look at the program. Look at the first year where we concentrate on cuts in government expenditure and building the fiscal surplus relative to our 1990-91 figuring. We take pressure off interest rates. We can get interest rates down. We can move the exchange rate more in the direction of its long term competitive level. That was another gross misrepresentation of the facts. Fourthly, the Prime Minister argues about the 15 per cent that is going to be added to everything under the goods and services tax and makes two gross misrepresentations in doing that. Firstly, the average price effect is 4.4 per cent. We are abolishing payroll tax. We are abolishing sales tax, and we are abolishing petrol excise. That will cascade through the system. I believe the inflation effect will not be anywhere near 4.4 per cent because of the extent to which those sorts of costs and taxes are built into the business infrastructure. When we get them off we both create jobs and start to get inflation down. When we get inflation down we get interest rates down. When we get them down we can run an easier, not a tighter, monetary policy. You have got it dead wrong again on points three and four. The second thing you did wrong about the 15 per cent is that you forgot to mention that people are compensated and that we have gone out of our way with the most innovative set of proposals to compensate people for the impact of the introduction of the goods and services tax. Average Australian families will be significantly better off. We are not claiming-as the Prime Minister said we had-that nobody will be worse off and that everybody will be better off. We do not claim that because some people in Australia will be visibly worse off. Those in the black economy who do not pay tax are going to be worse off. Tourists are going to start to pay a bit of the costs of using our infrastructure. Those who will not pull their weight and get out to look for a job and who fail the work test will be off under our policy. But, for the great bulk of Australians, the group those opposite have forgotten, those in the $20,000 to $50,000 income group, one should look at the total benefits, not just at the tax cuts as the Prime Minister did. The tax cuts, the family benefits and the health insurance rebates are targeted in at the bottom. As we go up the income s-ale the benefits are taken off people and people start to pick up the cost of their health insurance and to lose their family assistance. That is why the system not only compensates people but overcompensates people. It significantly overcompensates the people who matter in Australia, the average working Australians trying to raise their families and to give their kids a decent standard of education and a decent standard of living. We unashamedly looked after them and overcompensated them. In that sense that is a fourth gross misrepresentation by the Prime Minister. Finally, the Prime Minister went on to talk about the benefits of his Government-I must admit that it was a very brief discussion - and his vision. He had to stand there and read it. He said, 'My vision is that the disadvantaged and underprivileged-I have not met one, as I haven't been to my electorate in years-will be looked after. We have environmentally sensitive policies', and so on. Why should we believe him? He has had eight years. If that is his vision, he has not got anywhere near it. In fact, in almost every one of the areas he listed, he has gone the other way. He has no sense of vision and no capacity to deliver what is required in Australia. We unashamedly have taken on this package. Sure, it is full of some tough decisions, some benefits and some costs; but we have to make fundamental change in Australia. We have to break the mould, change attitudes, change values and change policies. We have to bring about a generational change, a change to the generation that has given us people such as the Minister who has just walked in, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). He is a Whitlam product of extraordinary proportions who has no understanding of what has to be done. We do not say to people, 'Don't ask what the Government can do for you; ask what you can do for your government'. Rather, we say to them, 'Think about what you can do for yourselves and what you can do for your children'. That is what Fightback! is all about. That is the sense of vision that this Prime Minister cannot even go close to understanding.",99
307,Mr KERIN,PRIME MINISTER,"I reject the Opposition's censure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and, of course, I support the Prime Minister's amendment. If the behaviour and deluded claims of the Opposition this week are anything to go by, pity help the Australian people if the Opposition is ever to become the Government. We just heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) effectively denigrate Australian workers. Again, he has uttered the mistruth that we have cut the living standards of the Australian workers since we came into government. He pays no recognition whatsoever to the social wage. He pays no recognition whatsoever to the wage-tax trade-off. He pays no recognition to the fact that through the late 1980s, during the boom times, the Australian workers and the ACTU exhibited more discipline than this country has ever seen before. The truth of the matter is that there has been no cut in real living standards, as I constantly reiterate. If only the Leader of the Opposition could read the tables, that would be proved to him. Average family household real disposable income has gone up by 24 per cent since we came to government and real private consumption, the standard of living, is up by 10 per cent. Mr Reith-What nonsense!",102
308,Mr KERIN,PRIME MINISTER,It is the truth. Mr Reith-It is not true.,102
309,Mr KERIN,PRIME MINISTER,The stunts and disruption we have seen this weekMr Reith-Ask anybody in the galleries. Go and ask a few real people.,102
310,Mr KERIN,PRIME MINISTER,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should read some straight-out tables; it is all there. It is in the papers. The stunts and disruption we have seen this week are all about confusing the Australian people. The Opposition knows that if it creates enough dust, the reality of the 'Frightpack' package, its essence, its implications and what it means for the average Australians, will not be quietly and honestly explained to them. We will be honestly and quietly explaining this package and all its elements right through 1992 into 1993. The package will wither with the heat of examination. Here it is in late spring. As we go through the summer, the leaves will start dropping off. It will never see another spring. It is a very deciduous package. After 8112 years in opposition, after having won only one mainland State election in nearly a decade, the Liberal parliamentary Leader has finally delivered a political program or election manifesto. Composed by economists, its only rank and file content is reflected in obeisance to the old and New Right conservative dogma. All the old conservative prejudices are there-the deserving poor, the trickle down, work for the dole, vouchers for education, rebate for health, wipe out the unions and expose the weakest to the greatest risk. It is all there. I am prepared to concede that it is a comprehensive document. We will respond to it in due time out in the electorate. I am not going to comment in depth until I have studied the document in depth. It deserves that. It will be done properly. We will debate any particular relevant issue in it. But we as the Government have a bigger job to carry out-that is, getting on with the job of government. Today the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) asked me a couple of questions, quoting a document from the Public Service. If he informs me which department it comes from, its date and who wrote it, the Government will be able to advise him of its status, its relevance, its relationship to any other document analysis, and whether or not he can read. It cannot be a relevant Treasury document. The central problem with the 'Frightpack' is the effect of the interaction of the Opposition's policies in total, not just an extra 15 per cent consumption tax, and its implications for macro-economic management. The ingredients in the magic pudding are the wrong ones, its baking will prove to be impossible and the cooks will end up badly burnt. The Australian people will never let the cooking proceed, let alone swallow this nonsense. The Opposition's 'Frightpack' document is an attempt to con the ordinary people of Australia into thinking that this package provides a viable alternative policy to the comprehensive reforms which this Government has put in place over the past nine years and is continuing to put in place at a pace unprecedented in Australia's history. It will not con anybody. By the time. I and this Government have finished taking it apart argument by argument, paragraph by paragraph, in its entirety, there will be nothing left except a heap of ruined political aspirations on the Opposition's side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition has been arguing for the past week that the package must be considered in its entirety, so let us do that. In its entirety it is nothing more than a monumental hoax. It has nothing other than tried, tested and failed monetarist prescriptions dressed up with a package of illusory tax cuts. These monetarist policies were implemented by Reagan and Thatcher. They resulted in a fiscal blow-out and poor trading performance, which, in Reagan's case, continued to beset the American economy. The same extremist policies also led to the severe de-industrialisation and poor trading performance in the British economy, together with the polarisation of British society into the haves and have-nots. We do not want that kind of society in Australia. What is the package all about? Let us get into the demolition of it. The package purports to spell out in minute detail, firstly, what is wrong with the Australian economy and, secondly, how the coalition will go about fixing it. It does not do either of these things. Nowhere in the entire 655 pages does the Opposition even attempt to seriously diagnose the problems which face the Australian economy. Nowhere in the document does it attempt to describe how its policy package will achieve its wish list of promised outcomes. It might seem that this is a mammoth oversight on the part of the Leader of the Opposition and his shoulder hugging bunch of free market cronies, but that is a trap into which I, this Government and the people of Australia will not fall. The coalition's Fightback, or 'Frightpack', document is not just a monumental hoax; it is also a cynical attempt to undermine just about everything that this Labor Government has worked for and achieved over the best part of the last decade. This Government has recognised that the key ingredient of the generation of long term sustainable growth in jobs in Australia is the achievement of low inflation and strong net export growth. To this end, the Government has stopped at nothing to secure the appropriate set of macro-economic, microeconomic, industry policy and industrial relations reforms. The net results of our endeavours are only now beginning to be realised. Let me spell them out. The Government has succeeded in reducing our inflation rate to its lowest level for 20 years. Australia's manufacturing export growth performance has been the best in the entire OECD area over the past five years. This is not by a small margin. Our growth rate of real exports of manufactures has averaged 15 per cent over the last five years, compared with an OECD average of 6 per cent. Let me repeat that: Australia's manufacturing export performance has been the best in the entire OECD area over the past five years. We are proud of these achievements which the Australian business community has delivered in response to our policies. The Government has done this by recognising that economies consist of people. It has done it by reducing industrial disputation during 1990, to the second lowest level since figures began in 1967. The coalition's Fightback package will undermine all these achievements. Let me spell out how this will happen, and let me turn to fiscal policy. The leaders of the Opposition have committed themselves to extremely tight fiscal policies. They have accompanied this with a so-called guarantee. This is worthless. Who cares whether the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) resigns? Once the GST was legislated in place, others could, and would easily, raise the rate. In the interim, with less direct tax revenues, tied expenditure plans and the removable so-called GST rates, the scope and power of fiscal policy will be totally evaporated. All macro-economic management, therefore, will be forced permanently onto tied monetary policy and high interest rates. Let us turn to monetary policy. The document points to inflation as being the economy's greatest fault, but nowhere does it even attempt to grapple with the underlying causes of inflation. Nowhere does it recognise that a proportion of Australia's inflation is imported due to the openness of the economy. Rather, its solution is to cominit monetary policy to a target inflation rate of zero to 2 per cent. This is done without any recognition of what world inflation may do. The only way this could be achieved is by severe monetary contraction together with unprecedented high real interest rates. This would cause investment to collapse, GDP growth to halt and unemployment to rise further, and it would worsen Australia's ability to compete in foreign markets in the long term. Any possible gains to families due to promised tax cuts would be wiped out by a multiple factor. This is an enormous hole in the package. Let me illustrate. The size of the average mortgage in Australia is about $40,000. The average size of new mortgages now being taken out is about $75,000. As I pointed out today, the average monthly repayment in these cases is about $420 and $850 respectively. Just say, conservatively, there is a 2-point increase in the interest rate on these mortgages, which amounts to an increase in payments of $60 per month and $113 per month. These increases would just about wipe out all the tax cuts. This is a conservative example. As I have said, with no other policy to fall back on the Opposition's package would most likely result in interest rate hikes much larger than this. Let us tum to trade performance. One of the fundamental arguments in the document is that the move to a consumption tax will improve the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and improve trading performance. This is wrong. Professors Martin Feldstein and Paul Krugman, the former a past President of the US Council of Economic Advisers and the latter one of the foremost authorities on modem trade theory, have formally demonstrated that a consumption tax in a floating exchange rate economy like Australia's will not improve trade performance-and will probably worsen it in the medium to long term. Let us look at the structural adjustment processes. The Fightback! document shows a complete absence of any awareness of economic, social and political processes. Many of the policies would result in severe industrial disruption which would negate and prevent any positive outcome. It is simply wrong to advance naive policies without any consideration of the political process through which they may be implemented. Mr Reith-Why did you do it?",102
311,Mr KERIN,PRIME MINISTER,"Why did John Howard point out all the arguments against a consumption tax in 1981. Nowhere in the document does the Opposition even attempt to grapple with the determinants of modem industrial structures in our economy and the complex processes of industrial and micro-economic reform. Yet it asserts that its policies will deliver an enormous boost to productivity across all the industries. How will this happen? I challenge the Opposition to explain the process. Nowhere in the document does the Opposition confront the complexity of modem international commodity markets and trading arrangements which Australia faces in its continual striving for better mance. So I challenge the Opposition to demonstrate even an awareness of these issues. Yet, in spite of the absence of even an attempt at genuine diagnosis of our problems, the Opposition asserts that the cure is simple. It involves the typical monetarist medicine of dismantling the social security system; replacing much of the present tax system with a regressive indirect tax on consumption; and using monetarist policies to achieve a targeted zero to 2 per cent inflation. Let there be no doubt that this whole magic pudding, all the recipes, all the elements, must give Australia a much higher inflation result and a much higher interest rate result. It is simply illusory to say that we can introduce a consumption tax and keep inflation down at zero to 2 per cent. If the Opposition ever got to power, if it ever implemented this package, the results for Australia would be de-industrialisation and disputation; a catastrophic collapse in investment and GDP growth; permanently high real interest rates; chronic industrial disruption; worse rather than improved trading and debt performance; reduced living standards for many Australians; and a worsened relative position of the economically disadvantaged at the expense of the rich. The sustained program of reforms which this Government has put in place over the best part of the last decade, as I said earlier, is now delivering its results. The Australian economy is now strategically positioned to deliver sustained growth in output and employment, with low inflation and strong net exports. The Opposition's policy package is not a credible alternative. Rather, it will undermine all these achievements and condemn our economy to low growth, high inflation, enormous industrial disputation and an abysmal trading performance. We will supply more detailed responses to the specific tax measures in due course. Meanwhile, let me summarise by saying that the Opposition's package is a worthless contribution. It does not even attempt to diagnose the causes of our economic constraints, yet it has the audacity to advocate net export perfor- the cures. This whole package is a sham. It will be exposed as such. It is a hoax. It attacks everything that the Labor movementordinary men and women in Australia-stands for and it will be exposed over the days and weeks and months ahead. We will expose it in our own time, and not in the Parliamentwe are in the business of getting on with government. We will expose it out there in the real world, where we are dealing with real people, not these fictitious figments of the mad Professor's mind.",105
312,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"The dogs are barking with the demise of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin). Leaks started last Monday. That is the fatal sign: when your own people start leaking against you and questioning your role and your work as Treasurer and, indeed, whether you are going to continue as Treasurer. The only thing the Treasurer did get right in his speech is that the economy consists of people. It might well do the House good to think about that, because here we have sitting on the Government benches of this House the Australian Labor Party, which is the only party in the world that has advocated a recession as a conscious policy decision. Shame on each and every Labor Party member for participating in a government that advocated a recession as a deliberate policy decision. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) said that this was the 'recession we had to have'. They are his exact words. All of you should go back to your electorates this weekend and hang your heads in shame. You should get down on bended knees to each and every one of the unemployed you encounter and apologise to them for the recession we in fact did not have to have-and the million unemployed that you have created in that regard. One week ago today the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) launched this tremendous Fightback package and changed, by that one act, the political landscape of this nation. This is what has stung the Government-the fact that the polls have swung in direct response to this package; the fact that each and every State branch of the Liberal Party and each and every State branch of the National party has strongly welcomed the package; and the fact that so many organisations welcomed the package-such as the VHIA, the AHA, the New South Wales farmers, the NFF, the NAFI, the IPA, the Housing Industry Association, the National Council of Independent Schools Associations, the National Catholic Education Commission, the Retail Council of Australia and the ANZ Bank group, just to mention some who have come out in full support of this package. Let us take up the Government's challenge. Let us go to an individual person, one of the grassroots people out there at the coal face dealing with people who are in hardship, ing with people who are in economic misery in parts of Queensland. This was brought to my attention by the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). I could do no better than quote this one individual-not an organisation; someone right out there battling to make ends meet as part of their operation. This is what the Reverend Owen Davies, an associate priest with the Maroochydore Anglican Church, had to say this week: Give GST a fair go ... We need radical reform of some sort to meet the needs of hurting Australia. We must restore incentive to business. To help those on social security benefits, the GST looks like a much better package than the double muddle of taxation we have now. Any change is a hassle. But in five years we may all be better off. Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and give to Lord what is the Lord's is the principal that I believe we should aim for. Mr Hewson has challenged us all to consider what is a better way forward for Australia. This is a full on appeal for us to deal with our selfishness. He has confronted us with the possibility of a more just form of raising revenue. The Hawke Government must come up with a better proposal and not merely resort to scare tactics. As a low income earner, I myself pay around 20c tax in every dollar I earn, and then there's another 20c hidden tax on most things I purchase. My initial impression is that the GST proposal will help many similar families. Amen to that. That is from the real people, the people who will have a chance to vote on the package, on abolishing no less than seven separate taxes and on reducing three other taxes. I am honest enough to say in this House that we have not convinced every organisation, but we have time on our side to do that. One organisation's release which I have seen says that it is not all that happy. That is because the Opposition has had the courage to make a major health policy decision, which many Government members have spoken about but have never had the courage to do. I refer to the Tobacco Council. We have had the courage to increase the excise by 25 per cent as a deliberate health policy decision, in a way which is tobacco user responsible and tobacco grower friendly. Mr Hulls interjecting",105
313,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"I am pleased to hear deal- the acknowledgment of the backbencher. What we have done is the sort of thing that Labor backbenchers have said should have been done but have not had the courage to do. We have made the tough decisions right throughout this document and we are standing by them. You have failed to address the real needs of this economy and, as a consequence, your days are numbered. I venture to suggest that the deal is in the making now. The drift could be heard up and down the corridors last night-'Yes, we'HIet the Prime Minister have the President's visit. Yes, we'lIlet the Prime Minister have the visit by Her Majesty the Queen. Then it's all bets off. Bye, bye, Bob Hawke'. The numbers will roll; the Caucus will decide; and out will go the Prime Minister. Sometime around the ides of March would not be a bad time to bet money on the demise of our Prime Minister; a Prime Minister who had the hide to enter this debate and extol the industrial relations virtues of this Government. The two bright, shining lights on that front were all to do with tearing up the activities of the industrial relations club. The SPC in Shepparton, in the electorate of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), dared to have the courage to try to put down a genuine enterprise agreement. John Halfpenny intervened, so it became a half-baked agreementbut better a half-baked agreement than no agreement-and immediately the SPC went from trading in the red to trading in the black, increased its employment and productivity, and set a shining light on the hill. That is what we can do if we start to get away from the centralised industrial relations approach. Power Brewing in Queensland is a shining example of what can be done by rocking the boat in respect of the constraints of the industrial relations club and all its centralised brokering. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is bereft on his own industrial relations record. He did so much to create unemployment, especially for the youth of Australia in yesteryear when he was President of the ACTU. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) comprehensively cleaned up the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), who is at the table, on the AM program this morning in a way which shows that we are the true parties of compassion, determination, job creation, hope and vision, and you are the tired party of creating recessions, one million unemployed and a five-fold increase in our foreign debt. One of the issues which has surfaced-I am delighted that it has, because our approach is comprehensive on this issue-is the absolute commitment to abolish Federal fuel excise. I have a bar graph which honourable members and members of the gallery, many of whom are motorists, can see from a distance and which shows the huge increase, by stealth, in petroleum products excise or Federal fuel excise by this Government. In 1982-83 this tax was a little over $1 billion; in the eight years of a Labor government it has risen to around $7 billion, a seven-fold increase in a tax grab through every petrol bowser around Australia. I have a long memory and I remember the former Treasurer, prior to becoming the Treasurer of this country and proceeding to wreck the economy of this country, saying that the Fraser Government was making every petrol bowser a branch office of the Australian Taxation Office. The Fraser Government did not do too badly because it kept the excise down to the 6c a litre level; this Government has gone for a four-fold increase, from 6c a litre to 25.76c a litre on Federal fuel excise. I say to the House in absolute terms that we will be abolishing this taxation by stealth. We will be abolishing the automatic indexation associated with Federal fuel excise, alcohol excise and even tobacco excise, in what is a very fair treatment of the respective industries I have mentioned. We will be doing better than that. We will be totally abolishing the Federal fuel excise, which will provide every motorist across Australia with a 19c a litre reduction in their petrol charges. A great benefit will flow from that across the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne and across country and coastal Australia. It will cost the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) his electorate when Mount Isa, Charters Towers and the Atherton Tablelands realise that he has put up his hand for a 19c a litre impost on all the motorists in the electorate of Kennedy and we have put up our hands for a 19c reduction in the motoring costs of all those in the electorate of Kennedy. Enough is enough. It is time this Prime Minister and this Government were despatched from office. It is time the handicaps were removed. It is time the anchors were weighed. It is time that Mr and Mrs Average Australian had a fair chance and a fair go, be they farmers or families. It is time for reality, leadership decisions and proper development-before it is too late. In stocktaking the Australian political scene, 1991 versus 1984, the more independent servers would agree on the enormous change which has come over this front bench. To begin with, for one reason or another, the following Ministers have departed: MCClelwe land, Hurford, Bowen, Young, Ryan, Grimes, Hayden, Brown, Cohen, Gietzelt, Uren-they have completely left Parliament. Then we across have those who should have left the Parliawhy ment by now: the honourable member for Blaxland, who should have left by now, given all that he has done in wrecking the economy; Senator Walsh; the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), a very cranky backbankruptcies bencher who is about to be knocked the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin); the honourable member for Shortland  Lalor (Mr Barry Jones); the honourable memto ber for Corio (Mr Scholes); and the honourlians able member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holdabolition ing). All have said, 'Enough is enough', and they have gone or have been pushed from the Ministry. It gets worse for the Government, because Ministers today are saying that they are not hanging about and they will not put their heads on the guillotine. They have seen the light. What has the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) done? He has announced running again. He has had enough. He wants out. He wants to depart from the scene. That great ace in the Senate, that great man honesty, Senator Button, is not hanging around either. He has had enough. He is smart enough to realise that this Government about to be thrown right out of office and not going to be a party to that. This Government is paralysed and pathetic. Government members are in their terminal phase as they serve out their time until the next election and cast around for tablets, including the hopeless big cities program which was dreamt up by the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), who nearly lost all his factional support because the deal was the Medicare cuts for the big cities program, and he was exposed on that. The sad irony is that in the mid-1980s we obsaw some recovery from drought, favourable terms of trade and a degree of breathing space in our economy. This Government has wasted that opportunity. It has created the recession did not have to have, it has created the enormous economic agony we did not have to have, and it has created so much misery Australia that that is part of the reason this package has taken off. In one sense, so long as it was comprehensive, it was always going to take off, because people have had enough of a regime which has led them down the path to destruction, to record and to all that is occurring in the off by economy across the nation today. I say again: enough is enough. It is time for this Government to go. It is time for Australia be given a chance. It is time for Austrato be given the chance to have the total of no fewer than seven taxes. That is the sort of striking action, the sort of sweeping action, the sort of determination, the sort of absolute commitment which adds up. So we are absolutely committed to the total abolition of sales tax, the total abolition of payroll tax, the total abolition, without qualification, of the petroleum prdducts excise, the total abolition of the superannuation lump sum tax, and the total abolition of customs duties, the training guarantee levy and the that he is not coal export duty. I support the original motion moved in this of House. The Government stands condemned; the Prime Minister stands condemned; and Australia now has some hope and vision in is the Fightback package to tum this economy is around and generate the jobs we desperately need.",106
314,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"We have all heard of the bunyip aristocracy, and we have just heard from the bunyip. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask that you require the Minister to withdraw that comment.",109
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER, The Minister must withdraw that remark.,109
316,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"If the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) takes offence, I will withdraw. But it is drawing a very long bow, if I might say so. Mr Tim Fischer-You still have not withdrawn.",109
317,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"I have withdrawn. The Leader of the National Party is drawing a very long bow. To say that someone on the other side is a bunyip, I would have thought, is almost a term of endearment. After all, the speech by the Leader of the National Party was an utter disgrace, and I could see the cringing in the Liberal Party as its members listened to it go on and on. But what this debate has revealed is a particular on the part of the Opposition from its Leader down. I sat in here and watched the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), both in Question Time and during this debate, and since the release of his package he has been exhibiting very clear symptoms of being extraordinarily touchy. He is extraordinarily touchy about the expose which is beginning to unfold of the Opposition's program. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition is not here to hear my remarks, but I will send him an autographed copy of what I say. He is making the' very great mistake of believing in his own infallibility. That is evidence of his political immaturity. He came in here in the last shower of rain and was elevated to the position of Leader of the Opposition within a period of about three years. And boy, oh boy, does it not show? Does it not show, Wal? Not all of us have been around here for as long as the Leader of the National Party, but I have been around here long enough to develop a bit of a thick skin. Anyone who has been around here and in politics for a while develops a bit of a thick skin, and does not jitter and seethe with anguish as soon as he is assailed with a bit of criticism or told that there are some deficiencies in what he is saying, or as soon as people say that maybe not everything, maybe not 100 per cent, of what he says is 100 per cent accurate. But the poor old Leader of the Opposition is still suffering from that affliction which so many academics suffer from, that is, he believes that he is infallible and that everything he says is true. Every criticism that he offers is not examined by him on its merit, but any attack on him is simply brushed aside as a lie. Time and time again in Question Time, as soon as the criticism starts to bite, he accuses his assailants of being liars, of telling untruths, of being dishonest. That is the surest sign of his political immaturity-a political immaturity which will become increasingly exposed by the processes which take place over the next 15 months. What these guys opposite have to remember is that they have released their policy 15 months before the next election. We do not have to respond to their puerile little motions. We do sensitivity not have to respond",109
318,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Opposition members interjecting,109
319,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER, Order! Members of the Opposition might cease interjecting.,109
320,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"It is their manifesto, not ours. Mr Ruddock interjecting",109
321,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for Dundas!,109
322,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"We do not have to respond to their particular election policy. But we will, and we have 15 months within which to do it. The very great and stark reality that they are going to have rammed home to them in the next 15 months is that we have 15 months to take apart this preposterous set of policies bit by bit. Bit by bit we are going to expose the underlying fraudulence of this particular policy. The Leader of the Opposition, in what I suppose in his case could be described as something of a flourish, said that he and his members opposite were prepared to put their faith in the ordinary Australian. Yet what was the great example he used as evidence of the economic efficiency of his particular package? He cited the example of a Queensland transport company which he said would have its tax burden relieved by his policy to the extent of $2m a year. Does he really think that that $2m a year is going to disappear? No. That $2m a year is going to be replaced by payment from someone else. It is going to be replaced by the users, both direct and indirect, of the services of that particular trucking or transport company. In other words, he is going to relieve the company of the burden of $2m a yearand where is he going to put it? Slap, bang on the sweating backs of ordinary Australians! This is the way in which the Liberal Party reposes its confidence and respect in ordinary Australians. It plonks a new tax on every living breathing Australian, regardless of age. Whenever ordinary Australians make any transaction involving expenditure, they are the ones from cradle to the grave who are going to be taxed-and taxed within an inch of their life. That is the way in which the Liberal Party is going to repose its confidence in the ordinary people of Australia in terms of its ability to deal with the problems which confront this country. Another example that honourable members opposite trot out as one of their so-called taxes for abolition is the training guarantee. Here again we have an example of the approach that a coalition government would take. What is the purpose of the training guarantee? To collect revenue? No. What I said at the time of its introduction was that it would succeed when we collected zero as a result of the imposition of the training guarantee. What are we collecting at the moment? Something like $2 1hm, and going down. The impact of the training guarantee, contrary to the deception within the Liberal Party document, has meant that companies and employers in Australia have responded, and those who were spending nothing on the training of Australian workers are now spending at least one per cent, and next year 1112 per cent, of their payroll on ordinary Australians. That is the way in which a government reposes confidence in the Australian people: by building up their skills, giving them a greater capacity",109
323,Mr FILING,PRIME MINISTER,It is a tax.,110
324,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"It is not a tax, you bonehead. The point is that a tax is something",110
325,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! I think the Minister might withdraw that.,110
326,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"I withdraw. I will think of some other epithet at some later time. The point is that a tax is something which the Government collects, whereas the training guarantee is something which the Government does not collect. It is something which Australian employers now spend to the benefit of their own employees-that is, spend to make their employees better Australians; spend to make them better workers; spend to make them more productive workers; spend to help them enjoy their jobs with more satisfaction; spend so that they can make a greater 'contribution to the welfare of their enterprise and, of course, to the country as a whole. As each day goes by, we have another revelation about the essential deception involved in this set of proposals. The Leader of the National Party said that this morning the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) did me like a dinner. I do not know whether he did me like a dinner, but he did himself like a dinner and he did the Opposition like a dinner. In the text of what he had to say this morning he revealed a basic weakness in the calculation, a weakness to which I referred yesterday, a weakness he has now confirmed from his own mouth. Let me briefly take honourable members through it, because it relates to the coalition's approach to assistance for the unemployed-I might advisedly put the word 'assistance' in inverted commas. The Opposition says that it intends to save $745m as a result of not paying benefits to those who are now receiving benefits by virtue of their lack of work, by virtue of their eligibility for the Job Search allowance or the Newstart allowance. You do not save $745m unless you take it from something like 90,000 Australians who are currently receiving it. The honourable member for Bennelong says that 20 per cent of those now receiving the benefit will no longer receive the benefit. That is what he says. He says 80 per cent would go onto special benefit and the other 20 per cent would lose the benefit and go onto Austrain or go onto the work for the dole scheme. If people go onto work for the dole the coalition does not save anything, because it will still be paying the dole to those who are having to work for it. If people go onto special benefit, the Opposition is still paying it, becauSe the amount of special benefit equals the amount of the unemployment benefit, although the conditions for receiving it are far more stringent and you need a huge army of bureaucrats to try to enforce the provisions of the special benefit compared with the other arrangements as they exist. The honourable member for Bennelong said: The other 20 per cent, some of them will go the Austrain schemethat is what I call Aus-slavesome of them will go into work for the dole scheme. Where then do the savings come from? The savings come from this illusory scheme of Aus-slave, which assumes that for every person who manages to get a position under this so-called Austrain there would have a one for one reduction in the number of people receiving unemployment benefit or the Newstart allowance. That is simply imposevery sible, because the Hewson hurdy-gurdy, Frankly, churning away, will ensure that there is huge displacement effect. When we introduce schemes like Jobstart, which is a properly funded wage subsidy scheme, we acknowledge the fact that for document says: every three people who go onto Jobstart there is a net reduction of only one in the number of people who come off the benefit. The Opposition cannot legitimately claim any more than that in their Austrain scheme, and that would be the maximum. Even the honourable member for Bennelong says that those opposite cannot guarantee people places; employers will not provide her them. Therefore the savings they have calunemployed. culated are wildly in excess of what they could possibly expect to save as a result these measures-unless they have as a fundamental objective actually sending people into abject poverty and starvation as a result of denying them the benefit. The coalition cannot have it both ways. Either 20 per cent of people will be denied the benefit and denied any income support or, alternatively, the coalition will not make its savings. That will drive a hole of probably a few hundred million dollars into its savings and therefore into the reliance anyone can have on the funding of the proposed income tax cuts. The same can be said of the abolition of the self-employment assistance program. That program provides an alternative to the Newstart allowance to people who are establishing themselves in small business. If you rip away the props from them as they are struggling to get their small businesses under way, all that happens is that they come off the into self-employment program and go back onto the unemployment benefit or Newstart allowance. The $22m that you are proposing to spend there is entirely illusory or, if I can be more direct, fraudulent. As I say, as every day goes by, another chink, another hole, is driven into this package. Every time we drive another hole into the package, we drive another stake into the to be heart of the Leader of the Opposition. We will see him squirm, sweat, blush and seethe with anguish, as he has been doing today and day since the release of this program. he cannot take the criticism which is a being dished out by us and which will continue to be dished out. One accurate sentence is perhaps revealed by accidental candour on the part of the Opposition. On page 209 the The Coalition is determined to restore full unemployment as a practical and realistic goal. When you mesh that with what the honourable member for Bennelong said about his admiration for the policies of Mrs Thatcher, I think you can understand why. When she came to office, there were 1.2 million Britons unemployed. Four years later, at the time of first election, there were 3 million Britons I think Mrs Thatcher-dear old Margaret, one of the parents of your program of - would the very proud of your ambition to re-establish real unemployment in this country, as you reveal, perhaps accidentally, in a rare display of honesty, on page 209 of your program.",110
327,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I rise to support the motion of censure. I do so because although last week the coalition's Fightback program was presented to the Australian electorate, in response we have had from the Government nothing but misrepresentation and lies. The contribution just made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) was typical of all the presentations and speeches made by Government members today. I timed him, and the first seven minutes of his 15 minutes was nothing but personal abuse; he totally failed to address the issues. In the second half of his speech, as he started to address some issues, he moved onto gross misrepresentation of what is being proposed and misrepresentation of the benefits that would flow to the Australian public. He talked about the tourist operators and said, 'You are just taking a tax off business and placing it upon the sweated backs of hard working Australians'. It is true that as we abolish taxes on business and give business the opportunity to create employment we impose a tax generally on expenditure. But it is not true to suggest that it is a 15 per cent increase in the price of things that people buy, because we will abolish many hidden consumption taxes. It was very surprising, even to me-and I have been closely associated with this for some time-to see the extent by which Labor has increased its hidden consumption taxes in the time that it has been in office. The average family on about $28,000, a man and his wife and two kids, is today paying between $45 and $50 a week in hidden consumption taxes. This Government loves hidden consumption taxes because it reckons it can put them up, tax people by stealth and get away with it. That is a policy of deception and deliberate misrepresentation. The Government believes that it can continue that policy. The tourist operator example that the Minister gave was misleading, because many of the people who will travel in tourist buses will be foreign tourists. We say that foreign tourists ought to make a contribution to the infrastructure paid for by Australians. That is one of the benefits of the Fightback policy. It will be no great shock to the foreign tourists. Virtually all the leading industrialised nations already have such a tax system. The coalition's proposed tax system is a much fairer tax system, and I am sure most Australians will agree with it. I skip past the Minister's fatuous remarks about his training guarantee levy, but let me cut through the nonsense he spoke about the coalition's integrated policy of training for the unemployed. The bottom line is that the Minister would prefer people to be on the dole rather than to be at work. We stand for a policy that gives people a chance get their foot in the door and to actually get some experience and get a job and keep a job. I am very proud of that aspect of the training proposals that we have put to the Federal Parliament and to the Australian people. Nearly one in three young people are unemployed. Those young people will be scarred for life unless we make some big changes to give them a chance to get a job. I think it is a disgrace for honourable members opposite to oppose a sensible measure that will give those young people a chance. I believe that when we get into the next election there will be very strong support from a lot of people for that particular proposal. This week the Government ran away from the debate about the coalition's Fightback program until it was shamed into starting to respond to the very positive elements contained within it. Today we have had a glimpse into the reasons that the Government has been so slow in coming forward to respond to the coalition's Fightback proposal. The bottom line is that the reason it has not been able to mount an attack on it is that the advice it has been given from the Public Service is that there are no major flaws in it. We have had made available to us by our friends within the Public Service a document that comprises a very extensive analysis of the Government's projects. Sure, at the margin there are some criticisms of various aspects of the coalition's package but, at the bottom line, the truth of the matter is that this is a very comprehensive package that has already withstood the onslaught from the Government and the huge bureaucracy that it has set to work to attack and to undermine the one great vision that is held out for the Australian people for the year 2000. This motion is to censure the Government for misleading people about the proposals that we have put. Members of this Government are masters at misleading people. For example, on the unemployment issue this Government was saying that unemployment would be peaking early next year and then basically starting to come down. We know it has been misleading people because again we have had some advice-in fact, something dropped off the back of a truck-which reveals that the advice the Government is receiving is very different from what it is saying publicly. In fact it is suggested that unemployment will go higher than the Government says it will go and that it will stay higher than what it ing, and that the number of long term unemployed, those unemployed for 12 months or more, will rise from 210,000 to 300,000 or maybe 350,000. It has to be said: these people lie through their teeth about the circumstances facing the Australian economy. When confronted with a document which contains some real solutions, honourable members opposite have absolutely no shame whatsoever in doing a complete back flip to oppose measures which they themselves, a few years ago, publicly said were a good idea. When we have nearly one million people unemployed, and a lot more who would like to work more if they could have a chancethey have a job but would like to work that extra day or extra couple of days a weekabolishing the tax on employment is a great idea. It is just appalling that these people here should stand and oppose it when they themselves, just a few short years ago, actually advocated it. We have the quotes here of what the Prime Minister said about the benefits of abolishing payroll tax. In the Melbourne Age of December 1977-this indicates it is not a view the Prime Minister has had just in the last few years; it is a long term view--he said: Abolition of the payroll tax will reduce the cost of employing the present workforce by $1700 million a year. This means employers could boost their employment by up to 150,000 without any increase in their total labor costs.",112
328,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"That was 13 years ago. He said that we could get an extra 150,000 people into jobs, and now he denies the very same proposition. Payroll tax was $1,700m then; he is now imposing nearly $6 billion on employers to prevent people getting jobs. The report of his comments went on to say: Payroll tax is a tax on labour and its abolition would reduce labour costs. It is as much a part of an employer's costs as the wages it is levied on. Mr Hawke said the abolition of the tax would reduce the cost of employing the present work force by $1700 million a year. He also said: With our policies of reduction in payroll tax and increases in public outlays, we think we can drop is say- the number of unemployed by 200,000. Imagine the number of people who could have work now but for the silly political games that those opposite play. On the wholesale sales tax, honourable members opposite themselves advocated the abolition of the wholesale sales tax just a few short years ago. The Prime Minister was going around the country saying we ought to abolish the wholesale sales tax. He said: It will be a tragedy for Australia if we baulk at tax reform because it might hurt me here, it might hurt you there. Now for God's sake, let's, as Australians, say what does Australia as a whole, what do our children need in the next generation. Do they want a tax system which has just been slip shod, mish mashed together over thirty years, with no point or purpose, and which is inefficient? ... you can't have a continuation of a tax system which is haemorrhaging, imposing burdens on those least able to bear them, economically inefficient . .. if Australia refuses to face up to this issue, we'll slop through . . . we'll slop through . . . Our children will pay an enormous price if through our self-indulgence and self-interest we refuse to remedy this system. That is what the Prime Minister said. Here we have his self-interest, his self-indulgence paraded before the Australian public preventing the big changes that this country so desperately needs so we can get Australia back to 'work. It is no wonder honourable members opposite are running away from the issues. The last thing honourable members opposite want to talk about is the substance of the reforms that we propose. They ought to be embarrassed that we are proposing many of the things that for 20 years Australians have said ought to be done, but few have had the courage to publicly advocate those changes. Even as we debate these issues today, we have the latest data on foreign investment in Australia. Our debt went up again, by 2 per cent, to $133 billion. Wake up, Australia! We are up to here in debt! In our own family budgets we cannot just go on borrowing to pay the interest bill. That is what Australia is doing-we borrow to pay our interest bill. We know in our own family budget that, if we do that, some day they will come into take out our furniture. The sheriff will arrive to clean us out. Australia has to face up to that fact.",113
329,Mr HOWE,PRIME MINISTER,Such a lovely bloke. You are another Lynch.,114
330,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"It is no good the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services sitting there, enjoying the benefits of his white car and his big salary and everything else. This country is going broke under his management and somebody has to be prepared to stand up publicly and say what has to be done. Look at company profits, for example. The September quarter estimate of $2,982m is still 17 per cent less than for the September quarter of 1990 and 35 per cent less than for the September quarter for 1989. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in his remarks was talking about high levels of gross operating profit share. That is simply not true. Honourable members opposite have to face the facts. This country will have to change, and we will have to make some big changes. It is no good the Treasurer saying that people's living standards are going up. No-one believes him. That is not true. Get out and talk to the people who, in mistaken moments, voted for him in the last election. People's living standards are not rising, and they will not rise in the months and years ahead unless we take the opportunity to make some big changes. We have massive debts, we have a huge number of people unemployed and we have many more wanting work. Incentive has been stifled, and just at a time when we want to encourage people to work harder, to be more productive, to be more efficient and to boost our national income, we have a tax system that actually penalises that capacity of people to work harder. We actually discourage people from doing the very things that need to be done to turn Australia's circumstances around. That is why we have proposed the abolition of seven taxes-not one tax, but seven taxes - and the introduction and replacement of some of those by a goods and services tax,. which is a much fairer tax system. The Minister ought to support that for a number of reasons, one of which is that it gives us a chance to tax the black economy. He is always talking about fairness; how about a bit of fairness for the PAYE taxpayer who pays more tax now because some of the Minister's mates cheat on the tax system? Australia ought to have a tax system based more broadly on expenditure, to make it a fairer tax system. We ought to encourage people to save. People say, 'What has the current account deficit got to do with me?'. It has a lot to do with every Australian. Because we have such massive debts to the rest of the world, we are all paying more interest than we should have to. For the average family it is about 3 per cent on the mortgage. We could get that down if, instead of relying on the savings of foreigners, we relied more on the savings of Australians. That is why, for example, a Hewson government will allow people to accumulate and gain interest on their savings tax free. I think that is a great idea. It is just another idea which has been talked about in Australia for years but which nobody has had the guts to do anything about. It is no good running a tax system when nearly half of what people earn goes to the Federal Treasury. People say, 'Why should I bother when nearly half of what I earn goes to the Federal Government?'. That is why under us 95 per cent of Australians will never pay more than 30c in the dollar. Running scare campaigns and misleading people will do those opposite no good and will do this country no good. We have a great challenge in front of us as members of this Parliament, that is, to address the issues and to be honest about what needs to be done. This Government has an obligation for honesty which so far it has failed to fulfil.(TIme expired)",114
331,Mr WILLIS,PRIME MINISTER,"I rise to support the amendment and oppose the motion. The package that the Opposition dropped a week or so ago is supposed to do many things to cure the problems of this country. It is supposed to increase employment by two million jobs and have unemployment by the end of the century, to increase productivity, to reduce inflation, to improve people's living standards and to enable us to control our foreign debt. It does not do any of these things, on the face of the Opposition's own calculations. The fact is that those opposite rely for their claims about employment on a calculation that does not include their principal reform, that is, the goods and services tax. They run a scenario that shows that there will be growth in employment of 1.8 million, not two million, by the year 2000, and they do this on a basis which does not include their principal reform, the goods and services tax. So one can take no notice of that. In other words, it is just a bogus claim and one which is put at the forefront of the package to try to make it look attractive to Australians as something which would provide lots of jobs. There is no reason to believe that at all. The abolition of payroll tax, which is part and parcel of what is put forward, is supplanted by a tax on employment through the consumption tax, which is a 15 per cent tax on value added. Value added is employment and the return to capital. It is a 15 per cent tax on employment replacing the payroll tax, which is generally around 5 per cent. Half a million out of 750,000 employers in Australia do not pay payroll tax. They will all pay the consumption tax. Those who export will get rebates for the export, but the vast majority of employers in Australia will pay the consumption tax. So they will payout tax on their employment. There is no reason whatever to see this as a tax change which is going to miraculously provide 100,000 jobs, or whatever number the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), was claiming in his comments a few moments ago. We are told that this program will increase productivity, but on the face of the scenario of those opposite it does not do so. Their scenario, which they say represents their path to the future, shows a growth in productivity of 0.8 per cent, against 0.9 per cent for the period during which this Government has been in office. So there is no increase in the growth of productivity at all. They say that it will reduce inflation, and yet for the period up to the year 2000 there will not be a level of inflation at the level at which they commit themselves, which is a rate of 0 to 2 per cent. Never in any of the years to the year 2000 docs their favoured scenario reach that level of less than 2 per cent inflation. They say that they will increase people's living standards, but in fact the scenario shows that real wages will fall. We will have no increase in real wages and therefore no capacity for people's real incomes to be increased. They say finally that they would give us control over foreign debtthat all this would bring about a miraculous productive cure which would enable us to control our foreign debt. However, their favoured scenario shows that net debt increases from 35 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 54 per cent in the year 2000. They have an incredible increase in foreign debt in that time. Quite clearly, on the face of this document, the miraculous cures for the Australian economy which it claims it will provide do not occur. We simply would not get them. Those opposite have no basis for the employment claim. Their productivity is less than has been achieved in the past. They do not get inflation down to the level which they claim they would. Real wages fall and foreign debt spectacularly increases. Yet this is supposed to be a new nirvana which is being offered to the Australian people. It obviously is none of those things. It is also supposed to be a vision for the future, a vision which shows where the Australian nation is going and what kind of society we can look forward to. What kind of society is it? The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) claims it is a society that provides genuine assistance with genuine dollars for those in genuine need. I think those were his words in his contribution this afternoon. But in fact one can certainly query whether that would be the likely outcome from the proposals of the Opposition, because what those opposite propose is a very severe tightening of eligibility requirements. Indeed, one could say that it is a virtual persecution of some elements of the welfare group at the present time, namely, people on social security, in a system which is already one of the most tightly means tested systems in the world and a system which has been dramatically tightened by this Government, whilst bearing in mind all the time the need to ensure that the genuinely needy were assisted, but not tightened to the point where it would cause real pain and not provide genuine assistance to people who are really in need. This package takes us way beyond the safety net vision which is there at the present time. It will eradicate that safety net and cause real distress to hundreds of thousands of people. As part of this package there is compensation of $2.6 billion for the goods and services tax to the welfare group on social security. At the same time there is a tightening of and cuts in expenditure on welfare of $2.4 billion. In other words, virtually all the compensation that is given to social security recipients is paid for by other social security recipients-$2.4 billion out of the $2.6 billion. That involves taking about $1.5 billion off the unemployed by such means as making them wait an extra two weeks for receipt of their first unemployment benefit cheque. There is already a three week wait and what those opposite propose would mean a five week wait. It would mean an enormous profusion of claims for special benefits, which are not allowed for in the calculations. If that was not able to be paid, it would mean enormous distress for many people who lose their jobs and have no income at all for five weeks. There are various other examples of tightening which I do not have time to go into. There is, of course, the absolutely ludicrous approach of saying to all those who have had more than six months unemployment, 'You must now get twice a fortnight from an employer a piece of paper signed by him or her which says that you have approached them for a job'. If they do not get that, they cannot get unemployment benefits. There are something like 345,000 people on Job Search allowance beyond the six months at this stage, or on Newstart. That works out to something like 18 million pieces of paper that have to be obtained from employers in this country in the course of a year. The absurdity of sending all these people spiralling around to employers who do not want to see them anyway and then driving people to desperation in trying to get an employer to sign this bit of paper-the whole system-is an absolute farce and just a persecution of the unemployed. There are many other examples one could go to. I think it is important to note, in looking at the assistance that is given to groups in the Opposition's package, that it shows in various income deciles what the level of assistance would be, and purports to show what real gains would will be achieved in various income deciles. The Opposition includes in this the goods and services tax, the abolition of various other taxes, the compensation and the personal income tax cuts. It does not include all of the cuts in benefits-the cuts in welfare expenditure-for people on those lower deciles. So the enormous improvement in welfare that people are supposed to get, according to this document, is an absolute fraud. It does not take any account of the $2.4 billion which is taken from people on benefits. Of course, as I mentioned in Question Time today, theirs is a vision of a society of the future in which not only are people on welfare persecuted but also people in poor bargaining positions in employment have many of their conditions of employment put at great risk. This is an Opposition which in government would seek to strip away the safety net of an award array of conditions and open up people in poor bargaining positions to the exploitation of employers who sought to strip away things such as the entitlement to four weeks annual leave; a 38-hour week, with overtime after that; long service leave; lunch breaks; sick leave; or whatever-the whole panoply of assistance which is there as a minimum requirement in awards. All of those things would be put at great risk because there would be no protection for people under the industrial relations system proposed by the Opposition. This proposed industrial relations system which, like the goods and services tax, seems to have been learned substantially from New Zealand would, I believe, cause great hardships to many people in poor bargaining positions, particularly those who are not union members or who belong to unions which have little in the way of substantial bargaining power with employers. Those people would be put in great difficulty in tenns of maintaining anything like their living standards. Despite that approach to industrial relations, the Opposition does not see in its scenarios great improvements to productivity or to real wages. In fact, the Opposition sees real wages going backwards. The society of the future envisaged by honourable members opposite not only deals the harshly with people who need safety nets but also gives maximum assistance to people the highest incomes. It provides income cuts at 4.8 per cent on incomes up to $20,000. Probably most of that tax cut-indeed, probthis ably mot:.e than that-would disappear in what those people would pay for the goods and services tax. However, for people on $75,000 a year, the income tax cuts would give an after tax benefit of 14.7 per cent. That is about 10 per cent more than people on as $20,000. For people on average weekly earntic ings-some 66 per cent of wage and salary earners are below average weekly earningsfrom the after tax income gain is 61/z per cent. Therefore, for people on higher incomes, the tax is infinitely better. To bias the income tax cuts in that way quite clearly shows the predilections of the Opposition-the kind of society that honourable members opposite see for the future. This is a society in which more assistance is given to people on the highest incomes and in which people who are genuinely in need are persecuted. That is the kind of society which they would produce. They would prejudice the positions of people with poor bargaining positions while benefiting people with substantial incomes. Honourable members opposite also would benefit higher income people by giving various concessions on the capital gains tax, giving price cuts on the goods that the wealthy buy-goods such as luxury cars, furs, jewellery and things of that kind, the prices of which would all come down under the tax plans of the Opposition. I agree with the Opposition about one thing: this country needs to go through substantial structural change. Of course, the great lie which comes from the Opposition is that this is not in fact happening, that no structural change of any worthwhile nature is going on-as though we are living in a society which has been frozen in time, which is as it was when we came into office, in which there has been no effective structural change and which is not undergoing a radical economic change in terms of its structure and its attitudes. In fact, what is happening is that there is greatest array of structural change that this country has ever seen. I refer to the 60 per on cent reduction in protection which has been tax brought about by Labor governments-the Whitlam Government cuts and the cuts under Government. I refer also to the very substantial array of changes to various service industries, making them more competitive. I refer to the telecommunications and aviation industries and the breaking down of highly inefficient arrangements in other areas, such the waterfront and shipping, where dramachanges have been taking place. The average crew of an Australian ship has dropped 33 to 21 in the period that we have been in office. It is still falling. We are seeing increases in productivity on the waterfront of up to 80 per cent to 100 per cent as a result of the introduction of the enterprise employment approach which we have put in place. We are seeing a very substantial change in the nature .of the Australian economy. This is supported by a vastly increased array of training measures such as the training levy-which the Opposition would abolish. We have seen greatly improved education which has meant that the retention rate for school leavers has increased from a bit over 30 per cent to 70 per cent in our period in office, and it is still going up. We are seeing a much better educated and better trained work force. Most importantly of all, we are seeing a change to a really productive culture, with changes in the workplace such as award restructuring and the adoption of the structural efficiency principle, which has been put in place by the Industrial Relations Commission, and the move to enterprise bargaining, which is a further substantial push in that direction for workplace productivity improvement. These things are actually happening. They are not things that might happen if the Opposition got into office. In fact, those things would probably go backwards at a rate of knots, given the policies that the Opposition pursues. These things are happening very effectively right now. The great lie that the Opposition has put to the Australian people is that none of these things is happening. In fact, the record shows that in industry after industry and in case after case we are seeing dramatic change in terms of productivity improvement and the basis on which this country can become internationally competitive once again.

332,Mr CHANEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I am pleased to be following the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in this debate because I suppose that if there has been one person on the Government front bench who, since the departure of the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has shown himself to be in command of the present Government's agenda-to the extent that the present Government has an agendathat would be the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) who has just resumed his seat. I think that the honourable member has been able to present better than anyone else on the front bench what the Government is supposed to be about. But having just listened to that speech from the Minister, I have to say that it demonstrates the lack of connection with the real Australia that is, I think, a function of this Government. In the speech that we have just heard from the Minister for Finance there was no sense of the pain, anger and llrgency which is so evident throughout the Australian community. There are very few honourable . members in the House at the moment, but I see that the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) is here. I suspect that he, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, would have had plenty of personal experience of the sort of anger and hurt, the genuine hardship, that is being suffered by so many Australians and the deep sense of frustration at the apparent inability of the Government to give any sense of direction to this country that might see us heading for better times. I think that the last speech indicated, as has every speech from Government speakers in this debate, a government which is out of touch with the real Australia. I would like to take issue with the Minister's description of every change that we have made to social security as some form of persecution of elements of welfare groups. It is amazing, is it not, that the many measures that have been introduced by the Minister for Finance, who is at the table, to target and to tighten welfare are never described by Labor in the same terms? When Labor does it-when the Government makes it more difficult for the young to obtain benefits, when Labor changes the qualifications for benefits-it is done in the national interest, to restrain abuse of the system and to make necessary reductions in expenditure. I would like to remind the House that over recent weeks it has been the Opposition that has had to negotiate with the Government for an easing of the assets test arrangements which have been applied to hard-pressed rural families. I welcome the fact that the Government was prepared to make some concessions in an area of its tightening up in order to meet an area of real need. But I will deal later with the approach of the Opposition to these matters. I just want to contrast the sort of attack which is made on the Opposition by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in this debate and elsewhere with the attitude that they themselves have adopted in regard to structural reforms within the social security system. Finally, the Minister for Finance said that we do not acknowledge that structural reform is going on-the reform that is necessary give this country a chance to compete in very competitive world which is changing very rapidly and changing far more rapidly than Australia is. I can only say in response to the Minister for Finance that it is summed up in the words of one of Australia's very distinguished economists, Professor Helen Hughes,' who wrote an essay that described the changes which were occurring in Australia and put them under the heading 'Too little, too late'. That, unfortunately, is the story Australia over the 1980s. It is not a story of removed. no change. It is true that manning levels on coastal ships have been reduced. It is true there are some changes on the waterfront. But contrast those changes to the efficiencies which are obtaining elsewhere and we underto stand why our country is going down the drain. It is not good enough to say we have changed. The only relevant question is: are we as good as the competition which we have to meet? I am pleased to be speaking in support of a motion which seeks to censure the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I am pleased because I think the Prime Minister has demonstrated utterly now that he is not living up to the responsibilities of his office. Many years ago when I was a very young lawyer, I went to a service opening the legal year. I remember a quotation that was read in the course of that service and wa<; from the late Dag Hammarskjold, a very distinguished international politiis cian, a statesman really, a man who played very distinguished role in the United Nations. I think it was taken from his diaries. He said, 'If you take a position or accept a position of power and influence, and you are afraid to use your power for fear of losing the position, then you have accepted shadow for substance'. Is not that what we see in the Prime Minister? He is a man who holds the highest political office that can be attained, a man who, I am sure, feels intense pride in having attained that office after a long career of public service in the trade union movement and in politics, yet time and again we see him unwilling to act in the way that he knows is in the national interest. The reason why he is unwilling to act is to that he must preserve his own position. We a have seen it as long ago as 1985 with the casting aside, in the face of trade union opposition, of the Government's own tax reform package which included a broad based consumption tax. We have seen it in so many ways, but look at the dramatic and simple example of uranium policy. It was described by the Prime Minister as illogical, yet he is not game to raise the matter in his own Party's forums, where that illogicality against of the Australian national interest could be Much of the debate in this place is offthat putting to the people of Australia because it does not seem to be connected to their reality. Let me try, therefore, to connect this censure their reality. I do not think that there is even a small minority of Australians who would oppose the proposition that this country is in serious difficulty. I doubt whether within this chamber there would be a single member of any party who would deny that Australia is in trouble. But the great prevailing feeling in the Australian community is not only that we are in trouble but that our direction is downwards; that there are worse troubles ahead, and we drastically need a change of direction. There is a very strong feeling in the community that Australia cannot afford to go on in the way that it is at present. There is a strong feeling in the Australian community that we have to make real changes, and there certainly a strong feeling in the Australian a community that those changes need to be fair. I find again that much of the debate that comes from the Government side is a joke. We keep hearing talk of fairness, but the overwhelming reality that is disclosed in this Fightback program is that the people who have borne the burden of this Government's mistakes are not the rich, and they arc not in fact the very poor. I publicly acknowledge that there have been useful measures from this Government with respect to those on very low incomes in this country. I acknowledge that it has picked up the family income supplement, which we introduced in 1982, and expanded it greatly. It remains a centrepiece of the Government's assistance to families. We have never opposed it or done other than acknowledge that that is a genuine measure which assists those working families on very low incomes. The figures, however, are clear and reflect the prevailing feeling in the community that it is the middle income earner, the person trying to meet the normal responsibilities of Australian life, who has borne the brunt. While the very rich have prospered under this Government and made the most enormous gains, the people in the middle-the man and woman on average weekly earnings with a couple of kids-have seen a substantial reduction in family living standards, as is recorded in these documents. That is the reality that we face. We bring forward this program on the basis that there is a need for a fundamental change of direction in this country in a whole series of areas. Great attention is focused on the tax system and on our proposal to introduce a broad based goods and services tax which will enable massive changes to be made to the taxation system and the lifting of business taxes, which will change the business environment of this country. But there are also changes in other key areas of Australian life. There are changes to the health system, to the education system, and to the welfare system. In each case those changes are tailored to an Australian view-not just an Opposition view-that a fundamental change of direction is required. We will have endless debate and the endless raising of a hard case here and a hard case there. And there are always hard cases. There are hard cases when the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs (Mr Howe) makes his changes to social security arrangements. As an ex-Minister in that portfolio, I know that change is impossible without there being hard cases. That is why we put an additional $50m into welfare agencies which will face part of the challenge of meeting those points of difficulty. Let me quickly look at the health system. There may be satisfaction with the universal coverage of Medicare, but there is great dissatisfaction with the difficulties of access to hospitals. Only recently the aged father of friends of mine in a major public hospital in Western Australia was receiving far less attention than they thought was required. When they raised the matter they were asked, 'Couldn't you hire a nurse?'. Hire a nurse in a major public teaching hospital to supplement the deficiencies of that hospital? That is the sort of point we are at. The delays and the problems of those who need medical attention in the public hospitals are manifest, and the parlous condition of the States financially is leading to very stringent measures being imposed upon State hospitals. What we are trying to do is to change the drift away from private access, which has put unnecessary pressure on the public system, and to restore a situation in which a substantial proportion of Australians can afford private health care. That is a matter worthy of debate from the Prime Minister. But what we get is abuse and evasion and an escape from that debate. I think that the people of Australia universally will welcome a return to providing assistance to those people who self-insure, and for the wealthy who are healthy and who freeload on the Medicare system there will be a penalty, so they will pay more. Who would dispute that giving base rate pensioners sufficient financial assistance to enable them to buy access to private health insurance and, hence, access to private hospitals and choice of doctor is a major step forward which will enable a redressing of the imbalance between public and private medicine? This is a major reform aimed at those who need it most. It is a fundamental change in direction in this vital area. I now refer to education. We do not have to spend very much time in the community to find the vast dissatisfaction of parents, employers and students with the quality and state of our education system, and so we have a series of reforms being put in place here which go to excellence, to the quality of teachers and which provide a new hope for a much improved education system. Some $3 billion worth of expenditure is committed, a net $2 billion of addition to education. That is partly why we are cutting expenditure in other areas, to provide Australian children with the opportunity to have the sort of quality education that the children of Japan and Germany get, which enables them to participate in economies that really work tn this modem competitive world. Let me tum to welfare. I have at times publicly praised the Minister for 'Health, Housing and Community Services, I think once in his presence, and sometimes when he has not been there, for some of the efforts he has made to bring about some necessary reforms in the welfare area. But look at the reforms which we are seeking to undertake and which go to the simple reality that this country had about one million people dependent upon social security in 1971, about 2.2 million in 1982 and about 3.1 million this year. There are many other statistics that we can produce. We can produce the fact that social security costs about $5,000 per household. We can produce figures on the disability pension, which show a 66 per cent rise over the period that Labor has been in govemmentway out of line with the population rise. We can produce endless statistics that show a drift that most Australians would say is in the wrong direction. We must encourage a move towards greater independence and greater self reliance whilst maintaining a universal safety net for those in need. This country is not a country which needs to leave any person without support. None of our changes would leave people without the means or the capacity to help themselves without access to benefits. We are saying, with programs such as Job Search, that people ought to be able to plan during their working lives so that if they lose their job they are able to sustain themselves for a few weeks while they look for another job. If people lose their job after having had a lot of bad luck-they have no savings and cannot look after themselves-of course they should have access to special benefit. Why not say to the Australian people that in all of these areas we simply wish to turn the system towards a little more independence rather than more dependence? One has to look at those changes in that broad framework because the people of Australia understand that in this area, as in so many areas of Australian life, something is wrong. The gravamen of this censure motion is that we believe these are matters which should have been debated face to face by the Prime Minister, not in the captured time of Question Time where he can simply say anything he likes and get away with it, but in the honest debate that can occur in this chamber. This evasion of debate by the Prime Minister is yet another example of his unfitness to govern this great country.",118
333,Mr HOWE,PRIME MINISTER,"I join the debate in support of the amendment which would have the House censure the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) for perpetrating a massive fraud with the launch of his Fightback! document which will increase unemployment, increase inflation, wreck economic recovery and shift the burden of taxation from rich to middle and low income Australians. We have just heard a somewhat pompous, even pious, contribution from the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who wanted to defend the fairness or equity of what it is the Opposition proposes. The question of what the Opposition is about is simply reflected in its summary of the three-year expenditure program in relation to savings as well as increases in outlays. I am particularly interested in the area of social security. Social security is concerned with fairness and equity. It is part of the income transfer system that involves revenue and how fair the revenue system is. Measures such as capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax on that side of the equation have been effectively watered down and made less effective to reduce the burden on wealthier Australians with resources. On the other side of the equation, in social security, where we are protecting those people who are arguably the poorest within our community, we find savings of $2 1h billion. If the honourable member for Pearce can find a Labor Budget in which there have been savings of that order, or where that kind of target has been set by the Government, I would like to hear about it. If we look at the equation and the cruel calculus of what is involved in what the Opposition is putting up, it is essentially asking those people who are the very poorest-those people who may be on Job Search allowance, the unemployed, those people on sickness benefit, those people who are sole parents with dependent teenage children, those older women who are approaching retirement age and who are now to have their retirement age deferred-to pay the compensation that would be occasioned by the introduction of a 15 per cent consumption tax. Rather than that compensation effectively coming out of the revenue side of the equation, the Opposition is proposing to dig into social security-to dig great holes in the safety net-for the purpose of ensuring that its numbers in relation to compensation can look respectable. I do not see that as fairness. I do not see that in terms of equity. We have already heard in this debate how the changes to be made with respect to the Job Search allowance are essentially designed to achieve savings of $750m. Those savings include, for example, extensions of waiting periods. I do not know whether the honourable member for Pearce knows what a waiting period means from his own experience. Our Government has considered that proposition involving longer waiting periods, but has rejected it. We have rejected it particularly in regard to waiting periods for sickness benefit. That is linked into the notion that people ought to make more use of their disposable savings. Again, the Government has looked at that kind of proposition. We should look at the scale of what the Opposition is really proposing in that areasavings of $150m, to be achieved by forcing people to dig into their own pockets. Welfare agencies tell us that long term unemployed people, or people who slip between employment and unemployment, simply run down their savings. Not in policy terms, but so that the calculus adds up, the Opposition is saying that those people who are sick ought to run down their savings. It is saying that that is what those people who are unemployed ought to do. That is the imperative that the Opposition is about. I come back to the question of sale parents, which I raised earlier in the week, and I come back to it for a very serious reason. We made major policy changes in that area. We moved effectively to tighten up the criteria for the receipt of sale parent pension. On the other hand, we made a major reform with the introduction of the jobs, education and training scheme. The Opposition is asking us to restrict the eligibility of women with children in early adolescence, at the stage of puberty, though it will give consideration to extreme cases. Let us look at the difficulty of making that judgment. Who ought to make that judgment about a woman who is caring for a child alone? That is the crucial point. It is all very well for the Opposition to get sensitive about this matter. Senator Alston, the shadow spokesman for social security, went to his own family and talked about his . five children and the fact that his wife had made a decision to go out to work. No-one would criticise that decision. To impose those values on someone else who does not have that degree of freedom of choice, someone who is desperately trying to care for teenage children through a very difficult period, is to make a very insensitive judgment. It is a judgment which, in my view, does not reflect a serious policy basis. It is not that one cannot look critically, as one ought to look critically, at every program. We should not make savings of this order on the basis of a critical, careful look. The Opposition has not been careful because it says that it is all about vision. It is about the big picture. In that big picture that it is trying to paint, it is being absolutely insensitive. It is being careless about the lives of people. That is why one talks about fairness and equity. When governments make decisions they ought to be the opposite; they ought to be careful about the judgments they make on what the impacts of their policy might be. As the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) has come into the chamber, let me move to an area of policy outside of social security. The Opposition would make changes which it sees as resulting in savings to the Budget of some hundreds of millions of dollars. I do not have the numbers here, but they are certainly very substantial savings. Dr Bob Woods-What are they about?",121
334,Mr HOWE,PRIME MINISTER,They are essentially about moving the burdenDr Bob Woods-Are you talking about the health area?,123
335,Mr HOWE,PRIME MINISTER,"The honourable member can speak in the debate if he wants to. Members of the Opposition are talking about moving the burden of the cost of health from the public to the private sector. They are essentially saying, 'Let's put greater emphasis on the private sector'. Of course, they have gone back to their old friends in the health insurance industry and they have obviously made commitments. They have said, 'We can see you are going through a hard time. Don't worry too much because good times are coming'. They have talked to the AMA and said, 'Don't worry because we will ensure that we lift your incomes; in fact, we are going to arrange a system that will guarantee you both; a system in which there can be a deal between the health insurance industry and the AMA and, effectively, both get what they ultimately want'. Ultimately the AMA is able to set fees in this country. The AMA's schedule fee will determine what this country pays for health. The health insurance industry will cooperate in this to ensure that it gets a share of the action. This is not about health; this is not about people; this is not about ensuring that there is a safety net; this is not about preserving Medicare; and this is not about a tax-based universal system. This is essentially about destroying Medicare, which is supported by 70 per cent of the Australian population, and about transferring the costs so that people have to pay an increasing burden for their own health care. In social security terms one can say that the test is, essentially, how much income people have. If you are talking about relative justice for those with the least income, surely there is some justification for greater support. There is a different test in the area of public policy covering health. The people who are susceptible, the people who run the risks, suffer chronic illness and have to go into hospitalthe people who need to depend on acute facilities-ought to be the priority. That ought to be the equity that is involved in relation to health. What is more, when they go into that system they are entitled to be treated on an equitable basis. If the honourable member was concerned about correcting inequities, then none of us would have any concerns. If that was the fundamental thrust of the Opposition's policy, then we would not have' any concerns, but that is not what the Opposition is about. It is constrained by the interest groups that are so important to the coalition parties. Those interest groups, of course, are the AMA and the doctors. Dr Bob Woods-The AMA and the doctors?",123
336,Mr HOWE,PRIME MINISTER,"Sorry, the AMA and the health insurance industry. Those two groups are to be looked after; they are important to the health industry. I pointed out in Question Time today that that deal can be seen in supplementary paper No.3 on page 15, where it is all very clear. The section is headed 'Expansion of Private Insurance Options', and it states: For those taking out private health insurance, full medical cover up to an AMA Schedule level, subject to certain patient co-payments, will be allowed. The AMA Schedule level will be negotiated between the AMA and the health funds. That could not be clearer. Here we have a commitment to gap insurance, but there must be a co-payment. Bulkbilling is out, it has gone, but there has to be a co-payment. That is clear; it has to be there. There is no bulkbilling for those beyond the cardholder group and, effectively, there has to be private insurance. Private insurance is obviously part of the equation. The Medicare levy stays. So we have the Medicare levy, private insurance and the co-payment-all three. It is the triple whammy. Why are we having a triple whammy? Not because of health reasons or because of economic reasons. In fact, we will be able to demonstrate in overall health costs that, despite ali of the stability of the 1980s, we are about to go for the big bang. We are going to have a big blow-out in health costs. We will no longer be able to talk about 8 per cent of GDP and make a comparison with the United States' 12 per cent of GDP, because our GDP is going to go up. Why? Because the doctors are going to get their way-they are going to get control of the system, they will be just like Dracula in charge of the blood bank. They are going to be in charge of the system, together with the health insurance industry-in cohorts with one another-and the victims are going to be the ordinary people. Let us not have any illusions about this package in regard to health. The Leader of the Opposition said only the other day that he cannot cost it, he cannot make a clear judgment about what it is going to cost in health terms. But we know who is going to bear that additional cost-the chronically ill, the sick, those who have not got the capacity to pay for the levy, private health insurance and make the co-payment. It is the triple whammy. That is essentially what the Opposition is about. The Opposition is about building a system in which the costs are transferred more and more onto the individual. The beneficiaries in that situation are the doctors. Of course, we all know that with any health care system we need to get control of costs. The Opposition has failed to do that. (TIme expired)",123
337,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"O'Connor) (5.57 p.m.)Before the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) leaves the chamber, if he has a real concern for the people he claims to represent in his portfoliQs, including health, I ask him to consider a couple of matters which are relevant to his own remarks. Firstly, he boasts so proudly about containing health costs, but he does not tell you that he achieves it by amputating old ladies' legs, that he achieves it denying people access to hospitals. That is true and I can give the Deputy Prime Minister the evidence. It happened recently torate. The Minister skulks out of the chamber, as he should. What is so special about saving money if that is the way you are going to achieve it? The Deputy Prime Minister talks about saving money. He quoted his expenditures as a percentage of GDP-not as a percentage of taxes collected by his Government. Of course, we can keep numbers down as a percentage of GDP. This Government has grossly inflated GDP in this country, not as a result of the productivity of our factories and our workers, but by borrowing money from the rest of the world. The evidence is there to be seen. That is what this Government has done. Up until 1989 there has been an 89 per cent growth in GDP and an 8.9 per cent growth in productivity. In other words, we have a debt led recovery which has caught up with us, as all debt funded programs do. Let us get down to the reality of the Deputy Prime Minister's comments about saving money on health. When Medicare was introduced, the Federal Government was spending approximately 9 per cent of all tax collected on health. At that time it was also spending about 9 per cent of all tax collected on education. Today it still spends 9 per cent on education and there is evidence of what is happening to our education system. We boast that things are as good as they were in 1971-but the world has run away from us in that time in the skills and training it is providing. Expenditure was 9 per cent in 1983 and it is 9 per cent today, but the 9 per cent of health expenditure has grown to 15 per cent of the tax dollar today. People pay dearly for that in not being able to get their kids into university and not getting the proper services that might be available in other areas. If the Government believes that expenditure is evidence of success, it might be able to argue that it has had a wonderful success; but as the expenditure has grown, so have the waiting lists in our hospitals. The Minister says, 'That's a good thing. Everything is okay. Your policies'-which set out to redress by some of these aspects, which set out to let pensioners, when their feet are going gangrenous, actually go to private hospitals with in my elec- empty beds-'are wrong'. We are debating a motion to censure the Prime Minister; we should talk about that, not the silly amendments brought forward so the Government can deliver on its numbers in this p-ace. 1 remember the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) once complaining that justice resides in the numbers in this place. He will get many lessons about that sort of justice within the next 18 or 20 months. We are debating a motion to censure a Prime Minister who is practically the ultimate example oftoday's union bureaucracy: 'It is my job that matters, mate, not yours'. That is happening throughout the union bureaucracy today. We have a new union bureaucracy that is all about its importance and keeping its influence and its jobs, with not much care for the workers. At this very moment in my electorate-and 1I have been dealing with it on the phone, and I am pleased to say that there will be some writs out today-the Transport Workers Union, which could not get its own members to strike, had the AWU impose a secondary boycott. The boycott is still going on because some little bloke has paid his air fare up to Geraldton and believes that before he leaves he should prove he is worth his wages. That is what the union bureaucracy stands for today. It runs this Labor Government, with 64 per cent voting on preselection. No wonder that when the unions tell the Government to jump, the Government asks, 'How high?'. This Prime Minister's concern is no longer about his union job or his union importance; he puts his own job ahead of the one million unemployed as he stumbles around. He is now a tired old man. When I called on you yesterday, Mr Speaker, to put him out of his misery, 1 did it with some sympathy, because he certainly needs to be removed from this place, and the sooner the better, because Australia in the next 18 months cannot afford him. The coalition has released its Fightback policy. That policy has the support of the business community, the media, most of the general public and, 1 understand from questions asked here today, the Government's own Public Service. Minister after Minister stood up today and said, 'I haven't seen it. What are you talking about?'. 1 know why they have not seen it. They have shot the messenger. They do not want to See it. They do not want to be told the truth. They are happy and they do not want to be confused by the facts. So what have they done? They have gone back to good old-fashioned rhetoric. 1 take honourable members' minds back into the history of trade union bureaucracy. Burnt on my mind until the day 1 die is Bill Kelty's speech after the Industrial Relations Commission rejected accord mark VI. 1 heard him on television say to his colleagues, 'Comrades, if we let the Industrial Relations Commission get away with this decision, we will lose all our power'. He did not say, 'If we let them get away with it, the conditions of our members will be eroded' or 'Our members need more money'. No, he said, 'We will lose all our power'. Dr Harry Edwards-Power hungry.",124
338,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Power hungry-and do they not have some power? The Government does not want to know what its public servants are telling it and has slipped back to rhetoric. Government members keep coming out with the nice one-liner-and we will hear plenty of them-that the Fightback policy is a policy for the rich and not the poor. I have read the policy, and I have in front of me a summary of it. On two pages I have identified 15 separate examples of where the Opposition imposes assets tests, means tests and other income caps on many of the measures it provides. The Opposition, quite properly, will give people tax breaks on interest earned on money they save, but only married couples who earn less than $50,000 or individuals on $25,000. The family allowance is doubled for families with combined incomes below $30,000. That is hardly catering for the rich. There is an increase of 50 per cent on the family allowance for people earning from $30,000 to $40,000. The family allowance supplement is increased by 6 per cent, with all the normal means tests applicable. The dependent spouse rebate is increased by $300, limited to people on incomes up to $75,000. That is generous, 1 admit. The dependent spouse rebate is increased, but only for families on incomes up to $50,000. There is funding of $50m to welfare agencies. Are welfare agencies going to give that to the rich? Of course not. The first home owners scheme gives $2,000 to young families with an arumal household income of up to $40,000. Are they rich? The Opposition's package gives tax rebates of up to $800 for people over 65 if they receive an income of less than $14,500. They are hardly wealthy elderly people. There are other tax rebates for middle aged people, but only low to middle income earners. The other side of the equation is: who gets the tax penalty? It is the high income earners who will not take out private health insurance. 1 cannot speak for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) or the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who are in the Parliament at the moment, but 1 know two losers on that arrangement. One is the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and the other is the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh), because they do not have private health insurance. The family income of the honourable member for Phillip is about $300,000 a year, and she proudly stands up in this place and says, '1 bludge on Medicare because I am philosophically aligned with it'. She rushes down to the public hospital and keeps more needy people back in the queue. She says, 'I take my turn'. High ranking public servants or politicians never take their turn. They do not even have to lift the phone because other people make the arrangements. There is a new elite under a socialist system. 1I have seen it in Russia. I can identify a couple of losers: people who get the best hospital treatment under Medicare because they are very important persons and they do not pay the extra for it. To the credit of the Prime Minister, whom we censure today, Hazel keeps him in private insurance, as he admits, and they go to a private hospital. On their salary, so they should. The Government should not tell me about looking after the poor when its own members in this place shoulder the poor out of the queues at public hospitals. 1 hope the two Ministers here will speak. They might tell us whether they are in the same situation-philosophically committed to bludging on Medicare. That is what we are on about, and we will change things. Of course we had the other bit of rhetoric today. I am glad that I do not suffer from hay fever because today 1 got a whipping with a feather from that lot opposite and it would have been only the dust that would have done me any harm. I do not know what the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) was on about when he was reading comparisons between New Zealand pages and our pages. We say in the front of our policy document that we have copied a lot of the detail from the New Zealand practice-and I can tell those opposite that, if they went to Italy or to Germany, they would find most of those words written in Italian or German. They are words used internationally where VAT operates. But the Government members thought they were on a big deal, laughing and joking at this, when all they were telling us was that some of the actual operating procedures of a GST as we propose it are written in the same words as in New Zealand. We have just been talking about some of the philosophical steps that we have taken. In the last couple of minutes, let us talk about labour. Let us talk about people out of jobs. Let us talk about working for the dole. There are 125,000 old people in l1ursing homes. Those opposite would think it an outrage to send 125,000 unemployed people to pay a visit to those old people one afternoon. I think both might benefit: it would be wonderful for the old people and it might be salutary for the young; they might just learn something from those old people; they might learn something from giving some community service. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) was carrying on today about the tragedy of someone getting a job back at 80 per cent of the wages. I remember a time in the hotel industlY when we had a thing called green labour. People got three-quarters of the wages if they had had no experience in the bar. I can tell those opposite that we could not put those people on full wages quickly enough if they were any good; we did not want the bloke down the road to pinch them. But the unions killed that. What was the result? Young people wanting to learn the bar trade had to go and pay money to be taught because they could not get jobs without experience. Big deal! Those opposite really put them in front! They took three-quarters of a weekly wage from them and made them pay cash to learn. I have apprentices in my electorate who cannot finish their time and become tradesmen. They are willing to work for nothing just to finish their time, but the unions will not let them. Do those opposite reckon that that is a good idea? (TIme expired)",125
339,Mr CREAN,PRIME MINISTER,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In doing so, I simply want to say at the outset that the Fightback/ document launched by the coalition parties is not a vision; it is an illusion. What the package proposes is simply to change the tax mix and to do that regressively, to involve itself in huge cuts in programs and therefore services-in particular services to those most in need in the community-and to ensure that as a consequence of the package we end up as a high inflation economy. We would end up as a high inflation economy specifically because the goods and services tax would directly add to our rate of inflation and because the policy proposals of the coalition contain no mechanism for dealing with wages. If there is no capacity to deal with wages policy in an inflating economy, we will simply perpetuate the inflationary spiral because wage claims will be made on future expectations. The coalition's policy document is put ther based on dry economics. It lacks compassion and it certainly will not solve the problems that it says it will. The document is also a dishonest one because in its presentation it simply does not tell the full story. I take the example that this Government has been pursuing this week with the issue of road user charges. I simply want to repeat in this House these circumstances. We have in the document, as well as in statements preceding it, a commitment from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to recover through road user charges the costs of repair and maintenance of our roads system. The contents of the Fightback/ document are quite clear in that regard. But what we saw yesterday was the change to it by press release because the National party put pressure on the Liberal Party to ensure that there was a clear statement that no fuel tax would be imposed. The simple fact is that, if one looks at the Leader of the Opposition's press release yesterday, whilst ruling out any increase in fuel taxes-I hope that when he makes those statements in future he is prepared to say, 'Read my lips: no new taxes'-he says that there are other ways to raise the road user charges. He instances two examples in that press release. One is a charge on heavy duty vehicles, which Senator Boswell in another place has already ruled out from a coalition perspective. The other is the so-called hubbing option, which the Prime Minister referred to in Question Time today and which has also in fact been ruled out by one of the coalition front bench. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), in an address to the National Transport Federation in Adelaide in August of this year, clearly indicated that mass distance charges based on hub meters would not be used to achieve the funding. So we have a circumstance of the coalition saying that it is committed to user pays in terms of road user charges, identifying three options by which those charges can be raised and, when under pressure, ruling out every one of them. The question has to be asked: if those options have been ruled out, how will the Opposition raise the revenue to fund Australia's roads, particularly against the togebackground of the massive cuts it will make to the Budget according to its document? That is one example of where those opposite have not told the full story. The other is in the area of compensation. I refer particularly to this in relation to farm families in this country because the document purports that all people except the rorters of the system will be better off. But, on page 155 of the document, where it refers to the price impact of the goods and services tax by community group deciles, we see tucked away in some of the notes: The price effects of the Goods and Services Tax have been estimated using the HES survey . . . That is the household expenditure survey. It then goes on to explain the technical details of this. In the next note it states: On the basis of the criterion for inclusionthat is for inclusion as a compensation measure. . . there are insufficient fanners to draw meaningful conclusions about that group. So where is the compensation package for farm families in this country, who at the moment are particularly suffering from low incomes? They are suffering from low incomes for a number of reasons-not just the domestic recession, but world commodity prices at an all-time low, unfair trading practices and drought. Those are the reasons that farm incomes are low. But where is the compensation package in the coalition's document? Do the members of the National Party not really care about a compensation package? There is nothing in the documentation that indicates how farm families, particularly low income farm families, will be better off. Let us remember: under the proposals contained in the Fightback! document, everything those families purchase that is not involved as a business input will be taxed at 15 per cent. Where is the compensation package for farm families? The next point I want to make relates to the inflationary impact. The document effectively gives up any hope of the continuance of an effective wages policy in this country. I have heard the Leader of the Opposition wax lyrical in this place about dishonesty and asking why we do not tell the truth. We know his own difficulty in reading a competitiveness index, having made the fatal mistake of confusing a plus with a minus. The Leader of the Opposition asserted earlier today in this Parliament that unit labour costs have not fallen under Labor. Let me just remind the House of the change in unit labour costs between 1982-83, when this Government came to power, and 1990-91, the year for which the most recent figures are available. Unit labour costs, if we take the private non-farm corporate sector index, have gone down from an index of 106.6 to 100.7. If we take the non-farm sector index, there has been a fall of almost 10 per cent-HO.1 down to 100.9. On the measures of competitiveness, if we take the CPI based index, there has been an improvement in competitiveness down from 108.7 to 93.7; on the GDP deflated base, down from 106.1 to 89.5; and on the unit labour cost base, down from 110.1 to 91.1. In other words, by any measure of competitiveness, and because of the significant contribution to this country's competitiveness by wages policy and the reduction in unit labour costs, this country is a far more competitive country today than it was when we inherited office from that mob on the other side. That point, if we are talking about honesty and facts, needs to be drummed home. But the simple facts of the matter are that wages policy has also been the significant contributor to a lower inflation outcome in this country. By moving the wages system away from building in inflationary expectations, by using the accord processes to distribute outcomes other than through wages-in other words, the social wage-we have produced a flexibility that has added not only to our competitiveness but also to a much lower inflation environment. The inflation environment is very important because this Fightback! document is predicated on the fact that it will only add to inflation by 4.4 per cent. We dispute that figure. We dispute it because we believe that it is fundamentally flawed in the content of the document, and that flaw will be exacerbated by the lack of a wages policy. I think it is interesting to reflect that in today's edition of the Age, an article by Kenneth Davidson pointed out that in the UK and New Zealand, where goods and services taxes were introduced, the consequent inflationary impact was higher than the calculated expectations. That, indeed, was a concern that the Government in 1985 had when, amongst other things, it determined to abandon a goods and services tax or a broad based consumption tax. The reason I highlight this is that the inflation figure is fundamental. It is fundamental for two reasons: because of what it does to our competitive position under this Government, which, as I have just indicated, has improved significantly from where it was when we inherited it; and because it goes to the question of the compensation package, as it is against the inflation measure that one has to make the judgment as to whether people are better or worse off as a consequence of this. It is an illusion to say the figure will be 4.4 per cent, because it will not be realised, and then to calculate one's adjustments, one's compensating mechanisms, based on a false figure. It is also dishonest for the Leader of the Opposition to assert that under this Government real wages have been cut, because the measure is not, in the end, real wages. What matters to people is the take home package, which is a combination, as a consequence of the accord mechanisms, not just of wage movements but of social wage movements, of taxation cuts and of superannuation improvements. It is that package of measures, living standard improvements, against which the real measure has to be taken. The reality is that the Fightback! document would throw all that out the door. It would demonstrate an incapacity to deliver wages policy, because members opposite simply cannot talk to the trade union movement. They have almost a pathological hatred for the trade union movement and, therefore, are incapable of developing a sensible wages strategy with it. But, in addition to that, even if they were capable of doing it, where is the capacity for the social wage trade-off in circumstances in which they are going to cut massively into Budget outlays and, in particular, into those areas that deliver the social wage outcomes? This Government has embarked on a radical program of structural reform and we will continue to develop it. In the micro-economic reform area, there have been significant improvements in competitiveness and productivity in the stevedoring and shipping industries. Just as an example of that, particularly as it relates to my sector-and I have not heard anyone on the Opposition side talk to us recently about productivity improvements - the Chief Executive of the Wheat Board issued a press release back on 6 November saying that Australian ports, as a result of the reforms that have been undertaken, are now amongst the most efficient grain loading POlts in the world. The average time taken to turn a vessel round has gone down from 4112 days to 2.4 days. The estimated savings to the wheat industry will amount to $1Om a year. That is micro-economic reform in action. Yet members opposite are blinkered and blinded to the perception or the understanding of the improvements that are taking place. They should get out and speak to some of the managers of grain terminals, and also coal loaders up in Newcastle, to see the significant reforms that have been brought about because of sensible industrial relations practices, driven by wages policies and commitments to undertake improvements in productivity. The vision of this Government is one that is built around improvements in living standards for this country based on economic growth-economic growth that will be delivered as a consequence of sensible macroeconomic policies, continuing improvement in micro-economic policies, and also the development of pro-active industry development strategies. The benefits of those outcomes, the benefits of those reforms, will be equitably distributed. The fundamental difference between us and the other side is that we understand the need to distribute the benefits with compassion rather than just in terms of those who happen to have the biggest snout in the trough. It gives me great pleasure to support the Prime Minister's amendment, to condemn the Liberal Party document for the fraud that it is, and to recognise that, as I said at the outset, it is no vision; it is just an illusion.",127
340,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 8 p.m.,129
341,Mr MCGAURAN,PRIME MINISTER,"Gippsland)(8.00 p.m.)I join with my colleagues in arguing for the approval of this House of the censure motion against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and seconded by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I remind the House of the content of the censure motion, which reads: . That this House censures the Prime Minister for his failure to formally respond to the Coalition's Fightback program notwithstanding that the Government has received from its advisers a detailed report that comments favourably on essential elements of the Fightback program. It is no surprise to those of us on this side that the Government has failed to make out any serious or lasting criticisms of the Fightback package, for if there is one feature of the events that have followed the launch of the Fightbackl documents a week ago, it is the unpreparedness of the Government to fight us on the detail, let alone the philosophical underpinnings of our package. The Government has seriously, even fatally in electoral terms, underestimated the content and resolve of the coalition and, more specifically, the coalition's Fightback package. 1\vo or three weeks ago all members of the Government received a detailed publication of some 35 pages entitled The GST Debate. It gave them clues on how to approach this issue, how to canvass their electorates, how to take the fight up to the Opposition in the Parliament. It even wrote their speech notes for them. Supposedly, it gave them detailed estimates of what would be in the coalition's final GST package. If the. Government, as now appears certain, was relying on this document to build upon its strategy to attack the coalition, it is no wonder that we felt compelled to move a censure motion that the Government has failed to respond to the Fightback program in any detailed fashion. This document, in which members of the Government place their faith, is patently absurd, and it was at the time it was leaked to us. Documents are coming out of all parts of the Caucus and the bureaucracy to the coalition at the moment. It was a document which was supposed to reassure members of the Government that the Prime Minister was in charge and the Prime Minister was ready to fight the coalition on the GST debate. But as it turns out, it is riddled with inaccurate predictions and errors in fact. Let me tum to some of these inaccuracies and these falsehoods upon which honourable members of the Government so naively and falsely place their hopes. Laid out on one page there is a strategy which amounts to nothing more than fearmongering on how to try to convince the electorate that the coalition will increase-within a fairly short time, if overseas experience is anything to go by-the GST rate. It gives all sorts of quotes from the past and it concludes by saying that Government members should go out and hammer home the message that the trend of overseas experience is unambiguous. It states: If a consumption tax is introduced in Australia then it will be increased. ' That is wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has given a commitment to enshrine in legislation the 15 per cent rate. It would be a very foolish, if not politically suicidal, party that increased the GST rate. A party would do so to its political peril. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party, and also a number of individual members, have given a commitment to quit any government that was a party to increasing the GST rate. There is no need to, as will be seen if one reads the Fightback! document. It is a long document, and its complexity and sophistication quite escape the Government, even though it has had public servants working overtime in the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Finance and other Government departments for months now, but more particularly in the week since the Fightback package was released. Let me turn to other pages of the Government's document to show how ridiculous it was in preparing for the Fightback package. The Government says on one page that the GST will affect a whole range of business. It gives us the example of licensed clubs. It says that there will be a gambling tax. The Government is wrong. Gambling is exempt from the GST. It goes on to list where the GST will apply on medical services. It says that there will be a tax on doctors' visits, a tax on pharmaceuticals, a tax on diagnostic services and a tax on pathology. It is wrong. Medical services and health generally are zero rated. But really the distortions of the whole GST debate are nowhere more amplified than in the section headed The Effect of a GST on Regional Australia. It says this: Freight and haulage costs are a burden for people living in the country. That is a remarkable admission. What is the Government doing about it? Mr Sharp-It took them a while to work that out.",129
342,Mr MCGAURAN,PRIME MINISTER,"The honourable member for Gilmore should wait for this. It goes on to say: A GST will increase freight costs with no compensation. We are abolishing the wholesale sales tax system. That represents 20 per cent off the cost of a rig, the cost of tyres, the cost of batteries, the cost of lubricants and the cost of repairs. Moreover, we are abolishing fuel excise. Because fuel for a truckie and the freight industry at large is a business input, the whole 26c will be reba table. The Government's document goes on under the same heading to state: A GST regime will not allow the advantages of tax averaging. That is wrong. The GST package of the Opposition allows for the continuation of tax averaging. This document is ridiculous, I will read out a few more examples to show just how wrong the Government has got it, how hopelessly prepared it is for any sensible debate on the GST or tax reform more generally. The paper goes on to state: Dr Hewson has said private school fees will be exempt but everything bought by schools (which costs more in remote areas) will be taxedcurrently they are not taxed. That is wrong. Education is zero rated. All inputs for schools will be rebatable. It goes on and on, and the inaccuracies totally and utterly discredit this long, and presumably carefully prepared, working document for each and every member of the Government. We have now got to the stage where the Opposition has had leaked to it a document of over 60 pages analysing the Fightback package. Quite frankly, it is necessary reading for anybody who wants to assess the value and worth of the Fightback paclGtge. In it, by and large, the Government's advisers support the Fightback package. They say, for instance, that things such as the 8 per cent compensation for pensioners appear to be adequate. Remember that that backs up our claim that we have been overcompensating social security beneficiaries. It goes on to say in this leaked document, which was prepared by highly paid public servants, who have no doubt enriched themselves by working the amount of overtime required of them, that under the new superannuation policy contributors will be better off, particularly low income earners. Again, this Fightback package is directed towards low and middle income earners and families. Furthermore, the Government analysis finds that the new superannuation arrangements involve possibly a lower revenue cost on health. It states that the reduction of the Medicare rebate to 75 per cent will have a similar impact on the Government to the Government's $5 benefit reductions from 1 November 1992. The hypocrisy of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) is revealed, because under our package people will be in the same position as they will with the Government's imposition of the $5 benefit reduction. Moreover, the Government analysis predicts that the package may benefit State governments because of the anticipated reduction in the pressure on public hospitals which will follow the introduction of our health policy. Of course, the public servants really have no choice but to concede that equalising the top marginal rate and the corporate rate will cut tax avoidance, as we have claimed. The Government's document goes on and on giving a remarkable endorsement to the Fightback package. So the Government said last Thursday when the package was released that it would not make wild accusations, that it would resist the temptation to shoot from the hip. Yet in the time since then we have had nothing but gross generalisations without any reference to fact or accuracy. Now we find, firstly, that the Government's preparation was utterly inaccurate and, secondly, that the Government's own public servant advisers are tendering advice that the Fightback package by and large is of benefit to the nation. That should come as no surprise to Australians who have made the effort to understand it-and,quite frankly, how could anyone not understahd it given the blanket media coverage of the particulars of the tax and economic reform package entitled Fightbackl. It is true that the Government was stunningly ill-prepared for the release of Fightback!, and I have no doubt it will continue to fail to make any serious and sustained criticism of either the calculations or the philosophical content of Fightback!. But there has also been another major reaction, and that is the acceptance by the community at large. That should not surprise anybody, on reflection, because Australians have been crying out for leadership, for the outlining of a vision, for a very long time now. There would hardly be a member in this Parliament who is unaware of the cynicism and distrust with which politicians generally .and political parties particularly are treated. People feel that this country lacks a future, that those of the emerging generation will certainly inherit a lower standard of living than their parents. Consequently people turn to political leaders to provide just thatleadership-and they do not get that from the Prime Minister. They now have it from the Leader of the Opposition. Compare the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition. Who is more in charge of his political party? Who has a definite view of the direction in which he wishes to lead Australia to the year 2000? Who is prepared to do the hard work and make the hard decisions so as to lay down in black and white the particulars of that vision? One has to conclude that the Prime Minister is tired and worn out and well past his prime and that the Leader of the Opposition is now coming onto centre stage as the hope of Australia. How this must enrage the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the prime ministerial aspirant, as he sits there on the back benches watching people he knows, as I suspect all of us know, who cannot hold a candle to him in parliamentary debate. If he were totally honest he would have to concede the worthiness of the Fightback package, for it was he who said on 14 June 1985: If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal then you won't see significant reforms in this country in taxation for the balance of this century. What do we think he was talking about when he spoke of 'this proposal'? He was talking about the broad-based consumption tax he proposed during the tax debate of 1985. He further went on to reflect on the importance of the broad-based consumption tax proposal in these terms on 9 June 1985: If this sort of proposal doesn't get up, one has to decide if there's much point in someone like me worrying about the Australian institutional process, and in Australian institutions, very much longer. The honourable member for Blaxland understands the critical importance of major government and tax reform as outlined by the coalition. It is just a tragedy, both personal and for the nation, that he will not now, openly and publicly and honestly, congratulate the coalition for doing what he would have wished to have done years ago and which he predicted, if not done, would doom this nation. Sadly, Australia is in political and economic decline and the people in the electorate know that. They are prepared for change; they are willing to shoulder their share of the burden so long as they know that it is equally distributed amongst all sectors and that there are not special mates in government, that there are not special mates in trade unions and that there are not special mates in big business. If this nation is to regain the greatness for which it was once known throughout the world, it must adopt the substantial and fundamental change that the coalition has outlined in the Fightback program.",131
343,Mr JOHNS,PRIME MINISTER,"Naturally I support the Government's amendment to the motion. What is driving the Opposition here, and especially the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), is a fear of failure-the failure that the Fraser Government had in its seven years because it did not reform the Australian economy. I can understand the Opposition's need and desire to reform the economy. It is a decent thing to do, and the package is something that we all hoped might create an even fUlther lead in reforming the Australian economy, because that is what we have been doing for eight years. One has to remember that Dr Hewson, as he then was, as an adviser to the then Treasurer, was part of that non-reforming Fraser period. I think he felt the bruising of that time, that seven years were spent in government with a massive mandate but nothing was done with it. That is what is driving the Opposition",132
344,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIME MINISTER,He was only 32. Why don't you blame him for the Second World War?,133
345,Mr JOHNS,PRIME MINISTER,"And that is what is driving Dr Hewson. It is right you should react in that way, with an enormous sense of guilt because you wasted",133
346,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIME MINISTER,It is absolute rubbish. It is absolute rot.,133
347,Mr JOHNS,PRIME MINISTER,"No, it is true. You must accept the proposition that you wasted seven years. Now, if you ever get another chance, you want to have a real good crack at it. Let us see if this package is the sort of thing that will create the change that the Leader of the Opposition desperately needs. I suspect it is not. I suspect it will not even get near it. Just to go back briefly to those Fraser years, we have to remember that nothing took place: the tariff regime remained, no national productivity case took place, there was no wages policy, the third runway did not get built and there was no award restructuring. None of those things happened. But next time around honourable members opposite want to make it happen. Okay, so what do they present to us? A beaut package which gets a terrific run, and now we will begin to take it apart. The Opposition thinks it is on a winner here, but it has to defend this package for 15 months and once it is all torn apart it will be left with clothes on and no hope of winning. There are three essential propositions in the package, mainly to do with taxation matters. Firstly, the Opposition wants to lower the overall tax burden by cutting government expenditure. The trouble is that government expenditure and the level of taxation in this country is not high by comparison with comparable OECD countries. So this is the great demand for reform from the bloke who sat there for seven years yet could not do it under the Fraser Government. This is the key point: 'We will cut government expenditure because having money in the hands of the government is useless'. Right? It does not work. The trouble is that by comparison with any other comparable country we are not overly taxed and we do not have an overly large public sector. So what a great reform it is-it is absolutely useless. Here is a straw man: 'We will get taxes off your back; we will get the Government off your back'. It has not been on the people's back for seven or eight years. It has provided a decent guide, and that is about all. So the first straw man is that the Opposition sets up its scheme and says, 'We will look after you, we will get the Government off your back'. But it has not been on the taxpayer's back for eight years; it has not needed to have that kind of impact on the running of this economy because it has introduced all the tax reform that is essential. That is straw man number one. The second thing the Opposition wants to do is broaden the indirect tax base to encompass most services and the rest of the goods not covered by the present wholesale sales tax on goods. If we just had a debate about the comparative merits of a GST and a wholesale sales tax, it would be a decent debate; it really would. It would be a useful debate to have here. We would debate the manner in which we have broadened the impact of the current wholesale sales tax, and the Opposition would be able to say that with the GST it would go further and apply it to services. That is all well and good. The trouble is that it went over the top; it had to try to buy off the small business sector and no State governments who for years have been bleating about payroll taxes. Those opposite went a little too far when they introduced their GST: they want to wipe out wholesale sales taxes, but at the same time they want to wipe out payroll tax. The equivalence between a payroll tax and a consumption tax in terms of management of the economy is zilch-there is absolutely no difference whatsoever in its impact on either the consumer or labour. The whole point of it is that, with straw man No.2, they want to introduce i a new form of indirect taxationand it might have been a half decent reform if they had talked only about reforming the wholesale sales tax by means of a GST-but they want to go right over the top and knock off the payroll tax as well, to no benefit whatsoever other than to appease the view of 10 or 15 years time. Their point was that every State in Australia has payroll taxes and that they are anti-small business. Well, they are not. What is more, they do not apply to more than a moderate percentage of small business in Australia. That is a little bit of politics there that the Leader of the Opposition has attempted to cast upon his own package, and it does not work. No.3 straw man is to shift the tax mix so that a greater proportion of revenue is raised from expenditure rather than from income. We are told that the purpose of that is, firstly, to lift the level of savings in Australia and, secondly, to overcome the black economy. The black economy is a beauty. If a bloke who came into my place to mow the lawn demanded cash for that-of course, I would not go along with that; I would pay him by cheque-and if he did not want that income to be known, taxed and tested, under a GST there is no way that that income would be known, taxed and tested. When he spends it he pays tax. So what is the degree by which one can lower the black economy? By very little indeed. A GST would have a moderate, modest, very small impact on the black economy. I think the Opposition shadow Treasurer said that the black economy runs to about $4 billion a year. We have better estimates to suggest that it runs at about $500m, or half a billion dollars, a year. It is not an inconsiderable amount of money and it should be picked up, but the trouble is that the GST picks up only a minor amount of it. Straw man No.3 is that the GST does not do a great deal to fix up the black economy. As to the matter of savings, we already know from experience in other countries that have introduced a value added tax that there has been a negligible shift in the degree of savings. These blokes in the Opposition are the radicals and want to set out to save the Australian economy, but on all three counts they do nothing for the Australian economy. They do nothing by these tax changes to assist the Australian economy. They do nothing for savings. They do very little for the black economy. The swap between a consumption tax and payroll taxes does almost nothing for small business. Then in the first instance they come back with the old shibboleth that we are overtaxed, when in fact we already know that that is untrue. On top of that, of course, they seek to cut the public sector by many billions of dollars-estimates vary between $4 billion and $10 billionwhen in fact I can assure them, and our front bench can assure them, that we have been doing a pretty decent job of that ourselves in the last seven or eight years. We are at a point now where most analysts would say we are at a bare minimum. We have been able to do it so far because we have means tested the welfare system, and it is a very fair system whereby we distribute moneys to those who need them on the basis of income and assets. There is not a lot more that can be done on top of our welfare base means tested system. We have done it all. So the three straw men add up to a useless policy-not a radical policy, but a policy that just will not stand up to 15 months of scrutiny. When the time comes and the policy no longer exists because it has been tom apart, we will see that it really is nothing more than a chimera. We understand arid we are terribly unhappy about the level of unemployment in Australia, but at least we can say that for that amount of pain there has been an enormous amount of reform in the Australian economy. Out of the 800,000 or more Australians unemployed at the moment, we know that at least 200,000 are unemployed as a direct result of industry restructuring and of government business enterprises and private business redirecting their efforts into more productive enterprises so that they do not require the same work force. There is a consequence of reforming industry. There is pain. What we must have in place, of course, is a decent training and retraining scheme so that anyone who falls into the pool of the unemployed at least gets out after a decent period; and we have ensured that we do that. But what the Leader of the Opposition claims he wants to do is to continue to reform the Australian economy, but with no pain and with no losers and with an enormous increase in the number of jobs generated in the Australian community. It is not on. It cannot be done. We can openly and readily admit that; we have argued the case that currently a substantial proportion of the unemployed in Australia are a direct result of getting on with the business of making the Australian economy more competitive and more internationally based. Pain is generated when things are changed. We understand that. But those opposite will not admit it. They will not say that to the Australian community. They are not honest enough to suggest that. They say, 'Here is a reforming package, but it will cost nothing; it is radical, but no-one will lose. Everyone is a winner. It is win, win, win'. That is a nonsense. We have proved that it is a nonsense. We have to take the political pain of that, but we will take it. We have proved it for seven or eight years as a government and we have made the sorts of reforms that even the Opposition would acknowledge. The fact that unemployment is so high is a cause for great regret. There are all sorts of reasons for that, of course. Some of them are ours and some of them are caused by other actors in the economy. No-one is happy with the performance of the banks. Their prudential supervision has been pathetic. No-one been happy with our entrepreneurs. We could not even sell the State governments because their performance has been pathetic-other than in Queensland, of course. They have not been good. The performance of State itself governments and State banks has not been good at all. In industrial relations, in which the honourable member opposite seems to have a particular interest, ACTU and Government relations cannot be scored at less than eight out of 10. They have been excellent. We may have been slow in the process of award restructuring, if we go back four or five years, but those processes are well under way now. What are these blokes going to offer? Nothtwitches. ing but the sort of Robe River example of infor dustrial relations. That is all they will give It will be pathetic. There will not be a dialogue between the ACTU and any future coalition government because the big hairy-chested men of the coalition will fail to provide a decent means of dialogue with the ACTU. Believe me, the ACTU is a considerable power in this economy and those opposite must bring it on side and deal with it. If they want to deal against the ACTU, then their package of straw men will not even get off the ground. It will be battered around the ears. We have learned to work with significant other actors in the Australian economy and they have learnt to work with us over seven or eight years. That is why we have got the amount of change in the Australian economy that we can patently prove. That change has brought some pain but the pain will have been worth it-but only if we are left in government, which the Australian people will do. To change horses now will produce this sort of nonsense package. There is no win, win, win. There is just a chimera that those opposite would really like to be radical and would really like to change the Australian economy. But they do not have it in them. They will not be able to do it. What they produce here is nothing. (Time expired)",133
348,Mr CHARLES,PRIME MINISTER,"I am delighted to enter this debate tonight to censure the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I note the weak and pathetic performance that has we have just witnessed-which follows a week of weak and pathetic performances from the Treasury benches, the Government side of this House. Is it not a shame that the Government of this great nation has consumed in so much angst that it can no longer effectively operate as the prime mover in the Australian economy and the Australian community? For that we can thank a weak and pathetic Prime Minister-a Prime Minister who is so consumed by his desire to hold office and to keep his job that over one million Australians today have no jobs; their future is bleak indeed. The stench of decay from a dying government is already evident, even as the body The Prime Minister today was asked a vision-his vision to match the vision of us. the Leadbr of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I can tell honourable members that as he talked to us and the Australian people about his vision, if one looked at the faces beyond the front bench, at any row of the Government back bench, one saw only sombre expressions. Many of those honourable members had their eyes cast to the floor-some to the side-but certainly none was interested in the shrill, harsh and uncompromising voice of an irrational Prime Minister who is so consumed by the challenge of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the ex-Treasurer, that he can no longer govern this nation. It was interesting tonight to hear an interview on the ABC-the Government's platform for communications. On the 7.30 Report tonight, Paul Lyneham had a little chat with our Treasurer (Mr Kerin). Do honourable members remember the Treasurer-the one who says, 'Oh, yes, that's me. I am the Treasurer. '? He is the one who went overseas recently and told the rest of the world that Australia was in the midst of the worse recession for 60 years. He came back to this House and told the members of this House and the Speaker of this House that he had made a mistake. He said that he was wrong and that we were not in the worse recession for 60 years; it was only the worse recession for 30 or 40 years. He said that he was not really sure because the numbers were confusing, but that he had made a mistake. He should not have done that. He should not have confirmed what we have been telling the Australian people now for months on end-that we are in the worse recession for 60 years. That is the Treasurer who says, 'That's me', That is the bloke, He was on the 7,30 Report tonight. Paul Lyneham welcomed the Treasurer and said, 'Good evening, Treasurer, how are you?', The Treasurer said, 'Good evening, Paul', Paul Lyneham said, 'When are you going to resign?', That set the Treasurer back a bit. He did not have much of an answer for a few seconds, Then he said, 'Oh, I don't think I will', Paul Lyneham said, 'You're hopeless, hopeless, hopeless', Not once did he say it; but he said it three times'You're hopeless', They are hopeless, are they not? They are absolutely hopeless, This week has seen the most disgusting performance by a government of this great nation in living recall. Hopeless, hopeless, hopeless! The Treasurer then, under questioning from Mr Lyneham regarding how he was going to respond to the shadow Treasurer (Mr Reith) and his claims for the many benefits that the tax reform package offers to the Australian people, said, 'Well, really, Paul, the package is so big it's like trying to discuss the Australian economy'. Is that not a joke-the Treasurer of Australia saying that the tax reform package, some 600-odd pages put out by the coalition and announced last week by the Leader of the Opposition, is so big that it is like trying to discuss the Australian economy. The Treasurer was right; that is what it is all about. It is about the Australian economy. It is about the Australian people. It is about a vision for the future-not the kind of squeaky hyperbole that we get from an absolutely distraught and discredited Prime Minister. It is about a real vision-a vision for the future of the Australian people. It is about a vision for families, a vision of hope for individuals, for children, for our elderly, for those who are disadvantaged, and for those who are not. It is about a vision for all Australians that perhaps we can get our act together again and that perhaps we can become more productive. It is about a package that will assist us along the way, because it might give us a bit of hope. We need a bit of hope. We certainly need a bit of hope today. In Australia today there is not a lot of hope-not with over one million Australians without jobs, not with those people in jobs fearing that they will lose theirs tomorrow and not with the massive amOlmt of disruption to Australian industry caused by bankruptcies. No, there is not much hope out there today. During this debate we heard from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). The Minister said, '1I have developed a bit of a thick skin'. 1 would think so. Considering his record in this place, considering his performance and considering the amount that he cops, I would think that his hide would be a bit thick. We would all think that. He is one of those opposite who are sort of sitting in the wings-challenging the Prime Minister? If the honourable member for Blaxland does not get up, perhaps the Minister for Employment, Education and Training will, because it is for sure that the former chook farmer, the now Treasurer, ain't going to make it. That is obvious. We heard tonight on the ABC that the Prime Minister is considering changing the Treasurer. That is not like changing one's underwear. We just did that, did we not? We shifted the honourable member for Blaxland from the front bench to the back bench. And he is supposed to be the Government's best performer! That makes a lot of sense, does it not-front bench to back bench? We took the chook farmer and we made him Treasurer. He is the one who says, 'That's me; I'm the Treasurer'. He is the one who goes overseas and says that we are in the worse recession for 60 years. I can understand that the Prime Minister is not very happy with the Treasurer. But then the Treasurer is probably not very happy with the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Blaxland is probably not very happy with either one of them. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training will have the job, if anybody will let him have it. I think he is running down the middle now. He is trying anyway. He said that the Government had 15 months to take apart the coalition's policy bit by bit. I tell the Minister for Employment, Education and Training that it will take all of that-every little bit of itand you will not get there. Do you know why? Because it is a comprehensive package. It is designed to assist Australians. It is designed to give them hope and vision for the future. That is what the people out there want. That is what the people on the street want. They want a bit of encouragement. People are sick to death of doom and gloom. All we get from the Treasury side of this House is doom and gloom. I ask the Government not to blame us for talking down this economy. Goodness gracious, it is the Government that has talked down the economy-constantly. The Minister talked about a new tax-a goods and services tax-to be put on the sweated backs of ordinary Australians. What a remarkable statement for a Minister of the Crown to make-a Minister who admits that he has a bit of a thick skin! It is more like a buffalo hide. It would want to be too because the goods and services tax is designed to get rid of seven taxes that are impeding industry, that are holding back jobs, that are iniquitous and that hurt the Australian people. Of course, we are going to introduce a goods and services tax, because it is fair, sensible and will introduce major reform to this country. I would like to take a couple of minutes to give a cheerio to Dominic Romano, a constituent of mine in the electorate of La Trobe. He lives in Kalorama, which is at the top of Mount Dandenong. He came to see me a couple of weeks ago. He is in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, and he has a few problems. Dominic is about 34 years old and has been in the TCF industry all his life. He has just gone through one company because it has gone bye-byes. He is with a second company and he reckons it is not going to last very long. He said to me, ' Mr Charles, since the Government brought down the March economic statement the banks will not even talk to us. We might as well be dead. We can't borrow money. We can't get any credit. We are in real trouble. Why is the Government trying to destroy the textile, clothing and footwear industry?'. I told him that I could not answer that because I did not know why the Government was trying to do that. Dominic said, 'Your side, the Opposition, wants to get rid of tariffs too. You said you are going to reduce tariffs to negligible levels by the year 2000'. I told him that was right but that there was a difference between the Government policy of simply getting rid of the tariffs with a scorched earth policy and a level playing field, and our policy that offers some hope for the future. I told him that the hope we offer him is a real change in the industrial relations climate that will allow him to reduce his costs and will allow his performance to increase. I said the second thing we would do would be to reduce input costs in communications, in transport and in shipping. Dominic then asked how we were going to help him when he is not able to compete with South East Asia because of labour costs. He said that his equipment is modern-the best there is; his people are well trained; and his firm spends a lot of money on training-but it still cannot compete. The problem he faces is that his company has to run 24 hours a day in order to be competitive with a like mill in South East Asia weaving the same cloth. In order to be competitive he needs to be able to run three shifts over the 24 hours but the unions will not allow him to run more than two shifts over the 24 hours. This means that he has to pay eight hours overtime per day in order to get the cloth woven. He cannot run three shifts, with three lots of people, at reasonable wages. Why not? Because the unions say so, and the unions control the labour market. We want to reduce tariffs to negligible levels because we know that tariffs are distorting and create inefficiencies. Goodness knows we have enough inefficiency in our industries in this great nation. But we will offer Dominic some hope because we will make real changes to the industrial relations system, not Clay tons changes. With the recent national wage case decision on enterprise bargaining, everybody has picked up the coalition's rhetoric. In 1986, after decades and decades of talking about change, the Liberal and National parties finally reached a decision to change their industrial relations policy by proposing to deregulate the labour market with voluntary employment agreements, introduce voluntary union membership and so bring about the end of the closed shop, and initiate the vote before people strike and secret ballots. That was a succinct policy change. Now listen to the rhetoric. The ACTU talks about voluntary employment agreements. Even the Labor Party talks about them. On 30 April the Industrial Relations Commission said that nobody was mature enough to make voluntary agreements, but on 30 October it said, 'Okay, away you go, boys'. But it has brought down a Clay tons enterprise bargaining system-people are not able to negotiate their own wages, their hours of work, long service leave, superannuation entitlements, Workcare or any other matter. All people can do is add to wages. Maybe a deal can be done to pay workers more, but they cannot get rid of any of the conditions that exist today because there are awards. The great union movement in this country fought for decades for the rights of their members to get those awards. Even though the unions represent only 30 per cent of the labour force in the private labour market, nonetheless the unions control the agenda. There is no enterprise bargaining. The Opposition will give people enterprise bargaining. I would like to close my brief remarks by saying that I condemn the Prime Minister because he is weak. The Treasurer is weak. The whole blessed front bench is weak, and the back bench knows it. The sooner we get to an election and get the public to vote on the coalition's taxation reform measures, and the sooner we get to Fightback, the better chance we have for a healthy future for a great nation.",135
349,Mr MELHAM,PRIME MINISTER,"I support the Government amendment to the motion, which states: That all words after 'That' be deleted and the following inserted: 'this House censures the Leader of the Opposition for perpetrating a massive fraud on the people of Australia with the launch of his Fightback document which will increase unemployment, increase inflation, wreck economic recovery and shift the burden of taxation from the very rich to middle and low income Australians'. The snake oil salesmen of the Opposition are at it again, promising Australians that a consumption tax is a panacea for Australia's economic problems. We are told it will reduce unemployment, encourage savings and reduce our foreign debt. If applied correctly, it will even cure baldness. In what has been a massive confidence trick, we have seen the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) traversing the countryside, preaching the benefits of his goods and services tax. While some honourable members in the Opposition see him as a messiah, the truth is that he is a false prophet. He was even seen having lunch at MCDonald's in Parramatta. It is a good thing he has a Commonwealth car driver because it is very unlikely that he would know where Parramatta is. It is this very hypocrisy which permeates the Opposition's economic policy. It does not care about low to middle income earners. Indeed, the GST does very little to assist low and middle income earners, while people in receipt of social security benefits or superannuation funds will be crushed. A GST will do nothing to help achieve social justice and equity. It is a recipe for disaster. Yet the Leader of the Opposition and the rump that is the National Party have gone out to the Australian people and told them halftruths. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) should well remember the fate that befell his predecessor. Once rural electors realise the full impact of a GST, the same fate will await many members of the National Party. The Leader of the National Party has sold out his constituency. His performance has earned him the name 'Opium', because opium is a slow-working dope. The GST will, however, be a bonus for those on high incomes. These people will pay significantly less as the cost of luxury items will fall. A luxury car will be thousands of dollars cheaper, but bread will cost more. In other words, the Opposition is saying, 'Let them eat cake'. A consumption tax is regressive. Its impact is greater on those on fixed and low incomes. It does nothing to promote equity and fairness. The cost of everyday items will increase, Bread, milk, fruit and vegetables will all increase in price. These are not what one would consider to be luxury items but rather necessities of life. Any successful tax system must be progressive, not regressive. The greatest burden of tax should fall upon those who can most afford it, not those who are the most disadvantaged. A consumption tax will greatly benefit the rich constituents of the Opposition but will do little to benefit the MCDonald's family restaurant customer at Panamatta. The falseness of the Opposition's package is best highlighted by its claim to compensate pensioners by increasing pensions by 8 per cent to 28 per cent of average weekly earnings. The simple fact is that pensions are already 26.4 per cent of average weekly earnings. The economic gurus of the Opposition will have us believe that a GST will encourage savings. The fact is that people will have less money to save because they are spending more on the necessities of life. Perhaps the Opposition believes that people will be saving more because they will be eating less. It should try telling those who are unemployed that they will be able to save more when, in reality, they will be forced to pay more for everyday goods and services. The GST is an octopus that will spread its tentacles into the pockets of all Australians. It will not differentiate between rich and poor, unemployed or retired. It will serve only to widen the gap between rich and poor and create a new class of poor. Indeed, many Australians will be treated as second class citizens. The Opposition's package gives with one hand but takes with the other. It resembles the iron fist hidden within the velvet glove. Once the shallow rhetoric of the Opposition has been exposed, people will realise the inherent dangers associated with the GST. If the tax cuts promised by the Opposition are real, where will the Government find the money to meet its ongoing commitments? The answer is obvious. The Opposition has made it perfectly clear that those in receipt of welfare benefits will be its main target. Unemployment benefits will be cut off after nine months and the supporting mother's benefit will be cut off after children reach 12 years of age. We will see the gradual phasing out of Medicare and full fees for tertiary students. The list goes on and on. In other words, members of the Opposition would severely cut back the role of government. The services provided by the Government would be abolished or privatised, given to their mates, as is the case in New South Wales. The Government's role would be that of economic manager. We all know what a disaster New South Wales Incorporated has been. The people of New South Wales deservedly showed their displeasure at the last State election. That is the model that the people of Australia need to look at-the conservative Greiner Government. That is what this Opposition holds for the future of Australia. A GST will cause more problems than it will solve. We should just look at New Zealand where the ranks of the unemployed have increased dramatically. The black economy would flourish as a GST will give more people incentive to find ways of avoiding paying tax. Why should a motor mechanic charge a customer 15 per cent tax for repairing his car if the person is willing to pay in cash? It is mutually beneficial for both parties to deal in cash. The mechanic does not have to declare his income, while the customer does not have to pay tax. So much for stamping out tax avoidance. The GST will impact on all services. It will, therefore, impact on inflation. The cost of electricity, water, rates and gas will all increase, while the consumer will receive no extra service. Local councils will be forced to either cut back or abolish services. The grand vision for Australia suddenly turns sour. The Opposition's manifesto is not a fight back; it is a slide back. This document is not a blueprint for the future, but rather a return to the Dark Ages. It draws heavily from the philosophy of the nineteenth century American economist, Herbert Spencer, who coined the phrase 'the survival of the fittest'. The vision espoused by the Leader of the Opposition is a nation of individuals concerned only with their own well-being. There is no concept of society, only the individual. It will be a dog eat dog world where there is little or no compassion shown for those who are disadvantaged. The Fightback! document is a statement driven by right wing ideologues. It is the manifesto of the New Right in Australia. In conjunction with other Opposition policies, it will result in an unprecedented attack on the living and working conditions of most Australians, all in the name of economic management and responsibility. Workers will bear the brunt of this New Right philosophy. The faceless men behind the Opposition are just waiting for the opportunity to exploit and prosper at the expense of workers. Let the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party come clean with the electorate and tell them of their true intentions. Ultimately, the people of Australia will cast judgment on the Opposition's false hopes and promises. As in 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990, I am certain that the electorate will once again reject members of the Opposition for the frauds and hypocrites that they are. On page 2 of this right wing document, the Leader of the Opposition and the National Party Leader say: Our program of refonn crystallises the choice facing the Australian people. Indeed, it does. In 1993 the people of Australia will have a clear choice between the New Right ideologues in the Opposition and a government that is filled with compassion, a government that is filled with vision and a government that will create opportunity. Indeed, there is pain, but for the pain there will be gain. It was interesting to see the faces of the Opposition members at Question Time today when the demolition began and when the plagiarism in this document was revealed. Air fares will not be subject to the consumption tax. I suggest that there will be plenty of Opposition members who will be wanting one-way tickets out of Australia as the Government demolishes this fraudulent con trick that has been perpetrated on the Australian people.",138
350,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIME MINISTER,"Hope springs eternal, Daryl.",140
351,Mr MELHAM,PRIME MINISTER,"Hope springs eternal. The Opposition's record over the last 8112 years is there for everyone to see. The dark years of the Fraser Government are there for everyone to see. The face of the conservatives is there for the people of New South Wales to seethe Harvard graduate, the business graduate, the hope of the team. What happened? He fell over the line. Why? Because he rorted the electoral system. With ticks and crosses, he changed the rules midstream and disenfranchised 300,000 Australians. The record of the Fraser Government was clear; it threw 400,000 people on the unemployment scrap heap. This document offers nothing for the disadvantaged. It will create further unemployment. It will .create division and disunity within the Australian electorate and, quite frankly, it is the way back for the Australian Labor Party; there is no doubt about that. The Opposition will realise that silence is golden. (Time expired)",140
352,Mr CONNOLLY,PRIME MINISTER,"Bradfield) (9.00 p.m.)The speech that we have just heard from the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) demonstrates beyond any shadow of doubt that Australia can no longer afford a failed government made up of people of his quality. He has the audacity to come into this House and say to the Australian people that he stands for a government that is full of compassion, vision and opportunity and, last but not least, used that glorious expression of his, 'There wil- be pain; but then of course there will be gain'. Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the last 8 1h years-especially for the past two years-over 16 million Australians, including their wives and children, have felt the pain of this Hawke Labor Government. For the last eight years people have wondered where this country was going. For the last two years they have known where it is going-nowhere. 1\vo years ago the Opposition commenced the most far-reaching analysis of public opinion ever conducted by any party in the history of this Federation. After the last election we knew that the time had come when men and women in this Parliament, representing the Australian people, including their children, had to be seen to be concerned about the realities of their lifestyle and their future. During the past eight years Labor has allowed these arrogant men and women to believe that the interests of the ordinary workers of Australia are no longer relevant. We went out to those people-a quarter of a million Australians-and we asked them what they wanted. They told us that above all they wanted a new sense of purpose, a new sense of direction, a sense of leadership and pride in their country. They wanted a belief in the future for their children. These were concepts which for far too long we have tended to take for granted. One of those people said this: At present Australia's international reputation an all time low. Our economy is weak, our trade position is weak, our people seem without direction, with no goals and no real urge to concern themselves for the future. It was on the basis of that advice that the Opposition parties and particularly the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) were determined to give the Australian people a sense of direction, a sense of leadership, a belief in themselves and in the future of this great country of ours. Over that period we have developed the most consistent and detailed analysis that has ever been put before the Australian people in the form of the well-known Fightback program. One may well ask: why do we use the word 'Fightback'? One does not need to be a genius to see why. It is a word which has emotive appeal and the ability to say to people, 'Let us get together and work this country so that once again we can achieve the greatness we know we are capable of'. We want the capacity to change the direction of Australia so that we do not talk about one million people unemployed and hundreds of thousands of wives and children whose daily economic lifestyle has been so severely affected. It means that once again we can say to all the people of Australia, 'Here are the opportunities. Here is the chance to make a real contribution to this nation and to yourselves. Here is an opportunity to tum around lowering living standards which you have seen over the last eight years. And here is the opportunity to create two million new jobs by the year 2000 for Australia's unemployed'. This program is for the 30 per cent of young Australians who believe they have no future, who cannot understand what it is that they have done wrong. The only mistake they made was to be born Australians. What an incredible indictment upon any govemmentthat above all else it failed the youth of this country. When the Government is supposed to be creating a future, for the last two days we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) do nothing but mewl about the past and about the achievements of his Government, which is now on the ropes. He has no sense of direction, no sense of purpose, no goals and no future. And Government members wonder is at why the Australian people seek change. Perhaps the most important statistic that has appeared in the press in the past two weeks has been the one setting out public opinion in relation. to the Fightback package. Whereas less thah 50 per cent of people often said, 'Maybe there is not a direct benefit for me', some 56 per cent of the people said, 'We believe it is good for Australia'. They were saying to this Government, 'We are no longer satisfied with a group of people who cling to power for no other purpose than to look after the interests of themselves and their mates. We want a sense of direction for this nation. We are prepared to make sacrifices, provided we know where we are going and provided we can see at the end of the road a future for ourselves and our children'. The Fightback package was announced in an environment where there is a desperate need for change. We have given the people a program more detailed than ever before in the history of this Federation. We are talking about regenerating the economy to increase national productivity and to reduce foreign debt. We are talking about creating more jobs, particularly for young Australians, about improving living standards and restoring financial security for all, about promoting international competitiveness for our industries so that our country can once' again match the best that the world has to offer. There is the need to improve incentives to individuals and to business by lightening the tax burden. We have heard tonight from members of the Government that Australia's tax system is low in comparison with those in other countries. How is it that nobody believes them? I will tell them why. Because there is no incentive to work hard in this country, when people on average weekly earnings do a few hours overtime and find themselves rocketing into the maximum marginal rate of tax. We are offering exactly the opposite. We are saying to the workers of Australia, to those millions and millions of people who want to get up and build this nation, 'Under our program, 95 per cent of all Australians will pay less income tax and the vast majority will pay less than 30c in the dollar'. That is what we are saying, in direct contrast to the Government. We are also saying to people on average income, 'You can double your income and you will not increase your direct income tax'. That is the model we are offering the Australian people. All the evidence is clear-the Australian people will see the virtue of those fundamental changes. We are talking about raising the quality of education and training-training for those unemployed so they have the capacity to fit into what will be a vital and vibrant economic sector. There is the need for improved education so that our young people will be able to compete with the best in the world. Is that asking too much? Is that asking too much of the descendants of people who in the past have fought against fire and flood and drought and all the other difficulties of nature, and have won? Of course not. We are going to lead Australia forward, based upon one simple principle, that this nation can survive only if it is prepared to work its way out. For far too long, under all governments, we have encouraged the belief in this nation that we can have one of the highest standards of living in the world, provided somebody else pays for it. The simple fact is that other people's savings are no longer going to be available to maintain Australia's standard of living indefinitely. The time has now come when the responsibility is quite clearly on our shoulders. We are fighting an economic war, a war in which there is no chance of failure, unless we give in-and that we most certainly will not do. It is a war where it must be absolutely clear to the Australian nation that we know what victory will bring us, we know what the task is that has to be done, and we know how we are going to achieve that objective. That is why this document of over 600 pages sets out in the most detailed manner, step by step, the decision making process, the outcome of those decisions, the role of every individual in our society to fit in, and the role of businesses especially-for them we offer no less than $20 billion less taxation-because we know that if we are going to create jobs for Australian workers, fundamentally they must come from the private sector. We are talking about streamlining the public sector in such a way that the people in the sector will be involved in doing a worthwhile job and will be proud of what they do, while ensuring that those areas of the public sector which could best be handled in the private sector should be there in a competitive environment. This is a direction even the Labor Government is now moving in. slowly but surely, after eight years of constant debate and goading by the Opposition. We even hear our language-for example. enterprise bargainingcoming back to us. But the Government cannot even get its industrial relations policy right, because this Government is, as it has always been, a creature of the trade union movement. particularly the ACTU. Employers and employees in this country must be able to negotiate, face to face, in the interests of the business which employs those people, in such a way that they will benefit from that employment. The nineteenth century approach, in which there was a constant battle between employers and employees, is a luxury that Australia can no longer afford. It is very sad, but there are still large segments of the trade union movement which will say to their workers that this class war must be the very basis of Australian society. If we are not prepared to stand together and face the massive economic and social problems before us, we must surely perish as a nation, and we will go into history as the people who had so much and failed when the ultimate test came before them. It is for that reason that taxation is such an important part of this total package. We are removing no less than seven taxes from the entire system: for example. a 30 per cent reduction in personal income tax; the abolition of wholesale sales tax and its replacement by a goods and services tax; reductions in the capital gains tax; the abolition of superannuation lump sum tax; the abolition of the payroll tax; the abolition of petroleum product excise; and the reduction in tax on business, including for import competing business, and on exports. Why? For two obvious reasons. As one of my colleagues said a moment ago, it is to instil once again the belief in the Australian people that there is such a thing as incentive and that there can be a fair return for a fair day's work. At the other end of the spectrum, if we are to reduce our national debt, if we are to pay our way, it is obvious that Australia must once again become one of the world's great trading nations, not just a nation that trades in raw materials, which we have done for so long. The great bulk commodities of the past are no longer one of the major elements of international trade. People are now looking for value added commodities. That is where the real profit lies. That is the direction in which we have to go. One of the reasons we have failed for so long is that we have had a tax system in place which effectively taxes exports. It taxes the entrepreneurial spirit and the people who ought to be going out, making the decisions and taking the risks to get Australia back into world markets. That is why the $20 billion I referred to is a fundamental package of changes, saying to the entrepreneurs of Australia, 'Get out there and give it a go. We'll back you all the way. Build Australia'. Above all, it is for our nation's and our children's good that we are here forming policy. We are proud of the package we have put together for the Australian people and we have every confidence that it will be supported. The fact that the last few days have demonstrated a desperate drought in the Australian psyche, a wish that there should be a change, is clearly identified in the Australian Speak document, which was the very basis of our analysis of the views of the Australian people. I seek leave to table the Australian Speak document. Leave granted.",141
353,Mr CONNOLLY,PRIME MINISTER,"As I said in my opening remarks, the Fightback policy analysis is the outcome of the most detailed examination of Australian public opinion ever made. It is also the outcome of the most detailed analysis of Australian economic policy ever conducted. We are determined to lead Australia forward and we will have the support of the Australian people to achieve the great goals and the great future that we know is there for all of us.",143
354,Mrs CROSIO,PRIME MINISTER,"Prospect) (9.16 p.m.)When I entered the House I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Conp.olly) talking about war. I thought that obviously the war he is fighting cannot be the Fightback package that has just been presented by the Opposition, because in it is a massive cut in defence. I was glad that he mentioned the fact that no longer can we have the nineteenth century type of trading. Let us not believe that we will go into the year 2000 trading in human lives, because this is what the Fightback package is all about. He went on to say, 'Let us praise the entrepreneurs'. Are we going back into the 1980s, in which the corporate cowboys raped this country? Is that what Opposition members are talking about when they say, 'Bring on the entrepreneurs to develop this country?' The Opposition's 15 per cent goods and services tax is the most unfair and illogical tax proposal to be put forward in Australia in this century. How can a tax that makes bread, butter, meat, clothing, housing and other essential items more expensive in order to reduce the price of furs, jewellery, Mercedes cars and other luxuries be considered even remotely fair and reasonable? The coalition's cold-hearted goods and services package should be condemned for the changes it makes to the sole parent pension. These changes are discriminative and harsh. They put added pressure on a group of people who are constantly battling to make ends meet with dignity and decorum. With a lack of understanding so typical of the Opposition, this package proposes to halt the sole parent pension when the youngest child in such a family turns 12 years of age. The sole parent could be male or female. As many members of the Opposition should realise, the child not formed through immaculate conception, but the sole parent would then be forced to go onto the Job Search allowance and made to find work. Until they can find a job, these parents' incomes would decrease dramatically, at a time when their children would require more money than when they were under the age of 12. 1Welve-year-old children are still not old enough to cope with being left at home while their parent goes out to work. The years between 12 and 16 are some of the most formative of a child's life; years when they require not only large amounts of love and understanding but also clothing and essentials. From the age of 12, children can grow anything from an inch to 111z inches in six mohths. How could sole parents possibly be expected to keep up with the requirements of their children at. this age without financial help? Page 287 of the Opposition's Fightback package deals with the uniform age pension. It states: Calculations are based on the assumptions that: as in 1990-91, around 13,000 women will reach 60 years and will become eligible for the Age Pension. half of these will be women. . . What are the other half? When 13,000 women reach the age of 60 and become eligible for the age pension, half of these will be women. I have read the document from front to back and I have not found what happened to the other 6,500-whether they changed sex or just failed to exist. But this is th- type of document that the Opposition is quoting as being so fair and logical to the electorate at large. It is a shallow document. It is a document that has been miscalculated and it is a document, in its presentation, that will be tried for what it really is-a document of deceit and illogical representation. Judging from the Opposition's package, it seems to think that not only these women, but particularly sole parents, are second-class citizens. It probably says, 'We don't need them. We don't need to consider them. They probably didn't vote for us; therefore we will not do anything to help them.' Under the coalition's package, sole parents would not be was allowed even the opportunity to opt for parenting in a full time capacity. However, the Opposition would increase the dependent spouse rebate so that it would be easier for the dependent spouse to stay at home and look after the children full time. This wonderful Opposition scheme is an obvious case of discrimination against sole parents, who would be forced to work after their children turned 12 years of age. Further in this wonderful Fightback! document I have noted the changes to the family allowance supplement. In the event of this package being implemented, 31,000 sole parent incomes would be cut off immediately. Statistics tell us that the average family contains 2.1 children. I have always wondered where the 0.1 is, but that is what statistics tell us. That means that this policy would disadvantage immediately more than 70,000 children just because they have reached that magical age of 12. These children are our country's future. Why should they be disadvantaged purely because they are being brought up by one parent? Nowhere in the document does it refer to whether a sole parent has been widowed, is in ill health, divorced or whatever. The coalition simply would not tolerate a sole parent receiving any type of assistance to bring up children over the age of 12. Under this Hawke Government, a sole parent with two children over 12 years-say 12 and 13 or 12 and 14-can earn through part time work $250 and receive on average $140 per week as a part pension. However, under the coalition's Fightback packageshould it ever have the opportunity to introduce it-such a parent with those two children and who continued to do part time work and earn that $250 would get a mere $30 per week in assistance. Such a person would then be faced with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. How would such people survive? Such policies would only promote poverty in the community and would certainly destroy families. I fervently believe that the Opposition's total lack of understanding of the problems faced by sole parents was further emphasised recently in a radio interview with Senator Alston. The senator had the gall to say that sole parents should go to work to help them to find a partner. How insulting! Since when has Senator Alston been qualified as the perfect matchmaker? I am truly amazed that policies such as those presented in this package are being seriously supported by those members opposite. Surely they know people within their electorates who unfortunately have become sole parents. Surely they know people in their electorates who would be made destitute by the introduction of the type of package that has been thwarted around Australia at large in the last few days. I am also truly amazed that policies such as these are even being seriously contemplated. It was pleasing to read in a recent article in the Catholic Weekly: It is five years since the consumption tax was introduced in New Zealand. The claim of the advocates of the tax that it is a significant step in overall economic reform are not borne out by the experience across the Tasman. We know that a lot of this package has been copied from New Zealand. It was clearly emphasised today that a 1985 statement had been taken verbatim and placed in the Fightback package as launched by the Leader of the Opposition. The article went on to say: Though we have seen some economic problems, by comparison with New Zealand, the Australian economy is a bonanza. The article went on to say: Many small business people who are inclined to support the proposal would have second thoughts when they realise that they will become unpaid tax gatherers for the Government. In New Zealand there are 300,000 businesses now involved in that process. As the population of Australia is more than five times that of New Zealand, that would mean over 1.5 million Australian businesses would become tax gatherers. That is about 20 times the number now involved in the wholesale sales tax system. With 1.5 million businesses gathering the tax in a country of 17 million people it would be one of our biggest growth industries-but the sort of industry that I believe we need like a hole in the head. The Opposition also tries to point the finger at our Government for mismanagement. How dare these hypocrites get the words past their mouths? What members opposite have so conveniently forgotten is the vital fact that the economic indicators on which they have so much to say were a lot worse when they were in government. The low inflation rate that this Government has achieved through careful planning and economic management would be destroyed by the Opposition's goods and services package. It has been estimated that it could put the inflation rate back up to 10 per cent or even more. How can the Opposition seriously believe that what it has to offer the people of Australia is fair, just and beneficial to all? It would be'disastrous. The Opposition's goods and services package does not provide the solutions to this country's economic woes. It is unfair; it is illogical; it is inflationary; regressive; and it is highly unpredictable as it is based on some extremely bold and, dare I say, rash assumptions. Again, the Catholic Weekly report that I mentioned earlier states: The reality is that low income people have to on goods and services all or most of their In the current recession many unemployed people and farmers would be spending more than their income just to exist (with the excess financed by running down their capital or by going into But better off people may spend as little or less of their income on essentials. One of the worse features of this tax is that burden will be even harder on many middle low income people. Country people will pay than their city cousins because goods and services are more expensive in the country because of a large freight component. For retired people or those who are about retire, the increased inflation rate as a result of the goods and services tax would be a this package. savage form of wealth tax. According to the article, those people who have saved a nest egg for their retirement through hard work over many years would be devastated as this money would be slashed by somewhere Government between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. Where in that scenario is the incentive to work save that the Opposition has spoken so boldly of lately? The Opposition also talks in this package a compensation scheme for those who may-I emphasise the word 'may'-be hurt by a goods and services tax. Although the Opposiber tion says 'may', I believe every individual would be hurt in some way by this goods and services tax. Such a scheme would, of necessity, be based on an average situation, which would not be adequate for the many people who are not in an average situation. Recently, in this bringing an anti-discrimination Bill into this House whilst speaking in a grievance debate, I spoke about the average age of our legisobscure lators. But that does not mean to say that everyone in this Parliament is 48.9 years age. Therefore, when we look at the average situation, we must then estimate the number of people who are going to benefit and weigh that up against the number who will be hurtand hurt savagely-by the introduction of a it is goods and services tax, as laid down in this 'illustrious' document. People such as those I have mentionedsole parents; the magical 6 1/2 thousand women we have lost who, after the age of 60, disapspend pear with nothing known of what became of income. them; the country people; the people with large families; the average working class person who earns less than what is estimated debt). to be the average incomewill be hurt by as a fifth this package. (Time expired)",143
355,Mr ANDERSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I the must say at the outset that with reference to and the remarks of the previous speaker, the more honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), it is a great shame that she evidently has not studied the package. If she had, she would have seen, just to pick up one example, that to country people will benefit enormously from the freight reductions which will result from Mrs Crosio-I have read it.",146
356,Mr ANDERSON,PRIME MINISTER,"She obviously has not absorbed its meaning. It is a pity that the is not holding true to its promise to engage in genuine debate as opposed to a and scare campaign in relation to this package. Mrs Crosio- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. There is no way in the world of that I implied a scare campaign. I quoted to honourable members opposite their own words, and again I ask the honourable memfor Gwydir and everyone opposite: where are the 6 tlz thousand women who have magically disappeared? It is not a scare campaign.",146
357,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Mr Dubois)Order! There is no point of order.,146
358,Mr ANDERSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I return to more serious matters. As we have done a lot of talking in place about leadership, I tum to that issue and what it is all about. To obtain a bit of an outline of leadership, I quote from a rather source, which I think is of particular interest. It comes from, of all people, Edsel of Ford, the son of Henry Ford the car maker. He said that leadership basically consists of three essential qualities: firstly, the capacity to form a vision in one's mind; secondly, the ability to communicate that to others; and, thirdly, the capacity to inspire people to work towards that vision. I add a fourth factor to that: the willingness and capacity to set an example that justifies that inspiration. Today in this place, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave us his vision for Australia today. I found it very interesting. He said that he wanted a tolerant multicultural society in which the disadvantaged and the underprivileged are properly protected by government. He went on to reject what he called experiments in cold Darwinian theory. What does this project for us in the way of an Australian society in which to live in 1991? The bare statistics have been pretty well covered in this place today. Nearly one million people are unemployed, getting on for 10 per cent plus, whatever it is; 500,000 to 600,000 people unable to secure full employment or the job of their choice; 30 per centan horrific 30 per cent-of young people unemployed, unable to find work or begin a career; and a ballooning foreign debt which we are told is now of the order, in net terms, of $130 billion and represents something like $70,000 of extra incremental debt for every job supposedly created by the Government over the last seven years. But, worse, there is a crisis of confidence in the community, a feeling that the nation is adrift, rudderless on a sea of insoluble problems. There is no doubt in my mind that that is why people out there have been so quick to adopt and embrace our package. This loss of confidence in the Government and its vision has occurred despite all the rhetoric we hear in this place and outside about social justice, social wages policy and a more caring society. It seems to me that Australians feel deeply and with great conviction that we are off the rails. Even the idea that the Government should be there to protect people is increasingly cynically dismissed as nothing more than the representation of a desire to enrol individuals as dependants of the state. That is a cruel hoax of an idea that seemed so much a part of the Whitlam approach-the Whitlam approach that saw people subjected to the idea that their lives could be run better by the and its instrumentalities than by those individuals themselves. I would just like to look at some specific groups left disadvantaged, underprivileged and anything but properly protected by government, in contravention of the vision the Prime Minister said that he had for Australia today. I turn firstly to young people. The Prime Minister promised them, of course, that none of them would live in poverty by 1990. That is the first quotation that springs to mind. That was sort of leadership bordering on a standard somewhat less impressive than Churchillian. It certainly failed the test of inspiring people to work towards it, being so patently absurd, because it missed the need to identify the causes of child poverty. It immediately produced cynicism and ridicule across Australia-and I would suggest quite appropriately so. That did not lessen the pain, of course, for the dispossessed and alienated kids in our society. I wonder how many people ever stop to consider the significance of the loud callsthis is just one minor example which I find quite interesting-for better anti-theft security for Australian made motor cars. Groups like the NRMA especially have been very vocal. As a result, whatever other qualities Australian cars mayor may not possess, when compared with those manufactured anywhere else in the world they are amongst the most difficult to steal. And they need to be, with our theft rates. The truly tragic thing is that we know that a great deal of that theft, in fact, arises from young people stealing motorcars for a bit of a spin, a joy ride, for all sorts of purposes. Some of them, unfortunately, steal them to support drug habits and this sort of thing. I happen to know a little bit about this, as I once had quite a new motor car stolen in Sydney by three young people. The police seemed to know all about them. I got the motor car back a week later in a very decrepit condition, full of the evidence from the jewellery store that they had knocked off and the drugs that they had been using. The police told me they had a pretty good idea of who had done it, which I took to mean that they state knew exactly who had been responsible, but that there was no point in taking the issue up, because those children would get nothing more than, proverbially speaking, a rap over the knuckles and a bit of a message to go home and be good. Those kids out there might be on the fringes. Nobody denies that. Fortunately, not too many children have fallen into that sort of class yet. However, the point remains that there are too many of them and every day there are too many more of them. It really gives the lie t,o the Prime Minister's claim that no child would live in poverty. The reality, unfortunately, is that we are seeing a continuing drift in exactly the opposite direction. I want to make the point that, if that is the cutting edge, then what stands behind it is also deeply disturbing. Recently I had a lot of children from schools in my electorate through this place, as I am sure other members have had children from theirs. It is the end of the year. I have taken to asking them what worries them most. I used to find a couple of years ago that the biggest single thing, believe it or not, was environment. But not any more. Now it is jobs, jobs and jobs, no matter how the question is phrased. The things that worry them most relate to the 0ppOitunities for training for a job, securing a job and entering some sort of satisfactory career path. The other day I had in here one group of perhaps 30 school children who will all be out in the work force in two or three years time. I asked them the same question and they all, bar one, expressed their concern about jobs. I asked the one remaining individual why he was not concerned, and he replied that his father was going to put him back on the land. I found that a particularly tragic answer because he was probably kidding himself more than anybody else in the group. If the Prime Minister's vision for children is that they would be better off under the protective mantle of government, I have to disagree with him. If his vision becomes a reality, we will have a real problem out there because we have developed a society which is not able to offer children a secure future. They feel anything but confident. I suggest that real compassion might extend instead to offering those young people better education opportunities. This pack, about which we have just heard such crass and unrealistic criticism from the previous speaker, commits us to an additional $3 billion expenditure on education alone by the year 2000 or the turn of the century. Having done that for young people, the program looks to regenerate the private sector, which is the only legitimate job building sector in the Australian economy, so that those people might have reasonable prospects of employment. Of course, when we were young we took for granted that there would be a job market out there, that we would be able to find a niche, that we would be able to grow into it and expand into it. It is an appalling thing, and perhaps something that we in this place do not fully understand, to be young and to be faced with the prospect of not quite knowing whether one is going to be able to find meaningful employment. The second area that I would like to tum the to is the farm sector and the pain that those involved in it have endured. I recall another call to arms by the Prime Minister back in the days when the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the then claimed world's best Treasurer, was talking about banana republics. That particular call ran along the lines of 'restraint with equity' - all Australians must make sacrifices but it will be done with equity. There was not to be much equity for farmers. This Government built its economic management, its wages policy and its taxes policy around high inflation. It pretended that we could live with high inflation and that there was nothing to be feared from high inflation. It tried to can us into believing that inflation did not matter as long as wages were adjusted for those who could be adequately protected. That, of course, was a cruel hoax. In general terms it was a cruel hoax on the whole of the Australian community. The Prime Minister has become a convert to the need to rein in inflation-since the Government had the good fortune to stumble across the discovery that if one sends an economy comatose, one can snap the inflation stick, as the honourable member for Blaxland describes it. But it is a little bit too late because a great deal of the damage out there in the community has been done. There has been massive wealth redistribution against the interests of the farmers, the exporters, the old and those on low and fixed incomes. The evidence abounds; it is quite easy to find. Any number of farmers could tell us that when Hawke came to power-this is one example that springs to mind-a person could buy something like a Toyota Land Cruiser, which is every cocky's friend these days, for the equivalent of, say, 30 steers or 100 tonnes of wheat. By 1990, seven years into the Hawke Labor Government, one was looking at 80 steers or 300 tonnes of wheat. Now, of course, with the worse drought for many years stalking the land-for many people in some parts of the country it is the worse in recorded history-we find a government caught flatfooted, with no adequate drought policy and with a need to move quickly to preserve an asset that is important, not just to farmers but to the economic well-being of this country, that is, the nation's breeding flocks and herds. There is no adequate policy in place to meet that urgent need. I will cite just one other example. In this time of great crisis in the rural community, the basic simple justice of a decent isolated children's allowance to ensure that all children, regardless of where they live, have equal access to schools at school gate level has been allowed to slip away to the point that it is worth only a fraction of its earlier value. That is a massively discriminatory policy which, I suggest, works not just against the interests of affected fanners' children, miners' children and lighthouse keepers' children-all of those people in isolated areas of Australia who need this sort of help-but against all our interests. This is a big country. Much of our wealth is produced in remote areas, and we need to do a great deal more about recognising the needs of those brave souls who carry on in often very arduous circumstances to produce this nation's bread and butter. There is a third group that, with some sensitivity, I want to turn to. Those are the regional inhabitants of this ancient continent. I have a lot of them in my electorate. It very deeply concerns me that they are not being adequately covered by the Prime Minister's vision in which he said he saw a need to ensure that the disadvantaged and underprivileged are properly protected by government. I raised in this place last week the tragic story of Walgett Aboriginal community in my own electorate. The lack of accountability and the outrageous fashion in which a clique or group of people is able to dominate a local Aboriginal community to its advantage and to the enormous disadvantage of the rest of the community is tragic. At Walgett successive regimes have got away with it and ripped the system off. The message to the people in the community is 'You will get away with it so go ahead and do what you like. You will get off scot-free' . This is an absolute tragedy. It appears that the model is, unfortunately, being adopted. A recent report indicated that Walgett, which is a predominantly Aboriginal community, is the fourth worse community in New South Wales for assault and the sixth worse for robbery. The basically gentle, giving people are losing their young as they follow the very poor models of leadership presented to them. I suggest that the Prime Minister's vision of a tolerant, multicultural society in which the disadvantaged and underprivileged are properly protected by government has become a sad experiment in social Darwinism-not our vision but his vision. It is time that it ended.",146
359,Mr MARTIN,PRIME MINISTER,"Macarthur)(9.46 p.m.)This motion and amendment afford members of this place the opportunity to talk in terms of vision and to talk in terms of economic solutions to the problems facing this country, and they provide us with an opportunity to compare, contrast and look back to recent history to see just who is putting up or who is trying to convince people that they have a solution which can be wrapped up in a glossy package. What the Opposition has come out with in the last week or so is, of course, the classic. It is voluminous and it contains the classic calTot and stick approach. It promises much. It says, on face value, 'Trust us, take us on faith, we·· will deliver'. It also contains a hidden message: if it moves, tax it. Most people have tended to neglect the implications of that in their examinations to date. I think even those on the other side would agree that some of the examinations by people who perhaps should know better have been nothing more than superficial. People have tended not to look closely enough at the implications of the view 'if it moves, tax it'. People have said, for example, that one of the major issues confronting those less advantaged in our community at the moment is the ability to fend for themselves, that we need to put some incentive back. What the Opposition is promising in its Fightback! document is a range of options which it considers will meet those very needs. It has suggested, for example, that family allowances should be doubled. That is probably a reasonable suggestion if we are basing all decisions of all people on the classic economic assumption of rational economic man or woman. What I think the Opposition's package fails to do is look at the type of person to whom it believes it is targeting that increased assistthe ance, and promising it; it is saying that each and every one of those people will act in the same way and that, as a class, there is no distinction amongst those people. When one looks at to whom family allowance is directed, one very clearly sees that it is not directed to the advantaged in the community. It is directed to those people at the lower socio-economic end of the spectrum. I want to mention my own experience in my electorate. I represent an area of Australia where unemployment, and youth unemployment, is higher than the national average, but where at least people show a determination to fight back themselves. The people who would qualify under the Fightback package for family allowance assistance are simply not going to fall into that model of rational economic people. What are they going to spend that increase on? My guess is that it is going to be on food, clothing, shoes, including school shoes, equipment and so on. What does that imply? It implies a 15 per cent tax. How then can one say to these people, 'We are compensating you. We are going to look after you to raise your children, but at the same time we are saying that when you spend that money it is going to cost you an extra 15 per cent'? The other thing that disturbs me greatly is this apparent belief that sale parents in this country again can all fit into the one category. It is interesting to look at some of the statistics regarding those who in fact are sole parents. The majority of sole parents in this country are not the young women who have run out and had some promiscuous affair and suffered consequences whereby they have had children and are dependent upon the state to look after them. That is a nonsense. Mr Simmons-Three per cent.",149
360,Mr MARTIN,PRIME MINISTER,"Three per cent, as the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories says. Sole parents in this country are made up of those people who, for one reason or another, find themselves bringing up families on their own, whether it be through divorce, separation or the death of a spouse. Yet we see this group in the community being derided by an Opposition which believes that package can be sold; an Opposition which is driven by polls and philosophical beliefs that sole parents are an underclass in this country, that sole parents are to be downtrodden at every opportunity. The Opposition believes that they are young, unmarried females who have gone out, played up and are paying the consequences. What absolute nonsense. I find it incredible that the Liberal Party, with a structure consisting of people with so called quality economic thought, can come down and suggest that the inflation rate will be no more than 4.4 per cent as a result of all these promises, 'Trust me; take me on what I say' - all of these promises, for 4.4 per cent. When we look beyond that rhetoric, what do we see? We find that there are at least three items left out of the calculation of inflation rates and additions to the CPI. I comment on one only: cigarettes. As I understand it from reading the document, and honourable members opposite might comment otherwise, it is proposed that by levying cigarettes with a 25 per cent impost a behavioural change will be induced which will see a reduction in the sale of those products, which will therefore result in a decrease in their tribution to the CPI. I say to the Opposition: if it can do that, it is going against all modem sociology; it is going against all modem promotion. It will certainly have the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and other people on this side of the House jumping up and down. They are proposing that we ban all sponsorship of sport by cigarette companies because if the product is promoted children and many others will it take up. It is just not going to happen. It is a nonsense. To say that in the first three years this massive behavioural change in something as fundamental as cigarette smoking will be brought about is an absolute nonsense. To say that change will make a big difference to the CPI measurement again defies logic. I am surprised, to say the least, that the so-called rational economic people on the Opposition benches will live with that particular suggestion. Another interesting issue, which has been highlighted in some of the media coverage at least, is the proposed benefit that will come from substituting a wholesale sales tax with this promised goods and services tax. The classic example that is often quoted concerns the family motor car. It is interesting to see the comparison between a Ford Falcon or a Commodore or one of the smaller vehicles so as to see just what the difference is. On the pure list price for a Falcon, the difference is probably no more than $113. I do not know whether any honourable members opposite have been out looking for a car recently and seen the sorts of deals that are on offer. Yes, we are in a recession and yes, a number of models have been produced and yes, people are not buying as many cars. Let me say that one can get pretty good deals at the moment by walking down the street and seeing the sort of offer motor traders will make to anyone wanting to purchase a car. In the broad cost of something like a Falcon, with a list price in excess of about $26,000, the classic family sedan, let me say that $136, or $113, whatever the estimate is, does not make a great deal of difference. So in the first con- instance something like that does not fit the rational economic model upon which most of the package is based. Another interesting issue is the cost of petrol. I will not go over all the matters that were mentioned in Question Time, as other speakers have done that. I will raise one thing for those on the other side of the House listening tonight; that is, the effect on pensioners of the promises the Opposition has made on the cutting of the petrol price. The Leader of the Opposition has been up to the Gold Coast to talk with pensioners. There must be a different bunch of pensioners on the Gold Coast from the pensioners down in Wollongong, I will give the Opposition the tip now. As luck would have it, the President of the Cammal Combined Pensioners Association came to see me the other day. He said, 'Look, have you got anything you can give me so I can tell my 250 members who will be at the meeting this afternoon about this goods and services tax?'. I said, 'Look, obviously we are putting a great deal of thought into this and we will produce something for you in the fullness of time which I am sure you will use'. He said, 'I don't really need it because I have enough now'. I said, 'Listen, what do you think about this idea of promising petrol reductions?'. He said, 'I don't think much of it at all'. I said, 'That is a bit strange; 19c a litre is promised and here you are, a pensioner; I would have thought that was pretty good'. He said, 'I'll tell you what, mate, over at my pensioners association there are 250 members, and do you know how many have got cars? Ten. Do you know what the other 240 are worried about? They are worried about the 15 per cent increase in the cost of taxi fares, the 15 per cent increase in the cost of bus fares and the 15 per cent increase in the cost of everyday items on which pensioners rely'. All those hot-shots over on the Opposition benches, with their rational economic philosophies driven by polls and with their targeting of people in the community who they believe, from some of their polling, the average Australian thinks that the Opposition can stick the boot into, should come down to Wollongong and tell them all about how they will benefit from a 15 per cent goods and services tax. They should come down and tell those 240 people out of 250 down there at Corrimal just how the fall in petrol pricing which has been promised-and which has been shown as an absolute charade by Ministers in this place during the last two days-will benefit them. As I have said, it is just a nonsense. This afternoon we saw that some of the policy that has emanated from these rational economic thinking Australian politicians has in fact not come from them at all. We have seen great plagiarism at work. Today we have seen the exposure of those on the other side for exactly what they are: rip-off merchants and frauds. Honourable members opposite cannot even think for themselves. They go to New Zealand and adopt the policy there. They say, 'Substitute Australia for New Zealand in the policy, and that looks pretty good to us'. I wish to highlight one other area this evening relating to the views expressed in the media in recent days on the Opposition's proposed GST-the views expressed by the banking community of this country. I have had a bit to do with the banks in Australia in the last 12 months or so and I have got to know them reasonably well. I have to say they are a little afraid. They have estimated that $400m to $450m will not accrue to them because of the GST exemptions applying to banks. Mr Simmons-What was the figure?",150
361,Mr MARTIN,PRIME MINISTER,"Some $400m to $450m. I know that is hard to believe. The banks cannot recoup all the additional work that will imposted on them by imposing the charges that will be necessary or, if they do, do honourable members know what they will do? They will not reduce interest rates; in fact they may even increase the interest rates. The banks are extremely interested in all of this. We on this side of the House believe that the sorts of imposts being proposed by honourable members opposite in this Fightback! document will continue to lead to more and more imposts on average Australians. In the case of the banks, who will be hurt? The average people out there, who want a simple basic banking account free of or at least with very low cost charges, fees and interest will be hurt. What will the Opposition policy do? According to the Bankers Association, this proposal surely will not give them that. In this place in the last three days we have seen a fraudulent document exposed. It contains a number of errors at worse but, more importantly, it shows it as a complete market research driven, poll driven set of initiatives aimed at undermining the very fabric of this society, aimed at creating and instilling into Australia a class consciousness which we thought was a thing of the past. We thought that was a remnant of the 1880s and 1890s when the landed gentry lorded it all over the average worker. We are seeing a return to the bad old days through this package. When we talk about tax cuts, how well we remember what the Opposition did when last in government. What were the tax rates then? Why was nothing done about it at that stage? This Government reformed the tax system; not the Opposition when last in government. It shied away from it at every opportunity. But what is the Opposition's answer now? The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Trust me; I am a battler. Look, I have made it. I believe in incentives'. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the people of the Illawarra will not trust him. They have seen what Nick Greiner has done to that area and they certainly will not trust a national coalition government to look after their interests.",152
362,Mr MILES,PRIME MINISTER,"I rise to support this motion of censure against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) because of the be Government's lack of capacity to come in here and debate the Fightback! document which we have put to the Australian people. I would like to take up a few comments from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). Is it not a great tragedy that the legacy of this Government is that only 10 out of 250 pensioners in his area can own a car? Is that not a terrible legacy that this Government is leaving this country? He gave us the statistics here tonight. This is the type of country that we are now faced with: virtually decimated under this Government's rule over the last eight years. And that information came out of the mouth of one of rates, the members of the Government. It is now seven days and nine hours since this package was launched. In that time there have been about 30 hours of debate in this Parliament and the Government has not laid a glove on the Opposition's policy. There has not been one hole punched through thls 600page policy. It is a comprehensive document and it has got a great deal of detail in it. The Government has come in here for three days and tried its best. It has had the Public Service working overnight and over the weekend trying to find gaps in it, and still a hole has not been found. Here we are at 10 0' clock on Thursday night still debating this issue, and the Government has not been able to find any gaps in it. Today, of course, we had an excellent example. I want to go through a few examples where the Government tried to punch holes in it. Let us just take the first one today. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) claimed plagiarism. That is just not the case. Obviously the Minister did not read the document because, if he had turned to paragraph 2 on page 1 of the technical manual, he would have seen that it says this: It relies heavily on previously published documents and studies of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and on the International Monetary Fund and upon documents supplied to the Liberal and National parties by the governments of Canada and New Zealand. There it is in the document. It is not plagiarism. That was the last major cannon the Government had to fire. That has already been blown out of the water within two or three hours. We go back to our document and we see it on page 1, paragraph 2. Is it not incredible that the Government never even got to that point in reading through the document? Mr Carlton-They did, but they misted us.",152
363,Mr MILES,PRIME MINISTER,"That is even worse. That is the fraud that this Government is perpetrating on the Australian people. It is incredible that after seven days the Government has not been able to lay a glove on this Fightback policy. I come to fuel. The Government claims that we are not going to get a 19c per litre drop in the price of fuel. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) makes an unequivocal commitment: 'In government the coalition will abolish fuel excise. This is an absolutely unshakeable commitment that will, under the current price regime, save private motorists about 19c a litre'. There it is-blown out of the water again, all within a few minutes of the Government trying to punch holes in it. That is an unmistakable commitment by the Leader of the Opposition. Let us have a look at the sort of Australia we are faced with and why the Liberal and National parties have set about providing vision for this country. Australia is a great country, but it is being decimated at the moment by a recession which was brought on by this Government. What is the record of this Labor Government? One million unemployed. I live in a region of Australia that has the second highest level of unemployment. It has now been returning Liberal candidates for over 15 years. It is one of the most highly unionised areas in Australia with a population of mainly working class people who return people from the Liberal Party. The reason for that is that they see no vision in this Government at all. If they saw any vision from the Labor Party, then I am sure that a Labor Party candidate would have been returned. Tonight, of course, we sat and watched the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on the 7.30 Report on television. Mr Hulls-He went well, too.",153
364,Mr MILES,PRIME MINISTER,"The honourable member says that he went well. Well, it certainly did go well! I was up in the dining room tonight and the Liberal and National Party people were all watching television. What were the Labor Party people doing? They were all eating their food and their eyes were glued to the plates on the table. There was not much interest by the Labor Party people in the Treasurer of Australia. They would have been looking if the previous Treasurer had been there, because he had some fight in him. If the Government speakers we heard tonight regard this as a fraud and if they can punch holes in it, why are they not smiling? Why are they not rejoicing? It is a test for us. They have lost in this campaign for the hearts and minds of the Australian people. Therds no doubt that the Australian people are looking for new leadership in this country. We have had a massive deficit and Budget blow-outs by this Government. We have huge overseas debt-a noose around the neck of future generations of this country-which has gone from $33 billion in 1983 to over $177 billion today. What sort of record is that for a Government to leave the Australian people? We have the deepest recession in 60 years. We have a rapid rise in crime, far faster than the population increase. We have excessive interest rates which have driven businesses out the back door. We have ever increasing hospital queues and a burgeoning welfare problem. Is it not incredible that in 1970 about 10 per cent of Australians needed welfare benefits from the Government and that the figure is now almost 20 per cent? Mr Andrew-No? Almost double?",153
365,Mr MILES,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, doubled in eight years. Of course, the Government comes in here and says, 'We do a lot for the unemployed'. By golly, should it not? It created one million them and put them out into the streets where they cannot have any jobs. It calls itself a Labor Party of compassion. It is an absolute joke. Let us look at the people who are supporting the Government. Can anybody tally up the list of peak bodies in Australia who have come out in this last week and said, 'No, the Government is really on track; the Opposition is not going anywhere'? No, we cannot. Mr Andrew-Not even the ALP.",154
366,Mr MILES,PRIME MINISTER,"No, not even the ALP. I just want to alert the Australian people to the remarks of a senior Labor Party official, Mr Neil Batt. I suppose that most people would remember that Mr Neil Batt was a former ALP National President-not just / a State President: he achieved the high honour of being National President. I see tonight that Labor Party is trying to get rid of its National President because it has a $7m debt in New South Wales. That is a great record, too! The Labor Party will want an election soon. Anyway, Mr Neil Batt, also a former Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, said that he endorsed the coalition's private health insurance policy, advocating private health insurance for all but a very few low income earners. That is a former National President of the Australian Labor Party giving wholehearted support for one of the major planks of the Opposition's Fightback policy. Mr Andrew-He says it is healthy.",154
367,Mr MILES,PRIME MINISTER,"He does indeed. He believes that we are on the right track and that the Government has lost its way. Therefore, what we have tonight is a censure motion against the Prime Minister, who is tired, who is lacking in any dynamism for this country and who is showing no leadership capacity in a time of crisis. It is a great tragedy that this Government has not been able to show the Australian people a direction which will lift them out of this recession which it has created. Earlier I was saying that the Government has not been able to punch any holes in this document. I want to refer to a few more attempts. There was an attempt by Mr Stutchof bury to punch holes in regard to superannuation-wrong again. Mr Stutchbury claims that our saving strategy is driven by tax concessions. Not so. He has not read page 101 of the document, which tells him that it is not so. In regard to bracket creep, Mr Davidson and Dr Quiggan are wrong. Contrary to the claims of Dr Quiggan, the Fightback package does not use the proceeds of bracket creep in 1991-92 or 1992-93. So that is wrong again. Every time members of the Government have come into Parliament this week they have tried to shoot down this package, and they have failed. As I said earlier in my speech, it is now almost 7112 days since it was brought down and the Government, with all the resources it has in the Public Service, has not been able to find a chink in the package at all. What we find amongst the Australian the people is a sense of relief in regard to this package. They have a sense of relief because they now feel that there is some incentive to work. There is a reason to work when one has to pay only 30c in the dollar in tax and can take home 70c on the dollar. People see some hope when they see petrol prices falling by 19c a litre. There is some hope for the people who have been waiting in the hospital queues, because now they can see that there is a possibility that those queues will get shorter. Not only that, but people are tired of being put in a straitjacket by this Government. There is an underlying philosophy behind the package. It is a philosophy of diversity, of choice and of freedom; of families being in control of their own lives; of getting governments off their backs; and of giving them opportunity to go about their lives without governments always being in their pockets. Families will have greater control over the money that they earn. Surely it is the right of the worker to take home the money and then decide largely how he is going to spend it. I think it is a right. I think that most Australians believe it. We have given great opportunities in education in this package-$3,000m worth of opportunities. It represents a tremendous boost to education - an area in our community that has been sadly lacking. Schools have not been fmanced adequately. Our TAFE colleges have been absolutely ground into the dirt by this Government; they have been ignored. Yet this country needs training and it needs skills. How can we have a manufacturing base if we do not train our people? In this package we see an extra $75m, over and above what the Government is presently spending, going into TAFE education. We see $200m going into our universities. In total, there will be an extra $3 billion spent on education. We need to pursue excellence and to achieve high standards in this country, instead of slipping behind, as we have in the past. It is only by having the Leader of the Opposition, who has got vision for this country, that we will be able to put hope back into the lives of many young Australians in regard to education. I fully support this motion of censure against the Prime Minister. I call on the House to give the motion its wholehearted support.",154
368,Mr HULLS,PRIME MINISTER,"Kennedy) (10.16 p.m.)Some of the drivel that we have to listen to in this House is really quite amazing. I am sure that the people sitting in the gallery will agree. I guess it beats taking mogadon, but really it surprises me that honourable members opposite actually moved this censure motion. They are outside at the moment, no doubt having a wake in response to the reaction the GST is getting, in my electorate in any event. I am glad that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) is sitting at the table because I am sure that he has been to the Stockman's Hall of Fame in Longreach. It really is a great place. Unfortunately, it would close down, as the Minister would be aware, if a GST were to be introduced. I am sure that the Minister has also heard of or been to the Workers Heritage Centre in Barcaldine, which is a great new tourist attraction in western Queensland. I believe that also would have to close down due to the package associated with the GST, as would the historical wool scour at Blackall, also a fantastic tourist attraction bringing people to western Queensland. Mr Simmons-The tourism industry will love GST!",155
369,Mr HULLS,PRIME MINISTER,"Exactly. Those types of enterprises would indeed close because lack of interest due to the cost of having to get to those areas, as a result of the Opposition's plan to impose a 15 per cent tax on domestic air fares while totally exempting international air fares. Add to this the effect of a GST on hotel bills, meals at hotel restaurants and entertainment and we will see queues at international airports as people head overseas for cheaper holidays. Why would someone pay an extra 15 per cent on absolutely everything when they visit the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach or, indeed, the wet tropics rainforest areas of my electorate, when they can fly overseas tax exempt? Of course, closing these enterprises does mean jobs, jobs, jobsor, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), said, lack of jobs. When I was elected to this place it was a very proud moment for me. I looked forward to representing the largest electorate in Queensland. Indeed, I looked forward to doing what I could to ensure that people in my electorate were not unduly disadvantaged by their isolation. I looked forward to getting involved in serious debate on serious issues and being fair dinlcum about playing a role in the decision making process. After all, as we would all know, it is here in this chamber that I ('"" the real decisions affecting this country are made. It is here where I certainly take my job seriously. It is clear from the Opposition's moving this motion today that others in this chamber do not take their jobs quite as seriously as they should. Representing a large rural electorate, I travel around as extensively as I can, listening and learning and ascertaining the problems of people in my area. As anyone who has been to western Queensland would know, the cost of living in that area is far in excess of the cost of living in the major metropolitan areas. Of course, this is due to a number of factors, including, I might say, some unscrupulous operators who raise their margins and blame excessive freight costs for the price hikes. But distance is a major contributing factor to high prices in rural and remote areas. During the war in the Middle East, there was outrage when petrol prices rose to something like 80c per litre in the cities. In parts of my electorate, the only time petrol gets to 80c a litre is when a petrol price war is on. The fact of life in the bush in north Queensland is that we do pay over the odds. It is really of the gravest concern to me that this Fightback package will further increase prices with devastating consequences for people in my electorate. The consequences of the cornerstone of this package-we cannot forget this-a 15 per cent across the board tax on virtually all goods and services on top of the already infla. ted prices paid in the bush, will be absolutely devastating. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) yesterday and today called the Opposition's package the 'Frightpack' and, believe me, that is exactly how people are feeling about it in my electorate. They are absolutely frightened. The coalition has argued that there are compensations in the package to recompense people who will be adversely affected by higher costs as a result of the 15 per cent GST. It astounds me that nowhere in this package is there a fair dinkum compensation deal for farmers-farmers who are already struggling with the fall in international commodity prices, the recession and vagaries of the weather. For all the talk of the National Party being the party of the farmer, it has done nothing at all to look after the special needs of what were traditionally its constituents. Page 9 of the overview document, apart from confirming that the Opposition will reduce tariffs to negligible levels by the year 2000-something I might say that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Senator O'Chee are not too keen to enunciate when they go around rural Queensland-also says that the Opposition will abolish all fuel excise. Page 58 of the overview document states: Over the longer term, responsibility for road funding will be transferred to the National Road Transport Commission and roads will be funded through user charges as proposed in the current negotiations being undertaken in the context of the Special Premiers' Conference. What in effect has happened here is that the National Party and the National Farmers Federation have been duped into believing that there will be a huge fall in fuel prices. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said, the failure of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to initially factor into his package the effect of fuel prices on new road user charges for road funding must obviously mean that any claim of huge petrol price savings is a furphy. It is not on. That message is slowly getting through to the people in the bush. Those in my electorate are seeing this promise for what it is-a big, fat fraud. In this package the coalition is also attempting to dupe the Australian people into believing that the Federal Government has a high taxing regime in relation to petrol prices. The fact of the matter is-I believe the Opposition knows it-that we as a nation have the second lowest level of taxes on fuel of the 20 International Energy Agency countries. Recent statistics show that the total Federal and State taxes on fuel in Australia account for around 45 per cent of the total petrol price. In the United Kingdom it is 63 per cent; France, 77 per cent; Germany, 66 per cent; and Sweden, 61 per cent. Even the percentage of tax taken by this Government from fuel has declined since 1983-84-from 12.5 per cent to around 7.6 per cent now. When the Opposition was in government, $1 out of every $8 was taken in tax from fuel. Now it is $1 out of every $14. So it is a fraud to suggest that petrol taxes in this country are high because the comparisons show that is not the case. It is also a fraud to suggest that there will be huge savings in the bush as a result of the dropping of the fuel excise because when road user charges are factored in there will be no savings at all in the bush. The Leader of the Opposition's claim that . motorists will save 19c on the price of fuel has taken a new twist overnight. The Prime Minister picked up the fact that the coalition's package does not take into account the effect on costs of new road user charges for road funding. The Opposition, as we know, has publicly committed itself to major reform of the land transport system and yet, as we heard, it did not cost those reforms into its package. The Leader of the Opposition panicked and yesterday issued a media release saying that he will not introduce fuel based road user charges for ordinary motorists. He said that down the track he wants to see a form of road user charge for commercial vehicles, especially heavy transport vehicles. This can only mean that the burden of the road user charges will fall on heavy vehicles, which will further increase transport costs in the north. The Leader of the Opposition singles out fixed registration charges and mass distance charges based on hub meters as possible methods of road charging for heavy vehicles. Clearly, the Leader of the Opposition has not listened to his colleagues in the Queensland National Party on this issue. Fixed charges are one thing but, as we know, mass distance charges are indisputably going to cost transport operators in rural and remote areas more than city transport operators. Of course, as the Prime Minister said today, research has shown that there are still plenty of technical problems with hub meters, including kangaroo interference and cattle interference. Once again, instead of evening up the inequities, the Leader of the Opposition's kneejerk response will further disadvantage people living in rural and remote areas. The petrol price reduction is a nonsense and a fraud. Talking about nonsense and frauds, all honourable members will remember that, during the last sittings, in answer to a question from me, the Treasurer happened to mention a bloke by the name of Bob Katter Jr who was opposed to a goods and services tax. He said that if it applies to food items, to the essentials of life, he was against it, hard and fast. He is a fine, upstanding man. Mr Simmons-Did he win the preselection?",155
370,Mr HULLS,PRIME MINISTER,"He has not got a hope in hell of winning preselection although I have been urging the National Pmty to preselect him because it will ensure the status quo remains in Kennedy for many years to come. I ask honourable members to listen to a news item from radio 4TO in Townsville today, which states: ANNOUNCER: Northern State MP, Bob Katter's now claiming he's seen the light on the Federal Opposition's Tax Package. Mr Katter, who describes himself as a former sceptic of the Tax Package says he wants everyone in the north to now back the proposal. He says the cut of 19 cents in the price of fuel and the abolition of the indexed petrol tax deserve the support of even the harshest critics in north Queensland. Mr Simmons-He has been monstered by Tim.",157
371,Mr HULLS,PRIME MINISTER,"That is right. I have shown that there are no fuel savings for people in the bush. I believe that, with no adequate compensation, people such as Bob Katter Jr, if they are bona fide, should really maintain their rage about this GST and not be bullied by people such as the Leader of the Opposition. Percy Harris, head of the economics department at James Cook University, has said that a GST, even with its proposed compensations, would have an adverse impact on northern Australia. Unfortunately, the National Party has abandoned its traditional base and is ignoring Percy Harris's point that while the abolition of excise duties on petroleum products will mean price reductions much the same everywhere in Australia-and that will be negligible-their replacement by a GST will mean a tax addition that will be higher in remote areas where petrol, and all other prices, are already higher because of transport costs. There will be no saving at all in the bush. This leads us to the fundamental injustice in the coalition's tax package: the less well off in our society pay every cent that they on the necessities of life and hence will taxed at 15 per cent on every cent they spend; that is, every cent they have. Rich people affected. spend only a proportion of the money they earn on the necessities of life, therefore, they retain a larger proportion of their income GST free. I suppose it is no surprise when one looks at the pinstriped New Right push behind the coalition's package that the people who will benefit most under this package those earning $45,OOO-plus per year. It astounds me that in the light of obvious disadvantages for people in rural remote areas the Opposition spokesperson Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), has the audacity to say that Aboriginal communities, majority of which are in rural and remote parts of Australia, will be the big winners as a result of the GST. To support his proposition, the honourable member for Chisholm quotes from a report to the Central Land Council, which states: When the issue of high cost sed in any detail, most people stated food, clothing, household appliances, car parts, petrol were all as high as twice the price of supermarket prices in the nearest major service centre. Many of the major service centres for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are located in high cost areas of Australia, residents are saying that because of their geographic location they are doubly disadvantaged and see themselves as doubly poor. I could not have selected a better quote to illustrate the devastating effect that a 15 per cent GST is going to have on remote Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal people in my electorate in the remote towns of Doomadgee and Mornington Island are going to have their gross disadvantage further increased by 15 per cent. The Opposition argues mischievously that a 15 per cent tax on all the necessities of life will somehow end this disadvantage by reducing transport costs to remote areas, abolishing wholesale sales tax and abolishing fuel excise. As I said earlier, with the burden of a road user charge system falling on transport operators, to be collected, in all likelihood, by a mass distance charge, transport costs in remote Australia will not be reduced signifiget cantly at all. Many Aboriginal families are on be low incomes, which, of course, will mean that they are the ones who will be most adversely The audacity of the statement by the honourable member for Chisholm that Aboriginal people in rural and remote Australia will be the big winners under this package is further illustrated by the Opposition's proposed are $66m cut to ATSIC on top of a $2Om cut to one of the most successful programs in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, the CDEP prothe gram. I invite the honourable member for and Chisholm to visit Normanton to see what a on marvellous CDEP program exists there and to tell the people there exactly what effects such a huge reduction in Aboriginal affairs spendthe ing will have on that community. In conclusion, I note that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) has said that pensioners on the Gold Coast are different from those in his electorate. I agree with him; they are different from mine too. This package cannot be accepted. (Time of living was discusexpired)",157
372,Mr ANDREW,PRIME MINISTER,"I rise in this debate specifically to address my remarks to the amendment that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has moved. But I cannot participate in the debate without first taking issue with the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) over many of the points that he has endeavoured, mischievously, to make. The honourable member for Kennedy came in here and suggested that neither the debate nor the documents being presented to the House by the Opposition, and now in dispute as a result of the Prime Minister's amendment, could be taken seriously. Here we have a SOO-page document that has captured the imagination not merely of the people of Australia but of Australia's cynical press, a document that caught the Government because of the broad-based scope of the changes that were being proposed, a document that has been endorsed by key bodies, inc1udingI remind the honourable member for Kennedy, given his rural base-the National Farmers Federation. He says it is a document that cannot be taken seriously. At the heart of this debate is the question not of whether we charge a 15 per cent GST but of whether the government of Australia chooses to charge people more or less in total tax take. Fundamentally, the Opposition is saying that we will reduce the total tax take. I repeat this for the advantage of the honourable member for Kennedy: we will reduce the total tax that the people of Australia have to find, whether they live in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, or in the electorate of Kennedy. Let us have none of this nonsense about how the electors of Kennedy will pay an additional 15 per cent on every item they purchase. Their total tax take will fall. That is the fundamental inescapable fact and that is the key not only to the success of this document but also to the economic success of our nation. I could understand it if the people in the press gallery, the people in the public galleries or the other people listening to this debate wondered what the Parliament had been about-wondered because the Opposition, desperate to debate this package, gave Jhe Government the opportunity to do so on the first sitting day after it was introduced and we were thwarted. It was only when the press picked up the fact that the Government was not prepared to debate this document that the Government was embarrassed into providing an opportunity for debate, partially yesterday and principally today. The honourable member for Kennedy and honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. If the purpose of this document is to take less tax, then the burden that the people of Australia bear will be reduced. The honourable member for Kennedy has chosen to say, 'But look at the burden you are putting on rural people because of the transport costs they must bear'. The whole focus of this document is to take away from rural people, particularly transport operators, the wholesale sales tax component which is such a burden on truck operators, not only in the purchase of their rigs but also in the purchase of their spare parts and fuel. Now he will say, as he has in the debate, 'But you lot are going to introduce a road user charge'. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we will not need to. I understand that the Government already intends to do so. Mr Bevis-What a top response.",158
373,Mr ANDREW,PRIME MINISTER,"The honourable member should let me finish. Regardless of what the honourable member says about my response, he should bear in mind the fact that wholesale sales taxes generate something like $9.2 billion in income to the Government, which the Opposition is going to do without, and that the present Government only spends something like $1 112 billion, if I were to be generous, in its present road program. What is left? Let us say that we as the Opposition-I am not suggesting that this will be policy - propose only through a road user charge to do what the Government already does. There is already a gross saving, principally for the people in rural Australia who are most affected by transport costs and especially for the people in the largest rural electorate in Queensland. Something like 3c a litre out of all the money that the Government rakes off fuel currently goes to roads. If we could do no better than the Government, we would still provide real savings for the people of rural and regional Australia. That is the object of this document. The people listening to this debate might well wonder what the Parliament is about. They may think it is some sort of nonsense if they were to give any credibility to the remarks made by people opposite. I will tell them what it is about from the Opposition's point of view. It is about a document that is not meant to be popular, but is meant to tum around the direction of Australia by taking one million people thrown out of work by this Labor Government and giving them an opportunity. Where have the winners from almost nine years of the Hawke Government been? The graph in the coalition's document shows us where they have been. There have been winners-we are here to debate the question fairly-under Prime Minister Hawke. We should make no mistake about it. Those winners have been - t the bottom end of the incol,lle spectrum. I am not blind to that; I do not walk away from that, and neither does our document. Those winners have been at the top end of the income spectrum as well. If we take a quick glance at the graph on page 13-I am sure everyone opposite has access to it-we will discover that there have also been losers. Unless one is right down the bottom end depending on social security payments, or right up the top end-a friend of the Prime Minister-we will discover that in nine years of the Hawke Labor Government that person has been a loser, according to this graph. The Fightback proposal is meant to take those losers who are currently despondent and dejected and say, 'What's the point of putting in an extra effort and giving them a chance to perform?'. When they perform Australia has a chance to perform. Frankly, as a member of the alternative government in Australia, I have no choice but to give every Australian an opportunity to perform. What has happened while the Labor Party has been in government? Australia's net external debt as a percentage of our gross domestic product has soared from something like 6 per cent when we were in government to something like 35 per cent now that the Labor Party is in government. What does that mean? That means that our capacity to pay off our debts has collapsed. I am not an economist; I am a farmer. The capacity of my property to pay its way depends entirely on more going out the front gate and less coming in. While the Labor Party has been in government we have lived comfortably by borrowing and borrowing until our debt has gone from something like $30 billion to $160 billion and our capacity to pay it off has collapsed. This package is all about making it possible for Australians to pay off their debts. I am not sure what the figure is and I do not intend to mislead the House. The shadow Minister for housing, the honourable member for Forrest  we need to generate other export income something like the income we currently earn from mining or five times the size of the present wool industry to pay off this disgraceful debt. All this Fightback! document is about is encouraging Australians to generate export income. How? First of all, we encourage them to work. We happen to see the unemployed as human beings who want to work, so we say: here is an opportunity to work. In fact, here is an opportunity for them to work at 80 or 90 per cent pf present salaries simply because it is better for them to have a job than not to have a job at all. Then we want to take those small investors in Australia-this is what this Fightback! document is about-and say to them that we would like them not to be discouraged from being successful by being saddled with this Government's capital gains tax. So if they are small investors we will let them have $3,000 a year capital gains tax free, and if they are large investors, choosing to make responsible provision for their retirement, we will allow them at age 60 to take $300,OOO-that will be indexed-capital gains tax free with which to retire. That is an incentive for people to generate a business of their own. In the process we will make Australia more wealthy. If that was not enough, we take what is the key to this document, and we say: sure, there will be a 15 per cent tax overall, but total tax will fall because we will spend less. I do not give a hoot how many tax channels there are for the Government to call on-if it is the Government's intention to take less, then as a taxpayer I am bound to be better off. We say: sure, there will be a 15 per cent tax but we will take export goods and exempt them from the tax. What does that do? That says to every Australian: I ought to be in the exporting industry and I ought to be in it by encouraging Australians to work for me. Unless we do this, we are in diabolical economic trouble. How else do we service this enormous debt that has been run up by those opposite? Frankly, the people who have a great deal to benefit from this package are my constituents-the farmers of Australia. When the honourable member for Kennedy comes in here and says that his electorate is disadvantaged, I have to say that he is deceiving the House. That is not the experience in my electorate. It is not the experience of the  Fisher) in his electorate. My electors, who right now are not generating any income and, therefore, have the least to gain from the generous falls in income tax, are still advantaged because this package makes their export goods exempt; more than that, it makes their petroleum excise exempt and provides them with real cost cuts in transport, which is so specific a burden on rural Australia. I happen to be a member of the Liberal and National parties optimistically in opposition. I do not intend to have my electors consigned to poverty forever, so when they do start to generate real income there will be even more advantages for them in this package. I want to attract industries into my area. I want industries to employ the 30 per cent of young people unemployed in my area. My Party proposes to do it by taking away that real disincentive to employment which is called payroll tax. So people in regional and rural Australia will not be unhappy about this. If honourable members do not believe that because it is coming from the mouth of someone who is presumably prejudiced about the package, let me cite the Wool Council. It thinks it is a great idea, and its electors are hardly earning big incomes or have much to gain from a change in the present tax regime. The National Farmers Federation thinks it is a great idea because it sees the opportunity it gives for farmers-principally exporters-to get on with the job. Our task has been to shape a package that encourages people to generate export income and to service the enormous debt that has been run up by this Government. Compare that with the absurd amendment that the Prime Minister has asked us to debate. The Prime Minister has had the bare-faced audacity to talk about perpetrating a massive fraud. This is a document that the press and the economists have gone through, and very few flaws have been found. Furthermore, he has the audacity to talk about a document that will wreck economic recovery and shift the burden of taxation from the very rich to middle and low income Australians. The very people this document is designed to benefit are ignored not only in the Prime Minister's amendment but also in the way he has gone about governing Australia. I recognise that there are real opportunities for rural Australia with a fall in fuel price, with the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and with the real incentive to be about exporting, because unless rural and urban Australia is about generating export income we are all damned to an economic future that none of us would want. (TIme expired)",159
374,Mr BEVIS,PRIME MINISTER,"I enter this debate in support of the amendment moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to censure the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) for the fraud which he has perpetrated on the people of Australia by virtue of the tax package document released last Thursday. This is a document which is full of rhetoric, although I notice, from observing the debate that has gone on in the chamber for the last six or seven hours, that most of those opposite appear not to have the full document. They have relied extensively on the Executive Summary. I am not sure whether that is I because they do not possess a copy or whether it is too bulky to bring in. I have not found too many people on the other side who seem all that familiar with the War and Peace edition of some 700 pages. Be that as it may, one of the areas in the War and Peace edition which has been referits red to on a number of occasions on this side of the House, but which has avoided any comment from those opposite, relates to the road user charge. The Opposition has skated around the road user charge time and again over the course of this week. The Opposition has said that it will remove the Federal petrol excise, and it has repeated that on a number of occasions. I do not think it is in dispute that that is their intention. The Opposition has supported a large portion of its incentive for the people of Australia by saying that they will benefit from reduced petrol prices as a result of the removal of that excise. That is a dishonest and fraudulent approach to the public, because those opposite know only too well that in place of that excise they intend to see imposed a road user charge which is currently under investigation by the States and the Commonwealth and which is currently assessed at approximately 16c per litre if it is applied on the basis of fuel consumption. In other words, the 19c per litre they purport would be saved by removal of the excise would be replaced by a 16c road user charge. The total net saving which the Opposition can honestly put to the people of Australia in this package is 3c a litre at the most. Those opposite claim that that is in fact not the case. I refer them to their own document, at page 82. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) referred to the Executive Summary. I will refer to the detailed explanation of what it is the Opposition proposes to do, because it appears unaware of its own policy. On page 82 the document states: The incoming Coalition Government, therefore, will request the newly established National Road Transport Commission to review a national system of road user charges to apply following the implementation of our tax reform package. Mr Andrew-Yes; nothing there about its role.",161
375,Mr BEVIS,PRIME MINISTER,"As the honourable member for Wakefield referred to its role, I point out that the Opposition intends to have very little role in determining it, because the package goes on to say: The Commission would be free to recommend that charges take any form or combinations of forms. It goes on further to say: The overall level of road user charges and road expenditures will be the responsibility of the National Road Transport Commission. That is a direct quote from the Opposition's own document. The Opposition is saying quite clearly in the Executive Summary and in the passages I have just read into Hansard that there will be a road user charge, as is currently planned, that the level of it will be set not by the Opposition but by the Road Transport Commission, and that it can take whatever form it wishes. The Opposition knows full well that the outcome of that review will be the imposition of either a very substantial increase in registration fees, administered by the States, the level of which was referred to in Question Time today, or the introduction of an additional charge on petrol. They are the most likely alternatives. It knows that is the case and, as an organisation and an Opposition, it is dishonestly withholding that information from the public because it suits its purposes. The net effect of that change, which is clearly stated in its document, will be an evaporation of the savings that it claims exist in its petrol excise policy. Tax cuts are probably the other big carrot which the Opposition has dangled before the public of Australia in an effort to get people to accept a quite regressive, divisive and unnecessary GST. The tax cuts which are in the documents provided by the Opposition give the lie to its claims that the tax cuts are designed to assist those on low incomes. Under the Opposition's tax scales, projected as they are to 1994, a person on a moderate income of $2-,OOO per annum, or on the average weekly wage, would receive a reduction in tax of $22.70. A person receiving double that income, $50,000, will receive a benefit not twice that $22 but four times it-$82.60. You double the level of the income but you quadruple the tax benefit. Your tax scale is designed to assist those not on average weekly earnings or on modest incomes but in the $50,OOO-plus bracket. Other examples of that have been mentioned throughout the debate. One is sales tax as it applies to vehicles. The only people who will not gain from the Opposition's proposals to eliminate wholesale sales tax and replace it with a GST on the purchase of vehicles are those people who purchase second-hand cars, because right now there is no tax on second hand cars, and you are going to impose one. It is not the people who purchase a brand-new Commodore or Falcon, because at best they will save less than $150 on a $25,000 vehicle. The people who receive the benefit of your proposal when they purchase a vehicle are those who purchase the Mercedes-Benzes, the BMWs, the Porsches and the Ferraris. Earlier today I referred to the details of that, giving examples of savings amounting to $6,000 and $7,000, and even higher for lUXUry sports cars. That is the sort of saving that you are going to provide to the people who purchase luxury vehicles, and it is consistent with your approach in your tax scales to which I have just referred. As I said in the House the other day, the Sydney Morning Herald got it right last Friday in its banner front-page headline that pegged you correctly- 'Bonanza for the Rich'. That is what your proposals provide-a bonanza for the rich-in your tax scales and in the implementation of a GST in place of the wholesale tax. I want to refer to the question of Austrain, because there has been some comment in the House today about the Opposition's plan for Austrain. As the Prime Minister's amendment points out, it too is a fraud on the people of this country. You will provide to the unemployed the opportunity, as you put it, to obtain a job, but it is a second-class job with second-class salaries at 20 per cent off the going rate of salary-whatever that might be. I will come to that in a minute because you are going to change what that salary will be. The people who think it will be 20 per cent off the award rate need to understand that what underpins your entire strategy is a reshaping of the industrial relations scene with a reduction in real wages. I will come to that in a minute too because that is in your own projections. You propose to say to employers, 'You can put on one of these people and pay them 20 per cent less than whatever might be the prevailing legal rate'. In that system you encourage employers to dismiss employees who are on full rates of pay so that the employers can get the benefit of employing somebody at a 20 per cent cheaper rate. If you do not think that employers will sack workers on full pay so they can put on someone at 20 per cent less, either you know less about the operations of your colleagues in the business sector than I think you do or you are naive in the extreme. Let us look at what you are going to do with the wages system across the board. Your document proposes that there be a freeze in wages to the year 2000. The people of Australia should have no misunderstanding about that. It will be a freeze with no increase in real terms in salaries in this country until the next century. That is your best scenario, because if you go down one of the other tracks in your document, you do not end up freezing wages until the year 2000; you reduce them by 1.8 per cent in real terms. That is your own projection of what you intend to do to the real wages of Australia's work force. Having done that, you expect them to embrace your goods and services tax, which will increase the cost of those items which are fundamental daily purchases for everybody in this country, such as bread, milk, clothes, meat and vegetables, whilst you reduce the price of expensive items. It needs to be understood that when we say 'reduce the price of expensive items', that would apply to those items that had a wholesale sales tax of 30 per cent, because it may be-and often it is the case-that items with a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax rate will be cheaper than they will be with your 15 per cent GST, because your GST is levelled on the retail price, not the wholesale price. You expect the people of Australia to embrace that when the average working person will not get the benefit of your tax scales and will not get the benefit of job security because the employer will be encouraged to sack that worker and put on somebody for 20 per cent less. There are three things we can do with our income: spend it, save it or invest it. That is about the start and finish of what we can do with our wages-when we have them. You intend to reduce the tax on investments and reduce the tax on income from savings, but increase the tax on spending. What do average people-not people on $50,000-plus but those on $25,000 to $30,000; average weekly earnings-do with most of their money? They do not have a lot of discretionary expenditure. Most of their $25,000 per annum goes in buying the roof over their head, their clothes, their food and an occasional bit of entertainment. Right now most of that is virtually tax free, but you are going to tax the food they eat, the clothes they wear and the occasional night out at the theatre or the football. The people who are on average weekly earnings do not have the opportunity to put a lot away in savings, and they certainly do not have the opportunity to put a lot into investments. But they are i not the people who will gain under your proposal. The people who will gain are those who have a lot of discretionary income; the people who, after they have bought the roof over their head, the clothes on their back, their children's clothes and the food for the family, have a bundle of money left over, which they can invest or spend on discretionary activities. They are the people who will benefit from the policies which you enunciated last week. But they are not the majority of Australians. The majority of Australians understand it is not in Australia's interests that that should be so. They are not the majority of the residents of Brisbane, either. I was pleased to note that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane made a statement last week, very clearly saying to the Opposition that he would not have a bar of your work for the dole programs, and that endorsement from the Brisbane City Council reflects the strong view of the people of the Brisbane City Council area. But, having decided to increase the tax on ordinary Australians on average weekly earnings, and having increased the cost of their normal purchases, those opposite would then tum around and reduce government outlays by $10 billion. At a time of unemployment, those opposite intend to reduce government outlays by $10 billion. They would reduce that $10 billion off an already lean Government operation. Those opposite will scoff at that suggestion but they know as well as everybody on this side of the chamber that the Federal Government outlays as a proportion of GDP are now at levels of 25 years ago. They are at levels lower than when those opposite were last in government. That is a fact. Off that extremely low base those opposite say that they would cut another $10 billion. The result of that incision that they pro- Prosser, G. D. pose to make with a chainsaw would be to injure ordinary Australians even further. As the next 18 months unfold, those opposite will rue the day that they decided to pursue this policy. Whilst they may bask in the glory of what they perceive as a good response in the first couple of days, they will come back here next year wondering whether they ever wanted to hear the letters GST. But they will hear them, not so much from inside this chamber as from outside in the electorate where the constituents will be clamouring at their doors and saying, 'We will not wear it. We are going to return a Labor government because at least we know that it has some compassion and care for us'. Motion (by Mr Simmons) agreed to: That the question be now put. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Hawke's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [11.06 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

381,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"in reply-More than just about any other member of the House I would like to be in a position to answer that question. The situation I am most recently advised of by my colleagues in the Senate is that it is more likely that we will be coming back in the week that concludes on Friday, 20 December. The days we come back will largely depend upon progress in the Senate. There is still a possibility that we might be called back in the week that concludes on Friday, 13 December. Again, that will be dependent upon progress in the Senate. The first date is more likely, that is, the week ending 20 December. Question resolved in the affIrmative.

386,Mr GRIFFITHS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"by leaveToday I am announcing the key elements of a new strategy for the development of the Australian natural gas industry. Over the last 20 years the Australian natural gas industry has grown from a relatively small base to become our third major primary energy source, accounting for 17 per cent of our energy consumption. Our domestic gas markets will continue to grow and there are strong prospects for increased exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Indeed, recent projections suggest LNG could become our second largest export earner by early next century, but if the industry is to achieve its potential, the policy settings must be right. Australia's current proven economic gas reserves represent around 45 years supply at the current rate of production, and it is generally recognised that Australia is underexplored, not unprospective, for gas and oil. However, some 70 per cent of the currently proven economic reserves are located offshore north-west Australia, far from the major demand centres in the south-eastern States. Interstate gas pipelines and policy issues relating to transport of gas across State and Territory borders will assume greater importance over the coming years. Against this background I released on 31 July the discussion paper A National Strategy for the Natural Gas Industry to address the issues central to the development of a national gas strategy. The natural gas discussion paper sought views from the gas industry, State and Territory governments and other interested parties on the key elements which should be included in a national strategy. Submissions responding to the discussion paper confirmed that all sectors of Australia's gas industry strongly support the initiative I have taken to develop and implement a national gas strategy. Overwhelmingly, respondents were of the view that a national strategy should provide a policy framework to facilitate optimal development of Australia's gas reserves for domestic and export markets. This is fully consistent with the Government's approach. Let me now address the key elements of the national gas strategy. Industry perceives interstate trade in gas on a free and fair basis as the key to future development of an efficient and competitive industry. Importantly, the industry argues that this would provide an incentive for future exploration and development, including in areas closer to major markets. With the exception of gas supplied via the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, there are currently no significant interstate transactions in natural gas and this situation largely reflects government impediments to interstate gas trade. State and Territory energy Ministers have indicated support for the removal of barriers to interstate trade in natural gas. A report to the Australian and New Zealand Minerals and Energy Council (ANZMEC) last September concluded: ... Governments can play an important role in the development of future pipeline links by ensuring that there is co-ordination of any regulatory ments between States, Territories and the Commonwealth to simplify procedures for developers ... It also said: Contracts freely negotiated between gas producers, transporters and distributors are an appropriate mechanism for dealing with the issue of continuity of gas supply. I am therefore hopeful that the States and Territories will voluntarily open their boundaries to interstate gas flows. The issue is one which I shall pursue with vigour. I intend to seek a formal commitment from the States/ Territories to free and fair interstate trade in natural gas through ANZMEC with, if necessary, endorsement at a subsequent Premiers Conference. If substantial agreement is not achieved on this matter at the next meeting of ANZMEC, scheduled for April 1992, I will bring forward alternative proposals to ensure free and fair interstate trade in gas. Export Approval for LNG Industry groups have indicated that they would view the removal of the LNG export approvals system as a positive step by the Government to complement the development of 'free and fair' interstate trade for natural gas, leading to similar benefits in terms greater exploration and development activity. Major gas users have a somewhat different perspective. They argue that careful assessport. ment of reserves and all markets, including export markets, is necessary to ensure that ture domestic markets are not deprived prematurely. Amendments to the export approvals system will be a further important element in the development of a national gas strategy. To date, the system has been used to monitor contracted volumes and prices on LNG conAct tracts from the only line project, the North West Shelf project. The Government to remove impediments to the expansion of LNG exports, patticularly in view of the major contribution they can make to our balance of payments and community welfare. The Government has therefore decided that LNG exports will henceforth be administered requireas a price approval and monitoring system only, with no approvals required for new or incremental contracted volumes. This will ensure that community interests are safeguarded. A similar system is used for other resource exports, including bauxite and alumina, to ensure a fair and reasonable return to the community for the use of its resources. I am confident that over the long term this will work in the best interests of both domestic consumers and our export industry. The Approach to Regulation Most of the respondents to the discussion paper favour a 'light handed' regulatory regime, consistent with the recommendations of a recent Industry Commission report on Energy Generation and Distribution. However, a number of gas industry participants indicated the need for clarification and/or strengthening of Trade Practices Commission powers and possibly the application of Prices Surveillance Authority powers in relation to gas pricing. Discriminatory pricing, pipeline monopoly abuse and third party access were seen as important issues by consumers. I am firmly of the view that resolution of these issues is necessary for the development of an efficient gas industry; they need to be of considered by the TPC and the PSA in developing an appropriate regulatory regime for the gas industry, as recommended by the IC reFor the time being the Government has decided to adopt 'light handed' regulation of fufuture interstate pipelines, with recourse as of gas necessary to the TPC. My Department has been and will continue to be in close consultation with the TPC on issues relating to gas industry regulation and will report to me on the need for clarification of existing powers under the Trade Practices and the need for any additional 'industry specific' powers to foster the development of is keen the gas industry. Development of the National Pipeline An integrated national pipeline system does not exist, but it is developing. The latest interstate linkage to be announced is that between south-west Queensland and the Moomba system in South Australia. There will be increased interstate gas trade and, at some point in the future, market forces will dictate the development of an integrated national gas pipeline grid. Any future transnational gas pipeline would represent a major undertaking for Australia's natural gas industry, involving a 2,500 kilometre linkup costing more than $4 billion. An appropriate national gas strategy now wi1llay the groundwork, so that should a trans-Australian gas pipeline proceed, there will be no undue impediments. This is especially true of the land access question where a multitude of heritage, parks and Aboriginal issues will need to be addresscd if Australia's pipeline infrastructure is develop and mature in an efficient and competitive manner. That is why land access and other issues such as technical uniformity and third party access to pipelines should be addressed now, not in 15-20 years time. Access to Pipelines The Industry Commission has made a number of recommendations relevant to the question of pipeline access, including that the TPC be required by ministerial direction to oversee the development of new operating guidelines and that public utilities' exemption from the Trade Practices Act be removed. The endeavours of a working party on development of a national competition policy, established after the July 1991 Special Premiers Conference, is also relevant to this issue. There is a strong industry view that open access to pipelines on non-discriminating commercial terms is essential for optimal interstate gas competition. The Government agrces with this view. A number of States have 'common carrier' provisions in legislation dealing with pipelines. However, The Pipeline Authority does not have any such obligation under the Pipeline Authority Act. The Act will therefore be amended as soon as System practicable to allow third party access as the model for future interstate pipelines. The report to ANZMEC on Regulation of Interstate Pipelines concluded that some form of common carriage is needed on interstate pipelines to allow scope for the further development and use of gas resources in Australia. The ANZMEC report highlights the differences which are apparent on the questions of common carriage or open access and that they need to be dealt with in a regulatory way. Resolution of these differences is another issue crucial to creating competition and efficiency. The ANZMEC report's conclusion lays the ground for future work on this aspect. Reform of Public Utilities In relation to public utilities, the Industry Commission report provided a comprehensive basis for reform but acknowledged that progress was likely to be uneven bctween different utilities in the same State and between to States. Differences in practices may lead to distortions in production and investment decisions which might favour gas use in particular States, as opposed to interstate movement. A number of current developments will impact on State utility reform and it is not possible at this stage to be precise as to outcomes. It will be necessary to monitor the results of Government consideration of, and State responses to, the IC report and the competition policy review to assess the impact on development of an efficient market driven gas sector. To date, the role of Federal Government agencies in domestic gas operations has been restricted largely to the Pipeline Authority. TPA needs to be refonned to enable it to operate effectively. The Government has agreed, in principle, to the implementation of a reform package for TPA to achieve a more commercial approach to TPA's operations and facilitate its possible future corporatisation. I shall develop the details of this package in consultation with the Minister for Finance (Mf Willis) over the next few months. Consultative mechanisms The Government supports the gas industry'S call for greater consultation between industry and governments on a range of pipeline issues. The Government has concluded that ANZMEC would be an appropriate forum in which to pursue these and other issues in the first instance-a view shared by the States. I shall report back to my Government colleaguesMr Tim Fischer-And to the Parliament.",170
387,Mr GRIFFITHS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"To the Parliament, of course, on progress on the consultative process later next year, including the need, if necessary, for alternative arrangements for consultation. Consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, there is no doubt we will continue to see an important role for gas in our future energy mix. It is therefore essential to take steps now to free up markets for natural gas and to ensure that there are no barriers to the use of natural gas in energy markets. Any attempt to deny gas the opportunity to compete with other fuels on anything other than an equal footing would unnecessarily restrict the market options available for this fuel-to the possible detriment of the environment and the distortion of gy use patterns. Restrictions on the use of natural gas in specific applications, whether for export, power generation or other domestic markets, would add unnecessary uncertainty to the suit of market opportunities by explorers developers. Expanded markets for natural coupled with removal of barriers to interstate trade, are the key to greater exploration and development for this fuel and to giving it the 28 opportunity to play its role in ecologically sustainable development. The initial basis for achieving the objective of sound policies for the natural gas sector may be summarised as follows: first, obtain the commitment of the States and Territories to the removal of all barriers agreed to free and fair interstate gas trade in order to facilitate exploration and development expedite the granting of permits, licences and easement rights-of-way ensure no constraints on gas finding new commercial markets, and no reserving tranches of gas for 'premium' or other earmarked purposes second, administer the LNG export approvals system as a price approval and monitoring system only, with no approvals required for new or incremental contracted volumes third, adopt a 'light handed' approach to the regulation of pipeline operations, addressing the areas of discriminatory pricing, pipeline monopoly abuse, and third party access through the TPC/PSA Conclusions and finally, implement reform of the Pipeline Authority to give it a more commercially oriented role. The Government's main role will be to facilitate the optimal development of our gas resources. The principal players are the States and Territories-and the invitations are in the mail. I am writing to my State and Territory counterparts today, inviting them to participate in the national gas strategy for the beneserve to fit of all Australians. The strategy I have outlined today by no enermeans represents the complete picture as regards future national gas development, but I believe that sound foundation has been established on which to develop policies that will benefit the natural gas industry and the community as a whole. The consultative propurcess is under way and I look forward to the and continued support of industry and governgas, ments in building on the framework I have just outlined. I present the following paper: The National Gas Strategy-Ministerial Statement, November, 1991. Motion (by Mr Griffiths) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Griffiths)-by leave to: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the National Party speaking for a period not exceeding 16 minutes.",173
388,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (11.45 p.m.)This is the end of a long parliamentary sitting day. I think it started at 5.15 a.m. for me. I was at the airport by 6.15 a.m. for a flight to Melbourne for a radio interview, media work and two speeches. I was back here for Question Time, through to this stage of speaking around midnight. I am too tired to proceed. However, I am conscious that in these tough economic times there are stillMr O'Keefe-What about a bit of stamina. You need to be able to handle the 4 o'clock finishes.",173
389,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Of course, I have the stamina. That is why I am going to proceed. Indeed, I am conscious of the fact that there are thousands of people still at their workplaces tonight trying to eke out a living during this recession we did not have to have. If it is good enough for them to be out there at their workplaces soldiering on, lengthening the hours they spend at work just to survive under the economic regime of this Government, then, indeed, it is good enough for me to proceed with a discussion in respect of the statement by the Minister for Resources (Me Griffiths) entitled The National Gas Strategy. In this context the Minister has cobbled together a strategy which seeks to provide a basis for dealing with gas in the policy arena at the Federal level and in interdiction with the States and with regard to the evolution of a national gas pipeline grid. The coalition supports the broad thrust of the Minister's comments. It seeks to move this policy area along the path that reflects the fundamental direction laid down in coalition policy documents. I welcome that aspect of his ministerial statement. However, there are a couple of very relevant points which I choose to make. In the 18 months that the Minister has been in this folio he still has not been able to nail down the States to a more definitive accommodation with regard to the strategy which he has unveiled tonight. In fact, he had to threaten that if the States did not come to the party-the creation of all that should be created in regard to the inter-state gas trade-he would be taking 'additional steps'. The Minister did not choose to elaborate further on that. He was sending some form of veiled threat to our colleagues in the States. That also points to the fact that in many ways this is a strategy statement with a great lack of detail, with a great hole in it, with regard to nailing down the attitude of the States-18 months after the Minister came to this portfolio. Whilst on the matter of State governments, I want to say that I was very surprised when I visited the AIDEX exhibition here in Canberra yesterday to find a couple of things that are not totally unrelated to this statement. I digress because I want to pay tribute to the Australian Federal Police in the work that they have carried out at AIDEX in very difficult circumstances. They have a right to be proud of that work in maintaining access to and from a legitimate exhibition activity. However, I would say to the demonstrators that I am not quite sure what they were getting greatly excited about because in the context of their concerns, the AIDEX exhibition is entirely unexceptional. I think that some of the biggest displays out there were, in fact, by those non-great war mongerers, those nongreat enemies of the people, namely, the State governments. We had a lot of froth and bubble and unnecessary and gratuitous violence of the worse kind by some very ugly demonstratorsMr Downer-Who were supposed to be demonstrating for peace.",174
390,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"They are hypocrites of the first order, as the honourable member for Mayo has pointed out. Again, I reiterate my praise and salute the work of the Federal Police in the context of AIDEX. Having said that, perhaps I should come back fairly and squarely to the statement before the House. I draw the Minister's attention to the annual report of the Pipeline Authority for 1990-91. port- This report says, amongst other things: Against this background the Authority referred to the Minister for guidance and was advised that the refonn package agreed to by the Government in 1989 to streamline the operations of the Authority was on hold until the outcome of the sale process was known; and the Authority should continue to operate on a 'business as usual basis' providing consultancy or other new work! business opportunities did not involve major construction, borrowing arrangements or commitments beyond 30 June 1991. We in the Parliament have settled that matter, whilst ever the Government will not go out and have fair dinkum negotiations with AGL. We indicated the outcome of that many months ago. The streamlining and reform of the Pipeline Authority in more fundamental terms should have proceeded by now. The Minister spoke of technical uniformity being encouraged under his strategy. That is sensible. There must be technical uniformity. This country does not want to repeat the tragedy of broken gauges in the railways as occurs in my electorate at Albury-Wodonga, at the Queensland border and at the South Australian border. Essentially we have three major railway gauges in Australia. There is the Irish gauge, based in Victoria in the main; there is the New South Wales standard gauge, which has gradually spread to link all capital cities; and there is the narrow gauge in Queensland and sections of South Australia; and then there is the narrower gauge again in Western Australia and other parts. But it is not only the question of technical uniformity, it is also the question of pipe capacity volume which is very significant. It is a related question, and some would argue that it comes within the definition of technical uniformity. I do not think it does. I think adequate capacity is a separate issue from technical uniformity, and it should be addressed fairly and squarely because the real tragedy would be that if any of the key links, including the one that the Minister referred which is about to be built between Queensland and South Australia, were to be of an inadequate diameter, they would restrict progress towards a national grid system. There are experts in this the capacity of that pipe has to be counterbalanced against the commercial viability of the pipe and the like. They are restricting factors. But we also have to have some foresight in relation to settling these issues. I expect and hope that the Minister will provide a catalyst to see that the right thing is done with regard to these matters at the early stage of planning. Nevertheless, I highlight to the House the absolute need to ensure that those volume calculations on pipeline capacity are correct, because already we have in place a very long pipeline from Alice Springs to Darwin, which many would say has a too narrow diameterwhich is a tragedy-which places a restriction on volume. Although the reasons for building it at that size were proper in the eyes of the Northern Territory Government, at some future date that pipe may have to be expanded at great cost. The coalition generally welcomes the principles outlined in this document, but rhetoric has not always matched the track record. We had to remind the Government on the RRT legislation that it had overlooked fully the gas circumstance. At the end of the day, the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), in introducing the Bill in one of his last speeches as Treasurer, produced a $60m top-up for Victoria in respect of a gas equation of the RRT legislation for Bass Strait. We also believe that the Minister bungled the attempt-not so much this Minister as the Government as a whole-to sell the MoombaSydney gas pipeline. That has been of great interest to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) over the years both in the New South Wales State Parliament and in the Federal Parliament",174
391,Mr GRIFFITHS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,We bungled it? You stopped us.,175
392,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"What was stopped to, were free, fair and legitimate negotiations with AGL to reach a fair dinkum contract rather than tearing up a contract using sovereign butchery, sovereign thuggery, by dint of the Government's numbers to ram through field, and no doubt those changes. Mr Fife-They wanted to welsh on a contract.",175
393,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Exactly. It was a contract which had operated for many years. We exposed that. We had the courage to make a stand, which I know that you in your heart, Mr Deputy Speaker, would have been proud of-although I know you could not speak in that regard from your position on the Government back bench. That Pipeline Authority position still remains our absolute commitment, reaffirmed in the Fightback! document, to proceed with that privatisation and the legitimate privatisation of a large number of Government organisations. We will do it properly, with none of this 49 per cent which the Government tinkers with. It keeps tinkering on the TItanic, and we keep coming up with the full blueprint, the full plans necessary for this country in turning the economyaround. I understand the Pipeline Authority still has over 100 staff and that it continues to be in limbo by degrees. This is regrettable, because time marches on. There is no capacity today for largess in government departments, government authorities or government instrumentalities. When we go through the accounts in detail of a number of these authorities, it is very interesting to see what the taxpayers' money is spent on with regard to their operations. In respect of my shadow portfolio of energy and resources, I serve notice that, as shadow Minister, I will be maintaining 'It great deal of vigilance in these recessionary times to see that all the organisations coming under the umbrella of this portfolio draw in their belts on a raft of things in the way that all honourable members have, by degrees, endeavoured to do with regard to their own activities as members of parliament and their entitlement. These are very tough times, whether in the gas industry or in the economy at large. The coalition welcomes the Minister's statement on a national gas strategy and notes that it still relies heavily on reaching an accommodation with the States. That is a big question mark. It is still up in the air with regard to free and fair interstate trade in gas. Of course, there must be free and fair interstate trade in gas. Let us hope that the States will see the light and respond further in a positive way. They have had a lot of time to do that. They had been showing some progress by virtue of the Special Premiers Conference apparatus, up till the one which was scheduled for Perth but fell apart and finally took place in Adelaide with the Premiers but no Prime Minister. Finally, I focus on the removal of export approval for LNG. The Minister proposes to amend that. The Government has decided that LNG exports will henceforth be administered as a price approval and monitoring system only, with no approvals required for new or incremental contracted volumes. This seems to be a very cautious approach by the Minister when governments around the world are getting out of the business of price setting. It seems to fall short of what I would have expected of a young junior Minister seeking to carve his robust and radical niche in the history books of time before the collapse of this Government. I thought he would have been out there taking that extra step; but he stopped short of taking it. Nevertheless, he has driven along an agenda to ensure he got down his ministerial statement before the summer recess. We welcome the thrust of that statement. We say there is a great deal more work to be done in relation to national gas, and we note with particular interest the comment of uniforniity which the Minister referred to and also his comment that gas should be equally placed with other energy with regard to its treatment-presumably referring to tax and other matters. We are about going that extra step, because we are going to totally remove all Federal fuel excise on petrol and diesel fuel as part of the Fightback package, which will ensure the change of government at the next Federal election. Gas will have a very big role to play to the year 2000 and beyond across Australia. It is extremely important that we get it right as we move steadily but surely towards the national grid. In closing, I remind the House that, in that regard, one of the key issues must be a proper approach to the volume, the capacity and the diameter of pipes on key link stages, to ensure that we will have adequate capacity to afford putting in place a viable grid as commercial production and capacity justify it.

395,Mrs KELLY,SENATE TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"Canberra-Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) (12.03 a.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 amends seven Acts administered in the ASETT portfolio. The amendments are mainly to make the administration of various Government programs more efficient and cost effecti ve. The addition of new section 20A to the Australian Capital Territory (planning and Land Management) Act 1988 will introduce a ministerial power of direction in relation to the draft Territory plan where the territory planning authority continues to object to any aspect of the draft plan prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority. The other amendments will allow regulations to be made enabling the NCPA to charge fees for planning and related approvals. This power will be limited to the recovery of costs reasonably associated with planning approvals and they must not be set at such levels that they would amount to taxation. The following amendments are made to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990: international anti-doping agreements will be recognised in the Act, allowing greater cooperation between the Commonwealth and other countries regarding the listing of defaulting competitors; the reporting requirements as regards negative test results are widened so as to accommodate sports organisations that have contracted with the Agency that require confirmation of a negative test result prior to recognising records and awarding medals. Competitors will also be advised of who will be notified if they return a negative test result or if they refuse to provide a sample; the Agency will be provided with the standard tax exemptions granted to Commonwealth statutory authorities; the Agency will be given the power to delegate a number of its powers under the Act to any of its employees. The Agency comprises a relatively small number of specialist staff, and such a power of delegation is considered appropriate to ensure the efficiency of the Agency's functions. The amendments to the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 will facilitate the giving of evidence by expert analysts and overcome any gaps in evidence in judicial proceedings. Addition of botanic gardens under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 will enable the Norfolk Island botanical garden and the Australian national botanical garden, as well as any other park or reserve created in the future, to be managed as a botanic garden through a plan of management under the Act. Three international agreements are also added to the schedule in respect of which the Governor General will be empowered to make regulations. The amendment to the Norfolk Island Act 1979 will pennit the Acting Administrator and Deputy Administrator to exercise the powers of the Administrator when the Administrator is absent from duty, for example, on recreation leave, without actually being physically absent from the Territory. Under the amendment to the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986, the'National Cultural Heritage Committee will be given the power to approve a recommendation or report under section 10 or lOA without the need to convene a meeting. This will enable those members of the Committee who are eligible to consider the issue to accept a recommendation or report by signing a document detailing the terms of their acceptance. This will remove any question concerning the legality of a procedure that has already on several occasions been successfully adopted by the Committee, while at the same time ensuring that it can only be adopted if all members agree to sign the document in question. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1991 Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",177
396,Mr CREAN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus Bill containing minor administrative amendments to the following legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio: the Meat Inspection Act 1983; the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978; the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967; and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. Meat Inspection Act 1983 The amendments to this Act provide for the definition of 'authorised officer' to limit the number of such officers to only those people appointed by the Secretary. Currently the definition of authorised officer extends to all officers within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in addition to those appointed by the Secretary. Since the formation of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in 1987, such a wide definition has not been altogether necessary. The amended definition will be the same as that which exists for an authorised officer in the Export Control Act 1982. The Secretary will continue to have the power to appoint people outside the Department to be authorithe sed officers. Secondly, the Bill makes the Act consistent with current criminal law policy of omitting references to monetary penalties where terms of imprisonment are provided for. The proviof sions of section 4B of the Crimes Act 1914 will apply. For each 12 months of imprisonDepartment ment provided for in the Meat Inspection Act 1983 as the maximum penalty, a court may impose a monetary penalty of up to $6,000 instead of or in addition to the imprisonment penalty for individuals, or five times that amount for corporations. This obviates the need to amend the Inspection Act 1983 when policy as to the relativity between imprisonment penalties and monetary penalties changes. Where an offence carries a monetary penalty only, the maximum penalty is increased by the Bill to more closeWhen ly correlate with the original real value of maximum penalty for the offence. The Bill also amends the regulation making the States. power to beyond doubt the power to make regulations for the remission of fees paid. The Bill also incorporates into the Meat Inspection Act 1983 a new offence of authoriable sed officers receiving goods or services from the owner of a prescribed premises without the written approval of the Secretary. offence was introduced into the Export ConLands) trol Act 1982 in 1991. Section 35 of the Meat Inspection Act 1983 currently prohibits the owner of a prescribed premises from providing goods or services an authorised officer. This amendment complements that provision by prohibiting the receipt of goods or services by authorised officers. Domestic meat inspection legislation must demonstrate the importance of integrity of inspection staff. National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Ad 1978 The amendments to this Act are designed to improve the efficiency of its administration in three respects. The first amendment transfers responsibility for determining the form of audited financial statements required under Act, from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. This will simplify administration of assistance programs under this Act, as all requirements of the Act would become the responsibility of one Minister. It will also bring administration programs under this Act into line with similar assistance programs administered by the of Primary Industries and Energy. The second amendment permits acquittal of program expenditures by the senior executive officer of the State organisation or approved body receiving Commonwealth funds. Currently acquittal can only be made by the State Auditors-General. This will expedite acquittal of program expenditures and recognises the Meat independence of State Auditors-General. The third amendment makes the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory eligible to receive assistance under the Act. the Act was drafted the Territories were the administered by the Commonwealth, but now they are self-governing. It is important they again have the same eligibility for funding as Petroleum (Submel'ged Lands) Act 1967 The amendment extends section 8H of the Petroleum submerged Lands Act 1967 to endelegation of routine joint authority powers under subsidiary Acts like the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) This Act 1967 and the Petroleum (Submerged (Royalty) Act 1967. It corrects a drafting oversight in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1991 and maximises the potential gains resulting from the streamlining of administration under the Petroleum to (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. Wheat Marketing Act 1989 This amendment will extend by two months, to 1 September, the date by which the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, is required to submit its Jorporate plan to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for approval. This change will more closely align the development of this plan with the AWB's financial year, which commences on 1 October. The amendments will also provide for the preparation of annual operational plans, based on the corporate plan, by 1 October, again better reflecting the AWB's budgetary cycle. The sections concerning ministerial approval of the AWB's annual operational plans will be amended to remove the requirement for ministerial approval of the AWB's annual operational plan in line with the recommendations of the Davis review of Commonwealth Primary Industry Statutory Marketing Authorities. That review considered that ministerial approval of annual operating plans conflicted with the principle of managerial autonomy, since operational plans only detail how objectives and strategies already approved in the corporate plan will be achieved. This aspect of the Davis review has already been implemented for the wool industry, in sections 35 and 36 of the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991. The amendment, therefore, will result in a requirement for the AWB's annual operational plan to be submitted to the Minister for information only before the commencement of the AWB 's financial year. None of the proposed amendments affect government expenditure and they will not have any staffing implications for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",178
397,Mr CREAN,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill provides for amendments to the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 to allow the Commonwealth to recover costs incurred in collecting and disbursing outstanding Commonwealth hen levies and for those costs incurred to be reimbursed from the Poultry Industry Trust Fund. The amendments are part of a strategy developed in consultation with industry to wind up the Poultry Industry Trust Fund as soon as possible and then allow the repeal of the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965. The Commonwealth Hen Levy was imposed by legislation for the assistance of the egg industry through the equalisation of returns between domestic and export sales. The levy was paid into the Poultry Industry Trust Fund and distributed to the States and Territories for the assistance of the industry. The levy' ceased in 1987 but the legislation continues to operate to enable the recovery of outstanding debts, the payment of debts recovered into the Fund and to permit disbursement of moneys in the Fund. When any outstanding levies have been recovered, the money is to be used for the benefit of the Australian egg industry. At the end of June this year the Trust Fund had a balance of almost $670,000 and outstanding debts owed by 11 egg producers, all in New South Wales, amounted to $1.7m. The majority of the debts are the subject of legal actions for recovery in New South Wales courts and, while some amounts may be irrecoverable, all possible avenues are being pursued to collect the debts. The Primary Industries (Recovery of Levy Collection Expenses) Act 1988 allows the Commonwealth to recover from rural industries the cost of collecting and disbursing funds raised through levies and charges on rural production and exports. However, the Primary Industries (Recovery of Levy Collection Expenses) Act 1988 did not amend the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 to allow such recovery of expenses for hen levy collection. Previously the Commonwealth had entered into agency agreements with the States for the collection of levies and the Poultry Assistance Act 1965 allowed the Minister to make a determination for the States to be reimbursed for costs incurred from the Poultry Industry Trust Fund. Accordingly, there was no provision in the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 for the Commonwealth to obtain reimbursement of collection expenses. The New South Wales Egg Corporation, the statutory egg marketing authority in that State, signed the agency agreement with the Commonwealth. Following deregulation in the New South Wales egg industry and the termination of the Egg Corporation in October 1990, the Commonwealth assumed the responsibility of collecting all outstanding hen levies. While litigation proceedings are continuing for the collection of these outstanding levies, the costs of these proceedings and related expenses are incurred by the Commonwealth. It is necessary then to amend the Poultry Industry Assistance Act to ensure that the egg industry meets the same obligations as other Australian agricultural industries by paying for any costs associated with the collection and disbursement of outstanding hen levies from the Poultry Industry Trust Fund. It is expected that the major costs that may have to be met by the Commonwealth in collecting hen levies will be court costs in the event of litigation proceedings being unsuccessful, any associated legal costs incurred by the Australian Government Solicitor's office and any charges made by that office for its services. These amendments will not prevent moneys from the Fund being used for the existing legislative purposes of providing assistance to the industry or providing funds for research and development projects, subject to sufficient amounts being retained to cover likely levy collection costs. Following consultation with industry, my predecessor as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy determined that available Trust Fund moneys be transferred to a special sub account of the Egg Industry Research and Development Fund so they can be used for the benefit of the egg industry as a whole. I fully endorse that decision. The sub account has been established and an initial $500,000 was transferred to it in July this year. The moneys in the sub account are to be managed conservatively by the Egg Industry Research and Development Council for specific industry purposes of producer training and economic and market research. Any levies recovered will be paid into the Trust Fund and transferred to the Egg Industry Research and Development Fund, after ensuring that sufficient funds remain in the Poultry Industry Trust Fund to meet Commonwealth collection costs. An accurate estimation of the likely costs is difficult but following consultation with the Australian Government Solicitor's office and industry it is judged that the current balance of $180,000 will be adequate. It is expected that litigation proceedings will be reviewed periodically to gauge likelihood of future levy recovery. Decisions taken regarding future legal action will follow these reviews. I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. NA BILL 1991 Bill receive from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",180
398,Mr CREAN,PRIMARY INDUSTRY COUNCILS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Primary Industry Councils Bill is to provide for the establishment of industry councils for certain primary industries. There are already industry councils for the wool, meat, horticulture and pig industries. These councils have made significant contributions to policy development in their respective industries and the Government has foreshadowed the establishment of a statutory policy council for the grains industry. This Bill will establish such a council and provide a legislative framework under which industry councils can be established for particular primary industries in the future. A similar Bill was passed by the House of Representatives but ,withdrawn from the Senate in the autumn 1991 sittings of Parliament. The Bill which I am introducing today differs from the earlier Bill in that individual industry councils and their membership will only be established by the inclusion of specific provisions in this legislation. The usual processes for amending an Act will need to be undertaken to amend the schedule to establish a new council and specify its membership. The concerns expressed by the Senate in relation to legislation by regulation have, therefore, been addressed in the revised approach. In the first instance, only a Grains Industry Council will be established under the Bill. As has been the case for the existing industry policy councils, the object of the industry councils established under this legislation will be to facilitate the development of sound government policies for these industries by bringing together representatives of different sectors of an industry and giving them an active role in the policy formulation process. Functions and Powers The functions and powers of the councils are set out in part 2 of the Bill. They are the same as those which the Parliament has agreed in passing legislation to establish the wool industry council in the autumn 1991 sittings. Under the functions and powers provided, the industry councils will be given a more central role in reviewing and coordinating industry policy than is the case for the existing policy councils other than wool. This is reflected, for example, in the first function listed in the Bill, under which an industry council is required to review and report on the strategic direction of the industry. In carrying out this function, a council will need to have regard to the activities and general strategies of other relevant statutory .authorities in the industry. The coordinating role of the industry councils will also be strengthened in a number of other ways. The councils will be able to convene industry review conferences. In this context, I would note that the grains industry has recently undertaken a major strategic review in the form of the Grains 2000 Conference initiated by the Grains Council of Australia. The Bill also provides for councils to be required by regulation to convene conferences at such intervals as may be necessary. Provision is made for councils to convene regular meetings of the chairpersons of the other relevant statutory bodies in the industry and the regulations may require that. such meetings be held. The purpose of these meetings is to enable the chairpersons of each of the industry's statutory authorities to be well informed of the activities of their counterpart organisations and thus ensure the coordinated development of industry strategy. Constitution and meetings of the Council Part 3 of the Bill provides for such matters as the composition of industry councils, appointments to the councils and meetings of the councils. Membership of industry councils will be broadly based to provide major stakeholders in an industry with an opportunity for input to the development of policies affecting that industry. My Depa-ment and I have consulted closely with the 'Grains Council of Australia and widely with other peak grain industry bodies on the establishment of the grains industry council. This council will encompass wheat, coarse grains, oilseeds and grain legumes. Its membership will enable producers of each of those categories of grains to be represented through the Grains Council of Australia. Processors and users of grain such as flour millers, malt, producers and grocery and stock feed manufacturers as well as marketers, including statutory bodies and private traders, and bulk handling authorities will also be represented. The extensive involvement of the States in grain marketing, storage, handling and transport warrants inclusion of a nominee of the Australian Agricultural Council. The interests of employees in the policies affecting all sectors of the grains industry will be reflected through a member nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In terms of the establishment of other councils under this legislation in the future, I can assure honourable members that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will consult with representatives of the relevant industries before bringing forward the necessary amendments. The Minister would expect meetings of an industry council to be held on a regular basis. Members may require a meeting to be called if a minimum number of members so requests. For the grains industry council, a minimum of nine members will be required to request that a meeting be held. Other Provisions Part 4 of the Bill provides councils with the power to establish committees and working groups. This is intended to ensure that councils can set up functional committees or subject specific working groups if required. Provision is available under this Bill for working groups to actively involve a broad range of people including council members. The provisions of part 5 of the Bill outline the terms and conditions of office, remuneration and allowances and other administrative arrangements applying to members of a council. The provisions of part 6 include arrangements for staffmg of councils and requirements for an annual report to be prepared and submitted to Parliament. It is anticipated that the operating costs of the grains industry council, which will be met by the Government, will be of the order of $100,000 for the remainder of 1991-92 and about $350,000 in a full year. The operations of the council, including funding, will be reviewed during 1993. Funding arrangements for any other councils established under this Act will be considered prior to their establishment or reconstitution under this Act. Conclusion The Government believes that industry councils established under this Act will provide a focal point for the industries they are set up to serve as well as providing an important link between industry and the Government in the development of national policies relevant to those industries. I am well aware that the grains industry council is being established at a particularly critical time when the grains industry is experiencing enormous pressures not of its own making. However, over the longer term, the industry's future will rest upon the capacity of its producers, marketers, processors and researchers to develop and implement strategies for adapting to a rapidly changing production and marketing environment. Enhancing our industries' international competitiveness and productive capacity with minimal government regulation and intervention will be fundamental to securing their future. The Government will continue to further develop an appropriate policy environment in which individual industries can pursue this objective. This Bill provides a mechanism through which the grains industry as a whole can participate in advising the Government on appropriate policy objectives and strategies for the industry. I commend the Bill to honourable members and I now present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Fife) adjourned. NA DEVELOPMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Griffiths, and read a first time. Second Reading Mr GRIFF1THS (Maribyrnong-Minister Funding for Resources) (12.30 a.m.)-I move: That this Bill be now read a second time. This legislation fulfils an undertaking made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the March statement to introduce forest conservation and development legislation to better protect Australia's native forests and concurrently facilitate much needed value adding investment and jobs in Australia's forest industries. The legislation will do so in a transparent and predictable way. In short, this policy initiative is a major reform. This Government is deeply committed to reforms that will produce secure, long term jobs for the people of Australia. It is always possible for governments to grasp short term expedients in the quest for creating jobs. But these almost always mean the jettisoning of longer term and often critical objectives, such as protecting Australia's environmental and cultural heritage. This is not the way for this Government-it never has been and never will be. This legislation is the result of long, careful and hard analysis; of careful consideration of the views of the ACTU and timber unions, environmental and industry groups; and of much con,sultation with the States and Territories including at the Special Premiers Conference in July 1991. It has been constructed with our sights finnly set on the imperative of ecologically sustainable development-the proposition that we can and must reconcile legitimate concerns to preserve the values of our forests for current and future generations of Australians, and the equally legitimate concerns to use those same resources to advance other community objectives through the development of value adding forest industries. Industry must have-and I believe to a large degree does have-the same objective of conserving the value of our forests for future uses, for without such an active commitment there can be no long term future for the industry itself. This constructive balance of what are always competing, if not conflicting, resource usages is embodied in the legislation now being introduced into the Parliament. I will now outline the features of the legislation for honourable members. Objectives of the Bill The principal concurrent objectives of this Bill are to provide security and certainty to both the forestry industry and to the Australian community: To provide security and certainty to industry so it can make significant long term investments with confidence that governments of the future will not prevent or obstruct that investment's productive outcome. To provide security and certainty to the Australian community that all of its interests, whether they be for values that are vironmental, cultural, heritage, social or economic-both for the current and future generations-are adequately and comprehensively safeguarded. This Bill does not attempt to confer any new powers on the Commonwealth or on any Minister; rather, it establishes a method of integrating a broad range of processes under existing Commonwealth laws and regulations. At the same time it also provides a mechanism to integrate similar State and Territory government processes with the Commonwealth's, in a constructive, time-saving and cooperative manner. I will now outline the conditions relating to the granting of resource security. Enterprise First of all, the proponent must satisfy the Commonwealth that it has a legal standing as an enterprise in the meaning of the terms of this Bill; that is, the enterprise is a duly constituted company, partnership or joint venture. We have recognised in the legislation that, in particular with large scale investments of the kind envisaged here, it often may not be possible or practicable for a single company to undertake a project. But this should not be interpreted to mean that a mere collection of sawmills could club together for the purposes of qualifying for resource security. Because the Government desires to promote valueadding industries, its approach to legislative resource security is based on a project rather than a region. Dominant Purpose The wood processing project's dominant purpose must be to make a new investment of at least $l00m to produce goods for export and/or import replacement. This legislation is not designed to protect the industrial status quo by providing security to any use of wood for any purpose from any region. It is designed to shift the industry towards export oriented, value adding activities and to facilitate large projects of that kind. World scale pulp mills are, of course, the paradigm case and we want to see such developments at the earliest opportunity. But again enthe Government has recognised and acknowledged in this legislation the commercial reality that investments of this size may also be made up of a sct of integrated activities. This does not mean we would countenance a mere collection of sawmills as being eligible for resource security; we will only consider a proposal if it emanates from a company or a group of companies whose activities are genuinely integrated. For example, such a proposal might involve, but not be limited to, a large scale sawmill, a veneer plant, a flitch mill, a woodchip plant to process the residues, and the establishment of plantations as a further resource base. We have also recognised that significant large scale investments of the type we are endeavouring to encourage can and do arise when companies expand or extend their existing facilities perhaps through mouernising or upgrading. The legislation enables this type of expansion to be eligible for resource security, provided it involves a substantial increase in the amount or the value of goods produced. One Hundred Million Dollar Threshold Many detractors of the Bill criticise it for the requirement that a project must cross the $l00m threshold before we will consider its eligibility. Let me remind honourable members that it was industry that initially sought resource security for major investments-and investments which at the time were referred to as being in the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars category. We are determined to focus on investments of this size in the context of this legislation, because what the Government is offering to industry is not being done lightly. We are saying to industry, 'We the Government of Australia, after conducting a comprehensive integrated assessment, and satisfying ourselves that certain obligations have been entered into by the enterprise and the relevant State Government, tie ourselves by legislation not to use our statutory powers, except in exceptional circumstances'. This, for any government, is an enormously important decision. We are willing to take it to facilitate investments of high value in the national interest. We have not, in producing this legislation, ignored the bulk of the forest products industry. I will return to this theme a little later, however, after I have completed the description of the Bill. Commercial Plantations This Bill gives force to the Government's clear and unambiguous policy of excluding from eligibility for resource security any project whose dominant purpose is the export of logs or woodchips from native forests. As a further concrete way of underpinning this objective, the Commonwealth considers it necessary for industry proponents seeking resource security, as well as the governments involved, to give appropriate consideration to the establishment, maintenance and use of forestry plantations. As a further boost to this policy, we have recognised the need to encourage investment in commercial plantations. Such investmentfor export of woodchips, or to provide resource for downstream processing, or bothwill be eligible for consideration for resource security under this legislation. Where the proposal is to export woodchips we would need to be satisfied they would be surplus to domestic requirements-that is, surplus to the needs of downstream processing operations. Consideration of resource security for this proposal would not include any woodchip from native hardwood forests. And, of course, the other criteria-including the $100m threshold-must be met. It is expected that together with the Government's other policy initiatives on plantations, this legislation will encourage a significant increase in the area of commercial plantations in Australia. Up-front assessment. The real antecedents of this legislation can be found in industry's feelings of uncertainty, engendered by fear of the Commonwealth using its powers to remove significant tracts of forest from productive investments. We do not accept the validity of that perception, but we do accept that it exists and influences investment decisions. The hugely important point for industry that the Government acknowledges in this legislation is that once a company has taken a major investment decision, following government giving the green light, it should not be for the Government to intervene later to thwart the product of that investment in anything other than the most exceptional circumstances. The only way any government can have the confidence to renounce using its undoubted and legitimate powers is if it has first conducted a thorough and comprehensive integrated assessment of the project; and in conducting such an assessment, to have assured itself that all matters that fall within its responsibility have been addressed and, where appropriate and necessary, decisions considered and responsibly mpde. This legislation carefully spells out the nature of that assessment. It after all is the basis on which the Government's guarantee not to use its powers stands or falls. In this regard the Bill: - says the assessment will cover all of the values likely to be affected: environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic; - says that the Australian Heritage Commission must have a reasonable opportunity to consider and comment on matters that are within its ambit; and says that all the processes under the Commonwealth's Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act have to be complied with. The integrated assessment process will also include the application of the World Heritage Convention and the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, together with provisions under the Aboriginal heritage legislation. This legislation does not water down the Government's environmental policies or its legislation. To the contrary; what it does do is ensure that environmental issues are taken into account when and as they should be: upfront, comprehensively, decisively, once and for all for the life of the project. It is wrong to suggest, as some critics have, that applying the assessment provisions of the resource security legislation up-front is tantamount to the Government abrogating its responsibility to protect the environment. On the other side, many industry and some State critics have suggested that such a thorough and comprehensive assessment will be too time consuming and will duplicate State activities. Let me make this very clear: we will conduct assessments as fast as possible consistent with the thoroughness needed to provide the very certainty that industry and unions want. There will be no undue duplication either of efforts or assessments between the Commonwealth and the States. It is the Government's intention-indeed it will be the legal requirement under clause 12(4) of the Bill-that the Commonwealth assessment process must as far as practicable be integrated and coordinated with that of the relevant State. As an example of cooperative federalism I am sure this legislation will be outstanding. The Commonwealth accepts that, provided all its assessment requirements are met before final approval is given and legislative resource security is provided, the assessment process can take place in two steps if a State so wishes. A State may wish to propose that a quantity of resource is required from a particular area of forest for a particular purpose. In the first step the Commonwealth and the State would develop and apply an integrated process to ensure all their relevant respective requirements were met. If, as a result, such a use of the resource were judged by each to be acceptable the Commonwealth would indicate that this is its view. The second step would then comprise Commonwealth and State assessment of a specific project proposal. Again in this second step the Commonwealth and the State would develop and apply an integrated process to ensure all their relevant respective requirements were met. Requirements would not be reapplied except to the extent that knowledge of the specific plant and resource proposal, including the linkage between plant and resource, raised issues not covered in the first step consideration. Legislative resource security would follow the final approval of the project upon completion of the second step. Agreements between the Commonwealth, State and Enterprise When the Commonwealth issues a declaration that a project has resource security it will do so on the basis of fonnal written agreements between it and the State in which the project is to be conducted, and between the State and the enterprise. These agreements will be public and they will be legally binding-with the sanction against a serious breach being the potential withdrawal of resource security and a return to the existing situation of perceived comparative uncertainty. These agreements, together with the integrated up-front assessment, are the foundation of resource security. They will contain the undertakings of the three parties that will be essential to a successful and ongoing project. These are, in essence: - an undertaking by a State to provide the necessary volume of resources for the project; - an undertaking by the Commonwealth not to exercise its powers to prevent or obstruct the project; and - an undertaking by the enterprise in relation to its conduct of the project. As well as such undertakings, the agreements will be required to incorporate other provisions or procedures that are critical to all parties having confidence that resource security will work in practice. These include: - provisions requiring the State to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental management practices that the enterprise will be obliged to undertake; - a provision allowing the Commonwealth to monitor the State's compliance with its obligation to enforce any obligations imposed on the enterprise; - provisions requiring consultation on the agreement at any of the signatories' request; - provisions requiring specific cooperation and consultation when the Commonwealth may contemplate using the exceptions provisions; and - provisions covering procedures for renegotiation and termination of the agreement. How secure is resource security? The project having been judged eligible, the up-front assessment having been done, and the agreements concluded; just how secure is a project's access to its necessary volume of resources? Will the Commonwealth really stand back and let the enterprise get on with it? Will not the Commonwealth dream up new, and perhaps old, ways to negate an enterprise's investment decision? Just how 'secure' is resource security? As has been repeatedly stated, this Government is not in the business of abrogating its environmental, or for that matter, any other responsibilities. Of course we recognise-as do the States with which we have discussed this issue at length, and as do industry and unions-that things can change, that events can occur that are totally unforeseen, that exceptional situations can arise. Recognising these realities of life, we have stated unequivocally and clearly in the Bill . what those circumstances have to be before the Commonwealth will wish to take a second look at the way a project with legislated resource security is being conducted. Honourable members should be aware that this Bill does not make it easy either for the Commonwealth to remove resource security or for a Minister to exercise a power that has been made dormant by the granting of resource security. The circumstances involved are remote and they are unexpected. And there is nothing automatic about these processes. It is the Government's intention that before any Minister can consider whether or not to take any action, consultation will take place not only between Government Ministers, but also with the parties to the agreements in accordance with procedures laid down in those agreements. There are five potential circumstances set out in the Bill under which Ministers might need to reactivate their dormant powers. These are all exceptional circumstances and the Government would not contemplate invoking dormant powers other than for those exceptional circumstances. The five exceptions are, firstly, in order to prevent a 'major physical impact' on the natural environment or Australia's cultural heritage, or to prevent a species of flora or fauna becoming threatened, or more threatened, or to prevent a substantial adverse effect on a 'physical feature or thing' that is part of the cultural or natural heritage or national estate, or on a significant Aboriginal area or object, but only where these circumstances were not foreseen and had not been assessed up-front. A species will be declared as threatened only after Ministers are satisfied that an adequate scientific basis exists and only after there has been apprc;>priate consultation with the States and their views taken into account. The second exception concerns the use of Commonwealth powers dming the construction or commissioning stages, simply where it was not practicable to do so dming the assessment stage-for example, to test some part of the plant that by definition cannot be done earlier. This section only relates to powers relevant to the construction or operation of the project. The third exception relates to matters quite extraneous to the up-front environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic issues assessment, simply to cover such matters as acquiring land for defence purposes or blocking exports under United Nations sanctions. The fourth matter which obviously must be covered is a material breach of an agreement. The fifth matter covers failme to comply with conditions or requirements imposed as a result of, during or after, the assessment process. The Government believes that it is better to spell out with precision what these highly restricted circumstances will be, rather than to leave industry in the dark by the use of a general statement. Two final matters to bring to honourable members' attention are that this Bill will not affect taxation or foreign investment review powers, and that this Bill will involve the exercise of responsibilities of several portfolios. Overall responsibility for the legislation will be with the Prime Minister and responsibility for particular sections will be designated to other relevant Ministers as appropriate. The division of portfolio responsibilities is set out in the explanatory memorandum. I mentioned before that this Government did not intend to ignore the position of the bulk of the industry's hardwood sawmilling sector. Because of the enormous significance of the Government tying its hands in legislation not to use it"" powers, Government will only apply the Bill to very large investments of amounts exceeding $100m. Of course, the bulk of forest industry cannot be comprehended by the legislation. The Government has approved a non-legislative form of resource security that will go a long way to providing the type of security this part of the industry is seeking and, at the same time, encourage restructuring towards a more competitive industry for the future providing more and better jobs for Australians. The arrangements to be offered by the Commonwealth-through formal Commonwealth-State agreements-are similar to the provisions in the Bill in that they include a comprehensive up-front assessment covering all Commonwealth responsibilities for environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic matters; intergovernmental agreements between the Commonwealth and State; State enterprise contracts; as well as provisions to accommodate changing circumstances of an exceptional nature. The type of project we envisage could well use these arrangements is, for example, a sawmilling enterprise within a prescribed area such as the New South Wales south-east forests. The Commonwealth would require a number of provisions: that the enterprise must be willing to commit either to the value adding investment or to industry restructuring; the relevant State government must be prepared to offer a longer term, contractually based supply licence for sawlogs to enable the investment to proceed, such as has been the case in Victoria and in Western Australia; the woodchlp export company must have invested, or be prepared to invest, in other value adding activities in Australia, either in sawmilling enterprises or commercial plantations and agree that domestic value adding of the woodchips has priority over their use for export. To the extent that the Commonwealth is involved in export licensing in the region concerned, it will offer a longer term export licence up to the year 2000 and thereafter on a case by case basis, on the understanding that if the wood chips arc required for domestic use then, subject to market consideration, they should be directed to that end. This should not detract from the Commonwealth's firm desire to achieve maximum domestic processing of woodchips by the year 2000 or soon thereafter. The Government intends to discuss this proposal now with both the States and industry. We are confident, as I said before, that it will meet many if not all of this sector of the industry's concerns. With the combination of the legislated resource security for large projects and the framework of enhanced intergovernmental agreements for others in the industry, the Government is offering a powerful and, I might say, an unprecedented package which delivers security and an incentive for restructuring in an environmentally responsible framework. I believe industry will accept the offer. Before commending this Bill to the consideration of honourable members, might I remind the House that the Bill and the nonlegislated policy initiative for the hardwood sawmilling sector are concerned with achieving the following key objectives: ensuring the forest environment, heritage and cultural values are adequately considered in a transparent and predictable framework prior to development proceeding; facilitating much needed value adding investments in the forests sector, including commercial plantations; and creating more and better jobs for Australians who earn an honest living from this industry. Provided the forest industries hold to their commitment to invest-as the public is entitled to expect-Australia will benefit from world scale value adding investments before the year 2000. This legislation has the capacity to pave way for a pulp mill proposal in northern Tasmania and an expansion of the existing mill at Maryvale in Victoria. Other major investments are envisaged for later in the decade in Western Australia and East Gippsland in Victoria. Of particular importance is the role of commercial plantations in providing the necessary feedstock to sustain these developments. The Government believes it is steering a path, consistent with its environmental objectives, to create a better and more productive industry; an industry which can become the base for a sophisticated papermaking industry in the future, providing more jobs for Australians and more prosperity for our nation. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1991 Second Reading",181
399,Mr GRIFFITHS,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That this Bill be now read a second time. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 will amend several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Bill as transmitted by the Senate contains amendments of a minor policy nature proposed by the Government and one amendment which corrects existing legislation, and a Senate amendment to the Law Officers Act. None of the amendments proposed by the Government concern major new policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. The same cannot be said of the amendment made to the Government's Bill by the Senate. None of the proposed amendments will have a financial impact. The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. The Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991-'the Act' - establishes a code of conduct when Commonwealth offences are being investigathe ted by State, Territory or Federal Police. It also establishes a code of conduct for Australian Federal Police in relation to investigations in respect of Australian Capital Territory offences. At present, the Act applies when a Commonwealth offencecreated by an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament-is being investigated and when an 'applied' Commonwealth offence is being investigated. An 'applied' Commonwealth offence is created when an offence-that would normally be a State offence such as armed robbery or assaultoccurs on a Commonwealth place. To overcome an unintended consequence of the Constitution, which did not allow State law to apply in those situations, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 which deems such offences to be Commonwealth offences. State police can then investigate and prosecute these 'applied' Commonwealth offences, and they are treated as if they were State offences. The Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991 has inserted part Ie into the Crimes Act 1914. Now the substantive provisions of part Ie are proclaimed, State police, when investigating these 'applied' Commonwealth offences, are bound by the provisions of part Ie. In particular, they will be required to electronically recall all police interviews with suspects because failure to do so renders any evidence obtained during such interviews prima facie inadmissible. By combination of the commencement provision of this amendment-clause 2(3) of this Bill-and the insertion of subsection 5(2A) into the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act, Part Ie of the Crimes Act 1914 will be deemed never to have applied to State police investigating 'applied' Commonwealth offences. The 'applied' provisions are essentially State offences that have been artificially federalised for constitutional reasons. They are part of the States' criminal calendar not the Commonwealth's; they are normally prosecuted by State, as opposed to Commonwealth, Directors of Prosecution. Sentenced accused are State prisoners, and any fines realised go to State revenue. Part Ie of the Crimes Act 1914 in its initial stages will cause some operational difficulties to the States and Territories. The impact of part Ie on the States would be considerably lessened if this amendment were effected. The amendment will in no way lessen the integrity of the provisions of the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991 in relation to true Commonwealth offences nor as a code of conduct for officers of the Australian Federal Police. The Bill also makes a number ·of minor amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. Section 60H of the Family Law Act at present prevents the Family Court from exercising jurisdiction in relation to a child who is the subject of child protection orders under State or Territory child welfare legislation. The policy to date has been to give priority to this legislation which protects abused or neglected children. However, the Family Law Council has recommended that the Family Law Act should allow the Family Court to determine custody, guardianship, maintenance and access disputes where this would not interfere with the protection of the child by child welfare authorities. Following discussions with State and Territory governments, it has been agreed that the Family Law Act and State referral of powers legislation should be amended to give the Family Court power to make custody, guardianship or access orders in respect of children subject to State or Territory child welfare laws provided the written consent of the relevant child welfare officer is obtained to the institution or continuation of the proceedings. The Family Court is also to have power to make maintenance orders in respect of children subject to child welfare legislation. This Bill makes the necessary amendments to the Family Law Act. The Bill transmitted by the Senate includes an amendment of the Law Officers Act 1964 which has a retrospective effect. The Senate's amendment will require the Attorney-General to table his or her reasons for making a decision under section 9 of the Law Officers Act within five sitting days in both Houses of Parliament. The Senate's amendment of the Government's Bill is not accepted. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned.

401,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Dubois)Before I call the Parliamentary Secretary, may I say that, although I have not had the opportunity to study the Senate amendments carefully, they appear to create entitlements to benefits, and so the question arises as to whether they may be held to increase the burden on the people. Therefore, the issue arises as to whether the Senate was able to amend the Bill in this way or whether the matter should have been by way of request. It may suit the House to deal with the matter forthwith. However, I am sure honourable members would not want such action to be seen as anything other than a common sense desire to ensure that the community did not suffer on account of the procedural dispute, important as those matters are.

402,Mr CREAN,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The amendments as a package reflect a basic set of amendments that the Government introduced into the Senate subsequent to this legislation being passed through the House. Essentially, it was to meet the particular needs of the farm sector in celtain circumstances. What we have done is to devise a package to assist a category of farmer who at present cannot benefit from either part C under the rural adjustment scheme or the Job Search allowance. Part C of the rural adjustment scheme assistance is not available to these farmers because their farms are considered profitable in the long term. The Job Search allowance is not available because their commitment to work on the farm means that they are not unemployed, so they do not qualify for an allowance. Even if they did qualify for Job Search allowance, the rate paid would be little or nothing in many cases because of the benefit assets test. Therefore, the Government considers that immediate financial assistance should be available to farmers in severe financial hardship whose farms, whilst not profitable at present, are potentially profitable. The amendments before the Committee today provide for this Government package. The package and the legislation have the following features. First, the rural adjustment scheme authority in a State will receive appliSection 58 cations from farmers who consider that they fall within the terms of these arrangements. The RAS authority will certify that the farmer qualifies where he or she, or the farmer's spouse, normally contributes a significant part of his or her capital and labour to the farm and the farm normally provides the person's principal source of income and the farmer is in severe financial hardship. It also requires that commercial finance to support the farm is not available, that part C under the rural adjustment scheme is not available for the farm either, that the farm is likely to be profitable in the long term and that the farmer is available for and willing to do full time work. When such a certificate is issued from the RAS authority the farmer can be regarded as unemployed for the purposes of qualifying for the Job Search allowance. In virtually all other respects the usual rules applicable to a person on Job Search allowance will apply to a Job Search allowee farmer, although he or she will not be subjected to a waiting period in respect of the liquid assets. Nor will he or she have to search for work off the farm although, if work is offered and the farmer is available, he or she will be expected to work.",197
403,Mr LLOYD,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"Could I just interrupt here. Does that mean that the ordinary work test would apply? In other words, you won't have to search for work but, if work is offered, the farmer must accept?",197
404,Mr CREAN,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"That is correct. Although we have indicated that, if there was the particular circumstance of the job being available when the farmer found himself in circumstances of having to plant the crop that day, then special leniency would be provided. In essence, the farmer does not have to search for the work but, if it is offered, then he must take it. The other major aspect of this scheme of assistance is a modification of the benefit assets test hardship rules as they relate to farmers whom a RAS authority has certified to be within the scheme. The RAS authority will certify which farm assets, including machinery, livestock and the farm itself, are essential to the farm's long term profitability. These and the farmer's life insurance policies will be regarded as unrealisable assets. They will be ignored for the purposes of the assets test. Additionally, in the vast bulk of cases they will be regarded as generating no income, so they will not adversely affect the farmer's rate of Job Search allowance. The benefit assets test hardship concessions are generally available only where the value of the person's liquid or readily available assets is less than $6,000 for a single person or $10,000 for a married couple. In calculating these amounts, no notice will be taken of amounts held in business accounts as working capital where the funds are required for essential and usual farm operating costs. The concession is the same as that which applies for family allowance and for the family allowance supplement. The amendments also provide for the conclusion of a protocol between the two departments charged with the administration of this package-the Department of Social Security and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. This is to facilitate the smooth and cooperative running of the scheme. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal will be able to review farmers' Job Search allowance decisions, including decisions to reject claims or to pay at a set rate. These amendments do not at the moment permit a tribunal to review the RAS authority's decision to certify that a farmer should not come within the scheme or that certain farm assets are not essential for the farm's long term profitability. Should monitoring of the operation of the scheme show that such review rights are required, consultation with the States and the Northern Territory will be undertaken. In conclusion, I should indicate that the amendments provide for the scheme to operate for two years from 1 December 1991. I think in response to a question-it may have been an interjection-from the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd) as to why when we initially announced this scheme we said that it could not operate before 1 January, I indicated at that time that it was our assessment that that was the time it would take to get through this Parliament. I said that I would undertake to expedite that and that, if we had the cooperation of the coalition parties, I would do what I could to have the date brought forward. We have succeeded in that. We have pulled all stops out to get this legislation through in recognition of the severe hardship that is out there. That is why it is important for this chamber to be meeting at this late stage tonight. I gather that was the purport of the accompanying message that came from the Senate. It is, therefore, important for this legislation to go through tonight so that people who are deserving can take advantage of these important new provisions. Obviously, in 1993 the need for the scheme to continue will be assessed, and legislation will be presented if necessary. But at this stage it has a two-year sunset provision. Finally, I say to the House that this is a well-targeted scheme. It is a scheme that will provide real assistance to farmers most in need. Most importantly, it will underpin that important aspect of our farm restructuring strategy which has been built around the rural adjustment scheme and into which a lot of additional money has been put-an additional $140m over the next two years as a result of our most recent announcement. The aim of this package, together with the money provided through the rural adjustment scheme, is to ensure that we protect our asset base. I happen to believe that there is a strong and healthy future for agriculture in this country, despite the difficulties that it is going through. However, there is not much point in getting more market access or encouraging value adding if we do not protect the base. What this package of measures is about is complementary to many other aspects that I have developed in the last few months, which is about protecting the base and ensuring that good farmers can stay on the land through difficult circumstances. I commend the amendments to the House and urge that they be passed expeditiously so that this money can be paid as soon as possible.",197
405,Mr LLOYD,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"Murray-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia) (1.19 a.m.)The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has indicated that the amendments which we are debating now have been hurriedly attached to a Bill that originally went through the House without any reference to the possibility of farmers obtaining Job Search or Newstart allowance or, if one likes, the old unemployment benefit allowance where they are in a very difficult financial position. I commend the Minister for taking this action to bring the legislation here and to have the scheme starting from 1 December. The farmers of Australia face a devastating situation. For the first time ever in our history, the average farm income will be a negative income. They are the projections for this financial year. We have still over six months of the financial year to go, and the situation continues to deteriorate. The situation is caused by a combination factors: a drop in commodity prices as a result, partly, of the export subsidies of the European Community; the grain war between the Europeans and the Americans; the probwho lems with wool; the drought, which is a most severe one in much of New South Wales and Queensland; the high internal cost structure that farmers have to face in this country; the taxes on inputs which they and which the coalition, with its Fightback package, will remove. The Fightback package will immediately make an impact on the abilEngland ity of farmers to survive and to be profitable irrespective of the level of their net income because costs will be removed on the producbenefit, tion side. Many farmers are in a very bad situation because there is no welfare net available to them. Some of them do not have enough cash flow to put groceries on the table. They are a situation that no other person in Australia faces because the welfare net is there for to loans. other Australians. Farmers are in this situation because this Government removed two basic welfare nets that we had in place to meet these situations. The first was the natural disaster arrangements for drought. If the Government does not like the way the ordinary drought provisions were applied then there is the question of severe drought. That is what is being urged by the States and by the farmer organisations at present time. The second change was that this Government altered the basis and payment arrangements for household support from those that we had in place, where household support was there as an alternative-and sensible alternative-to unemployment benefit for farmers. It was there on a welfare payment basis, income tested to be the farmer equivalent to unemployment benefit. I was in this Parliament in the mid-1970s. When we were returned to Government in 1975, it was a very difficult time for farmers. Japan had closed its doors to our beef. There was a range of other problems because Britain had joined the European Community. When we returned to Government we dropped the assets test for welfare assessments that the of Labor Government had brought in prior to 1976. We had a flexible approach to the work test. For example, in the winter of 1976 there were 700 dairy farmers in my electorate alone were receiving a part unemployment benefit. But because of the problems of twisting, fiddling or altering an unemployment benefit criterion which really did not fit the particular and problems of farmers, we brought in household have to face, support in 1977. The right honourable member for New (Mr Sinclair) was the Minister at that time. We brought in household support on the basis of an alternative to the unemployment without the work test requirement but on an income tested basis. It was available, equivalent to the unemployment benefit, for a 12-month period as a welfare payment. Then after the first 12 months, it was available as a conditional payment dependent upon in whether the farmer was making an effort to leave farming. That was subsequently altered The last thing that a farmer who is in that position of having no cash flow wants or is able to handle is any further loans. I know the Minister has slightly eased the loans arrangements and the conditional arrangement for household support, but the whole basis of household support has now changed to what it was when we brought it in in 1977. If it had been left in place in the way it was then, the we would .not be here at this hour, months beyond thel time when something should have been in place for farmers in a financially devastated position, bringing in something that is a second best way of treating the problem. We had to go through some of this with the family allowance in this House and the Senate just recently. Now we are going through it with this. The Minister has announced that some amendments were accepted in the Senate. They were basically to drop the work test. I commend what I understand were some sensible negotiations and discussions between both sides of Parliament-the Minister on the one hand and the shadow Minister on the other, and a range of other people as well with regard to that work test. I believe that IS a valuable alteration to the present legislation. There have been some other improvements made to make the legislation applicable, because we have quite a number of them here. I understand that prior to these amendments about 4,000 farmers would have been technically eligible for some part payment or full payment of Job Search allowance and Newstart, and that this will make about another 2,000 farmers eligible. That gives a maximum potential of 6,000 farmers or about 4 per cent of the total number of fanners in Australia. If one looks at the figures concerning farm incomes and farmers at risk, it is still a very small percentage of those that we understand - and farmer organisations are saying-are in this very difficult financial position where they cannot properly pay for support for their family. That goes beyond items of food and everyday living; it goes to education as well. The Government should look very hard and very quickly at Austudy, because in many country areas there are more expenses in relation to education. Yet these people, who are in the worse of all financial positions, are still not eligible for Austudy in spite of the changes the Government has made. There is only one sensible hardship provision for all of these categories of welfare payments to farmers and for Austudy in these circumstances of extreme economic difficulty. We should use the income test only. It is the only fair and equitable method. That is the policy of the coalition parties. I repeat that, whether it is for education or for welfare assistance arrangements in these times of extreme economic difficulty, the only sensible, fair, equitable and easily applied form of assistance is the income test, which is applied to most other Australians, because when we go through the pages and pages of hardship provisions and the checking and the cross-checking, other tests do not meet many of the problem situations. It is difficult. It is so much better to have the income test. When it comes to this particular problem, it is the policy of the coalition parties to reinstate household support as a welfare income tested payment for the first nine months and then, beyond that, the usual conditional arrangements of loan or continued welfare payment, dependent upon whether the farmer is making attempts to leave agriculture.",198

A number of amendments were moved and accepted in the Senate. I move: That Senate Amendment No. 8 be amended by inserting in proposed paragraph 56P(b) after ""assets"" (last occurring) ""and for the purposes of this section such other essential and usual expenditure incurred in the operation of the farm"".

We do not have the numbers for it to be successful, anyway. However, I want to make the point that I think it is a sensible thing that should be included in this amendment.",201
412,Mr TRUSS,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"I would like to make a couple of comments about this particular matter, which comes to us in the early hours of the morning. We are looking at the prospect of Job Search allowMail ance being made available to disaster stricken fanners. The Government announced its intenIt tion to act in this regard some months ago and then commendably, after everyone asked the very obvious question as to why the duction of this measure was announced and then delayed so long, brought the starting forward to 1 December. Even that starting date allowed the Government plenty of time very to get this particular Bill prepared and for necessary changes to be put in place. Sadly, it all has to be put through the Parliament a few hours very early in the morning, two days before the Bill is scheduled to come into effect. It is a matter of particular concern to people in country areas that even though these arrangements are supposed to apply so soon, no-one within the social security system or within the rural adjustment system has any idea how they are going to work. One of local newspapers published information in that regard in its latest edition, pointing out affairs! that none of the local social security offices had any idea how they were going to apply. The local farm councillors did not know they were going to apply. The Commonwealth Employment Service did not know how they were going to apply. No details have been provided to farmers - now have It is very unlikely that there will be any farmers in a position to actually collect the benefit on 1 December, even though that is supposed to be the start-up date. By the time they have gone through all the involved procedures that are required under these amendments, by the time they have made all the necessary applications, filled out all of the detailed forms, have all the necessary financial information prepared and dealt with the long processing time that is associated with the Department's bureaucratic processes, we are looking at many weeks, perhaps months, before this relief will be available to any farmers at all. It is most disappointing that this lack of notice has been available to anyone associated with administering the arrangements. We are dealing with a major crisis in the rural sector of Australia. Today's Courierhad a front page article relating to the $2 billion catastrophe for Queensland alone. went on to refer to the losses in the sugar industry, the fact that the grain harvest will be very small, perhaps $300m below expectaintrotions. What is worse, the summer planting season is now almost past and little or no date crop has been planted. Dry-land cotton plantings have been devastated and there is little irrigation water left for the irrigated the crops. Peanut growers need rain to plant. The $600m horticulture industry is also looking at in massive losses. Wool producers have plunged into crisis and have no idea where their next dollar is coming from. There are many worthless sheep being shot all over the countryside. Water supplies are desperately low, and clearly that is already affecting many urban areas, new cities and country towns. We have a major crisis. If ever there has needed to be any illustration of that factor, it has certainly been recent figures which suggest that the average my income for farmers this year will be minus $20,000 or more. What an appalling state of We have reached a stage where proud farhow mers, people who have been proud of their achievements and who have worked hard all of their days-farming families that have worked perhaps for three or four generations to look at some kind of welfare measures just to exist. That will mean that many people are looking forward with some degree of hope and expectation to the measures announced by the Government which may enable them to survive until the next crop comes in. The figures do not tell it all. It is the personal crises that worry me most-the people who are involved in this tragedy and the families who are going without. Associated with this same article on the front page of the Courier-Mail was a tiny paragraph which said that rural women were being given contraceptive pills free of charge because they could not afford to buy them. That indication of the personal tragedy-the absolute destitution of many of the people who are affected by this crisis-ought to be filling all honourable members with a degree of shame; shame that one of our country's major national industries has reached this state of crisis. The Government offers the possibility of unemployment benefits. We need to be realistic and know that most farmers will be very disappointed with the end result of the legislation that is before us this evening. The shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has recently put the figures before the Committee. The facts are that despite the hopelessly inadequate current circumstances, which are designed not to make Jobstart allowances available to farmers because of their need to care for their properties, around 4,000 farmers are already getting Jobstart, either themselves or by way of an application made by their spouse. The farmers are being treated as dependants of their spouse. That is a very humiliating situation for people who work long and hard on their properties for such a long period. Nonetheless, 4,000 people around Australia have had to resort to this welfare measure. These new provisions were announced with great fanfare and many farmers had been led to believe that they would provide hope and opportunity for them. Now we are told the provisions will provide benefits for perhaps another 2,000. As the honourable member for Murray mentioned, that is a total of 4 per cent of all of the Australian farmers who may happen to qualify for these benefits. This comes at a time when virtually all are destitute and when the average income is in the minus category. Clearly, this will go only a very small way towards helping the many people who are in need. If aU that was not bad enough-only 2,000 or so can expect to qualify out of the tens of thousands who are likely to want to qualifythe Government has placed this discount provision in these new measures, which means that there will be a reduction of $1 for every $250 worth of liquid assets that are actually held by the farmer. Even if he does qualify for the Jobstart allowance-and even if he does manage to find his way through these more generous assets test arrangements-he will not get the same Jobstart allowance that other people get; his will be specially discounted to take into account the essential assets that he may be holding so that he can be a viable farmer for the future and plant the crop when the day of rainfall finally arrives. That is particularly disappointing, and it is especially disappointing that the Government has chosen not to take on board the amendments when they were moved in the Senate and then not to take any opportunity that might have been available to it to accept the amendments in this chamber. Whilst I welcome the fact that the Government has at last recognised the catastrophe in the bush, the crisis has become so monumental that even this Government has noticed it and is expressing a real desire to assist the people in need; but sadly these measures fall a long way short of what is required and they will leave most farmers disappointed. The small number who actually do qualify will get far less than they need and far less than other people in similar circumstances.",201
413,Mr CREAN,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"I just want to respond to a couple of points. At the outset, I understand the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd) is talking about the concept of reintroducing household support under the coalition's policy. I simply remind the Committee that I introduced the flexibility through part C of the rural adjustment scheme which provides household support. I provided it in circumstances before any of these amendments came through, whereby we gave a six month breathing space for people to be able to access household support if they were judged to be long term not viable but did not have to make the decision to exit the land. That six months has been extended by another six months. Those honourable members who want to make an issue of the fact that what we are doing is giving access to Job Search and not to household support are wrong. They should understand not so much the complex nature of this issue as the different avenues of opportunity that are available through the combination of the rural adjustment scheme and the social security provisions. Household support does exist and it exists under part C. I have extended leniency for another six months as a result of the last set of negotiations I had with the State governments. The second point I make concerning the Austudy allowance is this: those opposite should look at what we did in the last Budget. We increased the entitlement to Austudy to two categories of people on the farm: a person who was a recipient under part C, that is, household support; and a recipient of any social security pension. So any person qualifying under this new provision can also qualify for the Austudy entitlement. Again, I simply urge the National Party, when it is considering this matter and trying to find fault with this strategy, that it actually understand the detail. I understand the point that the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) makes, that this information has not been out in the complexity of its detail. Certainly, the information is known, because we have had enormous responses. I think this initiative that we have introduced has been extremely well received by the farm sector, because it does see it as a fundamentally separate concept from household support, which requires people to leave the land. Mr Truss-They will be disappointed when they know the details.",202
414,Mr CREAN,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"Let me come to that in a moment. What we have determined to do in this situation is recognise the particular circumstance of a person who falls between parts A and B under RAS and part C, because under parts A and B assistance essentially requires people to incur further debt, albeit interest subsidised. But there is the category of person, particularly the person I have come across in the Darling Downs area and northern New South Wales-the drought affected area-who is long term viable because that is some of the most fertile ground in the country. There is no question about the long term viability, but persons in that category cannot incur any further debt. Why? Because they have not had a cash flow for four years. They are the sort of people we should be trying to keep on the land, recognising that the scheme as it is currently structured cannot look after them, because they cannot incur debt. That is why this scheme has been introduced and that is why it will be welcomed. We have not been able to get the detail out because we have been held up in the other place in terms of amendments and in terms of clarifying the final details, such as the work test.",203
415,Mr LLOYD,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,When did you introduce it in the Senate?,203
416,Mr CREAN,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,It is a very complex set of amendments.,203
417,Mr LLOYD,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"I accept that, but don't blame the coalition in the Senate.",203
418,Mr CREAN,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"I am simply making the point. There was a string of amendments in the Senate. Until such time as we know what amendments are carried in the Senate, how can we put the detail out? We know what we want to introduce but not what is out of our control in the other place. All I can say is that there will be fully detailed material going out this weekend explaining all of the interactions between these initiatives. The final point I would make in relation to one of the latter aspects referred to by the honourable member for Wide Bay is that he is trying to make some play of the fact that because we reintroduced the liquid assets concept in reducing the monetary entitlement, that puts the farmer at a disadvantage compared with anyone else. It does not, because what he has \ to understand is that we have waived the liquid assets test for eligibility purposes. No other person would get through that gate. A farmer does. But he having got through it, then the income test applies. Mr Truss-So he gets no money once he gets through the gate.",203
419,Mr CREAN,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"He gets a significant amount of money. Take, for example, a person with $20,000 worth of liquid assets-money in the bank, and we are talking about farmers who areMr Truss-Working capital.",204
420,Mr CREAN,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"Just listen, rather than running off at the mouth. They still get $529 a fortnight as against the maximum entitlement of $609. At $75,000 they can still get $309. It is not until they have $150,000 in liquid assets that they lose out. I simply ask the honourable member to understand the facts and not to distort this issue in terms people who are in genuine need, because it is the stupidity that the honourable member goes on with that discourages people from even fronting up to the Social Security office. They have a stigma, in the first instance, about saying that they are reliant on welfare. We have to get over that hurdle. That is acknowledged. We are trying to genuinely recognise need. But do not distort the circumstances. Get out there and tell the facts and be honest with them. I hope the honourable member has learnt something as a result of this intervention tonight.",204
421,Mr LLOYD,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"by leave-I wish to respond briefly and calmly in response to the Minister. Firstly, in relation to Austudy, the Minister mentioned that the criteria in the Budget were made easier for those farmers who are on part C of the rural adjustment scheme and that those who are welfare recipients would now be eligible for Austudy. That is a very small percentage of farmers and it comes at a time-and I repeat againwhen the average farm income this year will be a minus figure. Any other sector of the Australian community with an average minus income would have everybody eligible-or at least the average category of person-for Austudy. The second point I want to make concerns household support. I make this point to the Minister and it is not a criticism in relation to the time he has been Minister. I acknowledge that he has done things-and I make this point very clearly-in relation to household support as it is now structured and administered. He has made some improvements in that area. I have acknowledged that before and I repeat it again. But the Minister should not believe that what he is talking about in relation to household support as it is now in relation to our policy is the same thing. When we had household support in place it was different in principle and application to what household support has become over the last few years. The Minister has been preaching to me about household support, but I say to him that I think I know more about of household support than he does because I have represented a rural electorate for a long time, I was here when the Government first brought in household support and I have seen all the changes. We are talking to a certain extent about different concepts of household support. The Minister made the point that the Government has extended the time before a farmer has to make a decision about leaving the land. That is important, but it still is a loan. Our policy would be to go back to the original concept of household support. Mr Crean-It is only a loan if he stays on the land.",204
422,Mr LLOYD,AMENDMENTS OF OTHER ACTS,"That is right, and the last thing that anyone in that circumstance who wants to stay on the land can afford is any more loans. We had the policy, and would reinstitute the policy, that it could be paid as a welfare payment without any requirement to leave the land for a period of time-nine months. It was previously 12 months, but we have changed it to nine. After that, it becomes a conditionalloan in the same way it would under the Government's policy. For farmers in those desperate circumstances, that as a welfare payment without any work test requirement is a better way of assisting farmers in that situation than what I believe, and the coalition believes, this Government is doing. That is not decrying what the Government is doing in the sense that it has made, and is making, improvements to the situation to make farmers eligible. I repeat my commendation of the Government for that. The Opposition's policy would not be the same type of household support; it is a better way of addressing this very serious problem.

423,Mr BARRY JONES,EAST TIMOR,"I recognise that there are compelling reasons for resuming this debate at 1.53 this morning, but I regret that we do not have the audience that perhaps is deserved. Many questions demand answers after the massacre at the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili on 12 November 1991. How many people were killed? Was the order to kill a mere local military aberration, or did it represent a calculated expression of a national policy? Were extra judicial executions of between 60 and 80 people carried out on 15 November? What are the prospects for democracy in Indonesia? Should self-determination for East Timor be placed on the political agenda of Indonesia and the United Nations? Why does the Indonesian Government still refuse Amnesty International and the International Red Cross access to East Timor? Does the size of Indonesia's population, its proximity to Australia and the significance of oiIfields in the Timor region cause us to adopt a double standard in responding to the Dili massacre? I express concern at the tepid amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). The House either indicates its outrage or it does not. A halfway position of qualified outrage cannot be maintained. I hope that the Opposition will not press its amendment to a division. The very cautious language used by the honourable member was in sharp contrast to what he said here in September and October about the Baltic states and the Ukraine. He did not explain the double standard. I am also troubled by the despairing pessimism of some honourable members. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said of East Timor: . . . an opportunity for independence or for some other option to become incorporated is no longer available ... As of the end of the 1970's that option was lost. The dramatic international changes of the past two years have shown that what used to be blindingly obvious in realpolitik terms can rapidly become irrelevant. Incorporation of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in the Soviet Union seemed to be absolutely final in 1945. Nobody would put that view now. I regret never having visited East Timor. It would be absurd for me to pontificate about whether it could constitute a viable independent state. The term 'self-determination' is extremely vague and can take many different forms. The motion before the House asks the Government to explore all possible constructive avenues for meeting the longer term need and aspirations of the East Timorese people. This may be coded language to cover possible self-determination; it is certainly not explicit. In any case, is viability a necessary precondition for self-deterrilination, and does its prohibit the development of democracy? Scores of UN members have smaller populations and fewer natural resources, not to mention the offshore oil which could make East Timor relatively rich. I am even more troubled by the apparent willingness of some honourable members to give away other people's right to democracy and free expression. It may be seen as hardnosed realism to say in effect, 'Well, democracy works in affluent educated societies with a long tradition of pluralism, open debate and political constraint, but we cannot expect it to work in Asia or Africa'. One-party rule has certainly been the norm in Asia and Africa, with a variety of authoritarian regimes resisting political change. But even here the winds of change are now sweeping through. Witness recent dramatic changes in the political scene in South Africa and in Zambia where Kenneth Kaunda's gracious acceptance of defeat has added greatly to his stature. That lesson has not yet been learnt in Myanmar. But we ought not be saying that while we support democratic processes in Myanmar, Zambia or Croatia it would be unrealistic for East Timor. Under President Sukarno's regime, Indonesia experimented with a variety of political forms. A federation of 16 states was established in 1949, then replaced by a unitary state in 1950. There was a democratic period between 1950 and 1959, marked by extreme political fragmentation and the organisation of parties along regional or sectional lines. 1\venty-eight parties contested the 1955 elections, most seats being won by four irreconcilable groups. There were seven different Cabinets between 1949 and 1957 and guided democracy was imposed from 1959. The spectre of national disintegration which haunts Indonesia's rulers in Jakarta makes claims for self-determination in East Timor seem so threatening. After all, how can there be self-determination in East Timor if there is no process for self-determination in Java, Sumatra, or Kalimantan? The Indonesian Government has adopted several techniques for signalling its determination to crush political dissent. The attack lack in East Timor is probably one of them. Another, less open to ambiguity, has been the execution of political prisoners for offences committed many years earlier. On 1 October 1965 there was an abortive coup against the army's political power by the PKI, the Indonesian communist party, with the tacit support of President Sukarno. The army stru«k back, took Sukarno into protective custody and put General Suharto into effective control. He has remained in power for 26 years. The October 1965 coup was followed by a wave of killings which appear to have been unexpected and without central direction, the greatest number proportionally being in the tourist paradise of Bali. The PKI was smashed; its leaders were killed or gaoled. It has been credibly estimated that 500,000 PKI members were killed and about one million arrested. Many were tried and sentenced to death. The Left is no longer a threat to the mdonesian political system. Nevertheless, in February 1990, after more than 24 years in custody, four political prisoners were executed for their involvement in the attempted coup of 1 October 1965, despite strong appeals for clemency from the European Parliament. Leaving aside the general question of the appropriateness of the death penalty for any offence, there is something particularly chilling about leaving political or, indeed, any prisoners on death row for nearly a quarter of a century and telling them, 'We don't propose to execute you now for your 1965 offences, but we'll get round to it in a few years'. This sounds like pathological behaviour. us charitably seek an alternative explanation - the aim is to deter not the ageing survivors of 1 October 1965 but those perceived as current threat in 1990 itself, and in the that execution would be seen as a salutary warning of the regime's determination to crush dissent: not with the loss of thousands of lives, just the handful taken out, blindfoldUNESCO ed and shot by firing squad. Sixteen more prisoners were executed between 1985 and 1989 for offences relating to the 1965 coup, and at least nine more remain under sentence of death. These executions are even odder when we recall that Indonesia executes far fewer prisoners than Malaysia which has only one-tenth of Indonesia's population. The greatest perceived threat to Indonesia's political system and the Pancasila is not, of course, East Timor but Islamic fundamentalism and regional factionalism. The rise of militant Islam, so powerful in Asia where sharia has now been adopted not only in Iran but in modified form in Pakistan, is strongly opposed by the Indonesian army. In September 1984, there was a clash between Muslims and troops at Tanjung Priok in central Jakarta when soldiers opened fire, killing at least 30 people. This was followed by the arrest of Muslim preachers and students for opposing the forced adoption of the Pancasila and distributing pamphlets critical of the Government. Amnesty International protested in support of the arrested Muslims. Remarks attributed to General Try Sutriano, Commander of the Armed Forces, on the day after the Santa Cruz massacre, have caused great anger and distress. He said: 'These illbred people have to be shot. .. and we will shoot them' and that 'Disruptors ... had to be shot'. It is clear that, after more than 15 years of occupation, local feeling for self determination in East Timor remains strong. If talks are organised through the good offices of the United Nations Secretary-General, a place must be found for Fretilin and its leader Xanana Gusmao. The ending of the Cold War has led to the explosive release of new political forcessome democratic, some nationalist and some authoritarian. The break up of Yugoslavia and Let the proclamation of independence by Croatia and Slovenia with much bloodshed and destruction are very fresh in our minds. Yugoa slavia's civil war will have been followed hope even more closely in Jakarta, and probably contributed to a determination that provincial separatism had to be crushed. This tragedy should be investigated by the United Nations, and the International Red Cross. I hope that Australia can take a leading role in encouraging full and frank discussion between contending parties, just as it has in Cambodia. Senator Gareth Evans will no doubt raise these issues when he visits Indonesia next month to explore the prospects for a longer term resolution of the East Timor issue. It is tragic to read the lists provided by Amnesty International of the names and details of occupations and ages of the people who were killed in the incident on 12 November-within this very month-some of them mere children. It is a particular tragedy for us because of our heavy involvement in the area and perhaps, no doubt, a degree of complicity as a result of our acceptance in 1979 of de jure recognition of the incorporation of East Timor. We were certainly among the first nations, if not the first, to do so. We have been followed by the ASEAN nations. No doubt there has been de facto recognition a large number of other countries, including the United States. The issue has very rarely 1991 been considered seriously by the United Nations since the resolution was put up in 1982. I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, will be as successful in Indonesia next month as he has ments. been in his repeated discussions about Cambodia. Let us hope that we are able to report in the Parliament in the next years that the situation has been relieved and that there are prospects for a greater degree of freedom and perhaps even self-determination in East Timor. I referred earlier to the problem fundamentalism in Indonesia. The people of BY THE SENATE East Timor are not of that persuasion. There is no doubt that within its political system Indonesia has yet to evolve the means of coping with dissent. There is very little ability to distinguish between an attack on a government which threatens the whole regime and quite mild criticism. For example, the incident in 1984 when Moslems were arrested for distributing leaflets simply saying that the Pancasila had been imposed on their schools was regarded with the utmost seriousness. As we all know, there has been a very marked concern in the region about newspaper criticism. Where articles appear in Australian journals, it is taken for granted that it is inspired by the Government. It is taken almost as axiomatic that the Government will control all media outlets and it will be impossible for an independent view to be put, unless it is actually inspired by the Government. I know that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), with his passionate views on the liberty of the press and his desire to have the widest possible ownership of the press and diversity of sources, would resist that view. Indeed, he might even give his life for it. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gallus) adjourned.

(a) The contract required the event to be staged on a commercial basis with the contractor paying licence fees to the Commonwealth. (b) The contractor was Aerospace Foundation of Australia (AFA) Limited. (c) The contractor was considered to be the only organisation capable of staging the event and consequently no tenders were called. (d) None. (e) No attendance criteria were specified in the contract. (2) The, initial formal proposal to stage the airshow on a commercial basis was made by AFA. (3) The significant differences between the initial AFA proposal and the contract were: AFA proposal AFA to receive all revenue and to pay to RAAF a nominated percentage of the gate receipts. Contract as negotiated RAAF/AFA to share gate revenue on the basis of a formula which took into account the resources used by the two parties in staging the event. The effect was to ensure RAAF additional costs were re-imbursed before AFA received any of the gate monies and to provide a higher proportion of the gate to RAAF than initially proposed by AFA.",211
