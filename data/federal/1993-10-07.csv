2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Petrol Excise To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the increase in excise of 7 cents per litre on leaded petrol and 5 cents per litre on unleaded petrol resulting from the Budget. This rise in petrol tax: (1) discriminates against low income families and those living in rural areas (2) increases business costs and will cause further unemployment (3) adds further to the price of an already heavily taxed product (4) breaks Mr Keating's election promise not to put up tax. And your petitioners therefore pray that the House oppose these increases in petrol excise. by Mr Bradford (from 139 citizens), Mr Cadman (from 2,758 citizens), Mr Evans (from 2,094 citizens), Mr Miles (from 205 citizens) and Mr Taylor (from 801 citizens). Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembledThe Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows: 1. Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year. 2. Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their from a more expensive source. 3. The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the schedule fee. 4. The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases. 5. The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance. 6. Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available. We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered. by Mr Beale (from 22 citizens), Mr Beazley (from 280 citizens) and Mr Miles (from 288 citizens). Bass Strait Ferry Crossings To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the state of Tasmania draws to the attention of the House: The inequality that exist in the cost of using the Bass Strait as a road link between Tasmania and other capital cities, when mainland capitals are linked by highways exclusively funded by the Commonwealth and provide comparatively low cost travel. Your petitioners therefore request the House: To urgently approve Commonwealth funding of Bass Strait ferry crossings to enable travel to be at a rate consistent with travel between capital cities on the inainland. by Mr Miles (from 3,023 citizens) and Mrs Silvia Smith (from 1,878 citizens). United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child care To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Your petitioners therefore request the House to reject and not allow to become law the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. by Mr Bradford (from 32 citizens). Caged Bears in China To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the state of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears for these purposes to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Cameron (from 988 citizens). Australian Army Band, Perth To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest opposition to the decision of the Federal Government to disband the Australian Army Band, Perth. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to oppose any attempt to dissolve the Australian Army Band, Perth. by Mr Cameron (from 393 citizens). Budget 1993-94 To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of RepresentativeS'in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: that pensioners, the unemployed and low and middle income Australians will be worse off if the Government's 1993-94 Budget is passed unchanged by the Parliament; the increase in the rate of wholesale sales tax will add to the tax burden on basic household goods; the increase in petrol excise-in particular the excise on leaded petrol which is overwhelmingly used by low income people and farmers-will significantly add to the costs of operating a vehicle in Australia; the increase in the tax on wine from 20 to 31 per cent immediately and 32 per cent next year will do serious damage to one of this nation's most successful industries; the increase in the tax on lump sums received from unused leave is retrospective and unfair. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will reject these measures on behalf of the qitizens of Australia. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Downer (from 22 citizens). Wine: Wholesale Sales Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The proposed sales tax increase of an initial 55 per cent on wine will harm both Geelong and Australian wineries by further lowering domestic wine sales. 2. Investment of at least $500 million in the wine industry is at risk from this proposal. 3. Hundreds of jobs in the wine and related industries are under threat and calls upon the House to give every consideration to amending the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 so as to ensure a healthy Australian wine industry. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr MCArthur (from 125 citizens). United Nations Declaration on Religious Discrimination United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully submit that: The United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief: prohibits all forms of religious discrimination, thus potentially restricting the freedom of Australians to make any choices on the grounds of their belief; could lead to US-style prohibitions on public Christian prayers, Christmas carols or nativity scenes; has the potential, according to the NSW Attorney-General, to restrict greatly the freedom of religious groups; and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: gives wide rights to children in Articles including the right to privacy and freedom of association; gives only the legally-weak term ""respect"" for the rights of parents in Article 5; could result in government-assisted rebellion against parents who want to set limits for their children in their children's best interests. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: act to disallow these, two International Instruments from the HREOC Act. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr MCLachlan (from 244 citizens). Land: Sale to Overseas Interests To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents in the state of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that land of Australia is being sold to overseas interests. Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate to stop this practice or alternatively to legislate that land can only be leased to overseas interests. by Mr Melham (from 1,028 citizens). National Flag To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: (1) The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. (2) We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national as flag, provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national poll. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Taylor (from 32 citizens). Unrealised Capital Gains and Losses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled The petition of the undersigned shows: We the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that the Government's proposals to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 be abandoned. The 12 to 16, Petitioners note particularly that:1. The majority of Australians regard the proposed method of calculating unrealised capital gains and losses as unfair and inequitable; 2; The implementation of this measure will have a deleterious effect on national savings and investments of pensioners and veterans; 3. We regard the Government's estimates of cost saving as spurious. , And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Truss (from 184 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest support for the existing National Flag. The Australian National Flag is the most important symbol of the Australian nation and our national unity, and has evoked deep feelings of honour and respect from many generations of Australians. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian National Flag and to ensure that its design is not changed without the support of a referendum carried by the majority of Australians in the majority of States. by Mr Truss (from 30 citizens).

3,Mr FERGUSON,OLYMPIC GAMES,"Reid) (9.35 a.m.)I move: That this House commends the various levels of government for their success in gaining the Year 2000 Olympics for Sydney. Despite the hour at which the announcement of Sydney's successful bid occurred, in future years many Australians, particularly the younger ones, will recall that moment, because it is essentially a very significant decision. Regardless of debates about the flag and national identity, Australia has been recognised by the success of this proposal as a unit that can organise a :airly important international event. Whilst there has been, quite rightly, significant hype about the actual bid committee, I want to put on record my appreciation for the work of the New South Wales Public Works Department and the community liaison committee that has operated in conjunction with it. The area where these Olympics will occur is in the electorate of Reid. It covers an area of 760 hectares encompassing wetlands, salt marsh, woodlands and grasslands, areas of very significant environmental concern. At the same time, it has since the late 19th century had significant industrial usage. Amongst the operations that have occurred there are the Silverwater state prison and the waste transfer unit, which have a continuing presence. In previous years it has also had Sydney's major abattoirs, the Newington armament depot, the placement of which there is continuing controversy about, and from 1911 the state brickworks. It is a very onerous task that the state government has undertaken· to ensure that there is a responsible mix of environmental protection, particularly along Haslams Creek. At the same time, it presents a very momentous opportunity for planning in regards to residential development. There will be 5,000 to 6,000 people living on the site after the conclusion of the Olympics. There is also, of course, a great opportunity for a significant number of sporting venues: the 80,OOO-seat stadium, the aquatic centres, the velodrome, the gymnasium and the tennis courts. They will be additional to the state sports centre and other facilities that are already very much on stream. It is significant thaNhe Australian bid put a very strong emphasis on sustainable development and environmental aspects. Greenpeace was a major player in putting forward the Australian submission and it did gain international commendation for that aspect. The Australian submission covered global warming, ozone depletion and biodiversity, and it lays great emphasis on the possibility of recycling of water on the site from the residential units into the greenery around the site. We are talking of 19 hectares of remnant eucalypt forest, 100 species of Australian trees and significant casuarina plantations, and I am pleased to say that at this stage there is a very strong recognition the New South Wales state government and its departments of the emphasis needed to be put on these aspects. One other thing that I am very impressed with in the efforts made so far is transportation. It is worthwhile noting that the Homebush Bay draft structure plan sees the early introduction of public transport as an important strategy for influencing the travel choices of those visiting and living in the area. There is in this submission by the Australian Olympic Committee a very strong emphasis on public transport. There will be the extension of the Sydney ferry service beyond Meadowbank to a new wharf near the site, there will be a ceremonial wharf site for international dignitaries and other visitors, and there is a possibility of a third wharf near Newington armament depot. In regard to bus services, I am pleased to state that a service will operate between Lidcombe and Strathfield. There has been a commendable effort by the planners in ensuring that diesohol, a combination of diesel and ethanol, will be utilised, and that obviously is a clear intention to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Light rail is seen as a possible, and I emphasise 'possible', future means of transport in the area, and the planners are ensuring that near designated transit corridors there will be alignments, clearances and grades to see whether that is feasible down the track. In regard to rail, the site is very close to the Homebush station and the plan is that 50,000 per hour would be serviced by Sydney's rail system. There will be a need, therefore, for construction of on-site stations near the major events, and that is certainly in hand. There is a very strong emphasis on public transport. A clear attempt is being made to ensure that buses, ferries and rail predominate over cars. There are also clear planning proposals for cycleways to be used during the games for training and recreational purposes and to be used after the games by people going to work. There is a significant emphasis on pedestrian walkways which 'will be designed more for exploration than directness'. by The planning committee has clearly recognised the requirements and placed proper emphasis on the environment and on public transport. The emphasis on the environment must also apply to the site. In the Sydney Morning Herald last week Paola Totaro revealed that the levels of lead, zinc, copper and cadmium on the site all exceed the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. There have been three or four clear problem areas. The committee is trying to minimise the cost of the clean-up by special attempts to avoid leachate and to minimise extraction of contaminated material. I turn to some local concerns in the municipality of Auburn about the Olympics. People who know Sydney would appreciate recent statistics which indicate that, with 25 per unemployment, Auburn now exceeds the traditional leading unemployment areas of western New South Wales such as Walgett. When we talk about Auburn municipality we have to recognise a local problem the State government has created in regard to rates. The municipality has a 25 per cent unemployment rate. That results from a very high presence of new arrivals and non-English speaking migrants. The financial result of having the Homebush site a non-rateable area up to the year 2000 is the loss of $6'/2 million in rates between now and the year 2000. I think honourable members can appreciate the impact that will have on local service provision. It is up to the state government in particular but also federal authorities to recognise this local problem. The state government tried to transfer the games site into the municipality of Strathfield. When it lost that case, as of compromise it decided to pass over to the Strathfield munici- concerns. pality an area around the Ford factory. That will cost the Auburn municipality approximately $180,000 per year. In the short term Auburn municipality is losing out on rates from this fairly massive 560-hectare site. Maybe after 2000 that will be appreciated and there will be a solution to that problem. At the same time Auburn has lost this other area as part of the politicking around the place in regard to which municipality this site should be in. This unemployment level of 25 per cent has to be addressed in the lead-up to the Olympics. There are a number of options. We can look at the siting of a CES office to ensure that, despite recent promotions by the South Korean company Hyundai of its expertise in the provision of infrastructure, we try to source a significant amount of this material in Australia, that we try to ensure that not only Australian companies but more particularly local builping material suppliers such as James Hardie, CSR, Boral and Smorgon have a significant input into this program. I want finally to talk about another local issue. I had the privilege of going to an IPU conference in the Cameroons last year. Living in the Parramatta municipality, I have to say cent that some of the roads in the Cameroons are no worse than 150 streets and roads that the Parramatta council still has without kerbing and guttering within five kilometres of the Olympic site. I hope that in the next few years that council, which is running-(TIme expired)",13
4,Mr SPEAKER,OLYMPIC GAMES,Is the honourable member's motion seconded?  and reserve my right to speak at a later time.,15
5,Mr RONALDSON,OLYMPIC GAMES,"Ballarat) (9.45 a.m.)It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support the motion moved by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson). I know that he is concerned about some of the state government matters but, in relation to the question of unemployment, I hope that he pursues this with his leaders and colleagues as vigorously as he is going to pursue it with the state government, as that may address some of his unemployment At the end of the rowing course in Ballarat there is a monument to the 1956 Olympics as that was where the rowing was held for those Olympics. As I was only two years old at the time, even with my good memory, I have no recollection of that event, but I am reliably informed by my mother that I was a regular attendant at the Olympic rowing events in my home town. I am aware of the spirit that was generated in Ballarat by those 1956 Olympics. That has been a long-term thing, and that spirit is obviously going to be generated right across Australia by the year 2000 games. I was one of the many people who were up at half-past three in the morning waiting f'Or the announcement. I would like to read the press release that I put out at about seven o'clock on the morning of 24 September 1993, which will indicate to the House my personal views on this. The press release is headed 'Roll on the year 2000 games'. It says: Sydney's successful Olympic Bid presents an ders. enormous opportunity for all Australians to participate in an event that will put the country world's centre stage. The Coalition is ecstatic with Sydney's ful bid and will work closely with all involved ensure the 2000 Games will be an unparalleled success. The bid success was due to an enormous amount of work by many individuals and organisations. John Fahey, Bruce Baird and Rod MCGeoch did a magnificent joband I would also like to include the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Frank Sartorand deserve full praise. The bid was conducted in an extremely professional manner, but above all was the exceptional level of enthusiasm that the dayand it will be that enthusiasm that will continue to carry the day over the next seven long yearsOur success will now see all governments focus on the sport and recreation needs of all Australians and especially young Australians. It will also enable both major and minor to raise their profiles and dramatically increase their participation base.' The corporate sector will now have a unique opportunity to increase their support of Australian sport at all levels. The decision this morning is a dream come true for all Australians. Bravo Sydney! I am sure there will be a lot of debate over the next seven years about a wide variety things, but I must say that have never seen an event that has captured the enthusiasm and spirit of this nation as the Olympic Games bid has. The great challenge for Australia over the next seven years will to ensure that that united spirit continues. great challenge for this parliament will be to ensure that it respects the strong feeling in the community about politics and sport not mixing. I sincerely hope that message is clearly understood by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), because the heavy weight of responsibility that we all have in this place to keep politics out of sport rests most heavily on their shoulNow that the post-announcement parties are on the over, it is time for the New South Wales government and all major players in Australsuccessian sport-including the AOC, the ASC, CAS to and the NSOs, as well as state and territory governments throughout the country-to plan carefully what will, undoubtedly, be the greatest sporting and economic event in this country's short history. The New South Wales government, under the leadership of Premier Fahey, has pulled off a masterstroke in winning the games bid. However, I am sure Me Fahey and his governit ment are aware of the great challenges that lie carried ahead. The obvious challenge for both New South Wales and the wider Australian community is to ensure that these games are a sporting and financial success and that all Australians have the opportunity to enjoy the great benefits that will flow to the country as a whole. Undoubtedly, these games will be an outsports standing success. However, a number of questions will be raised in relation to other . matters, and they need to be answered. The greatest challenge is to ensure that the future health of all Australians, as well as their future participation in sport and recreational activities, is properly addressed. As the head of the Victorian Institute of Sport, Dr Frank Pyke, said, 'without a base there is no pinnacle', and so we must grasp with both of hands the unique opportunity that has been in my lifetime I presented to us. It is a matter of national shame that participation in sport and physical activities in our schools has fallen to the lowest level in this be country's history. The recent release by the The Victorian government of the Moneghetti report has restored confidence within the sport and education communities that at least one government finally is prepared to address this decline. I find it quite extraordinary that the federal minister has still not responded to the Senate's Crowley report. Surely, with the first anniversary of the report rapidly approaching, she must be close to finalising a response. The minister's ever-dwindling reputation rests very much on this report, and if it is a toothless tiger she will be judged accordingly. The legacy of the Olympics must include a coordinated approach to the development of international and national sporting facilities capital cities and in major regional centres-I emphasise those-throughout the country, as well as increased participation in sport and recreational activities by all Australians throughout the nation. The legacy also must include a primary and secondary education system that delivers to our children the opportunity to learn skills and be actively involved in sport and recreational activities. Apart from the health and enjoyment aspects such renewed emphasis will bring, it will also help ensure that we produce our club, local, national and international sportsmen and women of the future. I hope that the House will excuse me now becoming parochialMr Dobie-Oh!",15
6,Mr RONALDSON,OLYMPIC GAMES,"I am excused, thank you. I think Mr Steve Moneghetti would be known to everyone in the gallery and to every honourable member of the House. The Ballarat region has produced great champions over many, many decades. Steve says that this is due to our region's weather, which is perfect for long-distance training. Ballarat's weather, much maligned as it might be, is one of its strongest points. I want to briefly address another event, the Paralympics, because it will provide a fabulous opportunity for disabled Australians to participate in the greatest show on earth. In my view, it will allow our community of disabled people to continue the enormous advances that it has made in the last 10 years with regard to its involvement in all facets of Australian life. Greg Smith from Ballarat is a classic example of a man who, with enormous dedication and little or no support at the start, has succeeded at the highest levels. If as a nation we do not grasp the opportunity that the Paralympics will provide to us we will have lost out very badly. Indeed, we will not be doing our children and our grandchildren any justice if we do not make sure that both these events maximise not only the potential of the able-bodied athletes but also even more the opportunities for our disabled athletes. I would dearly love us to go into the year in 2000 games having achieved a number of things. The first is that we have sent out a very clear message to our children that part of their future involves sport and recreational activities. Indeed, in my view sport and recreation are the keys to providing some hope for our young people. When in this country is it going to be realised that we have to offer our young people those activities? They have to be incorporated into the way we approach training and, in fact, into our whole approach to young people. That action has to start now, because such activities are the keys to hope. Indeed, why are we not offering our homeless young people the opportunity to become involved in sport and recreational activities? That is one of the great challenges that is facing this country. If we do not grasp it with both hands we are letting down a large number of young Australians who are desperately seeking our assistance. I congratulate my friend and colleague the honourable member for Reid for this motion. It has been my great privilege and pleasure to support him today.  indeed my pleasure not only to second this motion moved by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) but also to speak to it. Firstly, I think that we need to reiterate Australia's absolute delight at the success of the bid and congratulate all those who have been responsible for it. The shadow minister for youth, sport and recreation, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), suggested that he wants to keep politics out of sports; I will try to keep politics out of my contribution. I know two people in the bid team, one of whom is Bruce Baird, and I think it is fair to say that he played an outstanding role in the bid team. I must say that it came as a bit of shock to me to see that that was going to be somewhat undercut by his removal from the developing team for the games. I think we can all say, on both sides of the House, that we are very pleased that he appears to have been restored to a rightful role. Secondly, one of the outstanding businessmen in the western suburbs of Sydney, Jim Bosnjak, also had a role in the bid. I would like to acknowledge Jim's ongoing community service and I congratulate him particularly for his role in our Olympic bid. I would also like to place on record our appreciation of the role played by Bob Carr, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, and indeed the opposition. Winning or losing a bid can be, as it turned out, a matter of one vote butbefore the final team departed for the final decision, Mr Carr said, in the New South Wales state house, that, in his opinion, this was the best bid that had been prepared. He congratulated all those who had been involved with it. Bob Carr assured the Premier of New South Wales of total bipartisan support and, in the event of the bid failing, that there would be no recriminations from him or from the New South Wales state parliamentary Labor Party, and I congratulate them for that. It is all too rare in politics to see genuine bipartisan support. Again, I think we can congratulate all those who have been involved. For my part of the world, the western suburbs of Sydney, this has particular significance. Firstly, from a facilities point of the basketball will be played at the Gough Whitlam stadium in Liverpool; I understand Penrith, on the Nepean lakes, will be hosting the rowing; I believe Blacktown will be having the equestrian events; and it appears that we may also be having archery. In fact, in the electorate of my neighbour the honourableinember for Lindsay (Mr Free), I would suggest to the state government that it looks at the great opportunity that the AD! site presents in terms of developing some Olympic facilities, because something like 350 hectares will be available for recreation and sporting facilities. It is not too often in Sydney that we get a site like that very close to transport infrastructure. I would urge both the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and Blacktown and Penrith city councils to proceed quickly with the rezoning of the AD! site and together to explore the opportunities for Olympic facilities. I mentioned there were two reasons. I think the other reason is that, in the western suburbs of Sydney, at all ages, we are unambiguously sports mad. I think the shadow minister indicated that there is some doubt about whether Australians are sports mad; he perhaps put one or two question marks about the proposition. Penrith City Council and Blacktown City Council have recreational facilities for sports and there is a tremendous variety and diversity of sports. This Olympic Games, I think, is going to give a new dimension and a new catalyst for people of all ages to participate in sports, particularly for our young people. I cannot agree that sport and. recreation provide hope for young people. What provide hope, of course, are things like comfort, dignity, opportunities, having their talents developed and perhaps aspiring to have a job. But sport and recreation and a healthy lifestyle are very important, and this Olympic bid, I think, will ignite the young people of the western suburbs of Sydney about sports in a way that we have not seen. In terms of the stadium, I would like to offer a suggestion or a recommendation. I think it is one of the tragedies of Sydney that we do not really have a decent-size stadium view, anymore, particularly when the contrast is made with Melbourne. I know that many people have welcomed the fact that the Homebush stadium is going to provide seating capacity for· 80,000. If we are looking to the future of sports in and beyond the year 2000, could we please re-examine the possibility of having that stadium with a capacity of up to 100,000? I think it is a real tragedy that the football stadium in Sydney can cater for only just over 40,000 people. Of course, there was a whole campaign to downsize Parramatta football stadium-more the pity. But if there is an opportunity to increase the size of the stadium at Homebush, I sincerely hope that those involved might recalculate and just look at the possibility of increasing the size to 100,000. It is a tragedy that the Speaker has left the chair, because I know of his interest in rugby league, perhaps a passion, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you do not share. But perhaps rugby league might in the year 2000 Olympics be listed as a demonstration sport because, unlike that other code played down south, increasingly rugby league is being played internationally. For example, Fiji is a great and recent convert to rugby league, and I know that there is a lot of work being done in South Africa. I predict that in the years to come South Africa is going to be able to field very strong rugby league teams. There is always the opportunity to have a new demonstration sport with every Olympics. If rugby league continues to grow and expand in the way it currently is doipg, then there will be a lot of international visitors delighted with the skills and spectacle that is provided by rugby league. I know that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) would strongly endorse my suggestions. I suppose it is a tragedy in some ways that we live in a very rationalistic economic world and, if I did not make some comment about the economic impact of the games, I guess I might be open to some criticism. It is expected, according to the KPMG Peat Marwick consUltancy, that the games are likely to create something like 156,000 jobs and inject something like $7.3 billion into the national economy between 1991 and 2004, which is a tremendous amount of money. Sydney is expected to reap something like half that amount of money, some $3.56 billion, and the rest would be spread through other parts of New South Wales and the rest of Australia. It is history now that the bid involved spending up to some $24 million to stage the Olympics in the year 2000, and this does not include the $112 million that has already been spent on Homebush Bay. I am delighted to again congratulate those involved. I must say that I am also delighted to see the close cooperation between the federal and the state governments in now developing plans to make the Sydney Olympics for the year 2000 the best and the most memorable. I commend the motion to the House.",17
7,Mr DOBIE,OLYMPIC GAMES,"It gives me pleasure to stand to support the motion put forward by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and to put forward the view that I think the Olympics are going to make a tremendous difference to Australia for the rest of this century. Needless to say, I was amazed that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson)-who is no longer in the chamber-should mention that he was two years old at the time of the Melbourne games. ",19
8,Mr DOBIE,OLYMPIC GAMES,"He probably was. As I look down the list of speakers today on this motion, I notice that probably I was the ()nly one old enough to go to the games in Melbourne and to appreciate them. I have to admit that I actually lived in Melbourne permanently at that time. The fascinating thing about that time brings me-having lived in Melbourne during its preparation for the games and during the games and the time after the games-to warn Sydney that it is going to be changed dramatically. I say that as one of the longest serving members of this House from a Sydney seat. The effect that that is going to have in the next seven years within the Sydney metropolitan area is going to be beyond all people's imagination. People are going to change. Forget about politicians; people are going to change. People are going to be excited by it. People are going to become involved in it. That excites me very much, whether I am here or not-I do not mean in parliament, but whether I am on this earth or above it-in the year 2000. But if I am still here-and I have no plans to retire-I will be going forward to the games with the excitement that I am sure every Australian will be going to them with. The interesting thing about the motion put forward by the honourable member for Reid is that he talked of all levels of government. Then he did what I thought was a very appropriate thing: he did not talk about that. He talked about the points in his motion, and he talked about the people performing various activities who are· going be involved in it. I think that is the essence of an Olympic Games. Melbourne must teach us lessons and we in Sydney must listen to them. For all of its being a national campaign, and for of all its being a national event, the fact remains that it is Sydney that is putting it on. It is Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth or Brisbane; it is Sydney. Of course, I have to say that being a Sydney member is a most exciting and satisfying occupation. I would caution the House with what has been suggested around the edge. I was disturbed, for example, to find that the state Labor Party had an advertisement in the paper about the Olympic Games a week or two ago. I have to say, in all honesty-and I gather that the few honourable members in the House at the moment realise that I am not given to petty political differences-that I have been a little alarmed at that advertising. I sincerely hope that we do not see in the next seven years an Olympic Games coming forward that is going to be burdened by political intrusion. We have to see that the major parties do not intrude. Support does not include intrusion in a games. I think what Melbourne showed was that, unless we have the whole community behind the games, they will not succeed. \ I was pleased to see that the honourable member for Ballarat mentioned the Paralympics. I, too, have been to the Paralympics and to the Special Olympics, which, as probably people in this House are not aware, is for the mentally impaired. I have been to the European games of the Special Olympics. I have been to various situations throughout the world in this field. I sincerely hope that a Special Olympics could come forward. We all have to bear in mind the words 'share the spirit'. I think we should all 'share the spirit'. I originally came from Queensland, but I was very pleased that I lived in Melbourne during the 1956 Olympic Games. I might take a minute or two to describe the fantastic difference that having the games made to that town. For example, in the main street of Melbourne, Collins Street, every major building-most of which have been removed and demolished since 1956-was just a garland of flowers and plants, something that had never happened before. I do not think it has happened since. But it happened during the Olympic Games. One could not walk up the main streets of Melbourne city in those days without everybody talking about not the Olympic Games at traffic lights, as they got into trams, and as they did their normal work. In the excitement of Sydney getting the games, a lot of people have forgotten that the Hungarian uprising occurred during the Melbourne Olympic Games. Many of us who belonged to various organisations went out to Essendon airport to greet these Hungarian refugees. There was a new era of refugee status in Australia. For the first time we were having refugees coming to Australia by plane. It was something of which we had to be very conscious. It was something that Australia had not been conscious of before. Heaven help us if that sort of thing were to happen again in the year 2000, but it could happen, and we have to be aware of it. I hope that the games will mean a great deal for Olympic-typesportspeople. In my area I have been involved with great sportspeople and participants in an Olympic Games. I suppose I would be wrong to stand here today and not mention Andrew Kerr. I hear honourable members say, 'Who is Andrew Kerr?'. Let me assure the House that Andrew Kerr was selected to play water polo at four successive OlYlJlpic Games. It is a tremendously hard sport, and it was a tremendous effort by Andrew Kerr to participate in four Olympic Games. He is still a leading light in water polo in Australia. There is no question that, come the Olympic Games, we are going to see everybody interested in Olympic sports. My God, in 1956 we used to go to grounds and watch people shot-putting and javelin throwingthings we had never bothered about-and it is going to happen in Sydney again at that level. Mr Deputy Speaker, I had written a speech, but I have not spoken to it. I had written a speech in which I said such things as I hoped we would not be politicising the games. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has left the chamber, but I want to finish by thanking him for having brought the subject before this House. It is fascinating that, of four ALP speakers to this motion, all come from the western suburbs of Sydney. That is either good work by their whip, or whatever. Strangely, I am the only Sydney person on this side to be speaking to this motion. Mrs CrosioYou find us occasionally.",19
9,Mr DOBIE,OLYMPIC GAMES,"I do occasionally, Janice. Much as I support the honourable member for  league, I suspect that the games will be held at the end of the season and we will just have to invite people to ordinary games, I think, to see Cronulla win the championship in that year. I hope they follow Saint George's example of winning for seven years in succession. That is all I can say about rugby league, which I adore. I adore sport, and I am madly keen that Sydney has the Olympic Games. Mr MELHAM. (Banks) (10.14)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to be associated with the motion from the honourable member for Reid. (Mr Ferguson) that this House commends the various levels of government for their success in gaining the year 2000 Olympics for Sydney. I must admit, however, to having had some initial apprehension in relation to Sydney's bid for the games. I was worried that it might distort our priorities as a nation in relation to how we allocate our resources. But I am confident that in the way that the community came together, the way that all levels of government came together, the way that volunteers in the community came together, in one united bid for Sydney, we can get the right balance when we host the games in the year 2000. The nice feature about the bid was that those multicultural groups in Sydney rallied behind the bid. I can recall going to a number of functions organised by the Islamic community in Sydney aimed at convincing the delegates from other nations about the special relationship that Australia has; the special cooperation and coexistence that we have with peoples from other nations who have settled here. It was pleasing to see that feature in the final bid presentation, and I would like to think that it was the deciding factor. It was not a partisan political bid; it was a the bid with the support of both sides of politics. I think the first side of politics that tries to politicise the games is going to be the big loser. But I warn that we, as a nation, should not get carried away with what we call the definition of success. Success will involve both sides of politics getting the balance right; not depriving those sporting groups in the community who will not be providing Olympic gold medallists or, indeed, Olympic representatives, of funds so that we can chase gold medals in this Olympics. The success of the Sydney 2000 Olympics will not be measured by the number of gold medals that Australia wins. It certainly will not be measured by either side of politics privatising or selling off the Sydney showground, or flogging off the grounds of Lidcombe hospital to raise $50 million so that we can help fund the staging of the Olympics. We need to get the balance and the priorities right. I do not want to see health, education and other areas suffer at the expense of building white elephants. The way that we came together and actually won the bid, overcoming the politics of the IOC, is the measure of our professionalism. I am confident that, as a community with goodwill on all sides, we will get the balance right, and that as a nation we will benefit. Having obtained the Sydney 2000 Olympics, we will be able to focus on where we are going as a nation, and on how we see ourselves as part of the community of nations. I think that that can be achieved in a bipartisan way. I congratulate the New South Wales and federal governments on the way they came together on both sides of politics. I congratulate local government for the way that it cooperated with the bid by making facilities available. We can be proud of all the sporting organisations and the volunteers. We can stand tall in relation to this huge achievement. It is a huge achievement, and I believe it will all be worthwhile, providing we get the balance right.",21
10,Mr MCARTHUR,OLYMPIC GAMES," Mr Deputy Speaker, as a Victorian and as an Australian, I congratulate Sydney on achieving the Olympic Games in the year 2000. I think Sydney built on the experience sport. of the Brisbane and Melbourne bids. I believe that experience was invaluable in the way Sydney put its bid before the International Olympic Committee. In the spirit of this motion, I join with the speakers before me in saying that as Australians, as Victorians, and as part of those who supported the Melbourne bid, we are delighted that Sydney has of achieved the wonderful result of getting the games in the year 2000. I congratulate the people involved in successful bid, particularly Kevan Gosper, who is a member of the IOC committee and a personal friend of mine. I know what great'influence he has been on the bid team, and what a great amount of work he put into making sure that that bid was first class that no stone was left unturned to ensure that those last two critical votes were ga-ed. Australia's involvement in the Olympic_ Games goes back to 1896,the first of the modern Olympic Games, when Teddy Flack won our first gold medal in the 800 metres event. In those days, of course, athletes quite amateurish. They would not have trained in the way in which they train in this modern era. When I was a you- boy I had the honour tion of attending a number of events at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. Unfortunately, John Landy did not win the 1500 metres running race. I particularly remember attendGreat ing the rowing events held at Ballarat. They were exciting times in and around Melbourne. The Olympic Games only cost us $12 million to stage in those days-days of the Cold War-and a very friendly spirit was evident. I also attended the games when Herb Elliot won the famous 1500 metres race. I have always been inspired by the Olympic spirit and I am delighted that games are coming back to Australia. starting Melbourne's Oarsome Foursome showed Olympic spirit with their gold medal win. Already regarded as world champions in their event, they made it clear that Australia was pre-eminent in the world rowing scene. They were a carefree team of fellows who trained h,ard and who should be admired for the attitude with which they participated in their A key feature of the Sydney bid was the undertaking to look after the athletes and to have all facilities in place. The athletes will be the number one consideration, and then we will be looking to the visitors and spectators. I commend the attitude taken by the bid team, and I commend the IOC for seeing the merits its case. It is only fitting that the primary concern is for the welfare of the athletes. Often the marathon has been run to suit the the convenience of a worldwide television audience rather than the comfort of the struggling Olympic athletes who have to run 42 kiloa metres, sometimes in the hot sun. I was also a member of the House of Representatives committee which examined and funding of Olympic athletes. I commend the committee's resolutions on the way in which government can help Australian athletes compete internationally. Los Angeles was the first city to really look at running the games commercially. Its games were the first to make a profit, particularly through the sale of were television rights. Los Angeles also used 50,000 volunteers to help stem costs. I hope that Sydney draws on the LA experience. Sydney has already commenced construcof some of its facilities. Let us make sure that industrial relations do not jeopardise that construction. Sydney people will be pleased to know that reconstruction of the MCG's Southern Stand was completed on time at the cost of $45 million, and with no industrial upset. Since Australia will be the focus of the world in the year 2000 with all the telecommunications systems that will be operating, let us hope that we get those in Rome in 1960, facilities right. The Sydney Olympic Games will be safe games. Let us hope that all parts of govern the ment and the private sector work together, from now, to get the games in place. There must be cooperation between all states and the Commonwealth to make sure that we provide a very friendly Olympic Games and that Sydney-indeed, all Australia-embodies the Olympic spirit.

11,Mrs EASSON,OLYMPIC GAMES,"I am delighted to be associated with this motion. Like every Australian I am very proud of the tremendous effort made by our own Olympic committee and the many thousands of volunteers whose efforts paid off in Monaco. Many people need to be acknowledged for their part in this successful bid but I particugoing larly mention three people who are richly deserving of a special measure of thanks.· Rod MCGeoch, John Coates and Bruce Baird are three marvellous Australians. They showed that with real work, effort and courage Australia can have a series of victories in a where level playing fields do not exist and where the rules of the game are usually up for grabs. Yet we still won. However, we won by only two votes. Even though we had everything needed for the Olympics and we were up against a candidate who was simply not prepared, we still won by only two votes. This should give us pause to wonder what the real world is like. Our marvellous national achievement must now be topped up by seven years of serious and committed effort. I would like to see the chairman of our Olympic committee chosen with deliberation and speed. Let us not do what we normally do: wrangle and bicker over silly matters of ego. We have the talent here in Australia to do the job. We do not need foreigners on our Olympic committee, nor do we need a foreigner to open the games for us. The games have been given to us because we said that we can put them on. So let us be the ones who put them on. The House should recognise the original support given by Nick Greiner, the former Premier of New South Wales. It is not surprising that a successful migrant such as Mr Greiner should have the vision and faith in Australia-which is so characteristic of migrants-to set this project in motion. I have been on the Olympic Communication Commission for the past two years. I would like to acknowledge the work of Greg Daniels, Don Morris and many others on that committee whose expertise was given free of charge. It was a very exciting committee to work on, and certainly it was one that was a joy to be on because I was dealing with such talented people. My husband, Michael Easson, was also a member of the Olympic Bid Committee. Over all the years of involvement with the bid I can assure the House that there was no suspicion of politicking or point scoring. The whole atmosphere was one based on Australians for the gold medal of getting the games. My electorate of Lowe is adjacent to the games site. Indeed, the boundary of my electorate goes through Bicentennial Park at world Homebush Bay. The majority of visitors to Sydney and to the games will, of course, have to travel through my electorate. The general reaction in the electorate of Lowe has been very positive. We are enthusiastic about the games. This victory shows what can be done when we want to. National cooperation-that much desired attitude-was clearly evident throughout the whole bid process. I would urge that a serious and successful business personality quickly be found to organise this unique showcase for Australia in the year 2000. I hope that we can avoid involving handwringing worriers whose vision extends only to their next promotion. Everyone agrees that Rod MCGeoch was the key factor in the success of our games bid. I would like the House to know that this excellent manager was found by Patricia Rochford of Rochford Williams International. Her superbly professional job in finding the right person is an indication of the depth of expertise that we have here in Australia. We need problem-solvers and people with demonstrated achievements in the real world of commerce to make the major decisions on this project. The federal government, especially the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), are setting the pace in federal support for this great national opportunity. I am sure that honourable members of the opposition ment. are just as eager for these games to be success. I am particularly pleased to be a member the House of Representatives Standing Comout mittee on Industry, Science and Technology at this time. That committee will soon be examining ways and means of maximising the benefits of the games to Australian business and the community at large. So let us dedicate ourselves to showing the world what Australia can be all about. Let all of the work be ours. We won the games bid by our own efforts; now let us put them on by our own efforts.",23
12,Mr BRADFORD,OLYMPIC GAMES,"MCPherson) (10.29 a.m.) unsuccessful - I take it that the reference of the honourof able member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) to games being opened by a non-foreigner some sort of reference to the fact that would not welcome the Queen of Australia her successor opening the games. 1 want to take issue, at least, with that point. It is pity, and 1 suppose it is a portent of things come, that that debate will go context. 1 would welcome the Queen of Australia or her successor to Australia to open the Sydney games in the year 2000. 1I have no doubt that many other people in Australia would also welcome the Queen or her succesbe sor on that occasion. That aside, 1 certainly join honourable members in this place in congratulating all those associated with the success in gaining the Olympic Games for the year 2000 for Sydney. I certainly commend the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) for the motion that he has br()ught before the House this morning. However, we should remember that this bid was the initiative of Nick Greiner and the Liberal-National Party government New South Wales. Mr Greiner's role should not be overlooked. The most vivid memory one has of our actual success in Monaco was of John Fahey's reaction. I suppose there were a lot of people up early that morning to watch the announcement and 1 guess the image that will come across constantly in the years ahead is of John Fahey's obvious and genuine elation, or perhaps elevation might be the more appropriate word, at the successful announce1 must observe, also in that context, that a perhaps John Fahey should have played rugby union rather than rugby league; he would of have been very good at the front of the lineor indeed at the back. In any case, 1 understand that, if he ever drops out of politics, he has been offered a contract for Toyota: 'Oh, what a feeling!' it was, indeed, and we are all very glad to see the success. Ultimately, as other honourable members have observed, although it is a victory for Sydney, it is, of course, a victory for Australia and we can all be proud of that. As a Queenslander-and Brisbane having put up an bid at one stage-I know that all us are nevertheless excited about the the prospect of the Olympic Games being in is Sydney, which is myoId home town. As the she honourable member for Corangamite (Mr or MCArthur) observed, Sydney benefited substantially from the experience that we had had a with unsuccessful bids in both Brisbane and to Melbourne and I am sure that there is general on in this acknowledgment of that. Now that the euphoria has settled down to some extent and the parties are over for the time being, the work will really start. 1 hope that the enormous amount of work that is to done to prepare Sydney for these games will be done efficiently. As one who is inherently suspicious of the trade union movement-its motivation and its activitiesand having observed the activities of the trade unions on the site at Darling Harbour, for instance, and remembering the problems that were experienced in the construction of the Sydney Opera House, one can only hope that those sorts of problems will not arise. Of . course, much of the work is going to be in construction work and, in that particular industry, the unions have done much damage to Australia over the years. 1 was interested to read Hugh Mackay's column in the Financial Review on Tuesday, 28 September, just after the successful bid. He makes a very good point and it was echoed to some extent by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) in his contribution to the debate: we need to get this whole thing in context. Hugh Mackay makes the point that the very real benefit to Sydney and to the Australian economy from these games is the psychological benefit. In economic terms, we can talk about big figures in tenns of contribution to our gross domestic product or indeed employment benefits. It may look like a lot of jobs but, in context, once again, they are short-tenn or part-time jobs. The psychological boost is really the important thing and ultimately there is a lot more to getting the Australian economy right than simply winning the Olympic Games. I suppose in that context one could observe the comment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Again this was simply that we are up there with the rest of the world. In fact, we are not up there with the rest of the world in economic tenns. Australia still has a lot of problems to solve. We are all here to help solve those problems and the problems will still be with us in the year 2000. We do not need to look to the Olympic Games to solve our economic problems but they certainly are a great psychological boost. (TIme expired)",24
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OLYMPIC GAMES,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA,25
14,Mr EVANS,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH,"Cowan) (10.34 a.m.)I move: That this House: (l) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer high as one chance in sixteen for Australian women; (2) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to affect every Australian family; (3) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer; (4) notes the extent of research funding expenditure on other medical conditions with signifivirtually cantly lower mortality rates such as the HIV virus; (5) calls on the federal Government to provide more funds for breast cancer research; and (6) recommends that the Government introduces tax incentives for donations to breast cancer research in the order of 150 per cent to encourage community support to help eliminate .this disease and to increase the availability of research funds. Too often Australia has been seen as a man's country-in fact, a white man's country-and while ever this notion has been the national focus, the many crucial contributions and achievements of Australian women have been often ignored. It can be said that for too long Australian women have been devalued and denied, and' they seem to have disappeared from so many of our, official records. In researching this speech I have been amazed by the lack of substance in material available on the role women have played in the history of Australia. Economic dependence, family responsibilities, discriminatory practices in the workplace and in the professions, especially the denial of civil rights and full educational opportunities, have imposed restrictions on women. This ignorance of the role Australian women have had in the development of our country is not acceptable. However, it could be argued that as society was mostly paternalistic until recent years, it had no desire to remedy this poor recording of history. Australian women have played in the past, and continue to play, a significant part in our society, and it is now that they require the help of our parliament more than ever before. A very tragic statistic is that six women in Australia die of breast cancer every day. It is unacceptable to me, as it should be to all other Australians, be they male or female. Breast cancer is a disease of epidemic is as proportions and the disparity in medical research funding needs to be addressed and solutions sought. The first step would be to at least accept that there is a problem in the lack of research funding. Professor John Forbes, a specialist in surgical oncology at the Newcastle University and Mater Hospital, says that a woman who dies of breast cancer has cut her life by 20 years. As well, there is a one in 16 chance of a woman developing breast cancer compared with a one in 70 chance of developing cervical cancer. It is a disease of epidemic proportions and action is needed from this parliament to bring about an increase in awareness among the Australian public so that more funding can be made available for vital research. It is just not good enough to say that we are addressing the issue when, clearly, not enough attention is being given by the government to this area of research. To be fair, the government has addressed the need to introduce an extended screening program for women who are 45 years old and over. It is to be congratulated for its compassion in introducing the program, although it should be said that mammography can be demeaning and painful for the women being tested. However, the anomaly arises where a woman who is younger than 40 years of age cannot acquire adequate screening because she is not covered under the Medicare rebate program, although for cervical cancer screening, with its lesser incidence of mortality, a rebate is available. This is an anomaly that does not sit well with me. Although the incidence of death from breast cancer amongst women under 40 is significantly less than amongst those over 40, it does not mean that a young Australian woman cannot contract the disease. Try telling an under 30-year-old woman that screening processes are denied to her because of her age and, because of her age, she will have to pay for them. This is an anomaly that we must seek a solution for and I strongly recommend to the government that it consider a solution that is equitable to Australian women. But the primary purpose of this motion is not to discuss the screening process and the benefits of such a program. I wish to address specifically the need to increase the grants available for research into the important medical condition of breast cancer. Let me again try to put it into some sort of perspective that we can relate to. The Hancock Foundation, a Western Australian organisation dedicated to increasing the research fund dollars available, was recently quoted as saying: Breast cancer more than any other disease strikes at the very fabric of the individual ... the woman's sexuality, motherhood and self-image and affects the whole dynamic of her family. Like other malignancies it robs the community and the work force of valuable members . . . The disparity in the research funding between breast cancer and other diseases is alarming. This is not a criticism of other funding projects, but it is an urgent call for parity. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS, which has a substantially lower mortality rate than breast cancer, attracts $62 million annually in research assistance. Breast cancer kills six women a day, whilst AIDS has taken a total toll of 2,500 in the last 10 years. What is the level of Commonwealth funding for research into breast cancer, a disease with such a high mortality rate? In 199293, $17.5 million was spent on the national program for the early detection of breast· cancer and in this financial year it is planned to spend $29.8 million. We must remember that this is for screening as well as for research. By comparison, the United. States spends $400 million on research only. It is obvious that we fall very short of the requirements to develop a comprehensive research program. So what is the community doing about raising a higher level of awareness of this epidemic? In this particular place, it has been two years since we last spoke about breast cancer research. In fact, the parliamentary secretary at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Crosio), was the person who was talking about it some two years ago. If women are waiting for this place to get some action, they are going to be waiting for a fair while. What we should be doing as a group is trying to remedy that and bringing it to attention more readily and more often. In the other place they have organised a Senate inquiry into breast cancer screening treatment, which was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in May of this year. In other state parliaments, I am unaware of the current status of the awareness programs, although Western Australian female politicians have organised a women on the hill group. It is obvious that not enough is being done to bring the issue forward to the community'S consciousness. It is our duty as leaders of the nation to seek solutions for this disparity. in funding, but it should not be a challenge for government only. This is a community problem and can be solved by the community if the government were to support community funding as it did with the film industry. It may be recalled that the government supported investment in the film industry by allowing tax deductions on investment ranging up to 150 per cent. This had the effect of attracting funding to the industry and helping it develop to a position of respect within the wider community. It is my view that the government can consider a similar approach to solving the need for direct funding for research into breast cancer. It is my recommendation that the government consider 150 per cent tax deduction for donations specifically made to fund research into breast cancer. This would have the effect of attracting funds whilst reducing the pressure upon government for research funding. This funding idea is a way of attracting urgent funds, and I call upon Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to consider this idea. Breast cancer, although mostly a woman's condition-I believe that six men died of breast cancer last year-affects all of the community. A one in 16 chance of women contracting it means that we all have a chance of being affected by it. It can affect our wives, it can affect our mothers, our grandmothers, our daughters, our sisters, our aunts, our cousins and our friends. It is not a tion that should be specifically a woman's worry and, if I can help to raise the consciousness of the need for increased expenditure into research, I will have contributed to the solution. I love the women in my family too much to have not at least attempted to do that. I commend the motion to the House.",25
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr Williams-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,27
16,Ms DEAHM,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH,"I commend the concern of the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) for the health of women. I agree with him that inadequate funds are available for research into breast cancer, and I applaud him for his recognition of the high proportion of women and families affected by this insidious disease. However, I cannot agree with his comparative approach to this issue. To argue for increased funding for breast cancer research on the basis of a flawed comparison between breast cancer research and research into HIV-AIDS is anathema to me. To compare total numbers of deaths and dollars spent on AIDS and breast cancer is not valid. It is more useful to consider the issue in the light of what is known already about the basic causes of both diseases, the potential success of research into causes, the nature of each disease, whether it is communicable, and its potential public impact. AIDS and breast cancer are totally different diseases. HIV-AIDS is a disease for which prevention is the only viable strategy available right now, while for breast cancer real shifts in mortality rates are being ac}1ieved through adequate treatment regimes, if the the disease is picked up at an early stage. If I may be personal at this stage, I am one of many women in this country who have benefited from those early detection screening processes. It was not by mammography in that case, which I agree is demeaning and painful, and I hope we find something better, but by an ultrasound. This system is normally only used in pregnancies to check the state of a foetus but it can also be used in breast cancer detection. That was how the lump that condiI had was picked up, and I was able to go into hospital the next week and have this removed. That operation was extremely painful. I have screenings regularly and hopefully will not have another problem. I have a lot of friends who have had total mastectomies. I agree with the honourable member for Cowan that a mastectomy is Ii great trauma and the patient needs a great deal of counselling.· There are many support groups among women who have had this operation. In the area in which I live, I know a number of women who work together to overcome their problems. In fact, their situation can be turned into humour to help them learn to live with their disease. It is important to emphasise early detection. This is why the government has committed $64 million for the first three years of a five year program for the early detection of breast cancer. Awareness, as the honourable member for Cowan has said, is also extremely important. This is why the government in 1992-93 spent $14.9 million on breast cancer screening and has allocated $29.8 million in 1993-94. I am sure honourable members will accept that this is a considerable increase. Because there is an effective secondary prevention strategy for breast cancer, the government has committed these funds to the national breast cancer screening program. Additionally, the National Health and Medical Research Council is supporting a significant level of basic research into the mechanisms and causes of cancer. In 1993 about $13.5 million was spent on research which will obviously lead to a better understanding of breast cancer. This sum included about $900,000 in support of 12 projects for research specifically into breast cancer. Breast cancer research is an identified priority research area, with applications in this field being given an additional weighting in the assessment process. Additionally, $2.1 million is being paid to the Garvan Institute in Sydney, which is recognised as a world-class centre of research into breast cancer. About 20 per cent of the Garvan Institute's budget is devoted to breast cancer research. A total of $10.5 million is being spent in 1993 on AIDS research, of which about $4.5 million is to be spent on virological and immunological research-research which has the potential to provide valuable information of relevance to a number of other diseases. A further $3.5 million is being spent on clinical and epidemiological research relating to AIDS, and approximately $2.5 million is being expended on social and behavioural research, focusing mainly on preventive behaviour. AIDS can be prevented, and education and awareness are extremely important. How can anyone argue with the amounts spent on this horrendous diseaseHIV/AIDS? How can anyone argue with the money spent on education, on safe sex campaigns? Again I speak personally and say that I have lost a number of friends to this horrendous disease. They were people who had valuable contributions to make to our society, particularly in the arts. I am sure his family will not mind me referring to him - I mention Mr Ashley Gordon, who was a partner in the Gordon Frost organisation, theatre entrepreneurs in Sydney. I knew Ashley for a number of years when he was a theatre publicist and before he started his entrepreneurial activities. In my local village of Medlow Bath in the Blue Mountains we have a park committee which is planting trees on a regular basis to commemorate people who have died of AIDS. Those sorts of things are necessary in order to keep before us the need for research into this very deadly disease. I recently planted a tree in memory of Ashley Gordon, and I know that his memory, as the memory of other people, will live on. As I have said, I agree entirely with calls for increased spending in the area of breast cancer research, education, treatment and screening. This government has identified cancer, in particular breast cancer, as a priority area of national health policy. Further, cancer has been identified as one of the four priority areas of the revised national health goals and targets. A working group is presently exploring the best means to achieve and monitor a shift in incidence of cancer, with particular attention to breast cancer. In addition, in May 1993, as the honourable member for Cowan has already said, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs commenced an inquiry into breast cancer screening and treatment. The committee is due to report in March 1994. I hope that the working group and the standing committee take on board the core of this motion, but I hope that they do not take into consideration a comparison between funding for different diseases. The motivation of the mover may not have been a true concern of the rights of women or an affirmation of the responsibilities of government in the area of women's health. But I think that in this case the end does justify the means.",27
17,Ms WORTH,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH,"I rise to support this motion. In doing so I commend the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) for raising this issue before the House. Cancer is a near second to heart disease as the leading cause of death amongst women and breast cancer is the leading cause of these cancer deaths. Breast cancer in women has been tagged as the lady killer, yet· it has been argued that women can find out more about having their cars repaired than getting optimal treatment for this cancer. The breast cancer death rate is 100 times higher than HIV-AIDS and car accidents. Breast cancer is a national epidemic which must not be ignored and I support the call for increased funding for research in this area. With 15 times the population of Australia the United States spends 100 times more money in this area. In supporting this moUon I am not arguing for sectional interest and I do not suggest less should be spent on other areas of medical research. We should not reallocate existing resources but rather increase Australia's overall investment in medical research. The fact is that Australia's investment in medical research is too low irrespective of what parameters we examine-1.4 per cent of the total health expenditure when that ally accepted minimum is 2 per cent. We need to come to see research as an integral component of our health care services. The primary goal of health and medial research must be to achieve better health for all Australians. As well as being a fundamental individual aspiration, improvements to health bring economic benefits by reducing the costs· of illness and increasing productivity. All health gains are founded on knowledge of the determinants of good health whether biological, psychological or socio-economic, and of the effectiveness of interventions. This knowledge is gained through research. Australia presently spends $30 million per year on the direct cost of ill health and less than 1.4 per cent of that figure on research into its causes, prevention and treatment. The true costs of ill health are much greater than the aggregate expenditure on health would indicate. Indirect costs due to loss of productivity and earnings can be equally high. Annual costs of individual disorders \ are typically 100-fold greater than investment in research into the same direction. Therefore, even small gains resulting from research in reduced morbidity or early mortality readily repay the investment. A direct consequence of the low level of government support for health and medical research is the high level of competition for funding through the National Health and Medical Research Council. In 1993 the project grant support success rate was at an all time low of about 21 per cent; that is, only one of five research projects were funded. In addition the real value of these grants has decreased. Costs have increased due to increases in salaries, costs of consumables and reagents and the decline in the exchange rate for the Australian dollar. At the same time the that absolute value of a grant has remained relatively constant, or as happened last year actually decreased due to 2 per cent acrossthe-board cuts. Needless to say, there is little incentive to pursue a career in medical research in this country-which is not going to make it any easier to attract a critical mass of scientists to focus on any particular disease, internation- including breast cancer. In 1993, out of a total of $110 million funding, $1.48 million was allocated by the National Health and Medical Research Council to funding for breast cancer research. Of the 866 projects supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council, four were on breast cancer, and that is $357,000 out of a total of $57 million. The council has a special incentives strategy to encourage applicants to apply to the National Health and Medical Research Council for funding in priority areas. The priority areas included breast cancer in 1992 but did not lead to an increase in project grant applications seeking funding in 1993. However, this year there was an increase from nine to 15 applications relating to breast cancer, representing a 67 per cent stimulus. The success rate of these applications was 16 per cent, versus 23 per cent overall. These figures support the notion that there is need to develop a critical mass of researchers with the appropriate skills working on breast cancer and that there is a need for more money to be allocated to medical research to enable a higher percentage of all recommended applications and special initiatives to be funded. . The Roy Morgan Research Centre survey on scientific research showed that the community heavily supports priority being given to medical research. Asked to identify the research areas that - hould be given priority, 80 per cent cited'medical research-the top response. All other priorities rated less that 60 per cent. Women are susceptible to the disease for one reason: they are the reproducers of the species. Deaths are not diminishing in frequency and may be increasing. Although those over 50 years of age are most at risk, significant numbers of younger women with families are affected. In my' own state of South Australia, the 1989-1992 diagnostic period was remarkable for breast cancer statistics. A total of 2,761 new invasive cancer cases were diagnosed, 19 per cent more than the 2,329.2 expected from the population change and the 1984-1988 annual incidence rates for five-year age groups. The number of cases diagnosed per year increased from 488 in 1984 to 743 in 1992. One obvious explanation for these increases is earlier detection. It is generally recognised that there has also been a greatly increased use of diagnostic mammography to investigate breast lumps and related concerns. Research into breast cancer has deepened our knowledge of the condition and is offering prospects for significant advances in the future. The cause of breast cancer is not known with precision, although it has been possible in more recent years to define who is at increased risk. This includes a family history and the presence of specific growth tissue abnormalities identified following surgical biopsy. Newer evidence has pointed to the specific genetic abnormalities that may be associated with higher than average risk. Current treatment of breast cancer involves removal of the affected tissue by total mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiotherapy, administration of hormones and/or chemotherapy to kill off residual microscopic amounts of cancer.in the body. We are at a very exciting and important phase of our knowledge about this cancer, for the following reasons. Firstly, prevention seems possible using anti-oestrogens, for example, tamoxifen, and a large-scale trial is being proposed to test this. We know that tamoxifen halves the risk of a second breast cancer in women who have had one. Clinical geneticists and molecular biologists have identified significant abnormalities and a breast cancer gene in some relatives of breast cancer patients. Definition of who is at risk is therefore potentially precise and appropriate intervention should be considered, along with the ethical complexities that may arise. Research in this area is very important. The use of chemotherapy and hormone therapy after surgery has been shown to improve cure rates significantly. Clinical studies to precisely define who needs such treatment, and how much treatment, must continue. Clinical trials are expensive. Data collection is required over periods of many years, as the disease may run a prolonged course. While today's discussion relates to research rather than screening, I acknowledge the important role of screening programs in combating this cancer. The evidence that screening reduces breast cancer mortality in women aged 50-65 years, the most commonly affected age group, is now widely accepted. Screening reduces mortality in this group by about one-third. Screening must be widely supported so that all eligible women are screened effectively. Support for special centres for risk assessment and counselling could well be justified. I am pleased to support these arguments today because, if anyone of us can do anything which is worthwhile in any way to reduce the death of women and the consequent hardships and tragedy which then beset their family, we will be achieving something.",28
18,Ms CRAWFORD,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH,"I rise to speak to the motion and also commend members of this House for raising the issue of women's health. As we would all know, women's health is of great concern to this nation, more particularly because women are the carers of our children and of our aged. So it is imperative for the health of the nation to ensure that women's health is best looked after. We must recognise that breast cancer research is being undertaken throughout most of the industrial world. In fact, breast cancer research has been part of medical research most of this century. As one of the particimust look. pants in that endeavour, Australia has access to a wide range of international research is able to make use of the very best of that data. Australian research is governed by ethical concerns, and for that reason the integrity any research program remains the paramount concern. In the USA at the present time, there is a question about the validity of some breast cancer research given that testing there largely carried out on Hispanic and black American women. We would certainly quesdiet. tion those results, and our ethical concerns would not allow that to happen here. We acknowledge that no researcher ever has enough money. However, the thing to remember about breast cancer is that it is enough to locate the cancer; there is the additional matter of developing a regimen treatment. What has been raised here, of course, is the whole question of screening. This government is most concerned about the incidence of breast cancer in Australia. We have already committed $64 million to the establishment of a national program for the early detection of breast cancer. This program will be implemented over five years. The cost of screening services are being shared by the states. The program establishes a network of screening and assessment sermight vices dedicated to screening mammography. Its target group is women in the 50 to 69program years age bracket, but women over 40 are funding? also eligible. The screening process is attempting to put in place a treatment regimen that is fair .and equitable. We need to ensure that women have a choice of treatments. For too long mastectomy has been the only treatment offered to women with breast cancer. The early screening program ensures that women with cancer are contacted early and, perhaps more importantly, given a choice of treatment. That should be the case whether they live Woodridge in Queensland, the Blue Mounbecause tains in New South Wales, Fairfield in Syd- . focus. ney, Adelaide, Perth or wherever. All women are entitled to a choice of treatment. I suggest that that is not happening at the present time, for and that is an issue of equity at which we The screening program also raises in the and community an awareness of the factors concerned with the prevention of breast cancer. Current research shows that there are a number of factors. The genetic factor has already of been mentioned. Women with a family history of breast cancer who might therefore be predisposed to the disease are eligible for early screenings. That is just, that is fair, and is that is also important. Another factor to consider in the prevention of breast cancer is If we are going to put women's health on the national agenda, we must ensure that all aspects of women's health are examined. Prevention, cure, choice and range of treatnot ments must all be part of the package. While nobody would suggest that more money is not for needed for research, as a community we must make decisions about funding priorities. For example, it costs the community $100,000 for a liver transplant, $58,000 to keep a premature baby alive, and $50,000 to treat an HIV sufferer from diagnosis to death. We can look at breast cancer in the same way. It has an horrendous effect upon the individual, and it has an horrific effect upon her family. It is, in fact, a very serious national health concern, but can we make ethical judgements that result in moneys not being available for others? How do we make decisions about priorities for medical research and When we look at some of the funding for HIV research, it has already been pointed out that over $41f2 million of that research looks at the whole question of immunology, and that looks at a whole range of other diseases in our community. So they are not comparable. They are not comparing like with like. What we need to focus on and what we must focus on is the question of the issue of women's health as a community issue and as in an issue for all of us in this community it needs and is deserving of our Currently, the NHMRC is spending $13 1h million on medical research for all types of cancer. This will give us a better understandnational ing of cancers. Included in this is breast cancer. The issue of priority has been raised and currently the government is looking at a commitment to medical researchers and an expansion of a further two per cent. But, as well as that, we have a commission to work by the minister, which is looking at ways in which research funding can be directed more effectively to areas of national priority. What we need to say is that our concern as a parliament, and our concern as a community, is very much about women's health, and is very much about the issue of breast cancer. The figures are horrific. We have seen that, if we focus on various campaigns, if we raise community awareness, if we ensure that people have a choice about prevention measures, and if people have a choice about treatment regimes equally across this country, we can address the issue. So the issue is one of choice for women. is one of raising women's awareness and making sure that they have accessibility to screening measures and to other preventl;ltive measures to ensure that they are not subjected to massive mastectomies and so on, because by the time their cancer is revealed it is too large to treat. What we as a community have to ensure is certainly that there is adequate medical research. There is no question of that. But it is also a question about ensuring that we tap into that huge international research that we hear about. We also have to question the nature of some of the research that is done and how it is done. We acknowledge that the way in which some of the research is done overseas would not in fact be allowed to happen here and would not happen in the way that it does, particularly with the testing of some of the drugs. Tamoxifen has been cited. There are some other recognised side effects from that in terms of liver and endometrial cancer. Those kinds of issues all need to be addressed and they are all part of a total package about women's health. What we welcome in this House today is the opportunity to raise on the national da the issue of breast cancer for women and also to ensure that we have support for the women's health strategy, which recognises that women playa central and key role in our community as not only the people who are the carers in our community but who are responsible for the health of the nation. It is the nation's responsibility to ensure then that we are responsible for their health. Certainly, I look to the government's commitment to ensuring that more money is placed into medical research and that we all as a nation make a commitment and give a national priority to looking at the way in which breast cancer impacts upon women in our community. We also need to ensure that the prevention and the treatment regimes are available to women across Australia with equal opportunity so that all of them are in a position to make choices about their health and their lives and the lives of their families.",30
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH,Order! The debate is adjourned and It the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT: NEW NA,32
20,Mr VAILE,SOUTH WALES,"I move: That this House: (1) recognise the importance of regional development strategies to the north coast of New South Wales; (2) urge the Regional Development Task Force to pay close attention to the needs and interests of people on the north coast of New South Wales when reporting back to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development in December 1993; and (3) call for the Industry Commission, in completing their report entitled Impediments to regional industry adjustment, to further examine the realities of regional Australia, in particular the realities of impediments to industry on the north coast of New South Wales, before tabling their final report in November 1993. The north coast of New South Wales is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. With a growth in population of 2.3 per cent per year, which is twice that of the urban sprawl of Sydney, the population on the north agencoast-which is now around 400,000-is expected to grow by as much as 80 per cent over the next 25 years. Physical infrastructure is, therefore, strug- many gling to keep up with the population growth. This is evidenced by a number of sewage treatment plants which have nearly reached full capacity at this point in time. It is also obvious to many that regional centres along the coast of New South Wales lack the necessities of public transport as well as many medical, cultural and recreational facilities. Regional development strategies which address these issues are essential. Those strategies should also address the more general issues of how to encourage the growth of business on the north coast and how to encourage relocation of business to the north coast of New South Wales. Despite the fact that the Office of Regional Development is not a separate department, was promised by the government in the leadas up to the election, I welcome the creation of interests. the federal Office of Regional Development within the Department of Industry, Technolcreate ogy and Regional Development. I welcome the initiatives this year that have seen regional development strategies finally put on the agenda as an important aspect of growth for this country's future. However, I am concerned about the direcregional tion the Minister for Industry, Technology Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) has taken in regional development over the past six months. I am particularly concerned at lack of attention paid to the north coast of New South Wales over the last six months since the Office of Regional Development was created. As the shadow minister for rural and gional development, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), has said, it essential that the minister get regional develrelocate opment out of Canberra. We are currently being subjected to report after report on to deal with regional development, but it is time for action. Regional development strategies on north coast are essential. Due to the rapid growth in population, some parameters and guidelines for the area are needed. This is just about pro-development, it is about controlled development. There have been far too instances over the last few years of parties from both sides of the development fence getting away with more than they should. We have seen environmental impact statements used for political blackmail. We have seen small self-interest groups aUract more attention than they deserve, simply because the media perceives their actions as being newsworthy. Regional strategies are, therefore, about providing guidelines for the future of such places as the north coast of New South Wales. These packages need vision; they need initiative; and they need to be realistic in terms of the needs of the north coast. That is why I have been disappointed in the lack of interest shown by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development with as regard to the north coast of New South Wales a specific region with specific needs and I think it is a recipe for disaster to try to an across-the-board regional ctevelopment strategy in the hope that it meets the needs of all the diverse and different interests of regional Australia. Unless such a system incorporates such aspects as introducing a more flexible workplace arrangement for Australia, then I do not think the and system has much merit. The Office of Regional Development needs to look at the specific needs of different areas, and it must the try to accommodate those specific interests. On the north coast of New South Wales, for example, small business is the key, with the average company hllving only six employees. Small business needs to be encouraged in resuch a way that it is able to develop and expand. In so doing, it will promote further is growth and it will encourage more industry to to the north coast. I have been in close contact with members of the business how community within my electorate and they now constantly make the comment that small business needs to be nurtured within the area the for the area to continue to develop. We are talking about really small business in that area. What I have found is that the not commonly accepted government definition of small business is pitched far too high for regional areas. The minimum levels of attainment in turnover and/or salary levels are accordingly far too high for many quite worthy regional small businesses to qualify for assistance under government programs. This is just one simple example of the problem of having the Office of Regional Development run from Canberra where very little contact with the north coast, and regional Australia in general, is achieved. It is important that I put on record some statistics that show the condition of the north coast of New South Wales in comparison with the rest of Australia. According to the most recent census figures, unemployment in my electorate of Lyne on the mid-north coast is 15.9 per cent, with the median family income being the second lowest in Australia and the employment participation rate also the lowest in Australia. To look at the whole north coast, we see very little change in these figures. In the electorate of Page, 24 per cent of the electorate earn under $16,000 a year; in Richmond it is 25.1 per cent; and in my electorate it is 26.6 per cent. These are by far the worse regional figures of any in the whole of Australia, and the area is crying out for some regional development strategies and support from the federal government, not a continuation of the lip-service that we have seen so far. This is why the regional development strategy of this government has disappointed me so much to date, and this is why I felt it necessary to bring this matter before the House today. It appals me when I read the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on regional development, and his strange theory which is: The proper starting point will be to ask not can the Commonwealth government do for a region, but what can a region do for itself. If the Prime Minister would only look at the figures from the latest census, he would see that they clearly show the government to be screwing the north coast of everything that it has got. How can the north coast possibly become an autonomous region when petrol prices are going through the roof, aviation charges are going through the roof and trans-. port and communications networks still leave a great deal to be desired? There have been many very worthwhile local initiative studies conducted by bodies such as the Manning Development Board, the Manning-Gloucester Business Enterprise Centre, the Mid-North Coast Development Board, the Hastings Business Enterprise Centre, and the Country Mayors Association of New South Wales. The Prime Minister must see that the regions are doing all they can to develop. They already have the inventory and the information available. It is now only a matter for governments to start tapping into these information sources. When I see the Prime Minister with the audacity to get up and say that it is up to the regions to call their own tunes, I develop grave concerns about the genuine intent of the current regional development strategy of this government and, in particular, I wonder whether this is just more lip-service to the north coast of New South Wales, which has been shown to be the poorest region in all of Australia. I am also astounded that the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Bill Kelty, is the chairperson of the Regional Development Task Force. The regressive and centralist policies of the ACTU, including the ancient industrial relations system, have done nothing but hinder regional development in this country. It has been said before and I will say it again: a much more flexible workplace arrangement is essential for regional Australia to function to the level it is capable of. I am also concerned that the interests of the north coast of New South Wales are not represented on this committee. I just hope that participants such as Lindsay Fox get stuck into the government over petrol prices, which, what I am sure, have already had a serious impact on his transport company, and that Margaret Bowman puts forward the case for university facilities on the north coast, as I understand education is her area of interest. .  representative for local government bodies, already understands and knows of the enormous amount of data currently available from the various regional studies in New South Wales and that he puts the case forward of all regional areas in Australia. It is no longer time for talk; it is time for action. The Regional Development Task Force must realise the unique role the north coast of New South Wales plays. Businesses that employ six people or less are a feature of this area. As well, self-employment is a major factor in the economy of the north coast. It is, therefore, essential that the Regional Development Task Force realise this and, in particular, Mr Kelty, who, I imagine, may have a little trouble understanding self-employment. The priority that the task force must examine on the north coast is, therefore, its existing base of high self-employment and large numbers of small businesses. If the Industry Commission draft report entitled Impediments to regional industry adjustment kept only to its first recommendation, I would be singing the praises of this report as a significant breakthrough in regional development strategies. The first recommendation is: The commission considers that greater recognition needs to be given to the particular conditions by workplaces in different regions when enterprise bargaining is undertaken. This would best be achieved under a system with: no restrictions on the terms and conditions covered by enterprise agreements ... freedom for employees to choose who may negotiate on their behalf at the workplace. It is this move to a more flexible work force arrangement that is crucial to regional Australia and crucial to the New South Wales north coast. I would just like to finish on a couple of interesting points: both the Regional Development Task Force, set up by the minister, and that Industry Commission inquiry came nowhere near the north coast, or my area of the north coast of New South Wales. (Time expired)",32
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Nehl-I second the motion, and reserve my right to speak.",35
22,Mr HORNE,SOUTH WALES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I am quite happy to support this motion, but I would like to preface my remarks by reminding the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) that this is the government that has had the initiative to bring about an inquiry into regional development in Australia. I suggest that he would be wise to withhold his statements until after the decisions or the recommendations of that particular task force have been handed down. If there is one part of Australia that should be thriving, it is the north coast of New South Wales. This area is one of the most diverse regions in Australia; it boasts a wide range of agricultural pursuits and a spectrum of industrial activities. The fishing industry is represented in prawn and oyster production; estuary and deep sea species of fish are regularly brought into the numerous co-operatives for transhipping to Sydney and offshore markets. Timber has traditionally been a significant employer of people in the area, and it is an area that is synonymous with tourism. Names such as Port Stephens, Myall Lakes, Port Macquarie, the Dorrigo Plateau, Coffs Harbour, Ballina, Byron Bay and Mt Warning, all conjure up a picture of a great place faced for a holiday, relaxation and vast· natural beauty. Add to this what has scientifically been rated as one of the best places in the world in which to live, and we can see why it has some of the fastest growth rates in Australia. The significant part of the population growth that will take our nation to 20 million people in the next two decades will actually locate on the north coast of New South Wales; yet this area poses a major conundrum because it suffers, as we have already heard, from higher than average rates of unemployment. This area should be buzzing with industry and growth in investment: it is not, and we need to ask why. We should also remember, Mr Speaker, that this is a part of Australia that has, since Federation, caused two groups of activists-and I think we might even have some more starting to raise their heads-to propose a new state in Australia. That may come with the republic. Mr Nehl-No republic.",35
23,Mr HORNE,SOUTH WALES,The honourable member might care to conduct a competition to decide what the flag will be. Mr Nehl-We have already got it.,35
24,Mr HORNE,SOUTH WALES,"It will probably be a banana. If such a move had been successful, one wonders what the prosperity of the region would have been. It is my opinion that this area epitomises the problem that is faced by much of regional Australia where three tiers of government have the best intention, but where we get lots of rhetoric that is not backed up with action. Local government is frustrated because it identifies the many problems that exist, it perceives the solution, but it does not have the resources. State government traditionally does not place the needs of regional areas sufficiently high on its priority list to allow the pre-development of infrastructure to take place. I do not agree with the solution offered by the honourable member for Lyne. I spoke to Lindsay Fox recently, and he greatly appreciates the fact that the cost of leasing his now is 30 per cent less than it was two years ago. The saving in interest more than pays for the increase in fuel excise. Honourable members should have a word with him and find out how much better off he is. Areas on the north coast are always in catch-up mode. We are always trying to get the infrastructure in there after the people have moved in. That has been the history of the place, and unfortunately it looks like it is going to continue to be the history of the place. Federal governments from both sides of politics have never considered that it has been their responsibility to allocate funds for regional development. As I have indicated, it is the initiative of this current government to look at regional development. We give funding for roads, we give funding for housing, we give funding for hospitals, we give funding for education, and we give it directly to the state government and it decides where it spends it. If the funding is not spent in the honourable member's area, he had better get his state members to lobby a bit harder. I am quite happy to support this motion today. As a matter of fact, this is a bit of a hobbyhorse of mine, because I believe that we are building the biggest cities and creating the greatest pollution problems that Australia has ever witnessed. But we are faced with the problem of getting real solutions, real strategies for regional development into the north coast of New South Wales. I anticipate that the needs of this particular region will be clearly enunciated in the report that comes to the minister at the end of the year. It is amazing how much foreknowledge honourable members on the opposite side have. It is unfortunate that they did not have it before March this year. A classic example of how regional Australia suffers under the three tiers of government is clearly identified by the Nowendoc Road. Let us look at this because it is a case history. I am not apportioning any blame but what I am disgusted about is that we have a road that has had $10 million spent on it by the federal government. It was identified as a bicentennial project. It is an alternative link, a parallel route to the Pacific Highway and the New trucks England Highway. About $10 million has been spent on it. There are about 20 kilometres of road that need to be completed. We have a road that, say, between Newcastle and Armidale would be 80 kilometres less in distance, an hour shorter through some of the best country which could be seen, and not only in Australia but anywhere in the world. It is one that the people of Gloucester had greatly anticipated. They pinned great hope on it, because it would increase the amount of traffic, and it would allow their businesses to develop. With another $5 million to be expended, what happened this year? The playing rules were changed. Tied grants that had identified money for this road ceased at the end of this year as a result of a request from Nick Greiner, and as an agreement with the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. It does not mean that the money was not allocated. The money was allocated. That money has been paid to the State government, and the Minister for Transport, Bruce Baird, in his decision, does not have that road ranked as high on his priorities as has the federal government. That money has not been allocated. We could say that $10 million has been wasted. There is a missing link in that road and I sincerely hope that we will see it corrected in our lifetime. But it does pose a very important question. Of course, that is a story that unfortunately is repeated throughout much of Australia. It is this sort of ad hoc decision making that does not support positive planning principles for regional development in our country. We have seen cuts in rail services to the north coast of New South Wales by a state government over the past six years that has not helped. Again, it is the case of economic rationalist policies triumphing over sensible planning policy. I do not apologise for getting on to my hobbyhorse. I am convinced that future generations of Australians are going to look back at the country that we have built for them. I am sure that they are going to ask: why, with such a vast and bountiful country, did we deliberately go about building a country where we packed 80 per cent of our population into six cities. That is the thing that we have got to sit down, in a bipartisan policyMr Bruce Scott-Ha, hal",36
25,Mr HORNE,SOUTH WALES,"I will even invite the honourable member for Maranoa to contribute positively if he wishes to. But the government in New South Wales of the political persuasion of the honourable member does not place the priorities on the development of the north coast as members on that same side of politics support in this House. If honourable members can tell me how we can go about short circuiting that, I am quite happy to sit down and talk in order to try to come up with positive policies because that is what we have got to do. That is the problem that is facing this country today. I am not whether we will be able to answer that question in our memoirs. I am not sure whether we will be able to come up with policies that will resolve that situation within the next two decades, but I do have a great deal of pleasure in supporting the motion.",37
26,Mr NEHL,SOUTH WALES,"I am very interested to follow the honourable member for Patterson (Mr Home). I must say that normally he is a very sensible man, but today he is down in the garden with the fairies. For heaven's sake, he says that we should wait until the report of this Regional Development Task Force comes in-in December, I believe. We are not going to wait to find that it has stuffed up. We have got to be in before and get the arguments in and get the decisions taken which will be the right decisions. I am also absolutely amazed to hear the honourable member for Patterson on his hobbyhorse about the Nowendoc Road, and I do support him. It will be a great asset to all of Australia, and particularly to northern New South Wales, to get that Nowendoc Road finished. But who stopped the tied grants? The honourable member is trying to blame Bob Hawke and Nick Greiner. Let us face it, mate: it was John Dawkins and Paul Keating. They are the ones who stopped the tied grants. They are the ones that have cut back on the grants to New South Wales in the last few years by a couple of billion dollars. As for the honourable member saying that the north coast of New South Wales is being starved under the present state government: when it was starved, it was under Barry Unsworth and under Neville Wran, under dear old Nifty. That is when the north coast of New South Wales was left as Orphari Annie, and it is only since Nick Greiner came in and has been succeeded by John Fahey that the north coast has developed. The honourable member talked about road funding. Let us go back to the Pacific Highway. In the last three years there has been an additional $300 miIlion. It is true that $130 million came from the federal government, yes, but the bulk of the money came from the state government-$170 million. I will not go sure on again about the black spots. What a disgrace it is that this government has taken away the black spot funding. All I can say to my friend the honourable member for Patterson is: 'Don't be such a dill. Get with it'.",37
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES,"Order! I think the honourable member could choose other words. Mr NEHLIf you object to that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will withdraw. I say to the honourable member: 'Don't be such a dope or a drongo'-because they are parliamentary words, as will be seen if one goes back into Hansard. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, if you investigate the Hansard of this parliament since 1901, you will see that the language in this place has calmed down tremendously. But even the language of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who is such an abusive man-even his dreadful use of language-pales into insignificance if one consults the history of the words used by our predecessors. Of course, the honourable member for Patterson is not a dill. I do withdraw that. Mr Horne-Or a dope.",37
28,Mr NEHL,SOUTH WALES,I will be very generous. He is not a dope; he is just a drongo.,38
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES,Order! I think the honourable member should concentrate on the motion before the House.,38
30,Mr NEHL,SOUTH WALES,"I am endeavouring to, but you are not protecting me, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are letting this honourable member distract me all the time. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that you give me the protection of your office. What we see in terms of regional development is that there is far too much duplication of effort from this government-including the proliferation of departments, who have all got their fingers in the pie-and what we really need is some degree of coordination. We are not getting that at all. So now we are having another go at looking at regional development, with this announcement of a study into business investment in regional areas. Where will it end? We have already got the Regional Development Task Force looking at it, but here is a separate inquiry coming on. Of course, it was only in the dying hours of the 1993 election campaign that the government did announce a department of regional development-a new found vision splendid, just on the eve of the election, just to try to get those few extra votes. And that is all the government needed, of course; it won by only 1,500 right around Australia. What we need is for this government to be really shamed into doing something on regional development, because so far there have been 10 years of rhetoric and no action at all. n is also true to say that this government has no commitment to the rural and farming communities of Australia. In fact, if one looks at the primary industries of Australia, one sees that this government-the way it is performing-is treating them as sunset industries. Regrettably, unless we get something going with the economy to give our agricultural and rural and primary producers a fair go so that they can be competitive and so that they can make a quid and not be making a loss year after year, they will be a sunset industry. There is quite a dilemma facing rural communities. I am not talking about the north coast in particular here but the smaller rural communities, particularly out west, because, even though this motion is about the north coast, it is relevant to all regional areas of Australia. There is such a decline that population is diminishing but the infrastructure is there. Unfortunately, the emphasis is on the capital cities, and that is why there will always be a role for the National Party, because we are the only party with a specific interest in regional' and rural Australia. We are not dominated by Sydney, we are not dominated by Melbourne or Brisbane or Adelaide, and that is why the National Party will continue to serve the people of regional and rural Australia. A regional development strategy is vitally important for the north coast of New South Wales because it is the fastest growing region in New South Wales, if not Australia. In the next 25 years the population will increase by more than 80 per cent to over 700,000. The growth rate is twice that of Sydney and by the year 2000 the population will be bigger than Tasmania's. It is interesting that the honourable member for Paterson-I will withdraw 'drongo' too; he is not really a drongo but he is a bit of a dill",38
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES,Order!,38
32,Mr NEHL,SOUTH WALES,"He mentioned the question of new states. Quite coincidentally, I already have in my notes a reminder to speak about new states. Perhaps the honourable member does not know this, but in the 1960s I was the secretary and executive officer of the New England new state movement and chairman of the vote yes campaign in the New South Wales referendum. Since we are talking about constitutional change, let us go back to the original constitution. Chapter 6 of the constitution provides for the creation of new states and provides for the admission of new states to the federation. Quite frankly, although this movement was superbly active in the 1960s, the idea is still correct. If we are going to talk about regional development, if we are going to talk about the north coast of New South Wales together the northern tablelands and the north-west, it would still make an ideal new state, it would still provide a better service as a new state than it gets as part of New South Wales at present time. We should not forget the possimember bility of the creation of new states. That Labor man, Arthur Calwell, was most outstanding advocates of new states, and he was right, as he was right about many things; he was right about migration at the time too. So we should not just cast that aside. It is there in chapter 6 of the constitucountry tion and it is something that we should not throw out of consideration altogether. People are being drawn to the north coast of New South Wales by the magnet of their lifestyle enhancement. The new settlers are mostly arriving from the south. We have got scenic beauty which is unparalleled anywhere in Australia and indeed the world, and access to services and sporting and cultural activities which for a regional area is quite outstanding. There is still a great deal of room for imrise provement. As far as the climate is concerned, the CSIRO describes my electorate and partly that of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the area from Coffs Harbour to Port Macquarle, as having the optimum climate for the human animal-it is not too hot, it is not too cold. Where the parents of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) live at Paterson (Mr Home). Kempsey it is absolutely delightful. This is why people are coming. But there is no point in their coming if there is no possibility of a job. Unemployment on the mid-north coast and the north coast of New South Wales is actually a growth industry because people, they have to be unemployed, would much rather be in a climate where they have lower heating bills than they have here in Canberra or in Geelong or Griffith, where their clothing costs are less and the cost of food is less as well. So the Industry Commission proposal that there should be some form of prohibition on people moving is not going to work. I must say that I reject that proposition that we should try to inhibit the free movement of Australians within Australia. I totally reject with that and I hope that the government will reject that as well. But the population increase does raise the question of where the people will live and where they will get jobs. We the need infrastructure and, as the honourable for Lyne said, one cannot go to a great region which has no great financial backing one of the and say, 'You create it'. Small businesses on the north coast are not looking for handouts, they want an economic climate where they can go ahead and make a dollar and provide jobs. The only way this is going to get going again is if we can get small business to be profitable once more, to be able to create jobs and provide employment. The north coast of New South Wales, together with the south-eastern area of Queensland, provides the future of Australia. This is where the future of Australia is going to be. I have one final point. If we are going to have a VFf, forget Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra, it should go to Brisbane.",38
33,Mr NEWELL,SOUTH WALES,"I to join my colleagues in supporting the motion moved by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) on the importance of regional development to the north coast of New South Wales. I do not necessarily agree with the thrust of some of his arguments but, nevertheless, I will join with him most fullheartedly in supporting the motion, along with my colleague the honollrable member for I must say that I found the contribution of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) a little bit out of character in the sense that it took almost seven minutes to get down to the motion. In a sense, his support was rather if tokenish. I do compliment the honourable member for Lyne for his contribution. He did make a real effort to actually tackle the motion that he has put to the House and to contribute some solution. I would like to do likewise. The motion urges the Regional Development Task Force to pay close attention to the needs and interests of the north coast of New South Wales and to report back to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) in December. The motion also calls for the Industry Commission, before tabling its report entitled, Impediments to regional industry adjustment in November, to examine further the realities of regional Australia and, in particular, the realities of impediments to industry on the north coast of New South Wales. There has been a lot of discussion over the last two to three months with regard to regional development and the thrust of where it should go and how we should approach it. I join with the honourable member for Lyne in his reservations, if I remember the way he actually expressed them, with regard to where the Regional Development Task Force is headed. I do have some reservations and I share this with my other colleagues and also my constituents on the north coast with regard to how regional development should be addressed. It is something that I have attempted to address on the north coast since the time. I was elected back in 1990. I compliment the honourable member for Lyne. I think Taree is located in his electorate, and I often use that as one example of a region that has got on with it and not waited around for government handouts or for a task force to report. That area has simply got in and done it. That is in line with what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said just a few weeks ago, which those opposite criticised. It has gone on and done it and I compliment that area. It certainly is a shining light in way regional development can go ahead and achieve the results in both building up infrastructure and putting jobs in that area. So, in that sense, I disagree with what the honourable member had to say with regard to the Prime Minister's comments on it and I endorse it fully. It is up to the regions, in a lot of ways, to get on with the job. It is also up to the three levels of government to get on with the job in helping the regions with infrastructure. There are lots of impediments, which the task force will recognise and which, I am sure, honourable members on both sides of the House who come from different regions will recogniseparticularly government members because, after all, the government does have more members representing regional Australia than the National Party or the Liberal Party. That seems to have been overlooked. Impediments are facing regional development on the north coast of New South Wales and, in particular, my electorate of Richmond. I do not wantto be too parochial about it; but it is unique. On the mention of the word 'parochialism', I do have to say some words. I do not want to lecture my colleagues on either side of the House-in particular, those on the other side-on the matter. But when we talk about regional development, we are talking about smaller and centred communities right throughout Australia. In that sense, there is a great deal of danger in that the arguments put forward do fall apart due to parochialism. It has happened on the north coast and the same sort of thing can happen across Australia with regional development, and the same thing happens within the cities. It is not something which is unique to the country areas. Parochialism also extends across into other areas. You only have to ask if we can move a government department from one city to another, or you only have to decide that one city has a better bike race than the other and 'bang' the other city would like it as well. That has happened. It is not something that we need to consider as being unique to country areas but it is something that we can address. I think we have to address it in a bipartisan way in the House. the That is why I was quite happy to come in and support the honourable member for Lyne on his motion, to support the honourable member for Paterson and to support some of the comments of the honourable member for Cowper. . Some of the issues that I think we should be prepared to address are particularly those of population and growth rates. Both honourable members on the other side have rightly pointed out the growth rates on the north coast in different electorates. The fact is that the local government areas seem to hold these up as a badge of office or badge of honour. As honourable members opposite know, they come back and ask us for assistance but, at the same time, they do nothing about population and growth rates. It is not so much controlling the population, as was alluded to by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) but rather telling the people they cannot go here. We have to be prepared to face the local government areas and to say to them that growth rates of that size are unacceptable; that uncontrolled growth is unacceptable. We have to be prepared to take a stronger line on that. In terms of some of the other infrastructure or works that have been mentioned by honourable members on both sides of the House in the debate this morning, there will always be a parochial and less than bipartisan approach; whether. it be state, local or federal government, as to where the blame lies. I must point out that in my electorate I have the state member for Ballina, Mr Don Page, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Planning.  go public. He told the entire north coast-the electorate and the constituents-that he had assurances from the then Minister for Roads, Mr Wal Murray, that the funding for the Pacific Highway would not be slashed at all: they would meet all their commitments and promises. Recently, what do we find? In the 1992-93 year, the funding for the Pacific Highway from the state government was underspent by some $41 million. That was an assurance coming from a parliamentary secretary; it virtually counted for nothing. I find the same situation regarding infrastructure. I also have the privilege, if I could call it that, of having the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Ports occupying a state seat in my electorate: Mr Don Beck in the seat of Murwillumbah. Despite being the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Ports, the parliamentary secretary has not been able to get any assistance from his state government with regard to the port of Tweed Heads and the sand bypass issue on the north coast. Again, that government simply palmed the issue off by writing to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and saying, 'Help us out; it is up to you to help us out'. There has not been any commitment from the state government towards this very necessary and vital infrastructure on the north coast. It is regrettable. I do not want to go down too far into the role of challenging the state government, but certainly there is a role for state governments to play. There is a role for federal governments to play and, for the life of me, I cannot see why a state government with state members representing their constituencies, has not been able to come up with a better or a firmer offer than it has so far. Back in 1991, I wrote to the three state members asking about an approach which would tie in the three levels of government. I have to say that I am a little bit disappointed. Maybe the honourable members opposite who are of that party would be prepared to take up the issue again to get a tripartisan approach-state, local and federal government. After all, I did write to the three members. I cannot remember the exact words in the letter of reply but it was anything but complimentary and anything but condescending towards further working relationships, if I could put it that way. Nevertheless, the north coast has proceeded. Through the good work of both the unions and the federal department, particularly DEET, we have been able to lead the way in areas such as jobskills. The north coast was one of the first areas to get cracking with jobskills with the cooperation of the unions. They were able to write and rewrite enterprise agreements to ensure that they got up and got going. The north coast leads the way in the numbers of jobskills positions that were put in place. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Lyne, flexible workplace arrangements are also assisting employers on the north coast. In fact, enterprise agreements have been one of the great initiatives of unions on the north coast, and that has led to a greater degree of cooperation between unions and employers. There are quite a number of employees whom I could name who have led the way in that regard. (TIme expired)",39
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption 6f the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. AIRPORTS: SYDNEY,42
35,Mr CADMAN,SOUTH WALES,"Mitchell) (11.51 a.m.)I move: That, in view of Sydney being granted the Year 2000 Olympics, this House: (1) acknowledges the increased congestion at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport; (2) commends the construction of the third, parallel runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport; and (3) endorses the immediate construction of a private/public airport at Badgerys Creek with a full international capacity including a metre runway. Mr Deputy Speaker, I note that over the last 17 years the Australian Labor Party has been incapable of coming to a decision on the airport needs of Sydney. In the last 12 months it has moved tentatively to establish the third parallel runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. While that is a commendable decision, it took 17 years to reach it. The Fraser government struggled with Sydney's airport requirements for seven years and came to the conclusion in 1983 that a third parallel runway at Kingsford Smith was needed. But the election of the Hawke government put that to one side, and we saw honourable members whose electorates adjoined Kingsford Smith protesting against the decision for a third parallel runway. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), formerly the honourable member for Grayndler, and the honourable member for  preventing the government making a decision to provide a third parallel runway. In 1989 Prime Minister Hawke made a joint statement with the then Minister for Transport and Communications, now the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). I will read the first paragraph: On 22 March 1989 the government decided that they had to develop a third runway at Kingsford Smith Airport, subject to the satisfactory completion of the normal EIS processes and to begin the development of a second airport at Badgerys Creek. The fourth paragraph of the same press release said: The government will move now to acquire the remainder of the land needed for the development of Badgerys Creek. A general aviation facility will be constructed immediately as a first stage. In anticipation of the second stage, which will provide for both domestic and international services, detailed design work will commence immediately. So that decision was taken by the current government four years ago. The third parallel runway is on the go but things are moving very slowly at Badgerys Creek. I believe that there are good arguments why there should be immediate regenerated interest in Badgerys Creek, and that Badgerys Creek should in fact be the site of a second international airport for 2900 Sydney. In light of Sydney achieving the right to stage the Olympic Games, the arguments for moving immediately with that project are absolute and compelling. The government has allocated $50 million for some paltry work on a 1,800 metre runway to be built at Badgerys Creek-a runway that will provide for nobody really, and which will not relieve the congestion that confronts Mascot. In the same statement, the government said that the decision to build a third runway would not result in an increase in the number of people severely affected by aircraft noise but that it would in fact relieve aircraft noise around the Mascot area. That is one argument that has been overlooked by the opponents to the third runway at Kingsford Smith. In the notes attached to that 1989 statement, the Prime Minister said that the government would be commissioning a detailed design for a major airport at Badgerys Creek providing both domestic and international services. That means that both domestic and international services were contemplated back in 1989. However, today we find that, while $50 million has been allocated to the project, there has been a complete change in the government's attitude broug-t about by the Federal Airport Corporation, the FAC, which has decided that the only need Sydney has is for domestic and general aviation. Consequently, no provision has been made for international aviation at this second airport. How does the whole growth factor stack up in the period since 1989? What has happened? It was predicted on figures that an airport at Badgerys Creek would be needed by approximately 2002 or 2003. However, since that time there has been a massive growth in aviation and travel in Australia, particularly in the international area. That prediction of 1989 is way out of date, and the FAC's own figures indicate that that program is now two or three years ahead and so the year 2002 or 2003 becomes the year 2000. The increase in aviation in the past four years-and the international travel agencies say that the growth in aviation will continue until the tum of the century-means that we will have a need for a second airport, not as originally predicted in the year 2002 2003 but by the year 2000. I have figures from the New South Wales government, which commissioned an inquiry. That inquiry indicates that approximately 1.3 million additional overseas travellers can be expected into Sydney during the year 2000, so that year becomes a critical one for inter originally predicted 16.5 million passengers by the year 2000, but it now seems that the figure will be something like 20 million passengers by the year 2000. History has indicated that the year 2002 forecast was actually five years out. .  the growth and the needs in aviation. In its assessment of the needs for travel in the Sydney area, the FAC's own figures indicate that it expects passengers to fly into Badgerys expired) Creek, and about 1,000 international passenger movements to be handled through Badgerys Creek, by the year 2002. But no plans have been made at this point for anything to be done about an international airport at Badgerys Creek. I believe that the Federal Airports Corporapleased tion has a monopoly on the movement of passengers, particularly international passengers, and that it wishes to maintain that monopoly. It wishes to cling to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) airport and retain it as the only international airport for the Sydney area. That allows the FAC to have an easy time with its management, it has a sure revenue base and, primarily, it does not have to at that time compete with anybody. I believe that the government must move quickly. Honourable members from western Sydney, both Labor and Liberal, believe a high priority for our nation is that construction of the second airport should begin immediately. Design work is running two years late already-it was supposed to be completed by 1992-and the $50 million allocated for design work should be used to establish a 2,900-metre runway as the basis of an international airport at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) airport. My colleague the honourable member for or Fadden (Mr Jull) has established that there is plenty of international interest in the construction and operation of an airport for Sydney.  has refused in fact to meet passenger demand. Its figures demonstrate that. It does not want· competition operating in a modem passenger conscious society. It is full of reasons why the whole thing should not and cannot happen. It keeps changing the dates by which the international airport will be needed. It wants to revel in its monopoly power; it wants to defy the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works and its recommendations; it has neglected the Olympics completely. Like Telecom or like Kerry Packer, it wants to retain monopoly interest in its set areas and the consumers of Australia be blowed. I believe that it is time that the minister and the government changed their minds. (TIme",42
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Jull-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,43
37,Mr HOLLIS,SOUTH WALES,"I am to speak on this motion moved by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). My main interest is in the third part of the motion, which endorses the immediate construction of a private-public airport at Badgerys Creek with a full international capacity, including a 2,900-metre runway. The government has agreed to a general purpose airport at Badgerys Creek at a cost of around $50 million for stage 1. This proposal is useless; It will not be a proper passenger airport or proper freight airport. It will not have the capacity or the facility to be anything but a gigantic and very expensive white elephant. My suggestion, and this comes from chairing the public works committee inquiry into Badgerys Creek airport, is that we immediately proceed with the construction of an international freight airport. This would necessitate the construction of a 2,900-metre runway and the related work. I would recommend that the honourable member for Mitchell, or anyone else interested, read the report from the public works committee, where we detail the arguments about why we support this proposal. If the government cannot or will not fund this, we should go to private industry for the funding. I have never been opposed to anyone making a buck. If the government or the FAC cannot see that there is money to be made there, they should get out of the way of those who can see the potential, who have the vision to see the potential there, and the government should move to stop the FAC blocking those who have this vision. I take a slightly different view from many of my colleagues on the question of the second Sydney airport. I do not live in the vicinity of a flight path, and maybe that is why I have the luxury of taking a slightly different point of view. But I believe that Kingsford Smith, especially with the construction of the new parallel runway, will be able to handle the projected passenger traffic until the year 2015 or 2020. That is only the passenger facilities. What we need is an international freight airport and an airport that. can deal with charter aircraft. Australia has not scratched the surface of charter flights, especially with the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. It is essential that we have an international airport at Badgerys Creek. Over the coming years I believe the charter industry will be the growth sector of the tourist industry, yet through our short sightedness we have the potential to miss out once again. I am very tired of being told by so-called experts that there is only one freight flight per week generated by Kingsford Smith. If this is true, our next question should be: why is this so? Yet the FAC runs around quoting this as if it were some holy writ, instead of being embarrassed by the lack of facilities for freight and its lack of skill and success in promoting the freight market. We are supposed to be the clever country, supposed to be competing in Asia, supposed to see our future is in the Asia region. We are not very clever about this airport. We do have a market in Asia, but it is a market that in the main we have yet to discover. It always amazes me why we in Australia never project into the future, why we react to events, rather than anticipating them. The airport question is a typical example. In a few years time, when Kingsford Smith airport is congested with freight, charters and passengers, and when we have a mickey mouse project at Badgerys Creek, which will be the worse of all worlds, whatever government is in power-whether it be us or honourable members on the other side-will commission a study, probably by some Americans, into solutions to the use of our airspace and airports. After spending millions of taxpayers' dollars, these consultants will tell us that to fully compete in Asia we must make the best use of our airspace and to achieve that or to achieve our full potentialthis should have been some 20 years earlierwe should have constructed an international freight airport that could also have taken charters. They will tell us that in 20 years time. It will cost millions of dollars for them to tell us that. Then the government will probably set up another committee, a ministerial committee, backed by someone outside, or perhaps a backbench committee as well, to consider the report on not only the international freight airport but all the. necessary infrastructure. That is what we also have to have. It is not just an airport. But it will all be 20 years too late. The planes will have left, taking with them all the opportunities which we have missed. That unfortunately is always the story of Australia. For once, just once, can we not look ahead. Let us for once in our lives anticipate. Let us look 20 years down the track, not wait for events to overtake us and then try to feebly respond as we always do. What is proposed at Badgerys Creek will not be successful. The aircraft operators do not wish to move from Kingsford Smith and the FAC cannot or will  erys Creek successful because it cannot take jet aircraft, so it is in a catch-22 situation. cannot promote Badgerys Creek because it has absolutely nothing to promote. Business is moving west in Sydney and a freight airport at Badgerys Creek would support this. We have this business of only one freight flight because we have never funded it. .We have never had an integrated transport network or indeed a transport plan in this country; that is a plan covering rail, road, sea and air. I heard earlier some honourable members talking about regional development. If ever anything is crying out in the regional areas in Australia it is development. As the honourable member said earlier, we should stop this nonsense of parochialism and lookat regions from a global perspective. Now, about the area I represent: I have recently made a submission to the Kelty inquiry and I was promoting Badgerys Creek. I was also promoting-the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) will be pleased to know-the inland port at Parkes because I see those things all linked to the area that I represent. They should be linked. Badgerys Creek should be linked to the coast, to the port of Kembla, by rail, with the MaldonDombarton rail link, and we should have decent road works to the inland port of Parkes which I have always supported. I mean, this is taking a really regional point of view and that is where Badgerys Creek fits into this whole integrated transport network in Australia. . The short-sightedness of Australians staggers me. We make much about being part of Asia. But we look immediately to our north and there we have Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation on earth. We have got China, the most populous nation on earth. We have got India, the second most populous nation. All these are in our region. Nowthese people are promoting their industry but what they cannot do, and they will not be able to do in the foreseeable future given their. increased living standard, is feed themselves. We are ideally placed in this country to be able to do that. When people go to Indonesia-many of my colleagues go to Indonesia-they sit down to breakfast in a hotel in Indonesia and their It orange juice is from the United States; their butter is from Denmark; if they have a bit of cheese it is from France; if they have a bit of fruit after it, it is probably from New Zealand. Here we are the closest neighbour and we are sending no Australian produce there. Why is that? It is because we are being too short sighted to get in and develop these markets. We have not got the freight facilities for that. We should have a couple of freight planes going into Indonesia a day, not one out of Kingsford Smith a week. That is the advantage of Badgerys Creek. People should look at Badgerys Creek, at where it is. It is placed close to the motorway. It is true that other infrastructure· will be needed there. From that area that the honourable member for Parkes represents and all that other south-eastern area of New South Wales we could be bringing produce up there every day, putting it on a freighter and taking it out to the markets of Asia. But we are going to miss this opportunity.  proven. It will wait forever, because this cannot proved. For once, we have to take it on faith, and it can be successful. That is why Australia. I almost said 'will miss the bus'will miss the aeroplane. If we have to wait for it to be proven, it will be, as I said, 20 years too late: we will not be able to get in there and we will not be able to have the infrastructure. For once, let us have this faith, this belief, in ourselves, let us stop all this nonsense and talk, and let u.. build Badgerys Creek. If we cannot do it, private industry should be invited to do so. .",43
38,Mr JULL,SOUTH WALES,"I commend the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) for what I believe is the most visionary speech ever given by a member of this government in my entire period of service in this House. It was a magnificat speech. I also congratulate the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) for bringing on this motion today, because it is a most important one indeed. The fact that the Olympic Games have been granted to Sydney, I suppose, focuses the need for improvement in our infrastructure over the coming months and years. While that is an important part, the reality is that, even if the Olympic Games had not gone to Sydney, we would need a new airport facility at Badgerys Creek, with full international capacity, by the end of this decade. Natural growth is going to require this, and I have no compunction in agreeing with the honourable member for Throsby that, if the Federal Airports Corporation and the government are not prepared to put their money where there mouth is in the development of this facility, the private sector should be allowed to do so. In the last federal election, the opposition parties had, as part of their policy, the immediate development of Badgerys Creek as an international airport facility. We had spent some years examining the needs of Sydney airport and the future growth, and we also spent some years examining how this would be financed. There is no doubt that it is almost impossible for governments today to come up with the sort of money that will be required to build that full international strucinfrastructural ture. Overseas at the moment the development of new airports is being left to major international consortia, and there are some very good examples of it. Istanbul, for example, has a new airport facility that was developed by private consortia. There are new airports in Alaska that have been developed by private consortia. I spent some time speaking to a few organisations that I thought would be interested in the development of Badgerys Creek. The interesting thing was that they were and that they had already done a great deal of homework on the development of Badgerys Creek, without, I suppose, too many people in Australia knowing. My suggestion to government would be that, as a first step, it should advertise as soon as possible for expressions of interest in the development of Badgerys Creek to full international standard, to just see what comes out of the woodwork. The government would be absolutely amazed at the reaction that it would get, because there is a realisation that Australia is becoming a major growth destination in the Asia-Pacific region. As I have quoted in this House before, even on pure tourism terms, if 140 million Asians are going to travel offshore by the year 2000 for their holidays and we get one per cent of that business, we cannot handle it. The reality is that 62 per cent of the business is going to come through Sydney. The reality is that, even with the third runway, Sydney airport is going to be very tight by 1998-99. There are problems with the future development of terminal facilities in Sydney, and I think there is a realisation throughout the aviation community that we do need the third runway but, most importantly, we need the development of Badgerys Creek at the same time if we are going to be able to pick up those pressures. It is true that a lot of infrastructure would have to be provided for Badgerys Creek airport. Prior to the election, the opposition gave a commitment that it was prepared to put the money up-I think the figure was some $50 million, initially-with the New South Wales government to look at those requirements. We are going to need high-speed rail links. We are going to need some massive roadworks put in place. But that will be the area where government can become involved at both a state and federal level. We will not be spending a cent if we go to the private arrangement on Badgerys Creek, in terms of the construction of that airport, and there will be an opportunity for us to help, for the state, local and federal governments to get in there to make sure that the infrastructure is right. The development of the population in western Sydney indicates that it could almost do with an airport now. As the honourable member for Throsby has mentioned, the freight prospects for Australia mean that we are going to need that airport within the next couple of years. If we are going to have true development of international tourism, we are going to need a facility other ford Smith arrangement, and that will become even more imperative as we get closer to the holding of the Olympic Games. The real option is to contract out Badgerys Creek and to do it as soon as we possibly can. The government should be advertising this week for expressions of interest. If the present government will not do it, we will certainly do it when we get into government.",45
39,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SOUTH WALES," I cannot believe that the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) could make the speech he just made and keep a straight face. The duplicity involved in that speech is breathtaking. The honourable member for Fadden knows, as other honourable members of this House know, that the thing that killed Badgerys Creek was the third runway at Sydney airport. The greatest exponent in this House of the third runway at Sydney airport was the honourable member for Fadden. He was out there day and night peddling the third runway. He knows, and every other honourable member knows, that that is what killed Badgerys Creek. For the honourable member for Fadden to come in here now and say that it is his and the opposition's policy to build an airport at Badgerys Creek is just breathtakflights, ing in its dishonesty. As my colleagues and I on this side of the House foretold in the development programs of Sydney airport and the third runway, what we have to come to terms with now is the fact that, when it was decided to build the third runway, the Federal Airports Corporation put all its eggs in one basket. The fact that millions of dollars have been invested in the third runway and the associated infrastrucallow ture of the airport has meant that the FAC does not have the money to build another airport around Sydney in the foreseeable future. Not only does the FAC not have the money, but it does not want to build it. Some 50 per cent of the revenue for all the public airports in Australia operated by the FAC comes from Sydney airport. Congestion at Sydney airport is money in the till for the FAC. It is not the least bit interested in seeing an airport built that will take away the great cash cow that is than the Kings- Sydney airport. However, as usual the FAC also has a hidden agenda. The cash cow only works for two-thirds of the day, but the FAC wants to be able to run Sydney airport for 24 hours a  with the curfew at Sydney airport and not to do anything about building an airport at Badgerys Creek. Basically, the FAC's attitude to the people who live around Sydney, to use a flying metaphor, can be summed up in terms of that infamous line in the movie Flying High: as far as the FAC is concerned, the people who live around Sydney airport 'bought their tickets, so let them die!'. What the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and the honourable member for Fadden did not mention is that the FAC and the CAA have been blatantly breaching the noise abatement guidelines of Sydney airport for some time now. Indeed, the Civil Aviation Authority has publicly stated that it has instructed air traffic controllers systematically to breach the noise abatement guidelines. Why? The only reason is that the rapacious airline industry continually refuses to stop parallel scheduling of and so that means that there is conges industry know full well that there is little likelihood of a second airport now that the third runway has been constructed at Sydney airport. I agree with the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that there ought to be an international freight operation at Badgerys Creek. If that were to happen, that would the CAA to act honestly, because at present deliberate deceit is involved in its reclassifying Boeing 737 aircraft, which are noisy aircraft, as allegedly low noise aircraft, so that they can operate inside the curfew hours at Sydney airport. I would agree that there is merit in a public-private consortium developing Badgerys Creek. There is merit in there being some competition for this very fat and very lazy GBE called the Federal Airports Corporation. There is also great merit in relocating the freight operation from Sydney (Kingsford Smith) airport to Badgerys Creek. But let us not have any of the hypocrisy of the honourable member for Fadden (Me lull) who suggests that somehow or other the opposition is going to do something about this. If the opposition wanted to do something about it, it should not have supported the third runway at Sydney Airport. If anything has killed Badgerys Creek and any sensible operation out there it has been the one, single, solitary fact that that runway is now pushing its way out into Botany Bay. He knows that, and we know that. Let us have a bit of truth in this debate.",47
40,Mr COBB,SOUTH WALES,"I support the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who has moved this motion here today; the shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr lull); and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who have all spoken eloquently on this matter. I believe the government has dragged its feet on both the issue of the third parallel runway and the second airport at Badgerys Creek. Had the coalition been in power federally, we would have had that third parallel runway started in the early 1980s and completed now. At least it is progressing now. It is sad to see that grubby politics in the surrounding Labor seats, for all the wrong reasons, have delayed that project to the cost of us all. I was pleased to see the honourable member for Throsby acknowledge the need for both. A third runway at Kingsford Smith airport will ease congestion at that airport, and will extend the life of it for passengers. As is contrary to what was said by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), I believe-as did the previous speakers-that a second airport is also needed at Badgerys Creek; and the time to be starting to build it is now. That airport will be curfew free. There is a great deal of infrastructure that needs to go with it: a superhighway into the city, a rail link and those types of things. As the honourable member for Throsby so ably highlighted, not only could we land international flights there, but it would also give us the wherewithal to develop the air freight industry in and out of this country, particularly into the Asian region. It would open up possibilities for regional Australia to get marine industry products and horticultural products-whether they be flowers, fruit or whatever-into niche markets in those countries in short periods of time. High prices are often commanded by these types of products, and these opportunities are slipping by us while we are dragging our feet on this issue. A second airport would ease the traffic at Kingsford Smith airport, and it would generate the new business opportunities that I have mentioned. I think the Federal Airports . Corporation has got to see this. The corporation has to drag itself into the 20th century, let alone the 21st century; and I believe the federal government should be giving it a nudge to do this. The government should, if necessary, override the stultified thinking of the FAC, which seems only to be protecting its monopoly in this area. . I am a person who lives in country New South Wales and I fly into Kingsford Smith on many occasions. Like many other passengers, I am sick and tired of flying around in circles for 10 minutes or 20minutes, waiting to land, burning up valuable aviation fuel and costing time and money in every way. Even when one is flying out one is often stacked up in queues on the ground for 10 or 20 minutes-up to half an hour, at times. Last year, Kingsford Smith took 15 million passengers. This year it will take about 16.5 million passengers. It is projected that next year it will take about 18 million passengers, and by 1996 it will be taking 20 million passengers. About 12 million of those will originate from Kingsford Smith airport. That is a very high trigger for a second airport to be built and to be operating. If we are going to have it built by 1996, the time to be starting it is now, because it will take at least three years. If we are going to build one, we do not want the 1,800-metre strip the FAC is proposing. We need a 2,900-metre strip in 1996, and not by the year 2015 as the FAC is proposing. The need is urgent to complete the third parallel runway at Kingsford Smith airport. The need is equally urgent to start the Badgerys Creek airport with a long 2,900-metre runway now. Both should be operating by the end of this century, and we should be proud to display these developments to people from the rest of the world when they fly in for the year 2000 Olympics.",48
41,Mr HAVILAND,SOUTH WALES," I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this motion but, although I whole-eartedly support its first and third points, cannot in all honesty support the second point about the third runway. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) began by attacking the government and in particular some honourable members-he was referring to the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay)-for their opposition to the third runway. Let me say that I supported, and still do, the stance taken by those honourable members-and by almost every local government in the Sydney area-opposing the third runway. As the honourable member for Watson pointed out, that was the reason why the proposal for an airport at Badgerys Creek was put back. However, that decision was taken four years ago, and I obviously accept the reality of the decision taken by the government in its wisdom, and we are now having the third runway. Nevertheless, in 1993 there is still an overwhelming and pressing need to construct an international airport at Badgerys Creek. I am talking about, of course, the 2,900-metre runway and not about the small facility currently on the drawing board and supported by the Federal Airports Corporation. On the subject of the Federal Airports Corporation, I very seriously question the role of a government business enterprise which, on one hand, has a charter to be profitable, it is out of Sydney airport, and, on the other hand, to be advising the government on aviation policy. There is clearly a conflict interest there in terms of its providing the government with policy advice on what is in the best interests of the nation with regard to aviation transport and infrastructure while at the same time its bottom line is to make money. I am looking forward to the upcoming Public Accounts Committee inquiry where this issue will be looked at in some detail by the committee, of which I am a member. I would like to talk about the great benefits that will come from, Badgerys Creek in terms of employment, infrastructure and regional development. We heard in a previous debate honourable members talking about regional development on the north coast. Indeed, there I were comparisons drawn between the population on the north coast and Tasmania, but western Sydney and south-western Sydney already have twice as many people as Tasmania. Badgerys Creek airport is a much-awaited initiative which will boost employment in a time of high unemployment, and will provide a much-needed opportunity for infrastructure, industry development, other transport links that will inevitably come-such as roads and rail-and the capital works that will not only create jobs but also provide real economic efficiencies in western Sydney. I am talking about the benefits, not just in the parochial sense of my electorate-it includes Badgerys Creek-but for the whole of western Sydney and New South Wales and, for that matter, Australia. There are also obvious benefits for urban planning. We have programs such as building better cities and other urban development projects, although obviously I would not be advocating building houses right near Badgerys Creek airport, because there would then be the same problem as there is at Kingsford Smith airport. But I believe that considerable investment in the airport would lead to jobs and would facilitate better urban planning in the general south-western Sydney region. This would mean that the urban sprawl that we are which already getting-courtesy of the New South Wales government-without proper infrastructure and community facilities, would be able of to be much better planned, and a real community could be built out there. That is another reason why it is imperative that we get on with developing the airport.",49
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WALES,"Mr Newell)Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted.  of sight, out of mind: that is how this government seems to treat Western Australia when there is not an election in the wind. With the government's self-interest focusing its attention on New South Wales, it is hardly surprising that even now there are occasional rumblings and mutterings from secessionists in the west. But what is surprising, given the government's focus on the most populous state, is that it is happy to ignore what was once a very important part of New South Wales. I am talking about Albany, in my electorate of Forrest. Captain George Vancouver claimed the western part of the continent when he explored the Albany area in 1791. In 1826, Major Edmund Lockyer occupied the area on behalf of the colony of New South Wales, so Albany became not only the first settlement in the continent's west but also the westernmost town in New South Wales. Albany, in strategic terms, was a very important part of the young colony of New South Wales. It was very important, because, as with much of Australia's settlement by the British, the settlement of Albany was a case of beating the French to it. Let me explain to honourable members what this means. At present, we have six states and two territories making up a single and generally harmonious Commonwealth, united under one flag and one language. If France had claimed part of Australia, instead of those states and territorcentury ies now debating things such as uniform schooling and land management, we would have a divided continent with different flags, a different system of government and a different official language. Just imagine the sorts of problems the federal government would be having with the French farmers in the GATT round if they were literally in the same continent. That example may seem far-fetched, but I use it to illustrate the historical national importance of Albany. But Albany has a lot more history than just being the place the British beat the French to. It is a picturesque town on the Princess Royal Harbour, part of the magnificent King George Sound. It has a Albany rich hinterland, and during the last century was Western Australia's most important port. Control of the settlement was transferred from New South Wales to the newly «stablished Swan River colony in March 1831. In the same year, Albany became a free settlement and the town was planned and laid out for development into a prosperous, solid, stable community. Reflecting that intended permanence, Albany has many fine historic buildings. Many of these buildings were constructed of stone by local craftsmen, helped by convict labour. These same buildings give Albany a great deal of character and are a constant reminder of the town's rich history. If fate and politics had not played a hand, Albany might today have been one of Australia's largest and most important cities. In fact, Major Lockyer, who settled Albany, favoured developing the town as the capital of the west. Another claim to historical fame is that Albany was the site of the very first dawn service for the ANZACs. This was held by local rector, Reverend White, on Mount Clarence, to honour and give heart to the first Australian and New Zealand contingents heading off to World War I from their assembly point at King George Sound. Albany became a vital staging port for the ANZAC troop carriers during the First World War and that first service set a tradition that is still honoured today. However, the advent of large steamships and the decision at the tum of the to establish Fremantle as the major steamer port in Western Australia created a trading slump for Albany. The town pulled itself back to prosperity with the lucrative whaling industry, and was the site of the last shore based whaling enterprise in the southern hemisphere until its closure in 1978. More recently, an equally promising tuna industry has been ruined by the federal government's inept handling of tuna quotas, and now the federal government is threatening to snuff out the area's fledgling wine industry with a 55 per cent increase in the sales tax on wine. I earlier complained about this government's out of sight, out of mind attitude towards the west. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is responsible for the national heritage. As such, she surely has a responsibility to Albany to help the town preserve and recapture the charm of its past. Much has been done by the people of Albany but a great deal more needs to be done to restore not only a significant part of the history of Western Australia but also a very important part of the history of New South Wales. The minister must realise that her responsibility for national heritage means that she should at least give Albany the same kind of consideration governments of the past gave to Port Arthur. As yet, though, I have been disappointed in the minister's response to Albany. As the federal member, I wrote to the minister in 1990 pointing out Albany's case for the kind of consideration which had been given to Port Arthur. The historical Tasmanian town had, in the seven years to 1986, received state and federal funding of $9 million for a major conservation and development project to restore its convict history and secure its place on the nation's tourism itineraries. I told the minister that I was keen to see a similar program to preserve and to restore one of Australia's most historic towns, Albany. A great deal of conservation and restoration already had been done in Albany. For example, in 1983 the town had begun overseeing the restoration of the Princess Royal Fortress, a defence establishment dating back to 1893. The town needed a heritage register, listing buildings of historical significance which needed restoration, so that a list of funding priorities could be established. I pointed out that the most appropriate means of funding would involve state, federal and local government grants, backed by community support. Indeed, I advised the minister that a Commonwealth contribution of two dollars for every dollar raised locally, similar to Port Arthur's funding process, would encourage considerable local support. I asked the minister to evaluate this proposal with a view to formal application for funding in 1991-92. I also suggested that she visit Albany so that she could see for herself, first hand, how important it was for the town's history to be preserved. In reply, the minister was quick to point out that the Port Arthur project was a one-off and that there would be no similar funding for Albany. Still, the town decided to go ahead without the minister's support and in 1991 applied for grants under the National Estate grants program. All three grant applications were rejected. The year 1991 also was the bicentenary of Vancouver's exploration of the Albany area. Again I wrote to the minister, inviting her to take part in the celebrations. Again the response was negative. A third letter to the minister brought a slightly different response. In July 1991, I was told I would be contacted when a suitable opportunity arose for the minister to visit Albany. It is now October 1993 and I am still waiting for that opportunity to arise. The minister is apparently more occupied with preselection matters and Olympic trips. In the words of a letter I received from the Albany shire in 1991: What's new? From responses received from the Treasurer, other federal ministers and their department heads, it would seem no-one in the eastern states is prepared to acknowledge the significant of Vancouver to this nation. I might add that the celebrations I mentioned were a tremendous success, despite the official lack of interest. Albany swallowed its disappointment and continued to go it alone, restoring the town hall, the forts, the old gaol and the historic precincts of Stirling Terrace and York Street, with the help of small grants, local government and community involvement. The old hospital is now the Vancouver Arts Centre, while one of the town's earliest buildings, the Patrick Taylor cottage, has been converted into a local museum. If the minister undertook to give Albany the kind of special consideration it deserves,the spin-offs to the town would be enormous. Albany has great potential, with its combination of a rich history and natural beauty, to develop a significant tourism industry. Albany really is a special place. Its natural scenery and splendid heritage make it a town which should be right on the top of the list of people that draw up the tourism itineraries around Australia. I again ask the minister to visit Albany to see the tremendous work that the local community has done, and show the people of Albany that she is interested in preserving the national heritage, even though they are on the other side of the country to her. The people of Albany have achieved much, but without the Commonwealth government playing its part, I fear the tremendous tourism opportunities of this town may be lost. Housing Industry Association",50
43,Mr GIBSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In a speech that I made in May of this year in this place I outlined my concerns about a political campaign that had been run during the March federal election campaign by the organisation called the Housing Industry Association, better known as the HIA. In that speech I outlined the way in which an organisation which is supposed to be an objective independent industry association conducted a very strong party political campaign against certain candidates for the Labor Party in certain seats around this country - I being one of them in my eltctorate of Moreton. Soon after that I was accused by the executive director of the HIA, Dr Silberberg, of engaging in a political vendetta. He said that I was seeking to punish him and his organisation because they dared to take a contrary position to that of the government. In fact, that was not my position. I was, in fact, making the point in that speech that the HIA misused its members' money in conducting that campaign and that it had alleged to its members that it would be a non-party political campaign. It said it would be based purely on arguing about a piece of legislation, yet at the time of the election in March it engaged in a very strong political campaign .in which it gave endorsement to conservative candidates and opposed Labor candidates in various seats. Since the time of that speech when I outlined my concerns about the operations of the HIA, I have received an enormous amount of information from organisations representing thousands of house owners who .have suffered grievously at the hands of the HIA and organisations or building companies that are members of the HIA. In fact, my file since May would be over six inches thick with submissions and letters and complaints that I have received from people all around this country who have suffered because of problems of corruption, extortion and unfair practices in the building industry that have been perpetrated by builders and building companies. The reason I wish to speak today is to outline some of the concerns of thoseorganisations and to highlight the fact that there is a continuing exposure of problems with the Housing Industry Association. I think it is very important that the government take note of these problems and respond with some positive action to deal with some of the matters that I am about to raise. In all of the very thick swag of complaints I have received there is a whole host of disparate issues that have emerged. A lot of them are not the responsibility of the federal parliament and I acknowledge that. They are, in fact, the responsibility of state governments and state instrumentalities that have the responsibility of supervising the housing industry. But what they do is add up to a picture of very great concern about the way in which the Housing Industry Association operates and the way in which some of its members, companies and directors have conducted their affairs. It also highlights the fact that there are some real problems with the way in which representatives of the Housing Industry Association-all its members are companies which are in the building industry for private profit-are also on a number of government instrumentalities which are supposed to supervise the building industry and are supposed to be there to protect consumer interests. There are, within the Housing Industry Association, members who are trying to wear two or three different hats and who are supposed to be providing objective advice to governments about housing industry matters, yet they are involved in personal gain in the housing industry, because they run building companies, and they are not able, I think, to divorce their personal interests as far as their companies are concerned from the more objective role that they are supposed to have in giving advice and protecting consumer interests. I think that is a very real concern that we should all have. One of the organisations that have written to me is a group called the Victims of Builders Support Group Inc., a group incorporated in Victoria. One of the members of that group has written to me outlining that group's concerns about the HIA and forwarding to me a copy of a submission that it is making to an inquiry that the Victorian Minister for Fair Trading, the Hon. Jan Wade, is conducting into the building industry in Victoria. It is horrendous to read about the problems occurring in the home building industry, about how thousands of ordinary families, ordinary people, have suffered grievously at the hands of some building companies and, in particular, about how they have suffered because of the operations and policies of the Housing Industry Association. I make that claim for one very clear reason: for construction of houses the member companies of the Housing Industry Association adopt the contract that the HIA recommends. The building contract between the building company and the family or the consumer seeking to build the home has been drawn up by the HIA. It is that contract that is the cause of so many problems in all the states. I realise that we have different organisational structures in each state, but this contact causes similar problems around the country. The major problem with this contract is that it is very biased in its provisions. Most people do not have legal experience to understand what a contract means. That is why I stress the great importance of any person who is about to sign a contract with a builder getting independent legal advice about the terms and conditions of that contract. The HIA recommended contract is very biased in favour of the builder. It enables builders to be paid for work that they do not do. The clauses in this contract are so biased in favour of the builder that the consumer has very little redress. There is very little sanction against the builders for their failure to comply with the contract, but there are lots of sanctions against home owners or consumers if they fail to comply. In Victoria the problem that the Victims of Builders Support Group Inc. has is that the contract refers any disputes between the home owner and the building company to compulsory arbitration. That in itself is not a bad idea, except that the arbitration system is dominated by the very building companies that are the subject of complaint. The HIA is represented in that arbitration process, so consumers are not getting an independent, objective arbitration. The people who are 'supposed to be doing that independent arbitration are in fact closely linked with the building industry. That is a problem we have throughout the country. A lot of the organisations that have been set up by state governments allegedly to be independent and to protect the interests of consumers are in fact dominated by representatives of the building industry and the HIA. We also have problems with the way in which some of the member companies of the HIA have operated on boards and with the fact that there is a cross-fertilisation of directorships between individual member companies of the HIA and the HIA's own organisations and companies. There is a concern about the failure to separate interests of the separate companies. Allegations are being made to me, and information is being sent to me, that public moneys that have been provided to companies to undertake work on behalf of governments in researching housing industry issues have in fact been diverted into private profit by certain members. That is a serious allegation which I believe needs to be examined. The real problem is the incestuous relationship that exists in the housing industry. We also have a problem with the way in which the Housing Industry Association has sought to separate itself from the work it did in the election campaign with the political donors list. I understand it is now seeking to revise its submission to the Australian Electoral Commission on the donations that it received and the way in which it expended money in the election campaign. (TIme expired) Small Business",52
44,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I take the opportunity today to grieve on behalf of the small business community. Small business is not insignificant within Australia but, after a very debilitating budget for that sector, it appears that all the government is prepared to do is to run around the countryside giving small business awards. Whilst I do not want to be recorded as being critical of this mechanism of recognising those who achieve in the small business sector, it is not a solution to the real problems. There are some 693,000 small businesses outside of the agricultural sector and 106,000 small businesses within the agricultural sector-799,000 small businesses out of a total 844,000 businesses; in other words, 95 per cent. Of these businesses, 273,000 employ fewer than 10 people and 39,000 employ between 10 and 49 people. In the two years February 1991 to February 1993 medium and large businesses shed 275,000 jobs while small businesses added about 135,000 jobs. In other words, small business is a very significant contributor to employment in the recession we had to have. In many ways small businesses have been hampered in expanding their ability to employ people. One of the most notable examples is the compulsory superannuation guarantee charge that was imposed upon them. Many had avoided the union type schemes because they were not subject to awards. Small business people have been hit very hard. Chamber of Commerce figures show that about 60,000 people lost their jobs as a consequence of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge. More concerning is that some 140,000 of those businesses have not submitted superannuation guarantee charge money. Most of them have failed to do so simply because they lack the money to pay people superannuation. They are confronted with the choice of either sacking the people to whom they have to pay this superannuation or ignoring that the scheme exists. I want to grieve about many of the factors affecting small business. I want to grieve in particular about the effect that regulation has upon these businesses and draw the parliament's attention to a recent survey conducted by the ABS. In a case study of some 224 individual companies it was found that a high percentage of respondents felt that the government forms were 'very difficult to complete'. Nearly 50 per cent of those interviewed felt that the volume of paperwork had risen over the past three years. More than half of those regarded the increase as significant. The Australian Taxation Office was the worse culprit, according to business. Forms relating to fringe benefits tax, sales tax, company tax and payroll tax were considered to .be the most common types of forms and often the most difficult to complete. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) is reported as promising that he is going to do something about all of this and as sayipg that he is consulting with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to have a combined attack on government regulation. That sort of thing has been said in so many parliaments by people of both political colours for so long that it is not funny. I would like the House to know that quite some years ago I prepared an attack on regulation. I proposed putting sunset clauses into the regulations we provide for. The tax agents association has recently circulated members with an interesting press release pointing out how difficult it is, under substantiation arrangements today and with the information provided by the tax office, to get a tax return right. It gives examples of people who have had audits under substantiation and indicates how few of them have not had adjustments to their tax return in a negative way. Ninety-four per cent of miscellaneous professions who had tax audits had their taxes adjusted by an average amount of $500. Ninety per cent of specialist managers had adjustments of an average of $3,300. For lump sum payments and terminations adjustments it was $7,200 on average. The point that I am making here is that, and as these people say, all these people are not dishonest; they are not tax cheats. They are just unable to handle the regulatory system. I mention the case of a person who has painted houses for 20 years in the country areas of my electorate. Obviously he has satisfied his clients or he would have gone out of business years ago. He has now been roped in under some new state government regulation relating to the registration of painters and told he cannot paint any more. His job, his livelihood, has been taken away from him by a state regulation put up on the basis that people have to beprotected from individuals like him. It is totally unnecessary that we have this level of regulation. I can assure the House that we will never· hear about the minister's promises again. ABS figures show that small business increased employment by four per· cent. I have drawn attention to that. Medium sized business shed four per cent and big business saw employment fall by one per cent. While all that was going on and while sales growth was fairly consistent across all sizes of business, averaging five per cent, small business profits plunged by 22 per cent compared with a seven per cent drop for medium business and a 10 per cent drop for big business. Small business was the big loser, but in the current election policy who got the tax cuts? Big business did. The incorporated companies got a 33 per cent tax rate; small business was left to battle on with all the problems that I am raising today. It is outrageous. It is time that people started to put their money where their mouth is as far as small business is concerned. Everybody knows the value of small businesses to the community. More importantly, everybody knows their value to employment. Yet nobody does anything for them, except of course, as this budget has done, add dramatically to their costs. The Road Transport Forum has been one of the first to explain how difficult it is going to be. It says that the costs of road transport operators will rise by about $200 a week because of the increased tax burden. Many will not be able to pass on the huge cost increases. All they will be able to do is feed less to their family. It is silly and it is wrong that we should have this sort of thing going on. Now the government is doing a deal with that monolithic bureaucracy called the ACTU. The ACTU is long past being an employee representative group. It is now a self-generating bureaucracy. It has done a deal with the government to guarantee power over everyhouse body. We are going to see further abuse of constitutional rules and conventions for the purpose of giving the Commonwealth further powers. The founding fathers did not want to give the Commonwealth any powers but eventually decided to give it power-over conciliation and arbitration. The Commonwealth is going to tell small businesses-people who employ one and two people, those 273,000 who employ fewer than lO-to make an agreement with a worker they probably call Bob or Bill and who comes to their place for tea occasionally. One can never recognise the boss in most small businesses. He looks very much like the employees. But he has to go off to the Industrial Relations Commission just to compete with the big guys. Today small business grocers and small business delicatessens are in desperate competition with Coles, Woolworths and the big supermarkets. The big companies have their industrial officers to go into the Industrial Relations Commission to do deals and stitch everything up. How does the guy behind his delicatessen counter get his apron off and go off to the commission so that he can get the same competitive advantage through the commission as the big guys will get? The government is legislating for big unions and for big business. It is absolute farce for the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) to be running around the countryside giving out small business awards. These people want a bit of fairness. They certainly do not want a deal that prevents them from making wage arrangements that are similar to those made by their big-time competitors who have all the advantages that are quite obvious to everyone. Small business people are the only people creating jobs in the community, and the government wants to make them so inefficient that they all close down and jobs disappear in the process. It is only small business that employ people. Big business today goes and buys a computer or it buys a machine. It is small business, which lacks the capital to do that, which will create employment. I have never seen any worse approach than this industrial relations deal fixing up the ACTU bureaucracy and killing the. opportunity for small business to compete. (TIme expired) Superannuation",54
45,Mr JOHNS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I pick up the theme of investment and savings in Australia. This government is striving to increase the nation's savings, particularly through the vehicle of superannuation. Released at 11.30 this morning by the Australian Bureau of Statistics were figures on the assets of superannuation funds and approved deposit funds for the June quarter 1993. I am pleased to be able to say to honourable members that the money held in Australia's nest egg-that is, in our superannuation funds-as of 30 June 1993 had reached $169 billion. Explicitly because of government policy money is being built up for the purposes of not only a higher retirement income for workers but also an improvement in the nation's savings. We· have a compulsory scheme underwritten by a superannuation guarantee charge that drives money into superannuation funds to be invested on behalf of workers. That money will be made available for Australia's investment for the long haul and will also be made available for workers in retirement, giving them a higher income in retirement than would otherwise have been the case. I am very pleased to announce these ABS. figures today that indicate a significant and continuing boost to the nation's nest egg. The last figures that were recorded showed an amount of $162.7 billion. The figures released today show the assets of superannuation funds and approved deposit funds as $169.17 billion. There are a couple of reasons for this increase: firstly, a rising share market; and, secondly, contributions being made to superannuation funds prior to the end of the financial year to take advantage of the higher will tax deduction and to satisfy superannuation guarantee charge obligations. I think the next release of figures will show an even bigger increase, taking into account the fact that the final date for payment of the sac will fall in the September quarter. We need to compare those figures with those of just a decade ago. Ten years ago superannuation assets stood at just $32.6 billion. The figure for the June quarter in 1992 was $154 billion. In other words, over the 1992-93 financial year contributions to, and earnings of, superannuation funds totalled just over $15 billion, or an increase of almost 10 per cent. After 30 June 1994, when contributions under the sac are to be made quarterly, we will begin to see a regular and rising injection of money into superannuation funds that will be both a boost to retirement benefits of workers and a fillip for national savings. This is money that, in most cases"" would not have been put away but for government policy, and I stress that. We did not leave it to the free will of the individual whether or not money would be put away for retirement incomes. We have had an enormous shift in culture on the question of retirement incomes in this country in the last few years. Workers had expected that, regardless of what they did about their retirement income, when they came to retire they would pick up a government pension. For all the reasons we have heard a million times, we cannot expect the generosity of a government pension 20 years hence when the numbers of retirees relying on the taxes of the then workers will be so great that we may not be able to satisfy everyone. It has taken an enormous shift of policy and it will continue to take an enormous shift in the culture of the savings of Australians to ensure that today's taxpayers put away some money for their own retirement. There are two mechanisms that we use in order to ensure that. We give a tax benefit for money being put away in superannuation and we also compulsorily force employers to put away a percentage of earnings on behalf of workers and that percentage is going to rise from three or five per cent at the moment right through to nine per cent. At some point in the future, as yet unspecified, we will be asking employees also to make a contribution. Employees would argue, if honourable members were to ask them right now, that they have, in fact, made the initial contributions. They may be right. It is not a debate we need to hold. We do not need to have people fix on the minute detail of the sorts of changes that we have been writing as a government. This is very essential detail about the prudential protection of superannuation funds. Those sorts of rules will have an effect on funds but most workers will never get to look at the detail, nor do they need to. What they want to know is: are my funds earning well; will the money be there at the end of the day when I retire? For all intents and purposes, the government cannot back these funds, but we can give the best regulatory regime available to ensure that the funds are not misused, mismanaged, poorly invested, and so on. By the release of these figures, showing a terrific increase in the assets of super funds and ADFs, I want to get people's minds fixed on the nest egg itself. The nest egg is growing; it is growing well; it is well and intelligently invested. What is more, workers will get to know more about the assets of their own fund. They will get to follow the business of their own fund. This is a big shift. Up until three or four years ago, most workers, of course, had little concern for those sorts of matters. They expected, as a right-and that was fair enough-to get a pension at'the end of the day. They were not really aware how money was put away on their behalf for those pensions. Of course, the money was not so much put away on their behalf but drawn from current taxpayers to pay for those pensions, and that cannot go on indefinitely. This nest egg is being built up and being managed by the private sector so that we have a unique arrangement in this country whereby we have a government mandated means of pouring money into superannuation funds but a private means of management. This is very well fenced, I might say, by government regulations as to how those funds will be managed. Between the two of us-the private sector and the government sector-we think we have an excellent scheme that will ensure many more funds are contributed to savings in Australia than would otherwise have been the case. Of course, I do want to point out to honourable members that the figure of the assets of super funds and ADFs is not the same as the savings of the nation. I am not pretending to say that. Savings is a much broader question. For instance, governments can contribute to the nation's savings by marking back the amount of expenditure they have by not running such large deficits. As the Treasurer has mentioned many, many times, we haveif it does not get wrecked by the 0ppQsition in the Senate-a budget strategy that will lower the government's call on the nation's savings by lowering the government's deficit over the next three or four years. But over and above those other contributors to savings, the primary one here that will affect and will be of greatest interest to, Australian workers is superannuation funds. I might also mention to honourable members that, as part of the establishment of this regime of prudential protection for super funds, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the regulator on behalf of the government of superannuation funds, will be opening up some new offices. It is established in Sydney and Melbourne. I will be opening up an office in Brisbane, near my electorate, in the near future. The Treasurer will be opening an office in Perth in a couple of weeks time and I will be opening the Adelaide office. So those people who might have queries or even conflict between themselves and the trustees of their fund can come to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to make sure that those matters are settled fairly in the light of all the evidence and come to, early next year, a superannuation tribunal that will be able to settle any differences of opinion they might have. I want to compliment the government on the system that it has established for superannuation funds and I am very pleased to be able to reveal these figures today about Australia's growing list there. (Time expired) Trade and Economic Policy",56
46,Mr CLEARY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Those who have read just a modicum of Australian history or heard a few stories around the kitchen table would be aware of the role of the British empire in the war that left 60,000 Australian soldiers dead and 137,000 wounded between 1914 and 1918. Anyone with such knowledge would have been more than a little confused by the latest foray of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) into military history, GATT and free trade in his now famous victory speech at Villers-Bretonneux. There. was me believing Australian soldiers were thinking only of England when they rushed off to Europe to defend the cherished British Empire of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). I never thought to tell my history students that those who fought in the trenches were really defending the French in the knowledge that, 80 years later, their sacrifice would be a key bargaining chip in Australia's push for a pure international free trade regime. If the Prime Minister's latest version of history is right and, regardless of his impassioned pleas, the French do not alter their protectionist ways, we will be left with the sad conclusion that the heroic sacrifice of our soldiers was in vain. Just to further confuse matters, when the Prime Minister mounted the stump at Barcaldine last year, he presented a scenario of nationalism nurtured in the 1890s and destroyed on the shores of Gallipoli. I suppose that is the beauty of the Prime Minister. He has a penchant for keeping you guessing. Unlike the Prime Minister, the left of Australian politics has been quite consistent in saying that this was a war which was none of our business. The truth is, contrary to the myth trotted out by the Prime Minister in France, Australian soldiers on the Somme and elsewhere in Europe thought they were defending the once mighty empire, not the French. Why the Prime Minister did not stick to the script and cite the wanton loss of life that comes from tagging along with an imperial power to defend the republic leaves those who support the republic somewhat disappointed. Rewriting history in the interest of political expediency is always fraught with danger. Rewriting it to· serve the false god of free trade is political madness. The great irony is that the French actually understand their history and the role of the countryside in it. -"" They are not about to sacrifice their farming sector in the interests of free trade purity and a level playing field, which members on both sides of the House know is pure fiction. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was less interested in quibbling with the Prime Minister over his interpretation of history than he was in admonishing the Prime Minister for not taking the issue of French subsidies to the rural sector directly to President Mitterand. Despite the vitriol that flies between the dispatch boxes during question time, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition share a great faith in free trade. You can forget all the rhetoric about Captain Zero. In the final analysis, there is only a hair's breadth between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on the question of tariff protection. Aware as he was that there was nothing to be gained by painting himself as the quintessential free trader and the Prime Minister his protectionist nemesis, the Leader of the Opposition chose another tack. Excited at the prospect of engaging in some rival myth making, the Leader of the Opposition chose to challenge the Prime Minister on what he described as his soft position on human rights in China and Indonesia. I, for one, was unaware that the coalition leadership was ever interested in the rights of the East Timorese. The Leader of the Opposition should have followed the lead of Kenneth Davidson of the Age and taken the Prime Minister to task for his hypocrisy in attacking the French yet ignoring the sacrifice of the Timorese in the defence of Australia. If, as the Prime Minister claims, the French owe us something then you might ask: what do we owe the Timorese? For the Leader of the Opposition to allude to the human rights issue in Indonesia flies the face of anything the opposition has ever said or done on the question. Once the Leader of the Opposition had dispensed with a bit point scoring on the issue of human rights in Indonesia, he returned to his favourite terribility tory: economic restructuring. All he could say was that we need to put our own economic house in order. In essence, that means institutpeople, ing more of the new right/free trade policies problems. Humphrey MCQueen laid bare at the feet of the ALP leadership in The Australian on 2 October. MCQueen admits that the opposition would be worse but he leaves those members of the Labor Party who still believe that ALP is the party of social justice, or social democracy, as the Prime Minister reaffirmed yesterday, with something to think about. This partly explains the anger ment of the coalition which, in its budget post-mortem, has cried foul claiming that the Labor Party has stolen its indirect tax policies. It also partly explains why those on the back bench of the ALP who actually believe in social justice sought to have the budget tax measures modified. John Murphy takes up the story in the August-September edition of the Arena magazine. Murphy had this to say: Throughout the 80s, Keating's balancing act required him to juggle the language and stance of the true believer with the modem iconoclasm of the Fallacies', economic rationalist. As we all know, this has meant financial deregulation, restructuring the old and now dislocated working class through labour myths market programs, the abandonment of protecHe tion and the old forms of arbitration and a reduced commitment to public enterprise and progressive taxation. Modernising the econneed omy and achieving international competitiveAustralia ness has been the justification. Given compromises on the economic front, Labor now relies on the republic. Here, as Robert Manne, editor of Quadrant, and other comtrade mentators have noted, Labor has the weapon to drive a wedge between the coalition and the electorate. It is probably reasonable to say that the republic and Mabo are the two issues which now most acutely separate the ALP from the in coalition. In attaching itself to the old world of monarchs and medals, the coalition runs the risk of looking like yesteryear's political of party, something the Prime Minister has not failed to exploit. By not ruling out the possiof a referendum on Mabo and allowing the Leader of the National Party (Mr Fischer) to continue to demean the rights of Aboriginal the coalition only compounds its The establishment of a republic, important as it is in redefining our direction as a country, will not solve the economic problems that confront us. Becoming a republic and hosting the the Sydney Olympics might well make Australians feel good and give us the much needed psychological boost the marketing gurus delight in talking about, but few economists are prepared to argue that it will enand resenthance our economic position. As long as we continue to worship the free trade/economic rationalist model, and relegate the welfare of our community to an appendage of the market, the underclass will grow. Not withstanding the opposition to free trade which exists in this parliament and the community at large, to argue against it is to risk being marginalised and described as backward looking. Trevor Sykes in his article, 'Free Trade which appeared in the Bulletin on 24 August 1993, took the bit between the teeth and challenged the prevailing orthodoxy. Using evidence from the Spindler independent inquiry into tariffs, Sykes identified five associated with the free trade argument. listed them as follows: myth No. 1Australia's adoption of free trade will encourage other nations to follow suit. We hardly to argue about that one. Myth No. 2is highly protectionist. When you the cast your eye over the various forms of protection used by other countries, you quickly discover it is not true. Myth No.3-free reduces prices in Australia. There is no evidence that this is true. In any case, cheaper goods are not much use to you if you do not have a job. Myth No.4-free trade forces Australian producers to become more efficient. This of course is the great catch cry around the parliament. Sometimes, no matter how efficient you are, you just cannot compete with goods produced under conditions we would not accept in Australia. Our dumping laws pay no attention to these anomalies. International competitiveness in an Olympic sprint bears no resemblance to the production of goods. Why do you think performance enhancement drugs are prohibited? Myth No. 5-government must not disturb the free market process by intervening to help local producers. Export facilitation schemes, such as the one Sykes identifies in the car industry, run directly counter to this proposition. Australian Economic Analysis Pty Ltd, in an advertisement in the Australian on 26 August 1993, summed up the economic malaise as follows: We need to look practically, not theoretically, at the lesson of world economic history. We need to formulate a set of long term strategic goals and develop the policies-including where appropriate the required level of import protection-to attain a balanced industrial and economic structure providing long term growth. One of the great ironies associated with this debate is that, so often, honourable members in this House talk as though they believe in an interventionist approach, yet support national policies which destroy regional areas. You need only to consider what honourable members today have been saying about regional economic development to understand the contradictions We cannot have regional development, whether it is the citrus industry in the Riverina or the manufacturing belts in the major cities, if we do not protect those industries. It is time for the myth making to give way to real strategic policies. European Subsidies",58
47,Mr SNOW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Eden-Monaro) (1.20 p.m.)The entry of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) into this parliament has been a breath of fresh air, but one does not always have to agree with him to acknowledge that fact. In fact, I am rather glad he did not go to Europe with the recent delegation when we were arguing with people who were putting the point that he has just been putting to us. Fortuitously, I am going to talk briefly about some of the representations made by that delegation. The honourable member for Wills has attacked some of the representations that we were making to the European Parliament, the OECD, the Council of Europe, the European Commission and a proliferation of other European organisations. The point we made while we were there was that we need to free misdirected money which is absorbed in consumer prices and taxes, money which can be spent on unfulfilled needs of people, on investment and on job creation. It is interesting that only a few weeks ago, before we left for Europe,. an Australian wool grower came to see me. He was in his seventies and he said, 'Why can't we forget about the rest of the world and use all of our wool ourselves?'. I pointed out to him that Australia uses about two per cent of its total wool clip and that it would be very difficult for us to use all the wool ourselves. I believe that if every person in China bought one sock it would get rid of our stockpile, so it would take quite a deal of buying to get rid of the stockpile of wool, and certainly Australians would not be able to do it. In Europe consumers are paying $US85 billion in subsidies, money which could be spent, as I said, on unfulfilled needs of people, on investment and on job creation. When I talk about unfulfilled needs, I include a wide range of services which people are not getting and which they would like. They are services such as home services, aid to people and infrastructure services that people need in Europe; we need infrastructure services in Australia as well. So there are plenty of areas of investment and plenty of unfulfilled needs through which we could create jobs which would be useful. This is not to deny the point that he was making about, for instance, the French farmers who have had generation after generation of involvement in their farms. But when we visited Belgium and found that there are farmers on properties averaging 2.5 hectares and farmers who are able to live off only five or six head of cattle because of government subsidies, then it was quite clear to us that what is happening there needs to stop. We were not the only ones saying it. The annual report of the DECO, which we commented on, was saying it; most of the counF ries of Europe were saying it. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) was, the deputy leader of the delegation-I was the leader-and he forcefully persuaded the parliamentary assembly to adopt some amendments. There was a motion, for instance, altering the trerid I spoke about of the transition into the world economy and into the framework of rules and disciplines of a multilateral economic system. A delegate from Bulgaria was trying to change that draft resolution, and the right honourable member for New England successfully argued against that change. There were other points made as well. I believe that consumers in France, Belgium, Portugal, Greece and other countries can no longer afford to subsidise people to the extent that they are now. They are starting to realise it as well. It is interesting that in the new government in Japan some of the parties have resolved to get rid of some of the massive subsidies. Japan is now making welcome purchases of rice. Iricreasingly, consumers are asking their nations to recognise the need to move aw-y from some of, those subsidies. We all share a concern not only for the rural sector but for all sectors of the Agriculture is important to the French economy, and it is important to the Australian economy more than it is for any country, probably. Agricultural reform and the making of tough pecisions have been happening here in Australia. That does not mean we have been abandoning rural communities t)ecause, if we restructure properly, we gain legitimate, rural development which can be pursued without distorting trade. Now that we are on that road, we will not abandon Australians to a trading environment which is corrupted by other governments' policies. The honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) made the very important point in our discussions with the European Parliament that steak in France sold at 150 francs per kilogram and yet Australia could land it in France for 20 francs per kilogram. Iri fact, it has been established that we could put a carcass of beef on a first - class seat in an aeroplane, take it to France and still sell it more cheaply to the French people than if they were providing it for themselves. We learnt that Germany is paying its own miners $200 per tonne for coal. We can land coal in Germany for $54 per tonne. That sort of situation is ridiculous. I say to the honourable member for Wills, who has properly represented his people, that we need to seek a constructive way to undertake rHorm, because in the end money misdirected is l;lUrtful to people. In the end it affects employment and it affects the national economy. Because it affects the international economy and causes, in quite a lot of cases, flagging economies, it affects jobs. We have made important progress in Europe through a range of measures. We now have a situation where the Uruguay Round is, I believe, close to a solution and there are positive outcomes evident. The people in Europe recognised the points that we were making. In fact, there was very little opposition. When the right honourable member for New England successfully opposed the amendment that I was talking about, there were, I think, in the end only two people in the whole of the parliamentary assembly from all the DECO nations, who economy. actually supported the amendment. So I believe there is increasing recognition throughout the world that through freeing up trade we are going to free up not only the ability of our own country to gain in the longer term through employment, but also the ability of developing countries to sell. We can complain, as the people in Europe did, about people in places like Thailand on $1 or $2 an hour and people in other countries on low wages taking away jobs in our country. However, in the end the same thing will happen to those people as has happened to people in Japan, Korea and Taiwan where they have been able to achieve higher wages through higher productivity. We eventually get the situation which we have today where Japan is purchasing car parts and vehicles from Australia. This is the sort of thing that will happen as we free up trade. We made that important point in Europe. I believe it was important to make that point. The great thing about it was that members of the Australian Democrats, the Australian Labor Party, the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia were all making the same very important points about the need to pursue the Uruguay Round. (TIme expired) Fuel Excise",60
48,Mr HICKS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"When members of parliament have just been to an election and been defeated as a party on policies which they believe are right for the country, and they believe they have been defeated by falsehoods and propaganda spread by the winning party, they tend to be a little bit disillusioned. They face a dilemma. They think to themselves, 'Well, there is a saying that people get the government they deserve' , and they think, 'Well, perhaps we really should not oppose any of the measures that are brought in by governments because that is what the people wanted and that is what they are going to get'. But, 'having seen what has happened in Western Australia under Labor ,and in South Australia under Labor and in Victoria under Labor, I adopt the attitude that we really should as members of parliament try and do all we can to assist those people we, are elected to represent. I might say that my electorate, fortunately, would not accept all the nonsense that was being put to them by the Labor Party at that time. One of the things the coalition did before the last federal election was promise the people that we would take the excise off fuel, 26c per litre for business and 19c for private users. The reason we were putting this forward was that we realise what a tremendous burden this excise places on most people in Australia. Whether we are talking about the average family person in their day-today activities, whether we are talking about the mining industry, manufacturing or transport, all of these things ate affected by the price fuel. I remember going into a business house just before the election when I was campaigning and speaking to a gentleman there. I tried to explain to him what we were going to do about the fuel excise"" and he calculated that it would save his company,.. - it was only a small retail business and had a small trucking operation-about $12,000 per annum. Because it was a business, he would actually have had more costs taken off. That was the difference between his surviving and not surviving as a business in these recessionary days. So it did mean a great deal to him. After the election I was at a function and I was speaking to a young man who was in the trucking industry and he said that his people had voted Labor. I nearly fell off the chair. I said, 'Do you know what this has meant to the trucking industry?', and he said, 'Oh no, we didn't bother about that. We were a bit worried about the GST, so we voted for the Labor Party'. I could just imagine that after the 17 August budget when he was eating his fish and chips he would just about have choked when he found out what the government has perpetrated in the area of fuel excise. Recent studies show that the Australian trucking industry is really very efficient. There is no doubt about that, and that is despite our tax regime where in Australia we are taxed about 27c per kilometre compared to lOe per kilometre in the United States. Despite that tax we are competitive, but since the budget that no longer applies, and I would say there would now be an even greater burden on our transport industry. The transport industry or trucking industry carries about 74 per cent of Australia's 1.33 billion tonnes of freight. It is a very flexible industry and has managed to compete despite government. The recession has cut profits to the bone. Some trucking companies may have been fortunate to earn about five per cent on their money, and now they estimate that this impost will cost the trucking industry $175 million per annum, and add $2,500 to the cost of a truck. It will cause freight cost increases, it will do something about the environmentof it will have a bad effect on the environmentand it will have an impact on safety, on employment and, of course, through the social impacts. I heard the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) speaking about our In competitiveness in world markets and the need to export. If we want to remain internafrom tionally competitive, we should have the cheapest, not the dearest, forms of transport in a country that really does have a tyranny of distance. We have to be lean and mean and we have to be better than other nations. If look at the latest tax comparisons based on pre-budget taxes and charges in cents kilometre, short haul in Australia costs 17c, in the United States 4c, and in Canada 12c. For long haul it is 27c compared to tOc in United States and 17c in Canada, and these are comparable countries, of course. That a dramatic effect, particularly in the rural areas, where we are trying to add value to primary industry products and make them cheaper to export. The government has· recently set up a regional task force headed by Mr Kelty. That task force will be travelling around the gional areas investigating how those areas best improve their manufacturing tion in order to create employment. However, I believe that this one stroke of the pen by federal government which increases fuel However, excise really means that the committee is wasting its time. For example, in Europe the cost of diesel half the cost of petrol. People there underployment stand that the trucking industry is very portant. They understand how important to get produce from one place to another. I stumble along. have been talking about regional and rural areas, but in this country we have also creased the cost of fares for people in the cities where many people have to commute to work. This excise is going to have a dramatic effect on those people as well. People will already be paying $2 to $3 more of grocery goods. So the tax relief that the government is talking about is an absolute nonsense. It will be absorbed by the fuel excise cost, without any other taxes that be imposed. I understand that some deal is going to done with the mining companies. If a deal is not done on these fuel imposts, some of these mining companies, particularly those in isolated areas, will have to close up business. fact, it has been rumoured that some of these businesses may be seeking approval the government to set up nuclear energy plants so that they can at least compete with countries overseas. The oil tax affects Nabalco's bauxite and aluminium plant at Gove in the Northern Territory and at Savage you River in Tasmania. and a host of others which are going to find it extremely difficult to be per competitive with these added costs. In terms· of the shipping industry, the increase in marine fuel excise will increase the the fuel bill for an average coastal ship by $360,000 per annum, amounting to $16.1 has million per annum across the whole coastal fleet. Within five days of overseeing an our agreement to reduce manning costs under its shipping reform program, the government has not only completely wiped out those reform savings, but has also added to shipping costs. A saving of $270,000 per ship per annum for recrew reductions has been countered by an can immediate government impost of $360,000 and producper ship per annum. One must wonder about some of the buthe reaucrats who get these budgets together. in the long run it is not the bureaucrats, it is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) who are is mainly responsible for the budget. The unemfigures came out today. They are imnot very flash. There are still roughly a it is million people unemployed, and we just We know that the government has given up inon unemployment by the way that some of the ministers have been answering questions, saying that we have to get used to this large unemployment figure, that we have to train people-I do not know what we are training for a basket them for-and so on. One in six jobs in the trucking industry will be lost as a result of these excise increases. Those increases will also have a dramatic may effect across the board. I do not know why we should be concerned about that. Apparentbe ly the government is not. From the recent industrial relations deal that the government has done, I can see that we are going to have a terrible problem in this country with unemployment as the unions are only concerned, as far as ,I can see, with the people who are employed. They are not concerned about those who are unemployed or those who are going to be unemployed. The government really should look very closely at this fuel impost. I would ask the Australian Democrats and the Greens to think very carefully about this. I know that it may take some thinking through, but this increase in fuel costs will have a dramatic effect on the environment, and on the safety of those people who travel on roads-and we already had a reduction in expenditure on roads of about $608 million in the last budget. I would ask them to think very carefully about it. I notice that one of the news items coming out of the west s4ggests that Mr Crean should take over the prime ministership and that Mr Willis should takeover for Mr Dawkins. I think that might be an idea. We would get some fresh blood in here and get some people who might understand what is going on. I say to the Australian people that it is very important that they do not take notice of all the newspapers, and things they read, because we have a lot of sycophants in the media. People should get hold of some constructive literature, whether or not it is· talking about the Mabo debate, the republic or fuel excise and taxes, and really study it. We are in a crisis situation in this country and it is going to take a lot of determination and a lot of goodwill to get us out of this situation we are in. (TIme expired) Regional Development",62
49,Ms DEAHM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Hon. Tom Uren, a great man, a man of collectively vision, said in this place on31 October 1974, speaking of regional and urban development: Everything is connected to everything else. In words, there is an inter-relationship with all matters-land-use, transport, housing, or what have you-because they involve people and the lives people who live in urban and regional communities. He went on to say: If we are to solve the problems of urban and regional development, bearing in mind that cent of the Australian population live in these areas, we must have a spirit of co-operation not only between the Australian Government, the State governments and local governments, but also with the private sector and the people within our community. We need the co-operation of all organisations, both public and private. We need the involvement of the people. In the lead-up to the election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his Investing in the nation statement promised to establish a regional development task force to examine regional development issues and to report to the government. But the government has gone further than that. By establishing the office of regional development within the industry, technology and regional development portfolio, we have, in the words of the Minister, the Hon. Alan Griffiths, 'elevated regional development to a first order priority'. Regional development is about developing the nation on a regional basis. It is about cooperation between federal, state and local government and it is about cooperation between government departments. It is about the community working together-government, industry, unions and local communities. This was TomUren's dream; a dream he was achieving during his time as Minister for Urban and Regional Development. Sadly he was not to realise his dream at that time. Unfortunately, Malcolm Fraser put regional development into the too-hard basket. It is hard. The type of cooperation and coordination which this process will entail, the process put in place by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development will be. hard work and will require goodwill at all levels. This process is not going to result in short- . term, quick-fix situations. It is about long term planning-about governments working to achieve lasting results. The regional development task force will; by the end of November, have visited 80 regions. It other has already met in over 60 regions. It is urban examining key policy issues from regional of perspectives and will report by Christmas. As well as programs originating in the office of regional development, there are other programs which will enhance the process: the 85 per primary industry and energy portfolio's national landcare program; the evaluation of community based approaches to rural development and flood mitigation assistance to New South Wales in cooperation with the state and local government authorities; and the tourism portfolio's regional development program, including the national ecotourism strategy and the promotion of rural tourism. There are many more examples, but I will conclude with consideration of the Australian urban and regional development review, initiated by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, the Hon. Brian Howe. At the launch of the review, the minister spoke of the types of partnerships that I have spoken of today-the partnerships that are going to ensure that all these regionally focused programs result in long-term achievements. He spoke of the issues which make these partnerships essential: air and water quality, waste management, public transport, roads, telecommunications, urban and regional water management. All of these issues require real cooperation at national, state, regional and local level. I have particular interest in these matters. My electorate is part of the greater western Sydney region. I was at great pains, when the office of regional development was established, to ensure that regional development was not taken merely as rural development. I am assured that the western Sydney region will be taken into account. The needs of western Sydney differ from those of other regions in more remote areas. Unlike other regions, we do not need more people. We need more industrial development and further growth in service industries such as education, tourism",64
50,Mr CADMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,And airports.,65
51,Ms DEAHM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"And airports. As I have said already, it will be a long process and a hard process but we are well on our way to achieving great things.",65
52,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! It being approximately 1.45 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106 the debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Unemployment",65
53,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Keating government must act on unemployment in the regional area of Bendigo. No more committees are required; what is required now is action on unemployment. The ABS figures on unemployment for September paint a very graphic picture of the situation in my electorate. In the past 12 months unemployment-in the Bendigo region has grown by over 10 per cent, and just in the last months the unemployment figures have gone up by a further two per cent in that region. So far, all the Keating government has done is to establish a further committee to look at unemployment and prepare a white paper for discussion, and that will not take place until early next year. So the government is putting it off. After almost 11 years in government, it has deferred any action at all on unemployment in regional areas. The other thing that it is doing is setting up a series of regional committees. It has got the Kelty committee on regional developrn-nt, it has got the Woods committee on regional development, and it has just received a report from the Industry Commission on impediments to regional development and taken no action on that yet. So it is setting up committee after committee after committee. It did not expect to be elected at the last election and it has no plans in place. (TIme expired) Question Time",65
54,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"People in the public gallery who attended question time on Tuesday, 5 October 1993 must still be rather confused at the debacle that took place in this House. They must surely have questioned why certain members of this place have been elected to represent them. That day demonstrated to me just what public opinion of this place and the people in it must be; No wonder they have so very little faith in their elected representatives. It was one of the worse displays of bad behaviour, rudeness and ill manners that it has ever been my misfortune to see. I came to the realisation of just how much discussion occurs in this place in question time, especially if people are in opposition. Watching and learning from senior politicians of all ilks who have gained this superior knowledge has given me an insight into the great skill and dexterity they have acquired-for putting points of order, moving ridiculous amendments and participating in a discussion in a supposedly orderly fashion. For example, question time is not, as I thought, for opposition and government members to ask questions and thus gain information on issues and policy development for the people of Australia. It tunity to publicly sling verbal abuse, to waste time on irrelevant points of order and to make a mockery of the process of government. (TIme expired) Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol",65
55,Mr CADMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to bring before the parliament an issue that is a national disgrace. Mr Speaker, are you aware that vital marine life saving equipment is still subject to sales tax? Life jackets, emergency location beacons, marine radios, direction finders, life harnesses, life rafts and, possibly most important of all, flares are all subject to sales tax. Organisations like the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol not only pay dearly as they equip their own lifeboats but they have their job made harder as they try to educate the general boating public on the need to carry this safety gear. The Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol has cast a safety net around much of the Australian coastline. It is recognised as our premier marine research and rescue body. It saves lives. It recovers more than a million dollars worth of boats and equipment every year. It augments the various state water police efforts. It is an official emergency service, yet all of its equipment, even its fuel, is taxed and the Commonwealth government gives it nothing in return. I implore the government to repeal this immoral tax and give due credit to one of Australia's most honoured voluntary services. I say to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that I will swap him a dollar for a life any day. The Fightback proposal allowed voluntary organisations to be free of these charges, and I think it is time the government was consistent in its taxing policies in regard to wholesale sales tax and its fuel taxes. (Time expired) Port Adelaide",66
56,Mr SAWFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I have some good news from the port of Adelaide. It gives me great pleasure to inform the House that during the last financial year the port of Adelaide handled a record number of containers. Barbara Wiese, the Minister of Transport Development in South Australia, recently announced that in the past financial year the port had handled 54,000 containers, an increase of 26 per cent over the previous is but an oppor- financial year. Port Adelaide is becoming more important as a gateway for overseas trade. An indicator of that is the 36 per cent increase in the number of vessels which used the Adelaide container terminal last year. In 1991-92, some 91 ships used the terminal while last financial year the number was 141. The major gains have mainly come from. improved services and levels of trade through Port Adelaide with Japan, Korea, South-East Asia and New Zealand. It is clear that traders and service providers, including shipping lines, are increasing their support of container shipping services at Port Adelaide. The credit for these much-needed increases obviously should go to Sea-Land (Australia) Terminals Pty Ltd, the new operator of the Adelaide container terminal. However, it also should be noted that the South Australian Department of Marine and Harbours has also launched itself into the marketplace and is vigorously promoting Port Adelaide and South Australia. Older Australians",66
57,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I draw the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government to the effect that they are having on the older generation of Australians. This group is in a state of future shock engendered by the rapidity of change, the selling off of national assets and institutions, the rising foreign debt and unemployment. The endless changes to superann-ation, the collapse of retirees' incomes through reduced interest rates, the removal of many thousands of people from access to part pensions, the counting of unrealised capital gain as income for only one section of the community, the attack on long service leave, the penalising of owners of older cars, and the raising of the pension age for women are all seen as bewildering blows. The reactions range from fury and disbelief to a feeling that it is all unfair and undeserved. But all these changes pale into insignificance alongside the shock of what is perceived by older Australians as a concerted attack on their values. The endless rubbishing of the 1950s, the behaviour and language of the Prime Minister, the divisive and abusive public debates on the flag, the republic, Mabo, the constant claim that Australians have no national identity, and the transformation of multiculturalism into racism are all issues that are irrevocably alienating the 4.3 million Australians over the age of 50. Irrespective of the merits of these issues, the brutalising of people's values is unacceptable in a liberal democracy. Kangaroo Exports",66
58,Mr SNOW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was pleased to lead a debate in the European Parliament in relation to Australia's position on kangaroo exports. The European Parliament had a draft resolution which was going to eliminate all export of kangaroo products. I am pleased that the draft resolution will probably be changed as a result of our representations and those of the embassy in Brussels. I pointed out that there were 10 species of kangaroos which were listed as endangered or threatened, but that there were other very abundant species, including the red, eastern grey, western grey, the wallaroo and the common whiptail wallaby, none of which have been listed as endangered. We also advised that harvesting and processing have been vastly upgraded, that illegal harvesting has been policed and that the work of Customs and the National Parks and Wildlife Service has been there to monitor export. I believe we did persuade the parliamentary members. The only people who were confused were the interpreters, who had problems with words such as 'wallaroo' and 'whiptail wallaby'. We pointed out that the abundant species, not listed by the ACF, the World Wildlife Fund of Australia or Funds for Animals, were certainly great providers of meat, hide and other kangaroo products. Keating Government",67
59,Mr EVANS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Question time in the last two weeks has shown just how out of tune the government really is with the problems of Australia. It seems the front bench is a bit out of rhythm with the real problems of Australia, so much so that the Prime Minister has to protect th-m during question time. 'Out of tune' is an apt term because one wonders what the actions of members of the government would be if they were actually as in tune as lead singers of - ome of the most contemporary bands around the world at the moment. Could honourable members imagine some of the ministers lead singing in some .of the bands, for instance, the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Kelly) heading up Meatloaf, singing his classic Bat out of Hell. Perhaps the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) could sing the Aretha Franklin classic about wanting a little respect. What about the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) singing the theme from The Godfather, or perhaps the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) heading up INXS? But the most·identifiable would be the old ramrod himself, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). One could just imagine him heading up the Eurythmics. In due deference to your ruling on the word 'lies', Mr Speaker, I shall censor where necessary, but could honourable members imagine the Prime Minister in peroxided hair strutting the stage singing, 'Would I beep to you, would I beep to you, honey, now would I say something that wasn't true . . . would I beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep to you?'. The mind really boggles. After the performance of the government this week, it should consider disbanding and seeking further lessons. Perhaps it should organise an election eisteddfod-then we could all judge more critically its performance. (Time expired) Land: Sale to Overseas Interests",67
60,Mr MELHAM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This morning in the House a petition was tabled that had been organised by a constituent of mine, a Mrs Nancy Bainsbridge of Revesby. The petition was in the following terms: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives - mbled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents in the state of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that land of Australia is being sold to overseas interests. Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate to stop this or alternatively to legislate that land can only be leased to overseas interests. That petition was signed by 1,028 people over a very short space of time, and there is no doubt that there is that view in the electorate. That view can also be extended to government assets being sold. In my submission to the House, the option should be that we should be leasing those assets and they should revert back to the Commonwealth at a later date. That will provide certainty for business, if we give long-term leases, and we do not lose goveriunent assets. Let us not sell off the family jewels, let us look at leasing them and getting them back.",68
61,Mr NEVILLE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to bring to the attention of the House the survey which was conducted in Australian provincial newspapers between Rockhampton and Brisbane. The APN chain, the O;Reilly chain, conducted a survey on whether or not people wanted it republic. It was interesting that in the city of Bundaberg the vote against a republic was 90.1 per cent, those in favour 9.9, which mirrors a recent survey by the same newspaper chain on the Sunshine Coast in the electorate of the honourable member for Fisher· (Mr Slipper), where the sample showed 86.6 per cent against and only 13.4 in favour. Both were quite representative surveys; one of 2,300 and the other of 3,300. What is even more interesting is that 18 months ago the same newspaper in Bundaberg, which now recorded 90.1, showed that only 74 per cent were opposed to a republic. It is interesting that the public obviously resent a number of factors, including the lack of balance in the task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the fact that the Prime Minister, when he was in England, presumed to tell both his English and later his Irish audiences that the majority of Australians wanted a republic, when· in fact that proposition had never been properly tested on them. Wool",68
62,Mr CHARLES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week at this time. I took the opportunity to congratupractice late the Olympic organising committee on winning the bid for the year 2000 Olympics. This week I would like to encourage the committee which is going to be formed to run the games for Australia that it use wool as insulation in the village that will house the athletes. All of us know, because we have been debating the subject actively in this place over some time, we have a huge stockpile of wool, and there is no better product for natural insulation of housing than wool. We can replace the fibreglass and we can replace all the seagrass and all the other products with real 100 per cent Australian wool. Some testing has indicated that wool has a higher insulation value than the man-made product. Republic So I would encourage the Olympic committee to make sure that we put wool in all the buildings that will house the athletes for the games and that we use them to advertise throughout the world what Australia is doing with its wool stockpile for the good of the nation, .for the good of our farmers and for the good of the economy. Prime Minister: Overseas Trips",68

67,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer him to the fact that the Senate yesterday passed tion which will enable the government's administrative deadline to be met in time for Australian workers to receive that tax cut before Christmas. Will the government pass the tax cut legislation through this House without further delay? If it is not prepared allow Australians to get their tax cut before Christmas, will the Treasurer confirm that the l-a-w tax cuts will be paid in two instalments, on 1 July next and 1 January 1996.",69
68,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the government's wish that the tax cuts flow to Australian taxpayers, working men 'and women, from about 15 November. The honourable member is right in saying that in order to meet the administrative requirements the passage of the legislation must proceed before 21 November. Everything else the honourable member said is wrong. He knows as well as anybody that it would be entirely irresponsible for the government to proceed with that legislation in the absence of the remaining budget legislation. The Senate might think it rather cute to attempt to remove the clause which links this bill-the bill which will return to this House today-to the other revenue raising measures still before the Senate. That is simply a cute device on the part of the Senate. The opposition knows full well what the government has been saying ever since budget night-that this is a package of measures and no one part of it will proceed without the other. tion ought to understand that this package is about reducing the deficit over the medium term and it is simply not possible to ignore the essential requirements which the government is responsibly facing up to. I am pleased that the Senate is finally getting on with discharging its obligations and dealing with these measures. All we need now is for the Leader of the Opposition to tell us that the Senate will pass those bills and return them speedily in a form acceptable to the government. Then the other measure can proceed and the tax cuts can be paid. Whatever the Leader of the Opposition likes to say about who is responsible for the delay, he knows that he and his party-and those around him-are responsible for the delay. This is a package and will remain so as far as legisla- the government is concerned. Economy",69
69,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he provide details to the House of recent evidence indicating a stronger to employment market? Is it a fact that recent record highs reported in equity prices are providing strength to the economy? Can the Prime Minister tell the House of any threats to continued economic expansion?,69
70,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The' September labour force numbers are out today. They show that, seasonally adjusted, unemployment fell for the month by 0.2 per cent, to 10.9 per cent. There was an increase in jobs of 45,100 over the month. Mr Downer-Most of them were part time.",69
71,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Provisional trend estimates of employment have now been increasing since February-an important point. The all ordinaries index yesterday broke through the 2,000 barrier. Blue chip stocks are trading at levels higher than those before October 1987. The 20 leaders index is at its highest level in history. Over the last 11 months the value of Australian stocks and shares has increased by $84 billion. Mr Downer-This has nothing to do with it.",69
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honour The opposi- able member for Mayo.,69
73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There has been an $84,000 million increase in the capitalisation of the Australian stock market. This increase is coming from the improved profitability in the economy, coming from the growth in the economy which was induced by government fiscal and monetary policy from the One Nation package of last year which kicked growth along, coming from the government's wages policies, and coming from the low inflation and low.er interest rate policies which have been, themselves, adding to profitability of companies. That profitability is reflected in the profitability, generally, of companies and that is reflected in the all ordinaries index. On top of these indications, there have been other encouraging signs in recent weeks. For example, the ANZ index of job advertisements rose four per cent in September. But, need I say-as the Treasurer, himself, remarked-the integrity of the government's fiscal policy and the deliverability of the promised tax cuts is continuing to be threatened by what is happening in the Senate at the hands of the opposition. Bain and Co. this week reported the uncertainty caused by the opposition's wrecking tactiCs as a result of the risk factor in the pricing of. the Australian dollar in overseas markets. Its analyst says: The. weakness in the $A can partially be explained by commodity price movements but mostly appears to have resulted from extra political pressure aSsociated with the Senate budget impasse. In the Sydney Morning Herald this morning Peter Smark wrote: If the opposition really wanted to hurt the country worse, what extra would they be doing? In the Australian Bureau of Statistics Statistics Weekly out. this week, dated Thursday 7 October, out of the weekly statistics for five references, four are positive. First, the current account trend is better despite a rise in the seasonally adjusted deficit. Second, job vacancies are rising. Third, higher demand is boosting takings for tourism establishments. Fourth, there is a tentative resumption of growth in home building approvals. The fifth reference was on slow retail growth, or, to use the words of the ABS, growth 'at a snail's pace'. Those points-the current account, job vacancies, higher demand boosting takings in tourist establishments, and a tentative resumptionof growth for home building approvalsall indicate that the economy is lifting and that the country is growing. We are seeing that reflected also in today's September labour force numbers and of course in the all ordinaries index on the stock market. This country is off and moving-all the more reason why this parliament, which must take responsibility for piloting the economy through these changes, should not be putting any impediments in its way. That is why I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: the behaviour of the federal. opposition in the Senate is now one of the clear impediments to the economy's progress. Taxation: Wine",69
74,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is directed to the Treasurer. Given the opposition in the Senate and by the Australian people to the wine tax, why on earth will you not accept the advice of the honourable member for Werriwa-a former Treasurer and respected Minister for Primary Industries and Energy-and abandon the wine tax, which he describes as being 'imposed on the basis of ignorance, stupidity and prejudice', being based on dishonest arguments, and which he rightly says will be a massive disincentive to invest in this important export earning industry?",70
75,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are four of my predecessors still in this HouseMr MCGauran-And they are all better than you.,70
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Gippsland.,70
77,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But there is only one I would criticise, and that is the one who. left us with double digit inflation and double digit unemployment and that is the one who is sitting over there. The honourable member for Werriwa made a number of observationsobservations that he has made over the years. He makes those observations in spite of the fact that the wine industry has been prospering despite the fact that he warned us against introducing any form of sales tax for the industry some years ago. The honourable member for Werriwa says that we should acknowledge the different circumstances of wine and beer. Of course, the government's measures do precisely that because there is both sales tax and excise applied to beer. In the case of wine, there is only wholesale sales tax. It is an issue of whether there should be fairer treatment between beer and wine, not a question of equality. It is the question of fairer which led the government to make its decision to impose a higher level of wholesale sales tax on wine and of course, because of the differences between wine production and beer production, to eschew the proposal which has sometimes been floated, particularly by the beer industry, to impose excise on wine. The Leader of the Opposition should understand that, if his campaign were successful in defeating the government's measure in this regard, that would not be the end of the government's options to get a better and fairer system of taxation for the wine industry. As a result of discussions with some of the members of this industry, the government put forward a proposal which involves the more gradual introduction of a higher level of taxation for wine. In the context of that phase-in, there would be a number of major improvements as far as the taxation treatment of the industry was concerned: firstly, there would be the introduction of rapid depreciation allowances in relation to the development of grape growing areas; and, secondly, there would be essentially a threshold of $50,000 on production, below which no sales tax would be applied at all. This would be a very great benefit to smaller producers, of which there are 600 or 700 throughout Australia, at the same time as we dealt with this issue of bringing about a fairer treatment of the taxation of beer versus wine. I am still hopeful that the more sensible and far-sighted members of this industry will carefully examine the proposal that the government has put forward in a. spirit of compromise to introduce this taxation more gradually and to do it in a context which will ensure the continuing prosperity of this industry which, of course, the government is very keen to see. Fiscal Policy",70
78,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Treasurer advise the House of what advice organisations such as the International Monetary Fund are giving to countries about fiscal policy? Will the Treasurer advise the House how the government's deficit reduction strategy actreatment cords with that advice?,71
79,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In its September World Economic Outlook, the IMF provides advice and support to governments in relation to fiscal policy and the handling of budget deficits and it urges all governments to attend to large deficits and to reduce them. It says: A failure to reduce substantially these imbalances over the medium term would likely cause renewed upward pressure on long term interest rates, reduce capital formation and the scope for new job creation in the private sector, lower the rate of growth of potential output and income, and continue to impede the flexibility of fiscal policy in the event of adverse cyclical developments. It goes on to say: As recerit experience in several countries shows, early announcement and legislation of credible medium term deficit reduction measures have immediate beneficial effects on long term interest rates and on economic confidence, even when recessionary conditions make it difficult to undertake significant deficit cuts in the short run. . .. postponing action to deal with the fiscal imbalances would continue to impede a recovery of confidence. This is a ringing endorsement from the IMF of the strategy which the government has embarked upon to provide the necessary stimulus to the economy in the short term when it needs it but at the same time have a credible legislative package involving the reduction in the budget deficit over the years ahead precisely for the reasons that we want to ensure an increase, a boost to confidence, we want to guard against rises in interest rates and we want to provide the necessary circumstances for an increase in investment and the jobs which will flow from that. As the Prime Minister has indicated, so many of the statistics which are now coming out do reveal an economy which is growing, an economy which has been able to attract considerable international investor confidence, an economy which is doing better than most DECO economies. As the Prime Minister said, the only impediment to the achievement of the objectives that we should all want for this country is the attitude of the opposition in relation to this budget deficit reduction strategy. It is the opposition alone, the Liberal and National parties alone, which are standing in the way of this deficit reduction strategy. The Democrats are prepared to embrace the idea of a deficit reduction. Even the Greens, with ideas which we do not accept, have embraced that particular proposal. It is only the opposition which is standing in the way and wanting to maintain and expand government deficits in Australia. It is the opposition alone which wants to see an increase of about $3 billion in the deficit confronting Australia four years from now. It does not matter what antics members of the opposition want to inspire in the Senate, it does not matter what they want to do to try to break linkages between one part of this package and another, we simply cannot legislate away the economic reality confronting this country; we cannot legislate away the essential responsibility which this government will never abandon. It is essential for Australia's future that we do embrace, give effect to, that deficit reduction strategy for .all of the reasons which the IMF has spelt out in terms of providing the economic security and the future which we want. It is easy for the opposition to engage in this kind of feel good political experience which it seems to be having at the moment where it thinks that tax cuts can be given away without the other side of the equation being affected. Yet it is an essential part of the economic reality confronting Australia that we simply cannot have one without the other: It is about time the opposition realised that, it is about time it realised its part in the management of the Australian economy and it is about time it passed the necessary legislation so that the government can not only give effect to the early payment of those tax cuts but also provide the credible demonstration of our determination to reduce the deficit over the medium term. Aboriginal Land Title",71
80,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Will the government's Mabo legislation include any suspension or rolling back of the Racial Discrimination Act?,72
81,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am somewhat surprised that the shadow minister of state, after about one year, together with other members of the front bench, has started to ask questions in respect of the· High Court decision in the Mabo case and the government's response to it. The first thing I should put on the record is that in the entire year after the High Court decision in the Mabo case the entire opposition front bench in the House of Representatives and the Leader of the Opposition on one single occasion did not rise in this place to ask a question on Mabo. In the middle of the Federal election campaign, the Leader of the Opposition, to his then great credit, stood with the government, realising that the Mabo decision was one that was above party politics, one that demanded a national response and one which ought to be the subject of a degree of cooperation and statesmanship in this place.",72
82,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,72
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister might wait a moment. Honourable members on my left might restrain themselves. I clearly heard the question. The minister was asked a question of some degree of relevance and I would ask him now to come to the question. Mr TICKNER:-Absolutely. The essence of the question revolves around a particular aspect of the government's response to the Mabo decision. On this side of the House we see this issue as one of great ethical and political moment. Mr Reith-If it's so important, why don't you have an answer?",72

Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: on the matter of relevance, it was a quite specific question which requires a specific answer, not a rhetorical flourish from the minister. You should direct him to answer the question yes or no.",72
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat. As I have indicated on a number of occasions, the chair is in a difficult position in respect that whole issue that you have just raised. However, I have asked the minister to come to the aspect of the answer that is being sought, and I would invite him to do so.",73
90,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I will, but I thank you for the liberty of giving some background as to why we on this side of the House feel it is so important. Mr MCGauran-What liberty did you give?",73
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is entirely within his own right to give background to the answer. He has been asked now to come to the relevance of the answer and I am sure he will.,73

98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You did not warn him.,73
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Correct. Mr Tim Fischer-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: in view of the fact that you have confirmed that you did not give a warning to the honourable member for Flinders in accordance with convention, will you provide an opportunity for the honourable member for Flinders to approach the dispatch box, in the circumstances arising, to withdraw or to at least put his side of the story?",73
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. As I said yesterday of to honourable members in this place, there are forms of the House that can be used. The honourable member for Flinders had asked a question, he took a point of order and he continued to interject. I consider that to be disorderly, and the standards of this place will be upheld. Mr Downer-On a further point of order, Mr Speaker: you did in fact warn other honourable members, I have to say, including myself. With the greatest of respect, you did apply one standard to one member here and another standard to another member. I think in light of that it would be appropriate if the recommendations of the Leader of the National Party were taken up.",73

104,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Flinders is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Flinders thereupon withdrew from the chamber. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Just prior to your naming the honourable member for Flinders, the Prime Minister on three occasions called across the table the word 'scum'. Mr Speaker, not only is that totally unparliamentary, and not only have Australians had enough of that behaviour, but I would ask you to get the Prime Minister to withdraw that unparliamentary and unnecessary remark.",74
105,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! If the Prime Minister in fact did do so, I would ask him to withdraw.",74
106,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,I cannot even recall making such a comment.,74
107,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The Prime Minister will withdraw.,74
108,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,But in the cavalcade of abuse which was coming my way,74
109,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Prime Minister will withdraw.,74
110,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"If somebody took offence at anything that I said, I should of course be happy to withdraw.",74
111,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Before the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs proceeds, the specifics of the question were there. You have now given the background. You will answer the question or resume your seat.",75
112,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,I am sorry that the honourable member is not here to hear the answer. The Racial Discrimination Act isMr MCGauran-He is watching.,75
113,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order!,75
114,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Perhaps he is in his office watching the television relay. The Racial Discrimination Act is very proud legislation of a former Labor government. It is legislation that, as far as I am aware, has not been the subject of one single comment by any member of the opposition over the preceding months. The third and final point is that the question raises a matter which is obviously and quite publicly known to be the subject of negotiations, consultations and cabinet considerations. Therefore, it is inappropriate to respond further. Bougainville",75
115,Mr QUICK,PAIRS,My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Has the minister seen reports that the Papua New Guinea government is giving consideration to convening a meeting of Bougainville leaders to address the need for a peaceful resolution of the Bougainville conflict and that the governments of PNG and the Solomon Islands intend to negotiate an agreement on border arrangements? Could the minister tell· us of the government's views on these developments?,75
116,Mr BILNEY,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Members of this House would know of his considerable interest in these matters. I know that he was recently a member of a parliamentary delegation which visited Papua New Guinea in which he furthered those· interests, and I appreciate the fact that he has asked me this question on a very important subject. The government welcomes the statement which was made by John Kaputin, the Papua New Guinea foreign minister, on 29 September to the effect that the Papua New Guinea government will consider convening a meeting of leaders on Bougainville to address the need for a peaceful solution of the problems on that troubled island and on the decision of the governments of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands jointly to negotiate a formal arrangement on the management of their common border. ,We welcome also press reports to the effect that John Kaputin, as foreign minister, will give approval to a monitoring group from the European Community to visit Bougainville on a fact-finding mission. We view these announcements as a very positive step on the road towards an eventual peaceful solution of the troubling Bougainville problem. It has long been this government's firm view that a purely military approach to the problems of Bougainville cannot succeed. There is a need for a process of dialogue between the various groups involved in the conflict in order for a peaceful solution to be achieved. Indeed, I would reinforce that by saying that the Prime Minister, when he discussed these matters with Prime Minister Wingti in Nauru at the forum, made the same point. I would hope that, as a result of the statements that have been made, the Papua New Guinea government will in fact endorse the convening of a meeting of Bougainville leaders. It will not be an easy process to bring about peace as a result of that, given the divisions which exist between Bougainvilleans as a result of the conflict. Australia has offered to assist in facilitating such a meeting, either by providing a venue or some other form of logistic support. That offer, I repeat to the House, still stands, provided of course that a-l the parties to the Bougainville conflict agree that our assistance would be appropriate. Those problems on Bougainvillehave dragged on for some four years, with tragic consequences for the population in terms of loss of life and· the lack of basic services, such as health care. The effects of the Bougainville problem have also, as the ,. honourable member referred to in his question, spilt over to affect the population of the neighbouring Solomon Islands, and those events have been without precedent in the South Pacific region and remain of great concern to the Australian government. Since the Bougainville problem began in 1989, Australia has provided relief aid to Bougainvilleans, including medicines, tents, clothing and tools. Now that conditions are improving on the island, we are stepping up our efforts to restore services on Bougainville. Indeed, on 23 September I announced an additional $2 million of assistance for the rehabilitation of Bougainville, and that will bring our total assistance to Bougainvilleboth expended and pledged-to some $4.6 million since April 1991. Finally, we welcome the continuing cooperation between the governments of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in addressing the spill-over effects of the Bougainville crisis. It is a process which has been assisted by the recent visit of Francis Saemala, the foreign minister of the Solomon Islands, to Papua New Guinea, and a process which we have encouraged all along. Aboriginal Land Title",75
117,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Does the minister see any inconsistency in negotiating with the states to water down native title while, at the same time, negotiating with Aborigines to broaden it?",76
118,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"I meant every word of my previous answer because I am in the position of knowing exactly the history of the way the Mabo debate has evolved, not only around this country but in this parliament. What I said before about the integrity of the opposition on this matter stands. Regrettably, the opposition, after the federal election, stepped out of any commitment to any degree of cross-party cooperation, abandoned any integrity it may have had, and willingly and actively went along with the Mr Andrews-I raise a point of order understanding order 145. In the minister's previous answer to a question, Mr Speaker, you gave him the liberty of being able to present some background. He is now presenting that same background again. Can you tell the House how that can be relevant?",76
119,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The minister is answering the question. I am sure he is going to conclude.,76
120,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Of course I am. The fact of the matter is that it has been the Prime Minister and the government that have unquestionably taken the high moral ground and, more importantly, sought, through national leadership, to embark upon the consultations that the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has just referred to. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party that we are not ashamed that we talk to the Aboriginal people of this country; we are not ashamed that we talk to the National Fanners Federation, the Mining Industry Council and the state and territory governments. For goodness sake, that is what national leadership is about. We always have admitted that it is very difficult to get a national consensus around this great moral issue. But the national consensus, based on principles of justice for Aboriginal people, is what we are trying to get. No amount of spoiling from the federal opposition, no amount of wrecking, is going to divert us from that historic national objective. Victoria: Floods",76
121,Mr HARRY WOODS,PAIRS,I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Could the minister infonn the House about his visit this morning to flood affected areas of Victoria?  Simon?,76
122,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I would have thought that at least some members on the left would be quite interested in this response.,76
123,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I think that is right. As foreshadowed by the Prime Minister yesterday, I visited the flood affected areas in Victoria. I was accompanied by the honourable member who asked the question, as chairman of the Prime Minister's rural and regional task force. I was also accompanied by the honourable member for Indi and was met on the ground by the honourable member for Murray. I think the House should recognise the bipartisan approach that has been taken in this matter. I hope honourable members are prepared to listen to what I have to say. We visited the areas bounded by Wangaratta, Shepparton and Benalla, and we inspected the flood damaged area. We talked to people affected by the floods, as we did with the relief workers. The point that should be made at the olltset is that the community involvement in rallying to the cause has been an extraordinary outcome, given the circumstances the community has faced. The good spirits with which the people were facing up to the task today is to be commended. But the reality is that a lot of damage appears to been done by these floods. It is damage that impacts upon the area within my portfoliothe pastoral activity-particularly in relation to fencing, to crops, to stock losses, but it also impacts upon the homes and the small businesses that are the backbone of the city areas that we visited. As for the assistance that has been able to be given to date, it is important to note the logistic support on the ground has been extremely well-coordinated-the services of the armed forces from the Commonwealth level, combined with the state emergency services, have been extremely successful. They have been able to respond quickly not only to the enormous damage that came so quickly in itself, but their activities today seemed to have saved Cobram from the damage that has befallen a number of other areas. I would like to place on record the appreciation that this side of the House-and I am sure that the honourable members for Murray and Indi would join with me-has for the work that has been put in by the relief agencies. As for financial support, the Commonwealth and states are already funding, on a dollar dollar basis, temporary hardship relief. It pleasing to see the relief agencies fully employed at work processing these claims. In addition, assistance can be obtained by residents for temporary living expenses, for house and content damage, for structural repairs, and flooding. for re-establishment grants. Again, the agencies on the ground are providing the available material. As far as the future is concerned, until there is a proper assessment of the quantum of damage, it will be hard to say what the measure of financial support will total. The total will comprise a commitment from all levels of government, particularly the Commonwealth and the states. We have in place a framework for funding arrangements whereby, once certain thresholds are reached by the state, that will trigger further, matching funding from the Commonwealth. Once the trigger level is reached we will employ the formula of matching every dollar that the state puts in with three from the Commonwealth. have We need further discussions with the state government on the level of assistance that will be required and the form in which it will be delivered. We spoke to a number of people in the area and they have raised the issues that they think are important. Those issues have to be talked through, and we will do that with the states. It is also important to note that Mr Kennett was there this morning. He and I· will talk later about how we can progress matters. Meeting the need now is an important dimension to this situation, but we also need to recognise that measures already taken by the government have helped alleviate what might otherwise have been worse damage in the area of Wangaratta. That assistance came through contributions from the Commonwealth to raise the levy banks. The whole area affected by these floods will be an important focus for any future work and priorities of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, which has been very active in flood mitigation and drainage activities. What we saw today also highlights another dimension of the problem, and that is planning control. A number of the residential for areas affected by the flood appeared to be was newly developed areas. We need to pay more attention to the requirements on planning authorities when making decisions about further developments that they take account of the damage that can :.; occasioned by I have had an opportunity to speak with the Minister for Social Security. We are assessing the circumstances in which a special declaration may be appropriate which would alleviate the asset testing associated with certain social security benefits. I will be able to report at later stage on that point.",76
124,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. . NA Hansard Report",78
125,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I refer you to page 1756 of Hansard of Wednesday, 6 October in relation to the supplementary answer of the Treasurer yesterday. The Treasurer quoted from the penultimate paragraph of a report of the Senate committee examining the fuel excise tax increases. In effect, that paragraph states: The Committee . . . hopes that the Government may accept or introduce needed amendments . . . The Daily Hansard so records that paragraph in part, but the problem is that the videotape of Hansard, which I took the opportunity of studying this morning, shows Treasurer Dawkins saying otherwise. Will you review this matter to ensure the correct guidelines were followed by Hansard in the circumstances?",78
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will take the honourable member's question on board and report back to the House later.,78
127,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, on the same point, I did not get the opportunity to fully quote the penultimate paragraph because I was interrupted by members of the opposition. It is quite untrue for the Leader of the National Party to assert, as did the honourable member for Mayo, that the committee was 'hoping' for anything. The committee was simply reporting the fact that the opposition 'hoped'. I do not care what the opposition hoped. What the committee wants is for the bill to be passed. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",78

133,Mr TIM FISCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do. In reference to the most recent comments of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), and as the shortest way to clarify the matter, I will read from the penultimate paragraph: The Committee noted that the Opposition opposes the bills but hopes that the Government may accept or introduce needed amendmentset cetera. It is clear-indeed, other people not in this parliament have confirmed-that that refers to the committee.",78

PERSONAL EXP-ANATIONS",78
136,Mr DOWNER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I seek leave to make a personal explanation.,79
137,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,79
138,Mr DOWNER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I do.,79
139,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Please proceed.,79
140,Mr DOWNER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"In today's Adelaide Advertiser, a journalist called Lindsay Olney wrote in an article, amongst other things, that I had misconstrued the meaning of the words in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the fuel excise. The journalist claimed, contrary to the views of the deputy chairman of the committee, who I would have thought ought to know, that the expression 'The Committee noted that the Opposition opposes the bills but hopes that the Government may accept or introduce needed amendments' means that it is the opposition that wants the amendments. Mr Olney does not seem to have understood that it is the cOmnlittee which wants the amendments, and that is perfectly clear from the paragraph, and to suggest that I have misunderstood this paragraph is wrong-and my interpretation has been well supported by the deputy chairman of the committee and other officials. NA Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council, Committee",79
141,Mr SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS,"I have received .the 1595 following message from the Senate: The Senate acquaints the House of Representatives with a resolution agreed to by the Senate this day, which is, in relevant part: That the Senate requests the House of Representatives to require the attendance of the following person before the Senate Select· Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council to provide public evidence: The Honourable John Dawkins MP. The Senate refers the House of Representatives to the First and Second Reports of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council, concerning this resolution. Ordered that the message be taken into consideration forthwith.",79
142,Mr BEAZLEY,DOCUMENTS,"I move: (1) That the House of Representatives having considered Message No. 71 of the Senate: (a) notes that the Senate's request that the House require the attendance of a member of the House before a committee of the Senate does not conform with the practice of requesting the House to give leave for a member to attend; (b) resolves that it is not appropriate that a Minister of this House should appear and give evidence before a committee of the Senate against the Minister's will; (c) further resolves that it is not appropriate that . any member of the House of Representatives be required to appear before a committee of the Senate against the member's will; (d) confirms that it is for each Member to determine whether the member thinks fit to appear before a committee of the Senate; and (e) declines to require the Honourable John Dawkins MP to attend before the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council; and (2) That the House send a message to the Senate conveying the terms of this resolution. There is nothing particularly dramatic. about this motion. It encapsulates what has become some substantial practice over time concerning the relationship between the House and the Senate requesting appearance at each other's committee procedures. From the time when parliament was first established and the possibility· arose of committees in one chamber being interested in the views of members in another chamber, a degree of practice has been built up which now effectively has the force of convention. lam a little surprised by the way in which the Senate's resolution was couched. It was slightly, in its terminology, outside the normal practice between the Houses. Nevertheless, from time to time missives have passed between the Houses requesting that a member of one particular chamber attend before members of another chamber. The practice has grown so that there' is an opportunity .provided for members, if they so wish, to appear before committees of another House. Early practice required a resolution to be passed in the chamber granting leave to a member if that member wished to appear before a Senate committee. But over time there has been a standing practice, and such advice has been forthcoming, that when a request is made leave is not required for an appearance before Senate committees. A member can do that of his or her own volition. The Senate from time to time has been advised on that matter. Anything further-that is, requiring somebody's attendance before a committee-is something that no House has done. Both Houses have assumed the inviolate status of their own individual members. One other point I make is that in recent times the previous Speaker appeared before a Senate committee without leave of the House or without having requested the House for leave. I think he discussed certain housekeeping matters before one of the Senate committees responsible for such matters. He did not believe that it was necessary, operating on advice that this chamber had repeatedly advised the Senate on such housekeeping matters over the years, to seek leave of the House in order to do that. This issue last occurred in some equivalent form to the matters that we are considering today during the period of government of our predecessors. The then Minister for Communications, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), was requested by the Senate to appear and give sworn testimony before it. At that stage, he gave a personal explanation as to why he was not prepared to do that. The matter related to issues of the international trade agreement on the selling of milk powder. The Chairman of the Senate. Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, Senator Rae, had set down some particulars of evidence and invited comments from the then minister. He responded with a letter detailing his views, which were at variance .with a witness who had appeared before the Senate, and decided further, however, that he would not appear to give sworn testimony on that issue. He said, inter alia:<iUl'ing his remarks on why he chose that course of action: I do not believe it appropriate that a Minister this House should appear and give sworn evidence before a committee of the other House. He took that point somewhat further than is perhaps impliCit here and said that not only did he think it was not right for him to appear voluntarily, but that a minister should simply not appear before a Senate committee and give sworn evidence in that particular manner. I have moved this motion to pick up something of the spirit of that last substantial precedent for this set of events. I have, nevertheless, made it quite clear that I have not taken this issue as far as the then Minister for Communications did when he seemed to be implying in his remarks that not only should a minister not be compelled to appear before a Senate committee, but a minister should never appear before a Senate committee to give sworn testimony. That was his view at the time, and this chamber did not disabuse him of that view. Ministers may, from time to time, wish to appear voluntarily before a Senate committee and I do not see any harm in that. In these circumstances, the request that has been put forward by the Senate that this chamber require the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to appear before one of its committees is one that, in the normal course of events, honourable members on either side of this chamber have simply never tolerated. Honourable members on both sides of this chamber have been sensibly defensive of members' rights to independence of such requests. I think it will be quite useful to pass this motion because it will advise the Senate and set down pretty clearly the fact that it now encapsulates a whole raft of practice. Hopefully, it will encourage senators who may think of this sort of thing in the future to bear that in mind and perhaps not approach us in the way in which they have on this occasion.",80
143,Mr DOWNER,DOCUMENTS,"The genesis of the motion of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is, I think, worth reflecting on. It goes back to a time last year when the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) first got ,himself into very substantial difficulties. Indeed, during the so-called Victorian Loan Council crisis in which the Treasurer was involved, he of was, on a number of occasions, asked to resign from the position of Treasurer. It is perfectly clear from a body of evidence that has been brought before both houses of parliament that, on other occasions, the Treasurer simply misled the House. The Treasurer's activities in this Victorian Loan Council affair can be described as little short of disgraceful. The story is, of course, as honourable members would well know",81
144,Mr BEAZLEY,DOCUMENTS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which goes to the language of the honourable member in his discussion of the broader issue and his use of expressions such as 'disgraceful' and 'misled the House'. These are all appropriate to the discussion of a censure motion, not a discussion such as this.",81
145,Mr SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS,"Order! I have some sympathy, I must say, for the view that has been expressed by the Leader of the House, only inasmuch as there are forms of the House, whether or not they still exist under present circumstances, to move motions of that nature.",81
146,Mr BEAZLEY,DOCUMENTS,They do on 1 November.,81
147,Mr SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS,"Nevertheless, I invite the honourable member for Mayo to be a little temperate in his language and, indeed, to deal with the substance of the motion.",81
148,Mr DOWNER,DOCUMENTS,"Of course I am dealing with the substance of the motion, which is simply a question of whether or not the Treasurer should be required to attend a Senate committee. The reason that this question arises is because last year the Treasurer, on a number of occasions, tried to argue that he was unaware that the then Labor government in Victoria had exceeded its Loan Council determined limits and, at the same time, the Commonwealth published documentation in its budget last year showing that the Victorian government had not exceeded those limits. The simple proposition here was that the Treasurer knew from communications between his office and the office of the then Premier of Victoria, Mrs Kirner, that the Victorian government had exceeded its Loan Council limits at the very time the Treasurer was publishing budget documents which apparently showed that Victoria had not exceeded its Loan Council limits. This was a clear political· exercise. It was an exercise designed to try to prop up the flagging stocks of the Victorian government, to allow it to borrow more money than it should have been allowed to borrow and to do so without revealing the trick that had been played on the Loan Council and therefore on the Australian people. The Victorian government was able to use this money in order to try to bribe voters to support it at the election, a tactic that failed. The fact is that on this occasion the Treasurer failed to fulfil his obligations to this House, to the parliament and to the people of Australia by stating in clarity in budget documents what the borrowings were of the different states in accordance with the rules of the Loan Council. That is the key to this whole debate. The Senate has established a committee, supported not only by the coalition but also by the Australian Democrats and chaired by Senator Coulter from the Australian Democrats, in order to investigate further this matter. Honourable members will recall that, when the coalition first asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) whether he would be prepared to ensure that the Treasurer appeared before this committee, his response was not only that he· would not allow the Treasurer to appear before the committee-contrary to what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was saying a little earlier-but also that he would forbid ministers to appear before Senate committees. Honourable members may recall that it was in this context that extravagant language, such as the Senate being 'unrepresentative swill', flowed from the lips of the Prime Minister. The fact is, though, that the Senate, whether the Australian Labor Party likes it or not-the Labor Party likes it when in opposition but not when in government-is a legitimate part of our constitution and a legitimate part of this parliament. Indeed, federation would never have occurred-there would never have been agreement to federation-had it not been for the creation of the Senate and the equal representation of the states in the upper house. Federation simply would not have occurred without it. The Senate is an integral part of our parliamentary system and it is therefore an integral part of the legislature. This debate ultimately revolves around the rights of the legislature in relation to the rights of the executive. The government is trying to say-the backbench members of the legislature do not have a free vote in the Labor Party-that the executive's wishes always supersede the wishes of the legislature. The executive is always superior to the legislature. This is the very principle that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was talking about the other day in his memorable expression of Keating's republic, a republic where the executive is totally dominant and the legislature is simply subsumed or rendered irrelevant. This whole debate we are having at the moment about the Senate and its capacity to oppose financial and tax measures is ,another part of the same overall debate about the relationship between the executive and the legislature. The coalition, in the context of the budget in the Senate, is saying that the legislature is a fundamental part Of our constitution and the executive was not established, was not elected, in order to govern as a dictatorship for three years without any consultation with the legislature but instead to use the legislature as nothing more than a rubber stamp. The motion that the Leader of the House has moved today says that the executive should, at the end of the day, in the upper house have a superior position to the legislature. The many requests that have been made by the Senate to have a minister appear before a parliamentary committee have been rejected. When we stop to contemplate why they have been rejected, we see that it is not only this point of principle-the relationship between the executive and the legislature-but also another attempt by the Australian Labor Party to prop up an ailing Treasurer, to prop up a man who has been in nothing but trouble as the Treasurer of this country. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, this was simply the first of a whole range of different so-called resignation that the Treasurer himself became involved in. The last thing that the Labor Party wants is for the Treasurer, in the midst of a selfcreated budget crisis, to have to troupe across mistake? to appear before a Senate committee, or any parliamentary committee, and explain why he misled the parliament and misled the Australian people in relation to the Victorian Loan Council affair. I am certainly not moved to support this motion. I believe that the Treasurer should appear before the committee to give evidence. He should tell the committee what he knew at the time of the preparation of the budget papers last year. He should explain to the committee why he misled the parliament in the lead-up to the last Victorian election. He should explain why he and the then Premier, Mrs Kirner, were involved in an underhand, under-the-table attempt to try to prop up the fortunes of the ailing Labor government. The best way for that to happen is for the TreasurDairy er to appear before the committee. If the government insists that the Treasurer does not appear before the committee, then we can ask only one question: what does the government have to hide? Why is the government protecting the Treasurer? The Leader of the House made it perfectly clear in his speech-the Prime Minister does not agree with this-that he himself was not opposed in principle to ministers appearing before Senate Committees. But the Leader of the House. is absolutely determined to make sure that the Treasurer does not appear before this committee. I wonder why. Is it a great issue of principle? Of course it is not. It is a simple issue of trying to protect a man whom the Leader of the House himself knows is a guilty man in relation to the Victorian Loan Council affair.",81
149,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DOCUMENTS,"Watson) (3.12 p.m.)Putting aside the fUm-flam that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has tried to run before the House today, there are some matters of principle involved in this issue. I am sure the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable  remember some previous debates when the House dealt with the question of whether the issues right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) should have appeared before the Asia Dairy inquiry. Mr Howard - Have you never made a",83
150,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DOCUMENTS,"There was quite a lot of discussion in both the government and opposition parties of the day. If the honourable member for Bennelong is now saying that the government of the day made a mistake in not doing that, it has taken him a fair while to realise that mistake. However, it would be a mistake. for this House to require ministers to attend Senate committees. There is a lot of precedent for ministers not doing that.",83
151,Mr HOWARD,DOCUMENTS,What attitude did you take on the Asia Dairy issue?,83
152,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DOCUMENTS,"Ministers from this House do not attend Senate estimates committees. The honourable member for Bennelong asks me what 'position I took on the Asia issue. I hope that the honourable member for Bennelong might be consistent for once in his life. I hope that, when this motion is voted upon, the honourable member will take the same position this time as he took on the Asia Dairy issue-because he certainly did not vote for the right honourable member for New England to attend the Senate committee inquiry that was held in those days. But maybe things have changed now. Maybe a lot of the things that the honourable member for Bennelong says now are different from the things he said then-driven by the simple imperative that now he is on that side of the House, he wants to do something to the people on this side. The fact is that ministers from this House do not attend Senate estimates committees. Honourable members of this House do not attend Senate committee meetings. If this House were to require ministers to attend Senate committees, it would establish a wrong precedent. If ministers from this place were to attend Senate committee meetings, that would go against the spirit of the separation of powers between the two Houses and the independence of the two Houses of each other. 1 can be pretty sure of the results of a request, or a summons, from the House of Representatives to the Senate that some Senate minister should attend here and give evidence to a House of Repre!?entatives committee. We would get a resounding no from them, with the Clerk of the Senate standing up on his high horse giving advice to the opposition and to the President of the Senate about the propriety of it. This is just a crude little stick-up by the Senate, and people should accept it as that. The honourable member for Mayo wants to make accusations against the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that he knows are not true. The honourable member for Mayo is wrong in saying that the Treasurer misled the House. He did not mislead the House. The government is not trying to hide behind any of the practices of the past, but we should not step away from those practices. We should not have ministers from this place, be they the highest or the lowest, attend Senate committee meetings to give evidence to them. Mr Downer-That is not what the Leader of the Opposition said. He said they could.",83
153,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DOCUMENTS,"The honourable member for Mayo had his go. He nearly got put out today for interjecting, so he should quiet and let someone else have his say now.",84
154,Mr HOWARD,DOCUMENTS,"That is very, very difficult when you are talking.",84
155,Mr SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS,Order!,84
156,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DOCUMENTS,"The honourable member for Mayo has not learnt anything from the past. The honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Bennelong know what happened here the last time this occurred. I hope that they will show some consistency in the way they behave this afternoon. But, even if they do not show that consistency, which 1 expect they will notalthough the honourable member for Kooyong might be more likely to than the honourable member for Bennelong - 1 think the House should stick to the principle that we have adopted in the past. We should stick to the separation between the two Houses. We should not have ministers or members of this House attend Senate committees to give evidence, even voluntarily.",84
157,Mr MACKELLAR,DOCUMENTS," I have been listening to the debate with, a great deal of interest. 1 heard the honourable member for Watson (Me Leo MCLeay) get up and talk about principles. 1 did not discern any principles in the statements that he made. We are looking at the principle of the government and the legislature. The legislature, whether we like it or not, at present comprises both the Senate and the House of Representatives. 1 will not go into personalities in relation to this matter; 1 think we should try to keep it to the principle of the rights of the legislature as against the principle of the executive government of the day. 1 speak with some degree of feeling because 1 appeared before a House of Representatives committee in 1982 in relation to my administration of the Department of Health in an investigation that one of the House of Representatives committees was conducting. 1 do not think it is a question of whether the committee is from the Senate or the House of Representatives. We should look at the responsibilities of members of the executive government to appear before·committees be of the parliament if they are requested to do so. That is the principle we are looking at. Everybody has their prejudices about the relative importance of the House of Representatives and the Senate. I think we can set that aside at this stage because we are looking at the reality of the situation, which is that we do have a Senate and a House of Representatives and that each of those Houses has relevant committees which have the power to require people to appear before them. Unfortunately, the situation that has become apparent is that we have a burgeoning of the power of the executive as against the powers of the legislature. That has not been so apparent in the Senate,. where the government of the day does not have a majority, but it is certainly the case in the House of Representatives. If one were at least a trifle honest in looking at the performance of the House of Representatives, one would have to say that the government of the day-particularly this government-has ridden roughshod over the rights of non-executive members of the House of Representatives. What the executive government wants in the House of Representatives goes. The government, particularly being of the political persuasion that it is at the present time, requires its members to toe the caucus line. If they do not, they get' expelled, unless they are the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). He would winMr Costello-He gets suspended.",84
158,Mr MACKELLAR,DOCUMENTS,"He would get suspended, but he would probably win any election in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. Anybody else does not have that right. In the House of Representatives at the present time the executive rides roughshod over the rights of members. We have only to see the situation which is currently obtaining in the House of Representatives to see the pluperfect example of that domination and derogation of the rights of individual members of the House of Representatives. Let us look at the principle. What is the principle? Whether we are elected to this parliament as senators or members of the House of Representatives, are we elected to discharge our duties as representatives of the people? If we are ....... which I believe we then we have the right to call upon members of the executive, whether we are members of a Senate committee or a House of Representatives commit-ee, to appear before that committee. The fact that we have had a situation in the past, which the honourable member for Watson and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) have brought to our attention, does not mean to say that that should necessarily be cast in tablets of stone. We can hopefully look forward to a more effective functioning of the institution of parliament, as it is currently constituted in this country, to discharge its responsibilities as being representative of the people. From time to time, that may mean that members of the executive government are discomforted by being required to appear and explain their actions. We had a situation only this week in the House of Representatives where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), with fickle determination, closed down question time. Therefore, members of both the government party and the opposition parties were not allowed to ask questions of the executive government. We have a situation where the opposition is not allowed to move motions of censure or propose matters of public importance. Because the executive government controls the numbers in the House of Representatives, we have a situation where the effective functioning of individual members has been set aside by the actions of this government. When I hear the Prime Minister stand up and talk about the setting aside of parliamentary conventions by the opposition and when I see the way in which he has treated the institution of the House of Representatives in recent times, it causes me to question his capacity for analysis and for having any relation to truthfulness when he speaks. Leaving that aside, we are members of the institution of parliament in this country. Whether we are in the Senate or the House of Representatives, we pride ourselves on being elected and having these rights and duties. If that is the case, and if the executive governarement is subservient to the role of the legislature-the houses of parliament-then neither the Leader of the House, who is at the table, nor the honourable member for Watson can argue along the lines that they have. In this situation, the legislature-the houses of parliament: the Senate and the House. of Representatives-and its institutions must prevail over the government of the day. Therefore, on a matter of principle, I think it is only proper and right that if a properly constituted Senate or House of Representatives committee requires a minister of the day to appear before it and explain his or her actions, that minister should appear. To set that principle aside, I think, is to demean the overall responsibilities and importance of the houses of parliament of this country. .I think that we, and any government of any political persuasion, should look very carefully at adopting that point of view. The political wheel turns, as we all know, but what we as members of parliament on both sides of the political equation seek is enhance and develop the role of parliament as an effective arbiter of democracy in this country. I do not think that is putting it too strongly. If we seek to denigrate, or if we effectively denigrate, that role by the executive government using its numbers in the House of Representatives to absolve itself of that responsibility, I think it derogates very greatly. from the role of parliament as a whole. Therefore, on a question of high principle, I would oppose the proposition being put by the government at this stage.",85
159,Mr MACK,DOCUMENTS,"I will be very brief. I would like to rise in support of the comments of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar). He put his comments very well. This is a very interesting debate and is part of the changing role of the Senate. The issue really boils down to the accountability of executive government. If there is any issue in this country that has caused problems over the last decade in Australia, it is the failure of execis utive governments to be accountable to parliaments. For better or for worse, the Senate is part of the parliament. I see the accountability of the executive as an important principle which will certainly improve the workings of the whole legislature. We are seeing a change in the role of the Senate, which has occurred as a result of the change to proportional voting. This year we have seen the first negotiated budget, I think, in living memory, and we are going to see many more of them. Unless the government can find some way to alter the voting system for the Senate, I do not think any group will ever again dominate the Senate. This is going to cause quite a change in our system of government. But the government should not be particularly worried about it. American cabinet ministers have had to put up with this sort of situation since time immemorial. It is interesting to note that, when the American government's health policy was recently launched, the President was required to go before six committees of the legislature-six committees. This situation is accepted by the President and all the to committee members. This might be horrific to people who are used to the style of executive government just handing down policies on tablets of stone and saying that not a line will be changed, as it has been in the previous system. But we have passed that era and it is no good harking back to the past and trying to be conservative about it. This principle of the accountability .of the executive is something that we should all support.",86
160,Mr HOWARD,DOCUMENTS,"I would like to complete the North Shore contiguous trilogy and join the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) in expressing opposition to the motion that has been put forward. I think it is important to analyse exactly what is being proposed here by the Senate. The Senate is not purporting to assert a superior power over this House. It is not even purporting to assert a collateral relationship with this House. All the Senate doing is requesting the House of Representatives to do something. The issue is not the pride of the House of Representatives, or the sensitivity of members of the House of Representatives to the Senate. The matter at issue is whether members of the House of Representatives are prepared to tell the executive to do something. That is the issue. I will come in a moment to what may have happened in 1981. But it seems to me, for example, that if this House had properly constituted legislation committees, which many people believed it should have, it would have been very strange if ministers were not required to attend meetings of those particular committees. In those circumstances, I do not have any trouble at all in opposing this motion. There is a political history to it, which my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has dealt with very adequately. Let me come to the question of what happened in 1981. On that occasion there was no such request and, as a result, there was no vote taken in this parliament on that particular issue. I do not want to go into all of the background of that issue. Because I was not directly involved my own recollection of it is fairly thin. I do not know whether the government of the day would have taken the same attitude as the government is now taking had it faced a request from the Senate-and I say this to the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay)-but the fact is that it did not. Whether it might have or might not have is, in a sense, irrelevant. If we are really interested in making intelligent decisions about what is the right thing to do now, then it is a rather absurd proposition to say that a political party or a group of individuals either here or elsewhere cannot change their minds on something over a period of 11 years, 20 years, or 30 years-even if they did have a different view 11 years or 15 years ago. I do very strongly endorse what my colleague the honourable member for Warringah has said. This is an issue of the supremacy of parliament over the executive. The government is asserting that this House has no right to make ministers in this House accountable for their ministerial responsibilities. I think that it is an untenable proposition. It shows how deeply ingrained is the authoritarian view of executive government on the Labor Party side. When I made that remark several days ago about a foretaste of republican rule under the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I really did mean it, because part and parcel of the constitutional agenda that the current Prime Minister has in mind is to more deeply embed the notion of executive authoritarianism. The genius of the Westminster system has always been-with whatever imperfections-to make the executive accountable before the parliament itself. I simply conclude by saying that we are asking the House of Representatives to respond to a request-not a direction, not an instruction-from the Senate to require one of our own ministers to attend before the Senate. I think that is, in constitutional terms, an entirely proper request. I think it would be right thing to comply with it, and I hope the House does. For those reasons, the coalition in this place will oppose the motion that has been moved by the minister.",86
161,Mr HOLDING,DOCUMENTS,"I was interested to hear the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) invoke as part of his argument a reference to the traditions of Westminster. I remind the honourable gentleman that the traditions of Westminster are very clear on this particular point. The pri vileges that are attached to the House of Commons and to the House of Lords are separate privileges. I know of no occasion when the House of Lords has sought, as a matter of privilege, to exert its authority over any member of the House of Commons. Equally, in our system, which is based upon the Westminster system,. it is perfectly clear that the privileges which are attached to this House are the responsibilities of this House, and the privileges that attach to the Senate are its responsibilities. For the opposition to come into this House, as a blind sort of exercise, and make a whole range of allegations against the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) first of all undermines the processes of this House, because if those allegations had any substance in fact then there are processes of this House available to the opposition within this parliament to raise those issues. A great deal of nonsense is now being talked about the Senate. It was constituted first of all as a states house-a states house! When has the Senate or any group of senators ever sought the view on any particular issue of the states they purport to represent? It has never occurred and it never will occur. A house of review it may be for those members of the Greens or the Australian Democrats who do not have any representation in this House. But for those opposite to say of their senatorial colleagues-who go with them dutifully every Monday, Tuesday or whenever they meet in their party room, who deliberate on every political issue that is going to be raised by the coalition and who put their hands up to say yea or nay to a particular process or to a particular policy-that they shed their parliathe mentary affiliations when in the Senate and become members of a house of review is not only political nonsense but also a political lie. Is the honourable member for Bennelong, or any of his colleagues who have been talking about executive power, prepared to get up in this House and say that this issue in relation to the Treasurer has not been raised in the party room, has not been considered, has not been discussed? Of course it has. While I do not agree with all of the honourable member's positions-for example, his attitude towards the monarchy and British traditions-he nevertheless has had my respect. However, his actions in this matter do him no honour. Having taken a political view on the actions of the Treasurer, he decided within the party room the political processes to be followed in the Senate. He then came into this House and said that the issue is between one part of the parliament and the executive government of the day. In effect, he was saying that we should curtail the privileges of this House. I remind all honourable members that the privileges of this House attach not only to the House in its entirety but also to its individual members. This is not an argument about the changing nature of the Senate. While there are a few independent senators in that place who are adopting a different sort of role, the only reason the opposition has made itself privy and party to the goings-on there is its very deep level of political frustration, which is evident in this House every day, at having been rejected at the last election. I can underthere stand that frustration but it does not excuse the opposition's actions. The honourable member for Bennelong came in here and said that the conflict is between the executive and this parliament. The suggestion that the Senate is in some way an extension of this parliament is a proposition that would not be accepted even by the Senate itself. There is probably no institution in the Westminster system more jealous of its prerogatives and privileges than the Senate. If a member of the Senate involved himself or herself in some process with which the executive government of the day was unhappy and this House took the view that the process could be in breach of the privileges of this House, does the honourable member for Bennelong believe for one moment that the Senate would yield up that senator to a privileges committee for this House to sit in judgment? He knows that it would not, I know that it would not, and every honourable member in this House knows that it would not. I ask the honourable member not to demean this institution by suggesting otherwise. This institution must continue to exercise its prerogatives and privileges. If the opposition, particularly some of its leading members, would only spend a bit more time reading the standing orders and making· themselves familiar with the processes and procedures of this House instead of trying to turn proceedings such as question time into one huge gang bang, we would all be better off. If there were one tittle of truth in the allegation against the Treasurer, it would be pursued where it should be pursued, and that is in this House against a member of this House. I have seen some loose political exercises in my time. I can understand the frustration of honourable members, particularly that of the  cock), who has been in opposition far too long. He has some years to go before he catches up with my time in opposition, but I understand his frustration and I understand the overall tension. But, please, for all its anxiety and tension, I ask the opposition not to come forward with a set of arguments which, if were any merit to them, could be pursued through the processes of this parliament. The processes available are wide and would allow the sorts of serious allegations we have heard today to be pursued. But we will create great trouble for this institution-and if I might say so for the Senate-if this parliament abandons the privilege which attaches to it as an institution and which we must all jealously guard and, more importantly, if it abandons on any occasion the privilege attached to each member of this parliament. The recommendation before the House is proper. It goes to the privileges of this institution and to the separation that is an integral part of the constitutional process between this House and the Senate. It ought to be supported. If honourable members opposite want to pursue this political exercise, I suggest that there are methods which they can do that in this parliament. will not be easy because they do not have the numbers-but at least it ought to be tried.",87
162,Mr COSTELLO,DOCUMENTS,"Higgins) (3.41 p.m.)The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has just drawn a red herring across this debate. He has tried to tum it into a question of privilege. We, on this side the House, believe entirely-:as he said-in the principle that the House should guard privileges. There is no question about that. This is a question of the House determining how to exercise one of its privileges. not saying the House should give away privileges or that the Senate should have some right in every circumstance to call somebody before a Senate committee. It is our position to say that the rights of House-or those of any member of this willing House-should be forfeited as a matter of course to the Senate. But we have to come back very carefully to what is going on. House has received a message",89
163,Mr HOLDING,DOCUMENTS,But you discussed it in the party room. You know that.,89
164,Mr COSTELLO,DOCUMENTS,"The honourable member is completely wrong. It has not been cussed in the party room. The message received was that the Senate requests the House of Representatives to require the attendance of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The Senate in this case has not asserted any right to call Treasurer before it, nor has it asserted any right over the conduct of a member of this House. The Senate has passed a message to this House and has requested this House, wants being the guardian of its own privileges, take into account whether or not-in these circumstances-it, exercising its privileges, should require the Treasurer to appear before a Senate committee. The motion that has been moved does not go into the circumstancesthat in every case. MrLeo MCLeay-You've never heard of this before?",89
165,Mr COSTELLO,DOCUMENTS,"The honourable member has never heard of a lot. That is why he is longer the Speaker. The motion does not go to the circumstances concerned in this request of the Senate. The motion seeks to assert that in every circumstance it is not appropriate by that a minister, or any member of the House It of Representatives, be required to appear before a committee; in other words, that this House should bind itself to saying that it is not appropriate in any circumstances for a minister, or a member of the House of Representatives, to be required to appear before a committee of the Senate against that person's of will. So the motion moved by those opposite is to try t- bind, in all sorts of circumits stances-by asserting a new doctrine-that in no circumstances could a minister, or a member of the House of Representatives, We are appear before a Senate committee. The argument of honourable ,members opposite is that processes could be engaged in, in this House, to require a minister to not appear before a committee of this House. this There might be, if the government were to set up one of those processes. But there might also be times when the parliament says, 'What would be the point of running an This inquiry concurrently into the same matter between the Senate and the House?'. In those circumstances, the House might well say, 'Rather than run two inquiries into the same subject matter, it would be useful to have it done in one inquiry'. There would be circumdisstances where it· would be proper for a minister or member to appear before a Senate committee. We are saying that there might be such the circumstances. We also believe that this is one of the circumstances. The Treasurer, if he has nothing to hide, and if he wishes to have the matter cleared up once and for all and to justify and vindicate his position, has to an obvious solution. He could go to the Senate like a shot, making his case and putting all the details before the Senate committee. We think that would be a good exercise in this case. But I am not arguing for Mr Leo MCLeay-You should go with him.",89
166,Mr COSTELLO,DOCUMENTS,"I might appear and do no some cross-examination. Each case has to be judged on its merits. There are proper times when ministers should be made accountable to the parliament and when the Senate, as a constituent part of the parliament, has the right to inquire into these things. The Senate, in this case, is inquiring into such matters. is proper, and it would be in the interests of not only the Senate but also this House-the whole of the parliament-if the Treasurer were to appear. That is· why we oppose this motion. This motion cannot be answered by the assertion of some - nchangeable doctrine that does not fit the circumstance and which says that in each case this should not occur. We should recognise that this matter concerns the privilege of the House. It is up to the House to make the decision. We are saying that in these circumstances the House would be well advised to accede to the fact that the executive should account to the parliament. The Senate, being in the process of doing that accounting, would be assisted by the Treasurer in these circumstances. In those circumstances no privilege of the House or doctrine is infringed. Our position is that it has to be judged on the circumstances-and that in these circumstances it is apposite and appropriate.",89
167,Mr BEAZLEY,DOCUMENTS,"in reply-There has been quite an Interesting debate on both sides of the chamber about a matter of parliamentary privilege. There are one or two points I want to make in winding up the debate. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) alluded to whether ministers ought to appear before Senate committees. That is not prohibited by this motion. It goes to the question of whether a minister or any other member of this House should be required to do so. . It is perfectly appropriate for minister- and members of the House to appear-if they want-before any set of Senate committees. Apparently we have tried to educate the Senate over the years-in times before mine-that it does not need to request leave of this House. If it is to make a request, a request about leave. We have suggested from time to time that the Senate should obviate that process and go straight to the member concerned and ask whether he or she would like to tum up-not bother us with it. But that procedure is now time honoured as It an interpretation of the appropriate relationship between the chambers. Ministers are members of parliament in the first instance-they are ministers second-and are therefore no different from any other person in this House when that occurs. A particular case from which we considered a lot of material for this motion was that of the right' honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). He asserted two things, one of which we would not completely agree with and the other which is interesting to note in this case. As far as we are concerned it is the appropriate way for the Senate to have proceeded. The chairman of the Senate committee which requested the presence of the right honourable member at that time was Senator Rae, a Liberal senator from Tasmania. His request was not expressed via the House of Representatives or the Senate. Operating properly and sensibly on the basis of what by then had become the practice of Senate committees, of communicating directly, knowing that it is not necessary to seek leave for a voluntary appearance, he wrote to the honourable member and asked whether he would like to appear and swear on oath that other evidence that had been given on oath was false or incorrect. Me Sinclair did two things. Firstly, he sent a letter saying he was not going to appear. Secondly, he said that he did not believe that it was appropriate to make a minister appear on oath before a Senate· committee. He said:' I do not believe it appropriate that a Minister of this House should appear and give sworn evidence before a committee of the other House. Mr Downer-You are trying to get him to do it.",90
168,Mr BEAZLEY,DOCUMENTS,"No, we are not. There was no resolution on this side of the House, to my recollection, to that effect. There were plenty of motions on the conflict of evidence it is between what the right honourable member had to say about the circumstances of the Asia Dairy Industries inquiry and what the witnesses had to say. We had quite a lot to say about it in this House. In the circumstances, as far as I am aware, and certainly not from any of the evidence in House of Representatives Practice, we did not require the right honourable member to appear before that committee in response to that committee's request that he might do so. So I think it is very important that we contemplate what is actually in this motion. This motion does not prohibit any minister appearing before a committee of the other place. It does not prohibit any member appearing before a Senate committee. What it does prohibit is the compulsion of that course of action by either House. There will arise, from time to time, opportunities to make political hay by utilising majorities in one place or the other. One can think of quite a few occasions in which it might be nice for members on this side of the House to find an opportunity to harass the odd tormenter that we discover in the Senate. It would not take the art of a person of the understanding and long experience of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) to dream up one or two things that might have the odd member of the Liberal Party in the Senate before a House of Representatives committee having an exceptionally interesting time. But the fact of that we do not do that sort of thing-though, it is obviously open to us-and on the interpretation of the Mr Downer-We would crush you.",90
169,Mr BEAZLEY,DOCUMENTS,"The honourable member's colleague was proud of his cross-examination technique and said that he would look forward to those opportunities. The only case I am aware of that has contributed to his fame was the Dollar SweefS case, when he was led by a silk. We are not yet sure of the honourable member's cross-examination capacity as it was not evident then, and it is yet to be tested. It mayor may not be good.",91
170,Mr HOLDING,DOCUMENTS,He carried the books beautifully.,91
171,Mr BEAZLEY,DOCUMENTS,"We know he carries the books beautifully; we do not yet know his cross-examination technique. Because of the decent behaviour of this House, we will never test that technique of his-at least, not on a senator-because we will not be requiring senators to appear compulsorily beforeMr Leo MCLeay-He didn't do too well with Kerry Packer.",91
172,Mr BEAZLEY,DOCUMENTS,"Actually, I had forgotten that. I have in fact witnessed the cross-examination technique of the honourable member on one occasion. It did not cause us to tremble in our boots, I have to say, and it did not cause another gentlemen to tremble in his boots either. It has not been my intention to deal with the actual issues in terms of the procedures of the Senate committee itself. I have been more interested in this motion in relation to the appropriate relationship between members.of this chamber and members of the other chamber. But since one or two of the spokesmen on the other side had a deal to say about that, I might say this: this is a product of a tawdry exercise prior to the last election. It is an effort to use those numbers to embarrass the government for political effect. Although that sort of behaviour ought not to be encouraged in any set of circumstances, it certainly ought not to be encouraged to the detriment of the long standing privileges and rights of this House and the members of this House. For those reasons, I trust that the House will the matter is support this motion. Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided. [3.58 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.2) 1993-94 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the bill be now read a second time.",93
175,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEES,"Higgins) (4.06 p.m.)For those who are sitting in the galleries this afternoon, I should explain that Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1993-94 seeks to spend about $5 billion of taxpayers' money. The government will close the debate at 4.10 p.m. The government proposes that the parliament will have four minutes, at about $1 billion a minute, to consider Appropriation Bill (No.2), one of the main budget bills that appropriates taxpayers' funds for the running of the ordinary services of government. The bill provides for proposed expenditure on capital works, various advances in loans, plant and equipment and expenditure on new initiatives flowing from legislatioo previously approved. The appropriation bill also appropriates the money which has already been supplied to the government under supply bills to keep it going until these appropriation bills go through. The appropriation bills make up the government's budget package. Let it be made clear the opposition is not voting against the appropriation bills; it is not voting against budget bills. The opposition is not seeking to prevent the government having the money available to run the ordinary services of government. From the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been carrying on in the last couple of days, one would think the reverse was true. He wound himself up at the beginning of this week, no doubt sitting in his chair listening to his Mahler symphonies, to say that some huge breach of convention would happen in this parliament. Report The fact is we will not be opposing Appropriation Bill (No.2), Appropriation Bill (No. 1) having already gone through. What we are opposing are those pernicious and regressive taxes that the government did not announce before the election but which it popped on the Australian people afterwards in breach of its mandate, the promises that it had made and the faith that the Australian people had, we said misguidedly, shown in it at the election. The government has made sure that every Australian is today paying more for his or her petrol, more wholesale sales tax and more wine tax, although it has not even been through the parliament yet. The government has completely breached whatever mandate it got after the election. This is a government that said before the election that its income tax cuts were l-a-w and that it did not need any indirect tax increases. It is a government which conned the Australian people into believing it, pretended that it would not raise tax and then, after it was elected into office, turned around and did all the things that it said it would not do. The opposition is saying that governments have to be kept accountable. There is a point in having an election: it is to give people the choice between policies. They get a choice between policies only if the policies that they have chosen are actually held against the government of the day. That is why we in the opposition have made no bones from the very outset about the fact that we do not believe this government has a mandate to increase the wholesale sales tax, to increase the price of petrol, to retrospectively tax annual leave and to increase the tax on wine. We do not support that. We believe it was a breach of the electoral promises that were made, and we will vote against them. In the remaining 20 seconds that I have left to talk about how the $5 billion is to be spent, I can say that this opposition has never said it will oppose supplying the money to the government to run the ordinary services of government. Just as Appropriation Bill (No. 1) was passed some days ago, so too will this bill be passed in due course.",94

APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1993-94 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the bill be now read a second time.",95
178,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEES,"Higgins) (4.11 p.m.)Those people sitting in the gallery have just watched the parliament appropriate $5 billion worth of taxes. That is the way in which this government runs this parliament. That is the way in which it allows this parliament to scrutinise where all of those taxes, which it sucks from the public at petrol bowsers, supermarkets and everything else it can get its hands on, are spent. We have just watched $5 billion worth of those taxes being spent under the rules that this government allows to operate in this parliament. Now we come to another appropriation. Honourable members will be pleased to know that this time we have got about 40 minutes to spend $126 million. This relates to the appropriation for parliamentary departments, including the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate, which operate separately. This bill seeks appropriations of about $126 million for the running costs to keep those parliamentary departments going. We might well ask, 'Is that $126 million being well spent?', when at the end of the day there is only five minutes to scrutinise the expenditure of $5 billion. I am not saying for a moment that this is the fault of the staff of the House of Representatives and the staff of the Senate, who work long, hard and well. Mr Deputy Speaker, like you I am sure, I believe that the clerks and those who work in this building do a magnificent job in keeping the business of the parliament running. I sometimes think that they must see some of their hopes dashed when the goveffilIlent introduces guillotines and rules, as it has. Those who have given a lifetime of service, because they believe in this particular institution and what it stands for, must look aghast at the way in which the government performs its legislative timetable as it is at the moment under this guillotine. The history of parliament is a history of the people wresting power from monarchs. Nations basically sprang into existence under the rule of the king. The area that the king could control became his kingdom, and the modern derivation is of course a nation. The principle was rex is lex--he king is law. The whole history of parliament was the assertion of the people grabbing power off monarchs. After a period, monarchs used to appoint ministers. The parliament then began to assert its right to scrutinise those ministers-its right to bring those ministers down-and to assert the right that there could not be taxation without representation and that money could only be appropriated for ministers to run functions of government with parliamentary approval. We got to the position in modern parliamentary democracy where the parliament had wrested from the monarch, from the executive, all of those important and significant powers. The way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) carries on-he is known as the number one republican-he would, no doubt, like to go back to the practice of the autocratic Stuarts. He would like to wrest back the powers from the parliament to the executive when it comes to scrutiny of government, exercising powers to ensure that administration is being carried out properly, inquiries and investigations, and question time. Question Time is a procedure which is designed to make the executive accountable to the parliament as representing the people, so ministers have to come in and answer questions. The first derogation from the principle that the Prime Minister seems to have practised so well is the principle of never answering a question. Every question is treated as an absolute opportunity to make a speech about whatever happens to be exercising his mind or whatever insults seem to be flowing out of his mouth at that time. On some occasions, when question time goes particularly badly, as we saw on Tuesday of this week, the Prime Minister ups and outs of this place. He walked out after the second question was answered or was attempted to be answered because the day was going badly for the government. Asserting the old autocratic impulses that make him so reminiscent of the Stuart monarchy, he walked out of the parliament and refused to take any more questions. The behaviour is not only bad in relation to question time. The opposition generally has the opportunity to debate the issue of the day in a matter of public importance. It has the opportunity to raise on behalf of the electorate what it considers to be a matter of pressing importance on that day and to debate it. The Prime Minister has absolutely abolished that for the whole month. So there is no opportunity in this parliament to raise, on behalf the people of Australia, the issues that concern them for the whole month-to debate them, to bring them to the government's attention and to probe the government where it might be going wrong. The Prime Minister not only did that; he then said that he would suspend standing orders, so if there were any censure motions or no confidence motions to be moved they could not be moved for a month. Apparently it does not matter how badly the ministry performs in that month, we do not even get the opportunity to move a censure motion or a want of confidence motion in order to bring these issues to the attention of the parliament or the people of Australia-whether it be question time, matters of public importance, censure motions, no confidence motions; all those important parliamentary conventions. This Prime Minister shows no interest in all of those important parliamentary conventions that make an executive and a ministry accountable to the peOple; in fact, he shows blatant disregard and contempt for the institution of parliament and the way in which it operates. This week a great campaign was launched on Sunday by the Prime Minister to assert that there was a convention that he believed in, a convention that, according to him, said that the Senate-one of the parts of the parliament-had no right to vote against regressive tax bills that it might be opposing on behalf of the people of Australia or on behalf of those that elected it. We saw the Prime Minister all worked up at the beginning of the week to assert this convention, this supposed convention that is locked in stone, this supposed convention that the terrible opposition was breaking by voting against taxes that a majority of the Australian people believe are unwarranted and do not support. They believe that it represents a great breaching of the mandate of the government at the last election. Those opposite came in here on the first question time of the week, one of the few opportunities left to ask the government how it operates, and it turned out that this convention, which had been long set out in stone, which could not be defied of because of parliamentary practice in this country, and which had got the Prime Minister worked up into a lather on the PM program and was going to be the target and spearhead of his attack during this week to try to get his ill-fated and failed budget through this parliament, was the very convention that this government, when last in opposition, had not only broken but had broken to succeed ih defeating taxes in the Senate. When the questions and statements were put to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who was the shadow Treasurer in the last Labor opposition, about how he had acted in relation to the sales tax bills, which had been part of the budget bills, it turned out that he had not only voted and led the charge against those bills but had also succeeded in knocking off sales tax bills. The Minister for Finance did it in these tenns on 27 August 1981 when he said: This is not blocking Supply. We are not suggesting a blockage of the Appropriation Bills and therefore putting the Government in jeopardy. All that we are saying is that there ought to be a blockage of these tax Bills because they are not in the best interest of this country. That is what he said in 1981 - He knew there was no convention in 1981 on voting against sales tax bills in a budget that he opposed. He not only knew that, but he also argued against there being any convention, and he actually led the opposition in voting against them. In August 1981, the Minister for Finance, who was then shadow Treasurer, also said: ... the Opposition is implacably opposed to these measures . . . they will have an adverse effect on the living standards of Australian families, they affect the equity of the tax system in a quite regressive way and they will most certainly add to the inflation rate. That could have been a speech on this year's budget, because the breaking of all those promises, all the new taxes that were never talked about before the election, and all the taxes that we saw after the election-after we had heard from the government that it was not its intention to put up taxes-just happened to be regressive, to have an adverse effect on the living standards of Australian families, to affect the equity of the tax system in quite a regressive way and, 10 and behold, put up the inflation rate as well. The government has been quite honest in its budget forecast that its tax measures will lift inflation. These are regressive taxes because they fall on the rich and the poor equally, and they do nothing for the equity of the tax system. The Minister for Finance knew there was no convention when it came to blocking tax measures. He knew that the Prime Minister's attempt to assert such a convention was a deception. He knew that because he had led the charge against sales tax measures as shadow Treasurer in 1981. He not only led the charge, but he was also successful in the assault. He was so successful that in 1981 these sales tax bills were rejected by the Senate within the tenns of section 57 of the Constitution. It was no token opposition; it was an opposition that actually succeeded, and led to the double dissolution in 1983. All it took was two questions to the Minister for Finance on Tuesday to make absolutely clear that the Prime Minister's supposed convention was no convention at all. All it took was two questions to the Minister for Finance to blow away the government's strategy this week. The Minister for Finance knew that, if there was any convention, he destroyed it in 1981, and he got himself into trouble on Tuesday by merely telling the truth. When the Minister for Finance tried to amplify or elaborate upon the reasons why in . 1981 the opposition had taken that very same position, he went to great lengths to say that this was a convention that had been broken will by both sides of the House. I ask: what sort of convention is broken by both sides of the House? No convention at all. There is no such thing as a convention that is not observed. In his .mind the Prime Minister is probably confusing the word 'convention' with , invention' when it comes to voting against tax measures, and the Minister for Finance is quite open about that. He said that he was justified in taking that position in 1981 because of the circumstances-they were regressive taxes and all the rest of it. That is exactly the reason why we say we are justified in 1993 in taking that position. The taxes are regressive, they do nothing for the economy and, even worse, they represent a massive fraud on the Australian people. Just last week the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) pointed out that there have been no less than 169 occasions when a Labor opposition has attempted to block coalition government legislation. In 1967, Senator Murphy said: There is no· tradition, as has been suggested, that the Senate will not use its constitutional powers, whenever it considers it necessary or desirable to do so, in the public interest. There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional powers, except the limitations self-imposed by discretion and reason. There is no tradition in the Australian Labor Party that we will not oppose in the Senate any tax or money Bill or what might be described as a financial measure. In 1970, the then leader of the Labor Party went further, claiming that 'any Government which is defeated by the parliament on a major taxation Bill should resign'. Later in the year he went even further, telling this House: We will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and to destroy the Government which sponsored it. In 1981 the Labor opposition did vote against sales tax bills in an endeavour to destroy the government. Do honourable members know who voted with the gove--nt? The honourable member for Blaxland, the current Prime Minister, voted with the governmentthe man who sought to put across to this House that there was some irresistible convention that this should never be done. In 1981 he was there doing it. As I said, he probably confuses convention with invention, but the so-called convention was an invention. It died this week and it rests happily in its grave. A few people tried to put a gloss on this convention after it had become clear that Labor in opposition had not followed any convention. The most inventive gloss that was tried during the week was that put by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) on the PM program. In an absolutely ripping performance to try to establish this convention, he adumbrated a new doctrine about when an opposition could and could not vote against budget tax measures. On the PM program on 5 October 1993 this is the doctrine the Leader of the House put forward: . . . the Labor Party has operated on this basis. They have determined their tactics on opposing budgets, by whether or not they're likely to be successful. There's nothing wrong with standing up and opposing a budget, making your point, taking it through to a division in circumstances where you know you're going to lose. In circumstances where you know you're going to win, you have to be much more careful. The gloss applied by the Leader of the House was this: any party can vote against budget tax measures as long as it does not win. His view was that it is all okay to vote against budget tax measures as long as we know that we will lose, but. if we should ever win, then we have a convention which says that we cannot take that path. . The trouble with the 'Beazley gloss' on the reinvented con,vention is that in 1981, when the Minister for Finance, the then shadow Treasurer, voted against these measures, he actually managed to win. He succeeded against all of his obligations in winning the vote and thereby, presumably, even breaking the 'Beazley gloss' on the convention. It was the 'Beazley gloss' that tried to re-establish the convention that died. The second, and later, attempt said that this convention came into action upon the deregulation of the Australian financial system. This was a much better gloss on this convention because this actually allowed one to say that all oppositions which had voted against tax measures prior to 1981 were justified in doing so. They were justified because the convention which said that opposition parties did not vote against budget tax bills only came into effect with financial deregulation. The genius of this position was that financial deregulation only came in after this government came into office. So the convention that stopped oppositions voting against tax bills only applies to this opposition for the benefit of this government. It did not apply when the present government was in opposition and we were in government. This was quite a. clever one indeed. But let me tell the House that parliamentary conventions have nothing to do with whether or not financial markets are regulated or deregulated. We cannot pull out the book of practice for the House of Representatives and look up conventions under financial deregulation in the index. We will not find any rider in the history of the Commonwealth that will assert a convention hinges on the state of the financial markets, or the state of regulation of the financial markets, or any such other rubbish. The real convention that this government wants to assert is a convention that says nobody will ever vote against its budget tax bills, but it has the right to vote against everybody else's budget tax bills. The real convention that it wants to assert is one that says, 'We are untouchable and you are thoroughly attackable'. There is no way in which we can fit the pieces of the puzzle into all these supposed conventions in accordance with the way in which parliamentary practice has developed over the last 10 years and make any general principle other than that one. When the current Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), the then shadow treasurer, was leading the attack on budget tax measures in 1981, he said that the tax measures would adversely affect the living standards of Australian families. I was amused to pull out the speech he made in defence of that proposition because it relied upon a paper by Mr Neil Warren in relation to distributional effects as evidence to show that the labor opposition in 1981 was justified in voting against those sales tax measures. Dr Neil Warren, as he is now, of the University of New South Wales, prepared a distributional analysis of the current budget, which was released by the coalition on 8 September. It found that by 1996-97 the budget would leave all Australians worse off. The principle asserted in 1981 by the then shadow Treasurer relied on the same person who, when he analysed the current Treasurer's budget, came to the same conclusion-that the 1996-97 budget would leave all Australians worse off. On the princione ples that were argued then as to why budget tax measures should be opposed, this government strikes out-strike one. Back in 1981 the then shadow Treasurer said that the Fraser government's tax measures would regressively affect the equity of the tax system. Dr Warren's analysis shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that the lowest income Australians are hardest hit by this bUdget. A person earning less than $2,700 does not get a tax cut. At best, that person would get $3 of guilt money, as some kind of sop for the government's failure to take into account those who are on lower income levels. But those on lower income levels still pay the petrol tax increase, the wholesale sales tax increase and the wine tax increaseif they happen to drink wine-and get no compensation whatsoever. The poor people who cannot afford to drive motor cats that use unleaded petrol get another 2c a litre slug. These taxes are designed to slug those on of lower incomes harder. Those on lower incomes will pay the same measure of tax increase as those on higher incomes. Somebody buying toiletries in the supermarket will pay the increased sales tax in exactly the same way as somebody earning 10 or 20 -"" times more. There is no proposal whatsoever in this budget to compensate those on lower incomes. This is an absolutely regressive budget. Back in 1981 those were the grounds for the then Labor opposiUon voting against sales tax increases. On that measure, this budget fails completely-strike two. The then shadow Treasurer also argued that he should be opposing the budget tax measures because they would be inflationary._1t is absolutely clear that the tax measures in this budget are inflationary. The budget forecasts themselves show that inflation will go up to 3.5 per cent from a base of about one per cent. If tax is put up on petrol-which feeds into the. economy at so many points-on wholesale sales taxes and everything else, the CPI, based on the basket. of goods, will rise. The fact is that this budget actually increases inflation. Increased petrol prices not only feed in at point, they feed in at every point. Not only are people paying more when they go to the petrol bowser but also the goods in the supermarkets cost more. The cost of bringing goods from the manufacturer to the holding or distribution centre and from the distribution centre to the retail centre is increased as a result of the increased petrol tax. I The people who win suffer the most as a result of these tax measures are those in outlying areas, such as country or regional centres, where the distances are longer. They are doubly penalised by these inflationary and regressive taxes. They are the people whom this government takes no account of at all. The people in rural and regional Australia are so far from the mind of this government that I do not believe it ever factors them into its thinking. I do not believe that the government ever thinks about the way these people have suffered from the rural downturn, from unemployment, from the government's high interest rate policies, and from the recession we had to have-brought to Australia by the former Treasurer, now the Prime Minister. This is yet another instance of those forgotten people of rural and regional Australia being attacked. They are doubly attacked by these measures. These tax measures are regressive, inflationary and do nothing for the equity of the tax system. But the reason why they should be opposed, and are being opposed, is even greater than that: it is the fact that the public was deceived at the last election about the government's intentions. This government won an election opposing any changes to the indirect tax system. The government said that changes to the indirect tax system would be a life-changing matter, that they would be the death of Australian buyers, mothers and housewives for about a decade. The government said that the world would fall in the day after the election if the coalition's proposed changes to the indirect system ever came about. The Prime Minister said that he was about cutting tax, that he had income tax cuts which were l-a-w. He said, 'It is not my intention to put up tax'. He then turned around in callous disregard of everything that had been said during that campaign and introduced these tax increases. If we want Australians to maintain faith in the political system on issues as big as indirect tax was during the election, we have to keep faith with the Australian people. They will only show faith in us if we keep faith with them. The fact is that the government did not keep faith with them. The only point about having elections is to give people a choice between plan A and plan B. If they vote for plan A and they get plan B anyway, what is the point of the election? If governments find that after an election they have a completely malleable mandate, that they are held to no promise, that they can assert a convention that even the oppositionelected to oppose them-cannot vote against budget proposals, then the Australian people will be disenfranchised, disillusioned and eventually displaced and dispossessed as a result of the electoral system. That is why the opposition has taken the view it has on these taxes. But rather than assert in hyperbolic, extravagant language that there is some great matter going on here, some great convention, the Prime Minister should concede that the great matter at issue here is the matter of mandates-Australian government mandates, his mandate, his prime ministership, his future, his commitment, his obligation to the Australian people. As I pointed out in relation to Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1993-94, we are not voting against appropriations and we are not stopping the supply of money to the government. The government will have a supply of money to continue with. We are saying that those unfair, unjust, regressive, inflationary taxes, which the Australian people were deceived about as little as six or seven months ago in a general election, are no good for the Australian economy and no good for the Australian people. That being our view, we have to vote against them. We will vote against them and we will see what the outcome of that will be in the Senate. In relation to parliamentary scrutiny, parliamentary appropriation and the funding of parliamentary departments, we spend $126 million to give the Australian people, through the parliament, the opportunity to scrutinise government. We will not be going slack on that. We will not be giving away that right. The Prime Minister might be giving it away, the Prime Minister· might have all sorts of beliefs about how he can restrict scrutiny and how he can mute the parliament and the parliamentary function but, at the end of the day, that parliament is a $126 million operation-just for the parliament itself. It is here for a purpose: to keep governments honestand we will ensure that it does. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.  time. LOAN BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the bill be now read a second time.",95
179,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEES,"Higgins) (4.41 p.m.)The Loan Bill 1993 is a standard machinery financing bill necessary to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund and to provide for certain Defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund, rather than the consolidated revenue fund. It is not legal for government expenditures to exceed the available funds within the consolidated revenue fund. As a result, successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill of this type to cover the shortfall in the consolidated revenue fund. The point needs to be made that the necessity for this bill arises in cases only where there is a deficit in the consolidated revenue fund. When that is in balance-as it was in 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90-the need for the loan bill does not arise. In those circumstances, there is an excess of funds rather than a shortage which is generally paid into a loans consolidation and investment reserve. Under those circumstances, Mr Deputy Speaker, the government actually behaves like you: it saves money and invests it rather than lending money in order to cover the shortfall. However, this is not the case this financial year. The loan bills provide for a loan fund of around $23 billion-which is principally made up of the expected budget deficit of over $16 billion and an additional $7 billion to cover required financing transactions and off-budget transactions. The bill provides the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) with the authority to keep topping it up to higher levels by further borrowing. The House needs to be aware that the charges that are made on this loan fund as a result of this bill represent a new high-water mark for borrowing by the government. A look back at the size of relative charges on the loan funds over the course of the past decade is revealing. In 1982-83, total charges made on loan funds by the loan acts amounted to $2.6 billion. The amount was $4.6 billion in 1985-86 and went to zero by 198990. In those years, there was no reason for borrowing through the loan fund because the Commonwealth account was running in surplus, as I said. However, from 1990-91 through to this budget the charges made on the loan fund have skyrocketed. In 1991-92, the total charges were $15.2 billion compared with $2.5 billion in the previous year. In 1992-93, it had gone to $22.3 billion and this year it is estimated to be $23 billion. The necessity for, and the sheer size of, this year's loan fund highlights the massive deterioration in the Commonwealth's position and illustrates the total ineptitude of the Labor government when it comes to economic management. Massive loan provisions go hand in hand with massive budget deficits. One needs only to look at the record of the Labor Party when it comes to fiscal policy. It used to boast about fiscal policy when it was actually running surpluses in the late 1980s. These surpluses were welcomed, they were good news. But there is no escaping the fact that since then there has been a reckless fiscal deterioration and that those modest surpluses that were returned then have been more than swept away in a current of deficit and debt. The great irony is that the Treasurer maintains that this budget is a deficit reducing strategy. I suppose every long journey begins with the first step, but there would be very few long journeys that begin with the first step going in the opposite direction-very few indeed. This government, with its budget deficit reduction strategy, is actually going to increase its deficit in this financial year. It believes the deficit is reduced by taking it from negative $14.5 billion this year to negative $16 billion next year. It is a bit like going from Sydney to Melbourne by taking a trip to Brisbane. The government will reduce the deficit by increasing it to start with. Over the next four years, the government has a plan to reduce the deficit, but in this financial it is actually going to increase it. The $16 billion deficit completes a trifecta of record deficits over the last three years. It caps off $40 billion of cumulative deficit over the past three years and a $57 billion fiscal deterioration in the budget position since 1989-90. Even if the government kept to its promise and got the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, there would be a minimum further $25 billion in deficits between now and then. The public ought to be absolutely clear about that. The government says, 'We have this you-beaut, gee-whiz budget reducing deficit strategy which is going to get the budget deficit down by 1996-97'. Even if the government meets that target, there will be further losses of $25 billion before we get there. We cannot say how large the future cumulative deficits will be because the government keeps changing its targets. This is a moving ta:rget that moves every time 'the government looks as if it is not going to meet it. In February of 1992, in the One Nation statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was saying that we would be in surplus by 1995-96. I am sure the Parliamentary Secre remembers that; he probably cheered when he heard it. Just prior to the election, we were going to have a deficit of between 0.5 and one per cent by 1995-96. Later on during the election campaign, it was going to be one per cent by 1996-97. When the budget came in, it was going to be 1.1 per cent by 1996-97. We remember the lynch mob that assembled t<;> do over the Prime Minister and the Treasurer over their budget. We remember how the caucus economics committee, which I think has about 10 members, was gatecrashed by about 60 backbenchers that night baying for blood and looking to be able to say to their own electorates, 'We didn't have any part of this unfair and unscrupulous taxation impost' . After that it became 1.2 per cent by 1996-97. The government has broken its deficit reduction target four times in 18 months. How many times will it break it in the 36 months to 1996-97? Most in the press have rightly year said that the government will again break its budget deficit reduction target. On current form, one would only have to say this is a horse that has form. If one were running dead, one would have to say that, in relation to budget deficit reduction targets, this government has a good track record. The fact is that Australians look only at the headline number in relation to budget deficit targets anyway. If we take out the snake oil and the smoke and the mirrors, the budget deficit of $16 billion that the government is talking about is probably closer to $23 billion. The government reaches the figure of $16 billion only by putting in the sale of capital assets, for which it says it will get $2.4 billion. That is another target that it never meets. It actually treats the sale of assets as recurrent revenue, which no reputable company would do. No reputable company would be allowed to say, 'We sold off our office block and therefore our operating profit in this particular year was such and such.' A company would have to account for the sale of capital assets on its balance sheet. It would have to show at the beginning, and at the end of the year, the assets that it had. If it had one less asset than the funds at hand, that would represent the sum which it had received. The government takes that sale into account and puts it into revenue as a negative outlay. It includes that amount in relation to its budget deficit reduction target. It also brings into account the Reserve Bank's profits. The Reserve Bank actually makes money by buying and selling the Australian dollar. It brings $3.2 billion into account as a result and puts that figure into the bottom line. It also brings in government business enterprises that pay dividends and puts that into the bottom line. The other day we saw the scope and extent of the way in which this government will mug government business enterprises to get taxation revenue. Mugging a government business enterprise is the best way of getting tax. The enterprise is told that it has to pay money to the government. The enterprise then has to go out and find that money. Telecom, for example, is told to pay the government money; Telecom finds it by putting up phone charges or in other ways. This is a way in which the government can raise money without increasing taxes. A total of $850 million is supposed to come into the budget in that way. When one takes out the $850 million, the $3.2 billion and the $2.4 billion, the private sector says, and probably quite rightly, that the Commonwealth budget deficit is nearer to the $23 billion mark. It is about five per cent of our gross domestic product; a level that is only rivalled by the disastrous Whitlam experiment. These protracted high budget deficits come at a price. Principally, they run down national savings and they expose Australia to the whims of international financiers. Just over three months ago, the government received a report on Australia's parlous national savings. That report was known as the FitzGerald report. The report made it quite clear that the country was heading in the wrong direction in relation to savings. It warned that our savings position would not improve until the government began to save better. The report said: We cannot, on a sustainable basis, continue to finance the investment we' need to grow over the 1990s, and into the new century, by going progrespluses sively further into foreign debt. Just last week, the failure of the government on the national savings was again illustrated by the release of the ANZ Bank savings report for the June quarter. It recorded the largest fall in the stock of national savings since the series began. It once again highlighted the fact made clear by Dr FitzGerald that the savings shortage represents a serious threat to Australian economy. Bills such as this Loan Bill represent a call on savings. If the government was running a surplus, if it was building up savings, it would not be borrowing moneys. There would not be a loan bill. We have a loan bill which shows that the government itself is not funding its own operations and, worse, it is borrowing to keep going. The government is running down savings-savings which have been identified by Dr Vince FitzGerald as absolutely essential for economic recovery in the 1990s. The Commonwealth is sapping savings resources, reducing the stock of savings in Australia and contributing to debt. That debt is not just domestic but foreign as well. Our chronic current account deficit problem, on a monthly basis, feeds into ever burgeoning levels of foreign debt. The budget forecasts a further $18 billion of current account deficits this financial year. Foreign debt currently stands at $172 billion in net terms. By the time of the next budget, Australia will have made no progress. The ANZ's savings reports show that our savings dive is being led by the public sector and the government of Australia. The recent report stated that the record fall of 1.2 per cent of GDP in the stock of savings in the last quarter was the result of a 4.6 per cent plunge in public sector savings compared with an increase of 3.4 per cent by the private sector. In other words, national savings ran down. Why? Because the government ran them down by 4.6 per cent, and the private sector could only pull them back by 3.4 per cent. The government and the public sector are the chief villains responsible for running down Australia's savings. When the necessity for those loan bills did not arise in the late 1980s, when the Commonwealth was running surand actually contributing to the loans and consolidation investment reserve, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were swanning around as great saviours, great heroeswonderfully successful. They were touting this as a great success. Those who take the success when they run surpluses are those who ought to be taking the blame when they run deficits. They made a number of bold statements then regarding the necessity for a national savings strategy. As early as May 1987 the current Prime Minister said that the prospect of a budget surplus that year meant that Australians were 'on the verge of freeing ourselves and our young people from the dictates of international financial markets'. Where are we now? We are $172 billion in debt-more subject to the dictates of the international financial markets than ever. Three years ago, in another heady election climate, the Prime Minister said: In three years' time there will be no government debt, domestic or external. It's an enonnous claim that I can make on behalf of the Government of Australia. It was an enonnous claim-absolutely, enormously false. Three years ago he predicted that by now there would be no government debt-domestic or external. These budget figures show that by the end of this budget the government debt will be $85 billion. Do you know how far he was out in his prediction? He was $85 billion out. He was predicting that there would with no debt. The budget says that, by the end of this - financial year, it will be around $85 billion-$5,OOO for every man, woman and child in the Commonwealth of Australia. If we take a family of mum, dad and two kids, their share of government debt is around $20,000. This claim came from a man who predicted three years ago that there would be no debt. That is the level of Commonwealth Government debt; that is what the government owes. It owes nearly $5,000 for every person in this country. Do not think this debt goes away; it does not magically evaporate. That debt has to be serviced. One of the largest expenditure items that we are starting to pay as part of our budget is the interest cost on public debt. I think in the budget the major areas that we spend money on are health, social security, defence and education. After that, the next major item on the list is servicing past debt. As the debt goes higher, the cost of servicing it goes up as well. People ought to remember that every dollar in the future that we have to pay off to service the debts that we are running up today is a dollar less that we will have for health, education, defence and social security. So the taxes of future Australians, which might ordinarily go towards their education, social security, defence and health, will have a charge included in them-a retrospective sucking out-to pay for debts that have been run up now. Their choices will be much fewer, because they will see a good part of their taxation income going off to pay the debts of today. Down the track, when we look at how governments will try to put together budgets in the future, they will have far less choices because of the way in which the interest on past debt runs up more debt. The Commonwealth's Loan Bill is necessary in order to keep the services of government running. As I said earlier in this debate in relation to the appropriation bills, we are not about blocking the supply of money out of consolidated revenue to the government to continue carrying on government, nor are we about blocking the raising of funds through the Loan Bill in order to keep those annual services going. We deeply regret the way in which this government has plundered the savings of Australia and has run up foreign and Commonwealth debt. It has put a charge on taxation revenue, which will be there for years to come, to pay for past debts. It is a charge which will lessen the choices and the ability of future Australians to look after the management of and provide for the services that they will need no less than us. But they will find it much harder because of what this government has done in this current period of financial management.",101
180,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"In addressing the Loan Bill, I want to endorse very much the comments of the last speaker, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). As I sat here thinking about the enonnity of the problems facing us in Australia, I was astounded at the nature of the second reading speech given by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) on this piece of legislation. He had the audacity to come into this House and say that this bill is a machinery financing measure. In his speech of a little under a page, he went on to outline the fact that this bill was to authorise the raising of moneys in the name of Australia to fund a deficit of $16 billion for 1993-94 and also to fund a prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund of about $7 billion higher. Most Australians, as they think about debt, worry about the enonnity of the debt obligations as a whole facing Australia at the moment. Towards the end of August, when the figures came out for July, I noticed that Australia's net foreign debt had risen to $172 billion. When that amount is extrapolated for all Australians, it gives rise to an obligation of $10,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. Over time, the government has wanted to tell us that this is not a significant problem and that it is not something we need to worry about in the longer term. International lenders are usually pretty small investors, as are those in Australia, who save for their own future in retirement funds. They have set aside their small savings and lend through international banks and other financhil institutions to Australia, Australian states, companies and financial institutions. These investors are lending to Australia. Even though some people suggest that when a company such as Mr Bond's company or Mr Skase's company goes broke we are under no obligation and that that will suddenly be written off, it is a fact that behind each of those obligations stands generally a bank and that behind each of those organisations stands the Reserve Bank of Australia when it lends through the Australian banking system. We cannot simply wish away these debts; they are a substantial and a growing obligation. Today our foreign debt now equals 42.9 per cent of our gross domestic product. That means that most Australians will have to find a substantial amount each year to repay the debt. On an annualised basis, when the debt reaches 42.9 per cent of the gross domestic product of Australia, the capacity to make those repayments on a regular basis is severely. jeopardised. The point has often been stressed that when a country's debt reaches about 45 per cent of GDP it is seen internationally as being vulnerable in its ability to be able to meet its obligations. Australia is a matter of only some three per cent or so from being in that position. I have often likened Australia's situation to that of individuals who are unable to pay the mortgage debt on their houses. When their mortgages are related to the size of their yearly income and they are not in a position from their incomes to service the interest obligation, somebody is put into manage their affairs and they end up being bankrupted. In relation to a nation, bankruptcy in that sense is not known, but something else is: the international community can assume the responsibility for giving advice and directions in relation to the management of a country's affairs. Mr Costello-They are the international receivers.",104
181,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"They are the international receivers, in effect, as the shadow minister says. But the government has emphasised over time that this was not really a Commonwealth problem. It was not debt incurred by the Commonwealth but by the private sector, by state institutions and by instrumentalities. The point that was made very clearly by the honourable member for Higgins is that we are now back at the point where Australia is pledging its credit-the Commonwealth is assuming obligations. The difficulty is that those obligations that were stated in the budget, and the authorisation that is to be given by this Loan Bill, do not fully state the extent of the problems facing Australia. I draw the attention of honourable members to the Auditor-General's report No. 34 of 1992-93 entitled The national bankcard: who will pay the piper? I think this report is one of the most alarming documents that has been tabled in this parliament. It is not like some of those other documents that we occasionally see from the Reserve Bank of Treasury which, while not being misleading, tend to try to gild the lily to make the government not look so bad. The Auditor-General-perhaps this is the reason he is being attacked as to the resources for him to carry out his own task in the recent budget documents-had the audacity to draw to our attention that the outstanding obligations that the Commonwealth has, not its debts, could exceed $125 billion. He went on-and I think it is very important-to say: These obligations include Federal Government borrowings with a market value of $50 billion. The face value of this debt equates to 11.8% of GDP, a figure which compares favourably with a ... ten year average ... The recent deterioration in the budget deficitwill. . . put pressure on future debt levels. He then said: Funding decisions taken by the Government lack the benefit of the information that would normally be available in any well run company which manages the level and impact of its obligations on future cash flows, costs and investment decisions so as to protect its future viability and maximise return to its shareholders. He was saying that the Commonwealth government, in dealing only with its debt obligations and not the totality of its obligations, was understating the situation. The government's analysis suggested that the debt level was in a favourable situation by comparison with previous debt levels. However, as the Auditor-General observed, if one included in that analysis other outstanding obligations, the situation would appear to be very different. The Auditor-General continued: In this respect, current accountability to the ment and the taxpayer is deficient, as: available data is not easily accessible and fails to highlight relevant benchmarks no federal agency has a responsibility to accumulate, monitor, manage or report on the total obligations of the Federal Government budget papers provide only a short term view on the impact of funding decisions, and practices adopted in the financial reporting of obligations, including superannuation, are cantly below the standards adopted in the private sector. He then went on to say: More accessible and better information is needed if Australia's medium to long term interests are to be protected. Those are very important points. It concerns me, as a member of this parliament, that my country's credit is being given when the full extent of its obligations are unknown to me. They should be fully explained to the Australian people by the government on a regular basis. I want to highlight a number of other points made by the Auditor-General because it is important for people to understand that there is a substantial deficiency when it comes to meeting the obligations that he has identified. The Auditor-General said: ... the Commonwealth has available liquid assets totalling $57 billion, leaving $70 billion to be met from future government receipts or realisation of non-liquid assets. He said further: The Commonwealth's power to tax should ensure that the Commonwealth remains solvent at all times. its The Auditor-General was there pointing out that the Commonwealth is not using its taxation powers to meet fully its outstanding obligations. What is the nature of those outstanding obligations? In his report, the Auditor-General points out that there is a commitment for future superannuation benefit payments against which moneys have not been set aside. That is the most substantial part of that additional $125 billion that the Auditor-General has identified. It is a measure of the economic problems we are facing that we have a loans bill as part of the overall budget strategy. Yet the governParliament is increasing the debt of the Australian people. The deficit is not being reduced either by expenditure reduction or increased taxation. In fact, the only taxation increases proposed in the. budget are those which are necessary in order to pay for the tax reductions promised by the government before the last election. Those tax reductions were clearly only signifipromised by way of matching the opposition's promised tax reductions. Our tax reductions were fully funded by promised expenditure reduction and alternative taxation proposals in the form of the goods and services tax. However, the government deliberately set out to deceive the Australian public into believing that tax cuts that were legislated for in the last parliament would not have to be paid for. We were told by the government that the recession was over. We were told by the government that there would be growth in the Australian economy and that the budget would miraculously cure itself. We now know that there was no magic pudding. The government has had to introduce new tax measures to ensure that the tax reductions-the personal income tax reductions that it had promisedcould be funded this year. Even with those taxation reductions, the government had to make changes to the way in which they were to be introduced. It brought forward, at a cost, the benefits of some, while it postponed over a longer period the more substantial decreases that were to occur in later years. In present day dollar terms, those changes effected a $6 billion reduction to the amount of the promised tax cuts anyway. Nevertheless, the government was prepared to propose new tax increases in the form of sales tax and fuel excise, and through retrospective taxation of accrued leave entitlements .. Each of those measures represents significant new charges which were not detailed to the Australian people. As Trevor Sykes in the Bulletin described it, the government played the pea and thimble trick and the Australian people were clearly deceived. As a result of these measures, the government has postponed any responsible economic decisions that it might otherwise have taken. Instead of endeavouring to reduce future debt obligations, the government has had to maintain a strategy whereby it brings forward bi11s that suggest that it has some intention of reducing the deficit. As the bill we are presently discussing clearly shows, this particular budget is running at a substantial deficit-a substantial shortfall, in fact, of $16 billion year-notwithstanding all the new tax increases. It is obvious that the government put those in place in order to meet the tax reductions that were legislated for last year, before the election. In any other situation, the parties involved in such a conspiracy to deceive would be severely dealt with by our consumer affairs bodies. Conspiracies to deliberately deceive would be met with the full rigour of the law. However, because it is being done in a political environment, that behaviour seems to be acceptable. In fact, some people think it is smart to legislate for tax reductions before an election. The government encouraged people to vote on that basis. Now that the .election has passed, it is free to indulge in this sleight of hand, announcing an increase in the deficit and the proposed new taxes. Is it any wonder that in recent weeks we have seen the international community judging Australia so harshly? Is it any wonder that in relation to our currency we have seen such fluctuations? Is it any wonder that in relation to the value of our currency there has been significant depreciation? All of that has happened at a time when the most vulnerable people in our community are suffering. I would like to draw the attention of the House to what has been said in some of the papers that I have been reading recently about the situation facing those who are unemployed. At the end of the day, when decisions like this have been take,n, somebody has to pay. The people who have been paying most frequently are those who are left to survive on our welfare system. The problem is that a large pool of people are becoming unemployed. The numbers of people defined as 'long-term unemployed' are increasing; those defined as 'very long-term unemployed', those unemployed for two years or more, are continuing to grow. The statistics suggest that the numbers of very long-term unemployed grew from 34,000 people in April 1980 to 176,000 people in April 1993a fivefold increase. These are the people who, in the longer term, even when the economy starts to recover, will not have the opportunity of getting into employment again. They this will-proverbially-be left on the scrap heap, because of decisions such as this and decisions of the sort we see reflected in this Loan Bill. (TIme expired)",105
182,Mr WAKELIN,COMMITTEES,"Grey) (5.20. p .. m.rHaving listened to the previous speakers, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), I am even more alarmed than I was before the debate began. When we consider the $23 billion shortfall, the charges that go with it and the damage to our economy, we can begin to understand why Australia has some of its economic problems. No matter how much we like to talk in this place, we cannot escape the fundamental facts. The honourable member for Higgins pointed out the record of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); he has got it wrong four times in 18 montb$. I could not help but think about the Prime Minister's answer in question time when he referred to the wonderful increase in the share market. I think the figure was $85 billion-I have yet to verify it. I note that the honourable member for Higgins said the Prime Minister was out by $85 billion when he said four or five years ago that there would be zero government debt. Perhaps that in itself is enough of a statement; wrong four times in 18 months on the deficit percentage and an $85 billion debt over the last four or five years when he said we would have zero government debt. One of the very high costs to our budget the interest we pay on our debt. Repayments are just keeping us going. We are not making any progress. I can remember big headlines a daily paper four or five years ago, before was interested in politics- '$100 billion This was the mid-1980s. It seemed to creep up to $170 billion or $200 billion. it stop-at $350 billion? Who is going to stop it? Certainly not the government. The honourable member for Berowra shows touched on the percentage of GOP-the per cent, or whatever it might be. The matter of the IMF, which has been raised for a number of years, cannot be dismissed. But this is just a simple distraction to the reality of this debt-and what the $23 billion about. We have had discussions about the republic and increased taxation. Since my time in parliament there has been discussion about this darned budget that people refuse get organised. There is also the industrial relations package-but it is all peripheral stuff. The fundamental reality is that we are spending more than we are earning or creatanswer ing. One of the ultimate ironies is that the government can just go out into the market and raise money. It has this wonderful power to go back and tax the people. Apparently this government believes it can do this with impunity. It has great disregard which dares to question the government's decisions. In this debate we have heard about savings. Some years ago we would have thought ourselves comparable with some of our about neighbours. But let us look at the performance of places such as Singapore over a number of decades. When will we hold our heads up and say-forgetting party politics- 'Enough is enough'? When will we say, 'We cannot keep surviving on debt'? When will we listen to people such as Dr FitzGerald, who was appointed by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to explain to us where we were at with our savings? There is absolutely no evidence in this budget that the government has done so. As the honourable member for Higgins said, it is pretty interesting when we were going to is take a big step forward and end up taking a bigger one backwards-the deficit for the year was a couple of billion dollars higher than the in projection. There seems to be a casual disreI gard for our national sovereignty. This casual debt'. approach seems to be that we can keep burdening a productive sector-and it will Where will keep producing. We seem to think that this will not have an impact on interest rates, margins, tax rates or our international competitiveness. History that, throughout the centuries, those 49 who would govern well did so without overreliance on debt. Only those governments with integrity and honesty, those who underall stood that we cannot spend more than we earn, have passed on their countries in better is all shape than they inherited them. How will our children judge us? Will they judge us as a parliament that allowed this to debt to overcome us or as a community which had the guts to face up to what we need to do? Having a $23 billion shortfall, grandstanding on budgets and complaining and whingeing about Senates are not the answers. I come back again to the Prime Minister's at question time and the $85 billion. I still find it difficult to believe that there is an $85 billion improvement in the capitalisation of the share market, the same amount that the Prime Minister was deficient in when he said that few short years ago that there for the Senate, would be no debt. I come to this place aware of these issues, but I am also acutely aware that the government is not offering any real solution. The sooner we get away from stupidly talking the deficit reduction when the deficit is going up, the sooner we stop grandstanding on this nonsensical approach to politics, the better chance this country has of going ahead.",107
183,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"O'Connor) (5.29 p.m.)One of the most amazing situations relating to this Loan Bill concerns the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). He told us that this is a machinery measure which is just going to borrow about $23 billion. It is an issue that has concerned me greatly, particularly when daily we have the government telling us about its responsibilities to reduce the budget deficit. The budget deficit is a matter of extreme concern, and of extreme concern to this side of politics. To demonstrate that we did not believe in such a policy-which I referred to throughout'the last election campaign as being one of 'let the children pay'-we went to the electorate with a plan which could balance revenue measures without putting such massive debt upon future generations of Australians. We have to look at the present levels of indebtedness, as shown in the budget, in the light of the sort of indebtedness that Australia anticipates it will incur with the rest of the world. There is no argument that during the 1980s it was business that generally borrowed the money. As a result of that practice, the government became the beneficiary of that debt by way of taxes. It might sound funny to say that people were getting into debt and the government got taxes, but it did because business was using borrowed money to ramp up the values of all sorts of assets throughout the community-shares, property, et cetera. Even our deluded wool growers-whom we will try to deal with again this afternoonthrough the organisation representing them internationally, the Wool Corporation, kept borrowing money to pay themselves inflated values for wool that the international markets . would not pay, and then paid taxes on the proceeds. We had the same situation with all the entrepreneurs ramping up the value of shares and property, and some of those entrepreneurs are reappearing. Our major institutions, such as the AMP and other insurance companies, were in on it too. But they were not producing any more. They were not putting any productive value into Australia. They went through a period of massive economic growth, which the world is paying for, which had no value to the community in terms of jobs or genuine development. During that period this government strutted around telling us about its surpluses. But has been one consistent factor in the government's performance, be it in delivering budget deficits or surpluses-generally, it has never got it right. It has come along to this parliament and predicted that its budget deficit or surplus would be a certain figure, and the figure has generally been considerably at variance with those predictions. It received a big surprise when it got a lot of money one year, I think it was in 1989-90. It had a budget surplus of about $8 billion generated not through the sorts of developments that this country needs, but through speCUlated profits. Then all of a sudden, from my recollection, for the year 1991-92 the government told us that it thought it could get by with a budget deficit of about $4 billion-which was bad enough but, as the figures in front of me display, it actually had a deficit of $9,339 million. That was the figure produced after the usual types of creative accounting where the government brings into account Reserve Bank profits and all of these things. The Reserve Bank makes massive profits every time the Australian economy is in trouble. It is probably an indicator that we sh.ould runthe Reserve Bank profit indicator-as evidence of how badly the country is going. When the bank goes out to defend our dollar and so on-and in the process sell good hard currency securities-it shows a profit in Australian dollars. But it is really a reverse index, and it is one that business should take into account. In other words, Reserve Bank profits are not good news for Australia. In the following year I think it was predicted that we might get by with about a $9 billion budget deficit. But the figures show us that the budget deficit rose to $14,571 million. At one stage it looked like being about $16 billion. We now have the government telling us that it can get by with $16 billion-to be correct, $16.008 billion.. The simple fact is that this is a disaster. We have the government moralising about the problem here, but offering only one solution. That solution is more taxes. In other words, it is too bad if the Aust-"" lian people have their own plans for investment; investments there that they could make that would produce something for the country. Our international indebtedness has grown dramatically under this government. When the Labor Party achieved office, Australia's international debt was of the order of $36 billion. That is what we owed all the world. Our international debt is now about $209 billion, an increase of 480 per cent. A lot of that debt was contracted by the private sector in the 1980s. In the 1990s, that debt is all the result of government borrowing, be it state or federal. It is significant that these budget papers show us that the current account deficit, the increase in Australia's foreign debt, is anticipated to be about $18 billion. We are now debating a bill that suggests the federal government will borrow $16 billion. Were I to have the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister e Mr Keating) sitting opposite me now, they would tell me that the Commonwealth is not borrowing any money overseas. That is primarily true. They have first crack at the Australian financial markets; they get their money here and send everybody else offshore to borrow it and lend it back to them. It is another example of the· silly, juvenile sort of logic that is trotted out in place day after day. Unfortunately, this logic is bought by the media people who make up our press gallery-and I hope some of them are listening. I know that journalists are not generally renowned for their arithmetic skills-they have been trained in another area-but the simple fact is that most of them, I hope, would be able to work out that two plus two equals four, not six. It is totally foolish to suggest that when the government borrows money within Australia it does not have an effect upon our international indebtedness. As I said, there is $16 billion of government borrowing and $18 billion of Australian foreign debt. These figures are almost comparable. One of the issues that concern me is that this government repeats, notwithstanding its rhetoric, that it will get this figure down to one per cent of GDP in four or five yearsprovided that it can tax the Australian people to pay for it! There is no question of improving the economy or of cutting government expenditure because the nation cannot afford it, and it is downright outrageous to dump our living standards on our kids. That is what we are on about with these sorts of deficits. We say, 'What about Asia?'. It became a bit of a joke in this place because government members would jump up and say, 'Asia does not have the same sorts of social security arrangements that we have; how can you compare us?'. It is an interesting point. But Asian countries have a few social arrangements that make some of thos.e social security payments unnecessary. For instance, it is the responsibility of young people to look after the elderly. They take it as a family commitment, and maybe there is some sense in that. It is probably too late for Australia. Our social security arrangements consume nearly 40 per cent of this budget. Certainly they consume over 30 per cent. I am often at pains to point out to people that this building, with all its beautiful facilities, represents two weeks spending by the Department of Social Security. I do not want people to interpret too much out of that statement, but the simple fact is that under this government the solution this to political popularity is to borrow some money-to let the children pay. They do not get a vote yet; the government does not have to worry too much about them. It is outrageous for a government to try to justify its electoral popularity and concerns for certain sectors of the community when its only solution to problems is to borrow money or put more taxes on those who are trying to produce. It is even worse when those taxes are applied in the way they have been. If a government really wants to kill the Australian economy, it taxes transport. We are a country of huge distances. Our resources are not all stacked up in one nice little comer where we can go in with a train line and cart them all out. They are spread across the nation. It seems that the more remote the area, the richer the possibility for resources. In that situation, why would a government increase the taxes on transport? It is an interesting subject in tenns of the Senate debate, and the position of the Greens, in particular. Why would the government put taxes on the most environmentally friendly fuel, namely distillate-diesel, as we often call it-and the diesel engine, when in Europe, in recognition of its environmental friendliness, and irrespective of the prices the taxes, distillate sells for about half the price of other fuels such as petrol? Furthermore, Europe works on the principle of making the most environmentally friendly fuel the cheapest, not trying to make the least environmentally friendly fuel the dearest by adding further tax. There is a lot of sense in it. . It still comes back to who is going to pay for this debt. I would not mind the moralising we are getting from the Treasurer and the increasing Prime Minister about the imminently sensible approach of reducing the deficit, recognising that it is dangerous for the country-it outrageous that future generations have to pay it back-if we had had this moralising prior· to the election. The government put a proposistages tion to Australia that it could balance budget without all these deficits, manage the expenditure and give people a good standard of living with no extra taxes. That is what it told Australia at the election. Now it is blaming us for wanting to hold into promise. Of course, the government's clear indication was something of which I totally approve-that it was going to achieve all this through economic growth. We would just like the government to get back to economic agreed to. growth, not a debt funded recovery. Anybody who conducts a business would tell us that any debt incurred that is not invested in income producing assets sends the business broke. I do not care whether it is a family }judget where a credit card loan is taken out to buy unnecessary gifts or items which are not connected with the family's survival. People in that situation can take a personal loan for $20,000 and look to be the richest people in the street, but they know the consequences. Any business that borrows money to finance an overseas holiday knows the consequences. But today the government is adding another $23,000 million to the indebtedness of Ausfunding tralians-I have read to the parliament recently the sorts of problems we are having with national savings; they are at their lowest level in history-and is saying, 'We will borrow some more, but we have a solution: .join we will increase taxes. For instance, we will and increase the taxes that small business has to pay, even when it is going broke. We will not increase personal taxes; we will not increase company taxes-in fact, we have reduced company taxes to help the big guys out. We will increase the taxes that go into costs and which are simply taxes people pay even when they are going broke'. I could not imagine a worse situation than that. Yet that is what this budget is about: it is about $23 billion worth of debt and about taxes in the areas that will hurt the most. People from the Road Transport Forum tell us that it will increase the cost of a is typical grocery basket by $3 a week.",108

186,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEES,"Higgins) (5.46 p.m.)The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is a traditional machinery bill which implements the decisions made at Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings with regard to the of the states for general purposes. I just foreshadow that in the Committee of the Whole the opposition will seek to delete clause 20 of the bill. On the basis that this will give the government the opportunity to us and excise that part of the bill, we will not vote against the second reading. However, should clause 20 be retained in the bill, the opposition will oppose the remaining stages of the hill. We so thoroughly oppose clause 20 of this bill that we will oppose the bill as a whole if the government refuses to excise clause 20 from it. This is the final year of the agreement reached at the 1990 Premiers Conference to guarantee in real terms the amount of financial assistance to the states. What is likely to happen in relation to financial assistance to the states in the future? The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) gave some insight into his thinking on that in an address in Brisbane on 24 June this year. In that speech he said: I believe that the States and Territories as have considerable capacity to reduce the growth in government expenditure. When it comes to implementing government expenditure savings, the states are an easy target. It would be one thing if the Commonwealth were leading by example, but it is not. The Commonwealth parades virtue, but it practises vice. It says to the states, 'You, the states, bear the burden; we, the Commonwealth, will go on spending'. In the same speech on 24 June the Treasurer called upon the states to face up to political and fiscal realities just like the Commonwealth had done. It was a statement that would have done the artful dodger proud'just like the Commonwealth had done'. The fact is that the Commonwealth has not shown the same amount of financial stringency in relation to its own purpose outlays as it has forced upon the states. We might well believe from the Treasurer's statement that he was leading by example, but the bottom line is that this Treasurer, even in this year alone, proposes to increase Commonwealth expenditure. Even this year the Treasurer proposes to increase the government's deficit. Despite all the sermonising and hectoring in relation to the states, he proposes to actually increase the government's deficit in the forthcoming year. At the end of June the Treasurer produced some charts to try to substantiate his ridiculous claims and to attempt to prove the impossible-that the government had a track record of fiscal discipline and would play its part in raising public sector saving. The Treasurer's press release of 27 June, which attempted the impossible, contained no data, omitted important social security and welfare expenditure and could be described as an elaborate statistical con. When we take away the smoke and the mirrors and look at the real figures, there is no hiding the fact that the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays-the spending of the Commonwealth on its own services-has grown, while at the same time the govenunent has been reducing assistance to other levels of government, particularly the state governments. Using the Treasurer's own definition of a whole own purpose outlays, which he defined as total government outlays less grants to other levels of government, I put the Treasurer's claims to the test. In the last year of the Fraser government the percentage of Commonwealth own purpose outlays to GOP was 18.9 per cent. In the first year of the Labor government it rose to 19.4 per cent. Using the government's own estimates in relation to GOP, by the end of this financial year it will have grown to 20 per cent. In relation to its own spending, the Commonwealth government has increased it as a proportion of the economy. On the other hand, outlays given in grants to other levels of government, particularly general purpose assistance grants and specific purpose payments to the states, have been slashed. They have been slashed from 9.6 per cent of GOP in 1983-84 to 7.3 per' cent this financial year. These figures make a mockery of the Treasurer's claim to fiscal discipline. He whips the states but indulges himself. In relation to the states, there is a touch of the sadist; but in relation to himself, there is not a touch of the masochist. The Treasurer's spending cuts are all done at the expense of somebody else. I wish to dwell on the most insidious provision in this bill: clause 20. Clause 20 seeks to enforce compulsory student unionism and infringe the rights of students to choose whether or not they wish to join a student union. It seeks to do this by financially penalising those states which allow students the - pen and honest choice of whether or not they wish to join a student union. Across this country students are compelled to pay considerable moneys each year to student unions in order to get an education. It is a classic no ticket, no start. If a person wants to start studying engineering, science or medicine-whatever it is-before that person can actually get a start in the educational process at a tertiary institution he or she is required to pay for a student union ticket. Clause 20 of this bill provides the mechanism to enforce that practice. The education minister is able to impose a financial penalty upon those states which institute or allow free choice or voluntary unionism. It works like this: if a state allows students to choose whether or not to join a union, like responsible adults, and they choose not to join a union, the government will nonetheless make up all the fees that the union has lost. It is going to pay those fees across to the educational institutions. It then says that if it pays any of those across to educational institutions it will deduct that amount from general purpose grants to the states. So the states will have less money to spend on hospitals, schools and roads. Why? Because this government has paid money across to - tudent unions where potential members have actually been given the choice and chosen not to enrol. Three outcomes arise because of this clause. In the first place, it is designed to force compulsory unionism. In the second place, it proposes taking money from the states for schools, hospitals, roads and all those other essential services, and paying it to student unions. The absolute first charge of this government, when it comes to funding the states, is going to be student unions. That is the government's priority. In the third place, it effects a direct transfer of taxpayers' funds to institutions and political organisations that this government finds convenient allies in elections. As I said before, the effect of this bill is that the first charge on Commonwealth government grants to the states is going to be payments to student unions because if any student union has voluntary membership and people choose not to join it, the Commonwealth pays to the states and deducts from the general purpose grants. At a time when 100,000 people cannot get into hospitals, when students cannot get into tertiary institutions and when we have accidents on our roads, the first· priority of this government in relation to grants to the states is student unions. That is the government's first priority. That becomes the first charge on general purpose grants in relation to those states that allow freedom of choice. Those of us on this side of the House, who actually believe in individual rights and individual freedoms, will never ever support the government's proposals to enforce compulsory association. One of the great human rights, along with rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion, is freedom of association. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) ought to know that by sitting there and supporting a government that is proposing this piece of legislation, he is fees infringing one of the great human rights of students in this country. Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says this: Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceable assembly and association. No-one may be compelled to belong to an association. Mr Rocher-We are a party to that; we have ratified it.",111
187,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEES,"There is lots of talk about human rights. But let me make this observation: whenever a fundamental human right comes into conflict with Labor Party policy that human right goes down the drain. There is a lot of talk about human rights. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was standing here before talking about human rights. Good on him; he should be concerned about human rights. But what about the rights of students to that basic universal, fundamental human right: article 20 of the declaration which says, 'No-one may be compelled to belong to an association. '? According to this government, that should read, 'No-one, except. for students, who should be forced to support organisations that are sympathetic to the Labor Party, should be compelled to belong to an association' . Perhaps there could be a clause 3, which could read, 'And if they are given that right, then states should be penalised and money should be taken out of hospitals, schools, roads and everywhere else to make good the income'. Because that is the effect of clause 20 of this bill .. This is an unashamed breach of the principle of freedom of association. It demonstrates the Labor Party's willingness to trample over individual freedom to prop up sympathetic political causes. Regrettably, this is not the first time that government has .tried it. The government tried exactly the same thing in the 1990 act. On that occasion, the Assistant Treasurer and now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) justified the measure on the basis of protecting the rights of higher education institutions. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, a former national shop steward, obviously never considered the rights of those enrolled in those institutions. They have rights too-even students have rights. One of the basic rights they ought to have and which the government is taking away is the right to choose whether or not they will associate. The right of the individual to choose for himself or herself is basic to human dignity. It is no less basic to human dignity in a case where the Labor Party wants to prop up sympathetic political organisations than in any other case. It is a fundamental, universal right, and we on our side of the House will always stand here and defend it. The rhetoric about maintaining the autonomy and independence of higher education institutions is absolutely rich coming from the government. This government, under the Treasurer, in his former incarnation as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, has been the most intrusive and destructive ever for higher education in the country. The Treasurer was responsible for the greatest centralisation of power ever in tertiary education. Yet, once again, the government sends in the affable but bumbling Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) to read out the same tired old lines written for him by the minister's office to tell us why it is necessary to force all students into student associations and why it is necessary, if they choose not to join, to prop up their income in the name of university autonomy. The fact is that the government tried this in 1990, it is trying it now, but it did not try it in· 1991-92. What has changed? Why has it come back all of a sudden? What is the intervening political event that has made all of this possible just now? It is the fact that a government, which was democratically elected in Western Australia, has decided, in accordance with the principles that it holds dear, that the it is going to give freedom of choice in tertiary institutions. That is what has happened. Because it is going to give freedom of choice in relation to tertiary institutions, Labor says, 'No; you can't do that in Western Australia. We cannot give Western Australian students the right to choose whether or not they join'. The most obscene feature of this clause is that the people who will receive the biggest financial rewards are those who are the least popular. The less popular a body gets-the fewer members it gets-the bigger subsidy it will get out of the Commonwealth government. That is the way in which the government works it. The fewer students who actually join, the bigger the grant from the federal minister. So the student unions which end up being the least representative will be the most rewarded financially. They will be rewarded with Commonwealth taxpayers' funds. This measure will isolate and marginalise student unions even more. There is now no market discipline. There is no need to attract members any more because there is a guaranteed source of income, courtesy of the federal taxpayer, through the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. These bodies do not actually have to go out there and be responsible to their membersthey do not have to appeal to: them with a service by saying, 'We are giving you value for money'. They do not have to get the students to join because the· government has a guaranteed source of income from the Australian taxpayer plugged right into the vein of the student unions-like one of those direct drips. The drippier the stud-nt unions get, the bigger the volume of the flow. The lJigger the volume of the flow will mean the less the states have for their general revenue purposes for hospitals, educational institutions and so on. This is absolute madness. In his moving speech in support of this bill, the Assistant Treasurer talked about the wide range of services and amenities provided by student unions. So 1 thought 1 might outline to the House some of those wide range of services and amenities that they provide that justifies this direct link from the taxpayer into the vein of funding. In 1992 the Melbourne University Student Union provided legal funding of around $1,000 for the so-called Austudy five who were arrested during a violent demonstration outside the New South Wales parliament. We could not have students going off to demonstrate in New South Wales on their own money. The student union also paid $500 to reimburse those who had participated in the Sydney protest for their expenses, and $200 to reimburse petrol costs associated with the Sydney excursion. When the more violent and extremist students start demonstrating against this Labor government over HECS and an of the changes in relation to educational funding-think about this-the government may well be funding their demonstrations. The absolutely obnoxious effect of the .bill is that poor taxpayers, employees in factories and shops all around Australia will pay to prop that up. In 1992 the student representative council of RMIT spent $1,000 on SRC lunches and $200 on gift vouchers for the SRC executive, as well as forking out $250 in library and parking fines for its women's officer. Doesn't it make the taxpayer glad that we have to prop up these institutions so that they can pay their officers' parking fines? The government puts it in the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. At the top end of the country, the student union of the Northern Territory University lost $44,000 on a Bob Geldof concert. We could not have that occurring, could we? We had better prop up its income. We had better make sure it has a guaranteed flow of taxpayers' funds. These are a few examples of the sorts of valuable services that make it necessary for these institutions to have compulsory membership and, if they do not get it, to have compulsory subsidisation of government funds in lieu thereof. Student unions have a long and atrocious record of financial management and stewardship of compulsorily acquired funds. Nobody will ever forget the Australian Union of Students, one of the diehard supporters of the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the terror campaign. It collapsed in 1984 after horrific business failures. The most prominent business failure was the collapse of AUS Student Travel in August 1977, when its creditors took over the company. These are the organisations the income of which the government has to prop up. AUS Student Travel collapsed with debts in the order of $2.5 million. Eventually, it was sold off to a Swiss multinational, and trades today under the name of Student Travel Australia. These are the important student organisations that this government has to fund and prop up. One of the business enterprises of the defunct Australian Union of Students, the AUS Friendly Society, collapsed with debts of over $157,000 against assets of $7,600. In the end, it managed to payout 4.8c in the dollar to its creditors. The funds that the government sends off can be spent on any sort of business enterprise that can go bust and can fail to payout creditors. If students say, 'I don't want to be part of that organisation anymore', the government picks up the tab; it keeps the funds flowing in. These are the kinds of business ventures that the government will inevitably be drawn into funding as a result of this bill. The remnants of the business of the AUS Friendly Society were taken over by the last of the AUS corporate ventures, Student Services Australia. Student Services Australia held the exclusive Australian rights to a discount air travel ticketing system known as 'brown ticketing', which it provided on an exclusive basis to STA Travel. When the AUS was disbanded in 1984, Student Services Australia devolved in trust to a couple of its ex-presidents, of whom the Treasurer would be very familiar. One of them was Mr Mark Burford and another was  to the Treasurer when he was minister for education. Mr Burford was appointed special student negotiator by the Treasurer in 1988 to liaise with students over the implementation of the Treasurer's higher education contribution scheme. . Now we get into the heart of the reason why these institutions have to be funded by government-why the government wants to prop them up against the danger that their members will voluntarily fail to retake out their subscriptions. The officers of these institutions can always be relied upon during election campaigns to campaign for the government, As soon as the National Union of Students was formed in 1987, it played an active role in the management of Student Services Australia. Later, the National Union of Students took over ownership of Student Services Australia under the conditions of a trust agreement under which SSA was devolved in 1984. Mr Burford ran into trouble over his shareholding in Student Services Australia when the president of the NUS acknowledged a possible conflict of interest by owning this service, through trust, and negotiating for the education minister in relation to HECS. Student Travel Australia gave the National Union of Students $19,000 to establish, plus $25,000 each year to Student Services Australia indexed for inflation, plus additional payments worth up to a total of $16,000 in return for Student Services Australia providing STA Travel with exclusive access to the 'brown ticketing' system. The National Union of Students has always been reluctant to discuss publicly the unusual nature of its relationship with Student Travel Australia. But with advisers such as Mr Noonan and Mr Burford, who have been intimately involved in all of these deals, any wonder that the Treasurer wishes to keep funding going to these institutions? Of course, the NUS is not without other dubious financial dealings. At the end of 1990 the general secretary, Mr Andrew Wooldridge, resigned from his position. Twenty-two charges were laid against him in relation to misuse of a cheque account drawn on the account of the union. The amount of the cheque was in the order of $4,500. Mr Wooldridge was sentenced to quite a few hours of community service, as well as being subjected to a substantial fine. The matter was covered up by the union for an entire fortnight because it had a referendum going at universities on whether students should affiliate their local student unions to the national one. It was not disclosed until after the referendum. The government makes students join these institutions .. By virtue of this bill, if students exercise their choice not to join, the government will continue paying taxpayers' money to the institutions. These are the sorts of institutions that this government elevates. to a priority when it comes to funding states for general purposes. The government is determined to ensure that student unions and student politicians with track records like this have a guaranteed Commonwealth backed stream of income. It is going to extreme lengths to quarantine these organisations from any market discipline. They do not need members because the government is hell-bent on making 'up the fees of anyone who exercises his freedom of choice to decline· membership. The government will guarantee their funds. It will even twist the whole of its general purpose grants to the states to include a· provision to keep this going. This provision has no place in a bill which is designed to give general purpose grants of $14 billion to the states for health services, educational services, roads and the like. Propping up student unionists; propping compulsory student unionism has nothing whatsoever to do with general purpose grants to the states. Yet we find that the government tacks into this bill a completely extraneous is it subject which has three effects: to deny students the right to freedom of association; to put a first charge to the Commonwealth on payments to student unions against hospitals, educational systems and the like; and to ensure that a constant stream of taxpayers' funds props up these .organisations that have political sympathy with the Labor party. Student unions should be forced to compete for members and provide services which students want.·If they provide them, they will get membership. Currently, student unions have a captive market. As long as student unions continue rely upon a steady flow of income, either from compulsory membership or from being propped up by government largess, there little incentive for these administrations perform in a responsible, responsive and accountable manner. They simply do not have to because they do not have to attract membership. Voluntary student choice is not just important political principle, it is a human right and it is also economically desirable. With the enactment of voluntary student . unionism, student unions will have impetus to improve performance and to offer services that will attract voluntary membership people who are prepared to pay for them. The coalition is opposing clause 20 but it is not seeking to prevent the Commonwealth from implementing the decisions of the Premiers Conference or to prevent the committee Commonwealth funding the states for general purposes. But we cannot vote for a bill which is tantamount to blackmail in relation to states which choose to recognise human rights. on this side of the House, believe in basic human freedom. We believe in freedom of association. We believe that it should be preserved at all costs. The substance of this bill relates to providrestore ing grants to the states for general purposes. The extraneous matter in it is thoroughly reprehensible. In committee we will move to excise clause 20, and support the bill. clause is not excised, if the government is going to make its general purpose grants to the states contingent upon propping up ganisations such as these and, by doing denies fundamental' human rights, we will vote against the bill as a whole.",113
188,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"As my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has pointed out, the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is a machinery measure that provides for general purpose grants to the states, to the Northern Territory and to the Australian Capital Territory. With this bill, the Australian Capital Territory will for the first time receive state-like funding. The ACT has previously been funded directly by the Commonwealth, rather than through to the financial assistance grants pool. As usual, these general purpose grants represent the outcome of the Premiers Conferis ence and the Loan Council meeting, which to took place on 5 July this year. The level of general purpose assistance allocated to the states under this bill is $14.7 billion, which constitutes about 13 per cent of the Commonwealth budget outlays projected for 1993-94. an This is one of the single largest areas of expenditure in the Commonwealth budget and the funds procured form a large part of the funds available to the states. With the grants for general revenue being set at $14.4 billion, it seems that the government has stood by its from commitment, made at the 1990 Premiers Conference, to maintain the level of financial assistance to the states in real terms over the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94 inclusive. At this year's Premiers Conference, the of Treasury officials appointed in 1992 presented its account of public sector finances in its National fiscal outlook report. In conjunction with the FitzGerald report, the We, National fiscal outlook document was designed to help put the magnitude of this country's national savings problem into some sort of perspective. It showed that a period of medium-term fiscal restraint is required to the public sector's contribution to national savings. This has been readily apparent for some time, although the National fiscal outlook document has at least served to If that quantify the magnitude of the task. That such restraint is required is a reflection of the marked lack of fiscal restraint by the orCommonwealth government in recent years, so, except when it comes to passing on such restraint to the other levels of government. This Commonwealth Labor government has long been concerned with shifting the burden of fiscal restraint onto the states. The most recent Premiers Conference was no exception. The National fiscal outlook document was, in large measure, designed to provide the intellectual justification for this continued restraint in Commonwealth funding to the states, just as the FitzGerald report provided some of the justification for the government's budget tax increases. The need for increased national savings is being used by Labor to give it new reasons for doing the same thing it has always done, but for which the old justifications are looking a little tired. It is certainly true that there is greater for fiscal restraint on the part of state and territory governments. The government does have a role to play in this regard as the principal revenue raiser in this country. However, it is highly undesirable for such restraint to be purchased at the expense of removing similar pressures for restraint on the Commonwealth government. Labor's most recent budget was notable for its complete absence of any expenditure restraint, despite the record high budget deficit and a need to wind back the public sector to make way for economic recovery. The government has instead contented itself with a budget deficit target of around 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97, leaving us with a deficit in that year of about $6 billion. Such a target is quite laughable, and is mocked by Labor's own One Nation statement of February last year, which projected a budget surplus within a similar time frame. The government could have avoided a lot of the trouble it has got itself into with its legislation to increase taxes if it had instead lived up to its mandate at the last federal election, which was to deliver personal tax cuts-not raise taxes-and to cut the Commonwealth's own purpose spending. Cutting government spending is never easy; that is acknowledged. But it must surely be starting to look a lot easier than trying to get the budget tax increases through the Senate. So instead of expenditure restraint from the Commonwealth in its own purpose spending, we have seen a host of tax increases being tried on to achieve Labor's paltry deficit reduction target. The tax cuts that were promised to the Australian people ahead of the last election are now being held hostage to these tax increases. Federal Labor has no basis on which to lecture the states about fiscal restraint. The Commonwealth is just not in the game and every dollar of restraint imposed on the states by the Commonwealth is just another dollar that can then be squandered by Labor from Canberra. The Access Economics Budget monitor of July this year made the point that the states room have already put in place substantial measures to address their budgetary problems. State government general budget deficits will decline by one-half of one per cent of GDP by the mid-1990s on current projections. In contrast, the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays have increased from 17 per cent of GDP in 1982-83 to 19 per cent in 1992-93. Commonwealth grants to the states have decreased by 25 per cent over the same period. According to Access Economics, the National fiscal outlook report reveals just how enormous the task of cutting the budget deficit by 1996-97 really is. It outlined two scenarios for the Commonwealth budget deficit-one based on high growth of four per cent, and one on a lower rate of three per cent growth. Even with the most optimistic view of economic growth, the Commonwealth is still left with a budget deficit in 1996-97 of $11.6 billion, or 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product. It surely follows that the Commonwealth will have to find an extra $6.4 billion in savings to achieve its target. Given the magnitude of Commonwealth payments to the states over the period 1996-97, it takes little imagination to figure out where some of the Commonwealth's search for savings will take place. With a preponderance of Liberal state governments, the Commonwealth will have every incentive to shift a large part of this need for fiscal savings onto the states. It is significant that the Commonwealth's three year guarantee to maintain financial assistance to the states in real terms has just expired. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has already been making noises about the need for the states to take the hard decisions. My friend the honourable member for Higgins made reference to that. Presumably, these are the hard decisions that the Treasurer has failed to make over the past year or two and that Labor has failed to make over the past 10 years. The degree of vertical fiscal imbalance th!lt exists in Commonwealth-state relations has been well documented. The states have an extremely narrow tax base. None of the existing taxes can be increased beyond their present levels without doing serious damage to economic activity in a variety of areas. Of all the federal systems of government in the world, Australia must have the most centralised system of revenue raising and the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance. If the Commonwealth government wants the states to have an incentive to engage in expenditure restraint, then it has to share the responsibility for public sector revenue raising with the states. Only then will'state governments have the appropriate motivation to limit spending and to make a significant contribution to public sector saving in this country. This was recognised by the previous coalition government which legislated for the states to be able to, at their choice, levy personal income tax through a uniform surcharge on federal revenue collections-or, if they were of a mind, to give a discount. That act was repealed by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during his time as Treasurer and has consequently left the states with few revenue raising options and, for the present, at the mercy of the Commonwealth's uncertain goodwill through the Premiers conferences. The states should, nevertheless, bear some of the blame for the position in which they currently find themselves. The states have continually shirked responsibility for raising their own revenue during the period legislation was in force which would have allowed them to do just that. The states have been· largely absolved from the need for the unpopular act of raising revenue and the accompanying accountability. This luxury, however, has been achieved only at the expense of fiscal responsibility. The former Labor governments of Victoria and Western Australia and the incumbent South Australian government are the most notorious examples of fiscal incompetence ever seen in this country. What remains of the states' own source revenue has been hit hard by Labor's recession. Lower levels of economic activity and falling prices in the property market have reduced stamp duty receipts to the states and payroll tax revenue has suffered as a result of the damnable 11 per cent unemployment that currently prevails. The Commonwealth is now in a position where it can virtually dictate terms to the states. This has been happening somewhat gradually over the past decade, with general purpose grants reduced during Labor's term from 55 per cent of Commonwealth outlays in 1982-83 to an estimated 45 per cent in 1992-93. At the same time, specific purpose or tied grants have risen from 46 per cent in 1982-83 to an estimated 54 per cent in 199293. It is the old golden rule: he who has the gold rules. That is what this Labor administration is practising. In seeking to reform Commonwealth-state financial relations, the states should not necessarily need new taxes or even extra revenue. Rather, they require· a guaranteed share of federal tax revenue that will enable them to manage their budgets by allowing a more effective process of fiscal forward planning. A state government at present has little incentive to exercise spending restraint if it is then unable to pass on the benefits of that restraint to the taxpayers in that state. In addition to providing general revenue assistance to the states, this bill includes provisions that seek to entrench compulsory student unionism at Australian higher education institutions through federal financial coercion of state governments. The honourable member for Higgins has given a good accowit of that. In conjunction with amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act that Labor passed last year, this bill will seek to reduce financial assistance to state governments that legislate for freedom of association at universities within state jurisdictions. The associated amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act were first introduced by Labor in 1989 in the mistaken belief that the coalition government in New South Wales would legislate to protect the rights of students not to be coerced into associations against their will. Unfortunately, the coalition government in New South Wales was never serious about protecting the rights of students to freedom of association. In fact, the New South Wales government has since used Labor's legislation as an excuse to avoid doing the correct thing by tertiary students in that state. That the New South Wales government should do the, bidding of the Commonwealth in this regard is shameful. I doubt that students in New South Wales thank it for that. The actions of the New South Walesgovernment compare most unfavourably to those of the new coalition government in my own state of Western Australia. The government of Western Australia has had the courage of its convictions to introduce legislation to protect freedom of association on campuses in that state. The Victorian government is also said to be considering legislation along these lines, and not before time. The issue of voluntary student unionism is alive and well again thanks to the state government of Western Australia and the new education minister there, the Hon. Norman Moore. The federal Labor government is thus cranking up this legislation again in an attempt to threaten and intimidate the states ignoring the rights of their students and maintaining the insidious institution of compulsory student unionism. It is doubtful that any state government, with the possible exception of the New South Wales government, will be in any way daunted by this legislation. The fact that the New South Wales government was making excuses for itself before this and related legislation was even passed by the federal parliament indicates that it was· never really sincere in its heroically stated intentions. What the federal Labor government is proposing to do with this legislation is in quite ridiculous. It is surprising that anyone should be fooled by it. The suggestion is that the Commonwealth will step in and give to universities a sum of money equal to the shortfall in collections of student union fees that occurs as a result of the introduction of voluntary membership of these bodies in any given state. The states will then have their general revenue assistance docked by the Commonwealth for an equivalent amount of money. Think of the bureaucracy involved in all of this, apart from anything else. Mr Costello-Job creation scheme.",117
189,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"Yes, it is a public sector job creation scheme. The government is proposing to hand taxpayers' money over to universities, and ultimately to student unions, to fund the activities of these bodies precisely to the extent that the students do not want to join them. The operations of student unions, as the honourable member for Higgins has pointed out, are already characterised by graft and corruption on a grand scale. Yet this government wants to give them money to the exact same extent that students vote with their feet and refuse to join these often unrepresentative bodies. Taxpayers should be outraged and I think students will be outraged that Labor proposes to undermine any accountability that voluntary student unionism would otherwise impose on those organisations. Exactly how the government would calculate the amount of the shortfall is anyone's guess. Labor has not said whether this would be a one-off payment or into an ongoing subsidy based on the enrolment at each institution concerned; but, either way, it is a ridiculous proposition. At the end of the day, it is hard to imagine even this government indulging in such stupidity. As far as the Western Australia government is concerned, I am sure that protecting the rights of students is more important to it than the small amount of funds that might be lost by way of reduced general purpose grants. The student unions themselves, I am sure, would prefer to attract genuine members by providing good service rather than relying on handouts from the Commonwealth as a fact subsidy for their incompetence. The federal Labor government claims that what the state government in Western Australia is doing is interfering with the rights of universities in that state.",120

193,Mr ANDERSON,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"There is untold hardship in woolgrowing rural Australia and, in particular, in specialist or exclusively wool producing areas. It is not just growers themselves who are being devastated by what really must be the lowest real prices for wool in living memory, and perhaps ever; it is entire communities. Service towns wilt and die as farmers close their chequebooks or, worse, have them taken away, just as they face that enormous devastation. The brutal and harsh reality facing the industry, I am afraid, is that prices will remain in the doldrums until the world economy picks up and more people are prepared to buy wool and pay higher prices for it, and until the industry'S huge stockpile ceases to overhang the market. Currently, depressed world economic conditions are the major price depressant. Once demand starts to pickup, I believe that the stockpile, especially while there is uncerother, tainty about the way it will be handled and managed, will prove to be the greatest inhibitor of what must be the first priority for the industry; that is, price improvements for the growers who, after all, are the foundation stone of the industry. They will not survive any longer in the current scenario in which they find themselves. Frankly, while the stockpile is used to immediately fill gaps between supply and demand-and there is enough wool in the stockpile to fill an awful lot of gaps for an awfully long time-there is little chance of significant price increases. The coalition's position is that the model proposed by the Wool Industry Review Committee, set up by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) after the last election, is, on balance, more likely to induce an earlier and stronger recovery in prices, at the same time as it will see a programmed quitting of stocks, than are the . current arrangements. Those current arrangements, which centre primarily on an annual debt repayment, seem likely to regularly produce uncertainty and speculation about the possibility of fire sales, for example, as repayments fall due. They certainly seem likely to depress prices and disguise market signals from growers and to result in higher taxes for longer than the alternative put before us tonight. We need to keep in mind that the budget itself provided, in the absence of a new an'd better plan, for a higher tax of 12 per cent-if my memory serves me correctly-in circumstances where the legislation· allows for a maximum of 15 per cent. We face a difficult situation, given that some $600 million is due next year-$400 million for debt repayment and $200 million in interest and storage and handling costs-in determining how that is to be met while the industry is in such a dreadful situation. Briefly, the package of eight bills before us will reshape the wool industry along the lines recommended by that Wool Industry Review Committee, known as the Garnaut committee. The aim is to reduce the number of bodies dealing with wool down to two. One is for promotion, research and development, and the to be known as Wool International, is to pay off the debt and reduce the stockpile by selling a predetermined fixed amount of wool. When the debt is less than the value of the stockpile-the target date is mid-1997; I understand it is only a target date-Wool International will be privatised and will then be owned by the people who have paid the debt taxes in the industry since July of tJlis year. It should be noted at the outset that the legislation relating to a privatised Wool International has not been introduced, and will not be for some time. I know that the industry will want to debate widely that body's potential role and place in the market. That is an appropriate situation given the concerns that many sectors of the industry have raised. By way of background, the wool industry reserve price scheme operated for some 20 years before falling into difficulty in the early 1990s due to a combination of factors which led ultimately to its total abandonment in February 1991. Prices for wool at auction increased dramatically in the late 1980s, peaking at around ll00c per kilogram. Instead of keeping the reserve price itself synchronised with the long-term price trend, it was increased by about 60 per cent over two years to 870c a kilogram, where it remained for two seasons. This increase, which effectively converted the reserve price scheme into a price setter, altered the price ratio of wool relative to other fibres. Instead of wool being somewhere around its historical level of three times as dear as cotton, it became six times as dear. This caused the trade to shift to other fibres at about the same time as the world recession started and the old Soviet Union split and ran into financial troubles. In 1950-51, the world total production of fibres was around 10 l h million kilograms. Wool had around 10 per cent of the total market. Man-made fibres accounted for 16 per cent and cotton 74 per cent. By 1991-92, the total share for wool had slipped to just 4.4 cent. I think wool growers ought to be concerned about and ought to focus closely on a different set of figures from that which is so often quoted to me in the community where they say we ought to have enormous presence in the marketplace and we ought to be able to use that on the basis that we provide 80 per cent of the world's apparel fibre. I would suggest that the figure that focus is that total market share of a world fibre market. It is slipping and is in danger becoming invisible. New approaches to dealing with this problem need to be put in place. That floor price for wool meant that wool was the most profitable farming enterprise with a guaranteed return. Many grain and other farmers started running sheep. We have all heard the tragic stories about graziers who went out and bought more land on the basis that they had a guaranteed income, because the reserve price scheme was there, and who have been horribly caught. Production rose very rapidly to the point where, in the late 1980s, some 1,100 million kilograms were being produced, but that was more than the market could cope with. In 1989-90, the AWC bought almost three million bales, or 52 per cent of the clip. The following year it bought 35 per cent of the clip. The government lowered the floor price to 7ooc, and in early 1991, as I mentioned earlier, it scrapped it altogether. By that time the Australian Wool Corporation had not only spent the $1.8 billion of growers' money that it had in reserve, but also borrowed $2.9 billion, and the stockpile reached the horrifying level, in current circumstances, of 4.5 million bales. At that point the government formed the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the AWRC, to handle the disposal of the stockpile and to pay off the debt. It was committed to a situation where the government said to growers, 'You will pay off the debt but you will cede ownership of the stockpile to the AWRC'. At the same time, the government established a separate research and development corporation, and a separate Wool Corporation per to handle promotion and quality control. The AWRC's stocks were frozen for the remainder of the 1990-91 season, with the exception of some outstanding long-term contracts and processed wool in stocks overseas. The government also gave the AWRC a bit over $20 million for two years to prevent it from having to hold a fire sale of its non-wool assets. That was an issue of great concern to needs quite careful many growers. At that time it established a seven-year of fixed repayment schedule with some $20 million due in that first year, $300 million in the second year, $400 million in 1993-94, $500 million the year after that, a further $550 million the year after that, $550 million the year after that, and $559 million to conclude the payment of the debt the following year, which would have been 1997-98. The system worked well for the first 12 months and some 540,000 bales were sold, putting the commission well ahead of its schedule. The 12 months following that, however, saw a significant decline in prices. It became obvious that it was going to be extraordinarily difficult to meet the repayment schedule this year. In fact, during that period of great speculation about what was going to happen and whether there would be a fire sale and so on, there was an all-time low of 381c a kilogram. Obviously, that was a totally disastrous situation. The immediate problem was overcome by the government adding a year to the fixed disposal schedule and declaring that nothing had to be repaid this financial year. At that time we moved that the repayment schedule should be completely disposed of because it was an unsatisfactory mechanism. One of the things that we welcome about the legislation before us is that that is the effective outcome. Currently, the debt is $2.2 billion and the stockpile remains at the worrying level of 3.9 million bales. However, production is estimated at 690 kilograms for the next 12 months and it is stm falling. In that sense, mentals are coming right.. This legislation, in order to prevent a fire sale of wool in the new financial year and to give confidence to the market to forward buy, adopts the Garnaut committee's recommendation of a fixed disposal schedule rather than a fixed debt reduction schedule. In other words, the deal is that we tear up the debt reduction schedule and put in its place a fixed disposal schedule. The Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, WRAP, will be responsible for the allocation of research and development funds and generic promotion. Other functions will go to industry, government or be abandoned altogether. The body will be encouraged to more actively seek partnership with commercial research and development ventures and to seek to more rapidly commercialise the results so that the industry obtains royalties, patents and the other benefits that can flow from quick and effective research efforts. Last year the government contributed $25 million for wool promotion along the pattern that has been established for a long time. This year it is to be $20 million, and the government has announced that there will be no more government funding. That is an issue to which I will return in a moment. WRAP will have a board comprised of a chairman, managing director, a Commonwealth representative and six others. The Wool Council of Australia has raised certain objections to the make-up of that board, and we will be moving certain amendments in relation to that later in the evening. One of the great problems that we face in relation to increasing demand for wool is that of promotion. We are actually facing a situation a little short of a crisis in funding. It seems to me to be self-evident that the future of the industry, whether under this model or any other, is heavily dependent on locking in the demand that is there, and increasing demand where possible. Whatever else, good or bad, that might have been said about promotion in the past-frankly, that is now a pretty much irrelevant issue-we face a situation where promotion funding and the efficacy of the packages put forward are of the fundaabsolutely critical importance. It seems to me that the IWS, under Richard Excell, has put together a very good promotion package and business plan that has resulted in a leaner, more focused operation which will need support. While some $120 million will be necessary for the program put together for next year, the 3.5 per cent wool promotion tax will raise something less than $70 million next year. That raises the very real prospect of the gutting of vitally needed programs. It should be noted that Coca-Cola spends something in the order of $60 million a year promoting its product in this small market alone. On the other hand, the International Wool Secretariat is looking at something of the order of less then $70 million to promote its product globally. That is obviously an extraordinarily worrying situation. The government has promised to ensure funding from other sources. It says that it is still hoping to get money from the International Wool Textile Organisation, the IWTO. I remind the minister for primary industries that he must honour his election promise to work with the industry, the Australian Wool Corporation and the IWS to develop a three year funding package in order to ensure continued and effective wool promotion. That was a commitment from the minister and it must be met if the future of this industry is to be secured. The very desirable outcome that we hope to achieve through this package is dependent to a very great extent upon demand levels. They in tum are dependent on a variety of instruments of which, of course, promotion is the premier part but which also include various other aspects, such as ATIP, a program pulled together under this legislation. We face a situation where the IWTO has abandoned its offer to provide $100 million for wool promotion largely because the government, correctly, rejected the IWTO's request that Australia introduce an export tax on wool. The minister claimed that the IWTO is withholding that $100 million because the IWS has not produced a business plan satisfactory to the process. I am assured, however, that that is not the case and that there is now an acknowledged adequate business plan. Action is desperately needed in this area. The other major body to be set up under this legislation is Wool International. That company will initially be a statutory body because legal advice is that, under company law, as debt exceeds the current value of assets, the director would be obliged to call in a liquidator. It will eventually be corporalator tised and privatised. The body will have the responsibility for handling the stockpile and the fixed schedule disposal. Before it becomes privatised, Wool International will have to be set up by a separate piece of legislation. The opportunity will be there for the industry to have wide-ranging consultations. That is important because industry needs to have varying views. That is appropriate and nobody could object to that. We will all want to hear what they are before we make a final decision. Wool International's immediate task is to develop risk management tools, such as futures markets and wool bond options; to introduce total quality control management for the industry; and to seek to enhance and expand those mechanisms in all ways possible. Members will be appointed to the board of Wool International by the minister through a process which is still subject to some negotiation. The board will consist of a chairperson, a chief executive, a Commonwealth representative and eight others. Board members must have skills in one or more of the following areas: wool production; wool processing, including the manufacture of wool products; business management; financial services; marketing; international commodity trading; wool testing and specification; law; and industrial relations. It is intended that Wool International be established as soon as legislation is passed to allow it to take over from the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. This will allow more time to develop forward selling and risk management tools, and to ensure that it is ready to start fixed disposal of the stockpile from 1 July 1994. Wool International will have to make a simple public statement monthly, then quarterly, on its compliance with the disposal schedule, but not in relation to stockpile management. However, it will repoit confidentially and regularly to government while the government guarantee is in place. That guarantee will be extended until Wool International is to be privatised. It is not intended that Wool International be a day-today trader or specuin the marketplace before it is privatised. I know from consultations with other sectors of the industry that they have had some concerns in that area. The minister has moved to address those concerns; and that is appropriate. Instead, the power to buy in wool, which has caused real concern, will be then used only in specific circumstances where sales have exceeded the amount of wool that legislated fixed disposal requires it to sell in a particular period. Wool International will have the use· of non-wool assets and can sell them if it makes commercjal sense to do so. It is anticipated that it will earn about $25 million a year froill these assets for its development work. The government will review its access to this money in a couple of years time. The minister has agreed that if a commercial buyer wants a large part of the stockpile before the end of June 1994 and the introduction of the new scheme, and such a sale will not affect sales of current production or allow the filling of the wool pipeline by traditional users, raising the sceptre of marketplace withdrawal on the introduction of the new schedule, the sale will be allowed to go ahead. That enticing possibility means there is the potential for the stockpile to be reduced significantly in size before the new arrangement begins. All of us would welcome such an outcome under suitably sensible arrangements. The minister has also agreed that if the is reduced more quickly than anticipated-this is to address some people's concerns that the price might go through the roof-Wool International can be privatised earlier. This would leave some flexibility in relation to what the industry might decide to do thtm with the remaining wool in the stockpile. The Garnaut committee, in relation to this whole question of stockpile management, considered six options for dealing with it, including the current arrangements, trigger prices, destroying or denaturing the wool and other such options. It did a lot of work on the various schemes. It came to the view that the long-term demand for wool will be better if at least half the stockpile is sold off, even cheaply, than if the stockpile were destroyed-Australia would find new customers and new uses for wool and thereby increase wool's total share of the world apparel market. Australia .provides 80 per cent of the world's apparel market at the'moment, as I indicated earlier, but the fibres share of total world market has slipped to an unacceptable level. More importantly, given the imperative of increasing, returns to growers, there is widespread acceptance that the stockpile is overhanging the market and will continue to do so while it is there and while there is uncertainty about when and how much of it will be released. The only 'perfect' way to solve the problem is unacceptable-destroy the stockpile. The next best method is to lock it up and release wool according to a very rigid schedule so the trade stops speculating about the stockpile and comes to factor in the release volumes, as something analogous to extra production. The objective is to create a marketplace as close as possible to one in which there is no stockpile-as has often been the case, even the usual situation, in the wool industry, allowing normal market signals to operate. Those signals are vital. Under current arrangements, the almost unlimited volume of stockpile wool which could come onto the market when prices start to rise will dampen not just the rises, but the signals. The result could be that, just as recovery surges, the debt stockpile may well be largely depleted and production levels could be very low. The potential for a repetition of the boom-bust cycle that has been such a problem for this industry in the past is very high under current legislation. At the same time, the proposed model starts to quit the stockpile. It does so at a rate of 27,000 to 29,000 bales a month from July to December next year, with a plus or minus five per cent variation allowed in that, and from January 1995 some 33 million kilograms, plus or minus five per cent per quarter. The Garnaut committee believes it will not be difficult to sell this amount of wool, as sales last year amounted to some 820 million if kilograms. The price might have been lousy, but the demand was all right. Production is now predicted to be only 690 million kilograms, at the same time as world production is falling. This will leave a 130 million kilogram gap which will not be filled with the - o million kilograms to be put on the market in the first six months of the plan. It will be only equalled by the 132 million kilograms to be put on the market per year from 1 January 1995. This initial shortage should cause the price to spike up which, in tum, will encourage people into forward contracts and futures. Speculators will see that there is money to be made in wool and they will start to invest. There will be no investment in wool if people are worried that a lot more wool might be dumped onto the inarket to meet an arbitrary debt repayment schedule. The coalition recommended in 1991 that we move to a fixed disposal schedule. We moved away from that scenario at that time because of the higher rates of production then applying. More recently we removed a second reading amendment calling for a flexible debt repayment schedule to prevent the market speculating on a fire sale of wool whenever a debt repayment was due to be made. In essence, that is part of this package. The coalition offered to match this year's $20 million for promotion and pay another $20 million in 1993-94, the first year of the new three-year funding period, while the needs of the industry were to be assessed. We have persistently argued, with considerable success, the case for the lowest possible level of tax. This legislation does provide for a fixed disposal schedule and it does abolish fixed debt repayment schedule. However, does not provide anything for promotion. I have indicated, the government has enormous responsibility, if its package is to higher here. work, to deliver the goods to ensure that it gets that very important aspect right. I want to make some final comments I think are of great importance in this debate. An enormous amount of damage has been industry done to the wool industry, in common with the rest of the rural industry, by the sort economic environment the industry has had operate in for the last few years. High levels of inflation, relative to our competitors-and this is an export industry-have done mense damage. They have pushed costs up all the time in a way that growers have not been able to cope with. Sometimes growers say, 'What we need a lower dollar'. We have had the most signifishow cantly depreciating dollar in the Western world over the last decade or so, with the exception of those of Turkey and New Zeation land, yet growers are no further ahead. Why has this happened? Consistently high levels of now? inflation have gutted our competitiveness and put us· behind, every time we have gone ahead. They have also driven the horrific interest rates that have done so much damage to the rural sector and wool growers, both weakening them before this disaster hit and limiting their capacity to recover. The review committee noted, in this whole question of economic environment and reform thereof, the importance of continued improvetion ments in the efficiency of the waterfront, translation of improved port efficiency and lower port and shipping costs. The committee noted that efforts to reduce costs and raise incomes in the grains, beef, sheepmeat and forestry industries, will help apply upward pressure on the wool market by moving farmers away from wool production. What did we get in the budget? There was a series of measures which make those indusensure tries less competitive, putting more pressureincluded in the way Garnaut highlights-on the wool and the industry. industry. The committee recommended that attention be given to micro-economic reform, to reduce slaughter and other sheepmea,t costs. the We are woefully uncompetitive in those areas. it The Australian Wool Corporation last year As compared our wool industry costs with those an in New Zealand and found that they were The committee drew on work by the Industry Commission, identifying the potential for which savings from on-going micro-economic reform, to estimate that output in the wool could be increased by $90 million a year. The committee accepted that tariffs on of imported inputs cost the wool industry $39 to million in 1991-92. The committee said that if our shearing costs were the same as those in New Zealand, Australian growers could imsave $100 million a year. The committee accepted the Treasury estimate that sales tax costs primary industry hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The committee noted the is figures of Swan Marketing Consultants that Australia has a long way to go, relative to international best practice. The waterfront remains overmanned, and equipment utilisais well below standards set abroad. Mr Braithwaite-What about fuel costs",122
194,Mr ANDERSON,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Fuel costs, certainly with their impact on other industries which need to be attractive enough to induce those in who have a choice away from the wool in industry, remain too high. The coalition will be moving a series of amendments tonight which will involve the need to include fellmongered wool for the purposes of collecting the wool tax; retain the clause in the legislawhich facilitates the government giving the wool for promotion; change the date for AWRAP to divest itself of quality assurance ·from the end of December 1994 to the end of December 1995; have selection committees to select people for both boards, Wool International and AWRAP, as under the old board; require AWRAP to consult with the Wool Council on its corporate plan, given that it is the peak body. representing all states; and that the Wool Council of Australia is in consultations between AWRAP As my first meeting with brokers here in Canberra and my last meeting with growers in Hay indicated, the industry has a final message: when this package is hammered out, for all of our concerns and reservations, this industry must pull together in all of its sectors, all of its parts and all of its leadership to end the uncertainty, division and lack of stability that has so plagued an,d undermined it. That is how it must be if wool is to be restored to its rightful place as a premier agricultural export of this country.",127
195,Mr HARRY WOODS,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"page) (8.31 p.m.)I am very pleased to support what I believe is one of the most important pieces of primary industry legislation that has come into the House for many years. The Wool International Bill and cognate bills will have a marked and positive impact on an industry that has shouldered a great deal of the burden of Australia's economic well-being for many decades. I commend the coalition and the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), for the positive steps they have taken to back the legislation. I know that the opposition is raising some questions of detail, as has already been mentioned, but I believe that they are peripheral; they do not go to the substance, impact or focus of this legislation. I understand that consultation is still going on, and I hope that is approached in such a way that the future of the industry is considered. Certainly, in that respect, the consultation so far has been very good. I also commend the Head of the Depart-. ment of Economics and the Divisional Conveand nor of the Research School of Pacific Studies at the Australian National University, Profesthe sor Ross Gamaut; the Managing Director Pioneer International, Rod Price; and Stephen Bennett of Country Road Australia, which the biggest domestic user of Australian wool and one of the largest users of fine products in the world. Those three people, the membership of the Wool Industry Review much Committee, have been able to stand at arm's length from the industry and view the probimpact lems confronting it as a whole rather than bits and pieces with difficulties arising each of those small parts. In doing that, they have come up with what is known now as the Garnaut report on the wool industry; That report has provided the framework for this legislation. I also strongly commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for the understanding, work and clear thinking that he has brought to this particular problem and to the portfolio as a whole. I know that, in the meetings that I have shared with the minister, primary industries organisations and wool growers have all been impressed with his great 'ability to cut to the core of an industry'S concerns and, where government action is required, necessary or appropriate, to act quickly and have those concerns addressed. I know that, especially in the early days, opposition members, particularly of the National Party of Australia, hoped that the minister would fail. But with every passing day those opposite cringe a little more as he demonstrates to the rural community that he has the understanding· and the ability' to get things done that the primary industries need. They are recognising that fact. As I have said, this legislation affects what has historically been, and what will continue to be, one of our most important primary industries. While it is true that Australia probably does not ride on the sheep's back any. more, there is still truth in the fact that the backbone of the sheep will carry a considerable amount of our economic burden in the future. As we all know, the wool industry is probably just about to emerge from one of the most difficult periods in its history. Low falling commodity prices, joining with extensive droughts, in some cases floods-as minister and I saw today in Wangaratta, of Shepparton and Benalla-and some ill-conceived management policies forced many is farmers into bankruptcy and much of the primary industries sector into deep recession. wool As a government, we do not have much control over external factors. We do not have control over droughts, if any, floods or falling commodity prices, but we can have an on the internal domestic mechanisms as which play such a direct part in influencing out of the future of the industry. Those internal mechanisms are being properly addressed in this legislation. It is about sending proper signals to our wool producers and to the international markets on which they rely. It has become necessary to do this because the wrong signals have been sent out in the past. By setting an unrealistically high floor price for our wool in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Wool Council of Australia sent out two extremely important but equally damaging signals. The first was to the Australian wool producers. It did not matter how much wool they produced, it was going to fetch a premium price. It seemingly did not matter that wool producers were not selling it to anyone but themselves and that they were having to buy it back and pay interest on the borrowings they needed in order to buy the wool. They were happy to keep producing more and more wool, secure in the knowledge that they would be able to sell it at that high price. That, of course, led to overproduction and an increasing supply of wool that was difficult to sell. The second signal was to the international market. That signal told the international buyers that if they wanted to get Australian wool they would have to pay 870c a kilogram. That led many to retool and to develop facilities for the processing of the competitive items-the man-made fibres. Once they spent so much of their resources on retooling, it was going to be difficult for them to get back into the wool market. So the farmers were producing all the wool that they could, then buying it back from themselves, while the international clothing manufacturers turned their machinery into making clothes from other fibres. The result was the development of a huge stockpile of wool; and panic set in. The stockpile was seen as an ogre. The overriding feeling was, 'Who will pay anything for our wool when they know we have to get rid of ,this great amount? Buyers will hold out of the market until we are forced to sell it for virtually nothing'. The most powerful aspect of the legislation before the House tonight is that it allows the wool industry, and more generally Australia, to view the stockpile of wool not as a liability but as an asset. It lets us see that this great reserve of wool has tremendous value, that it all is something no other country in the world is capable of producing and that, if marketed correctly, it will return the industry to long term viability. That will be achieved primarily through the introduction of a fixed schedulein other words, a timetable-which will let the international market and the domestic producers know that, regardless of price, a certain amount of Australian wool will come onto the international market at a fixed rate over a fixed time. There will be no fluctuation; a set amount will be sold each year. This is an important signal. This is the one that tells prospective buyers that they will not be able to hold off on their purchase for too long because another prospective buyer, one who is equally aware of what is available, might snap up what is on offer in that year. It has been argued by some people in the industry that, while they agree a certain amount of the stockpile should be sold each year, if the price rises significantly they should be able to fill that demand while the price is at a premium. This would_ create market uncertainty and the question would be: how much over the schedule are they likely to sell? If Wool International were to take the opportunity presented by rising prices to sell more wool, this would have a dampening effect on the extent of the price rise and producers would, therefore, lose the benefit of any price upturn. With the passing of this legislation, we will be telling' international buyers that from 1 July next year we will have a set amount of wool for sale. It is perhaps fortuitous that in the first year of the operation of the fixed schedule our wool production will have fallen to such a degree that the wool realised through the fixed schedule will simply bring us back to somewhere near the current level of sales. With South Africa and New Zealand also likely to be producing less wool there is likely to be less supply, leading to increased demand and rising prices. The three primary objectives of the legislation are: to establish industry bodies with a clear commercial focus; to establish new mechanisms for the marketing of wool; and to expand international trade in wool and wool products. The first of these objectives requires a significant change in approach for the wool industry. In the past it has had what was predominantly a production focus, encouraging industry participants to produce high quality and large quantities of wool, but with little focus on the market requirements for that wool. This strategy links closely with the second and third objectives to establish new mechanisms for marketing wool and to expand the international wool trade. This will largely take the form of generic promotion whereby wool and wool products, rather than particular classes or types of wool, will be promoted. Wool lobbyists will approach existing and prospective international buyers to advise of the advantages of using wool-and there are many advantages-and encourage them to join the market. This again is expected to increase demand. Once this has been achieved, it may then be appropriate for more product specific marketing. As is evident from this package, these are measures which are designed to ensure the long-term viability of the industry. They are measures which will change the signals that have been sent to wool producers and the international community, which will encourage an attitudinal change in the industry from one that is production focused to one that is market focused, and which will treat the wool stockpile as a great natural asset rather than a problem that must be disposed of. They will place the wool industry firmly in the position of master of its own destiny. It is important to remember that while this government is focusing on guaranteeing the long-term viability and profitability of the industry, it is not going to let wool producers with good long-term prospects fall by the wayside during the current difficult position. The simple fact is that on current international prices the industry is unsustainable. The term prospects, on all available evidence, are good, but many producers are in severe difficulty now and it is essential that they be assisted through this difficult period until commodity prices improve. While we are here tonight discussing measures which are aimed at the industry'S long-term future, it is important not to lose sight of what we are doing to help those whose need is urgent. In late April this year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced a package of measures to address the existing and long-term issues facing the industry. These measures provided immediate assistance to members of the industry who were in short-term difficulty but had long-term viability prospects. As announced by the minister at the time, the key elements of the package to address short-term circumstances were, first, that the federal government would fund up to $44.6 million under the exceptional circumstance provision of the rural adjustment scheme, which would allow an interest rate subsidy of up to 100 per cent for eligible growers. This followed a recommendation to the government by the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, a broadly represented body which includes rural representation. The second element is maintenance of the wool tax rate at 8112 per cent for 1993-94, made up of 3 1h per cent for wool promotion and marketing, half a per cent for research and development and 4112 per cent for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. Third, there is the restructuring of the AWRC debt repayment schedule by extending the debt schedule from seven to eight years and introducing more flexibility to the schedule, including the removal of any requirement for the commission to repay debt in 1993-94 beyond the funds already in hand for this purpose of $118 million. The government has also agreed that annual targets for debt repayment be indicative only, with the actual target to be determined by the government at the start of each financial year. The government made the exceptional circumstance funding available immediately to eligible producers and called on the states long- to provide some matching RAS funding. The minister also announced that the cap on the level of assistance for· each applicant under the provisions would be lifted from $30,000 to $50,000, with further changes being subject to a review of RAS administrative arrangements. Increased flexibility was also provided for those eligible for exceptional circumstance provisions. It is clear that the government is focusing on the long-term and the short-term prospects for the Australian wool producer. It is focusing on the long-term prospects by implementing the appropriate policy settings, but will keep farmers with prospects for long-term viability operational by providing short-term assistance. By doing this, it will be able to keep those with an understanding and a knowledge of the industry, those who have a commitment to its future and their future within it, involved. We will not be losing one of our most precious resources in the wool industry, namely, the human resource. I mentioned at the outset that I was encouraged by the support this legislation had received from the opposition, government members and other interested parties. I would like to conclude by giving credit to the vast majority of the wool industry which has supported this legislation. It is often difficult when faced with a crisis to see things clearly, and there is no doubt that the wool industry is currently in crisis. But it has been able to recognise the many positive aspects of this legislation and generally has offered very strong support for the focus and substance of the legislation. Concern has been expressed by the Wool Council and more lately by the New South Wales Farmers Association that they will not be represented on the board of the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation. After giving support to the Garnaut report, the New South Wales Farmers Association is now suggesting that it might approach the Democrats and the Greens in the Senate in order to force amendments to the legislation to require compulsory membership on the board. The argument is that, if growers are to be paying a four per cent levy for promotion and marketing, they should have a say in how that money is spent. The answer is that they will. Of the nineperson board, there will be a chairperson, a deputy chairperson, a government appointee appointed by the minister and six others. The minister has given assurances that the industry will be thoroughly consulted bdore any appointments are made. It is also a requirement for the remaining six members of the board that they have skills or qualifications in the following areas: production or processing, business management and finance; research and development and product promotion. These board members should have expertise in at least one of these areas and some skills in each of the other areas. To suggest that members of the board will all come from outside the wool industry is wrong. The board is structured to provide the best possible people with the best possible qualifications to manage the interests of the wool industry. Some will obviously have to come from within the industry, but if there are others outside the industry with outstanding attributes, it is entirely appropriate that they be given positions. It would be completely wrong if they were ignored. I would like to make a couple of points. This legislation is about setting a clear direction for the Australian wool industry. It is a direction which will put it on a stable footing and will allow it once again to be one of Australia's predominant primary industries. It is a long-term process and, while we are getting there, this government will not abandon those wool growers who have demonstrated commitment to the industry and an ability to become profitable. It is well-reasoned legislation based on expert advice and wide ranging discussion and consultation with the government, the industry and individual growers. I have a great feeling of optimism for the future of the wool industry. Wool exported in the two years from 1991 to 1993 was close to the highest level in the history of t)le wool industry. I believe that we should view the wool industry not as part of our problems but as an important part of the solutions to this nation. It deserves our full support. I commend the bill to the House.",128
196,Mr MCARTHUR,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"I am delighted that the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) in his final remark is optimistic about the future of the wool industry. I am pleased that a member of the government has that attitude. From the outset, I declare my interest jn the wool industry, having been a wool grower all my life. I have watched these arguments since 1965 when the wool growers actually rejected the reserve price scheme, which was subsequently introduced in 1972. In October 1993 we are introducing legislation that clears up the mess, so to speak. We have a massive $2.2 billion of debts and we have about 3.9 million bales in the stockpile. They are the fundamental problems that face the wool industry. This is the culmination of all the arguments and debate-the theories about reserve prices and the way in which the wool industry should be run-that have gone on during those intervening years. It is worth looking at some of the historical perspectives of how we actually got into this mess. The reserve price peaked in the 1980s when the wool price reached l100c clean. The reserve price at that time was increased by 60 per cent to 870c. That was at a time when the wool industry was booming and everyone was optimistic. I well recall wool industry leaders saying, 'This will go on forever'. Those of us who had been in the industry were very sceptical that these very high prices would continue and thought that the setting of this reserve price at such level was fraught with danger and in the long term would be the undoing of the industry. And so it happened. The security blanket that was put there by the reserve price encouraged wool growers to produce 5.7 million bales of wool in 1989-90. At that stage, the Australian Wool Corporation brought in three million bales of that clip-about 50 per cent-because of the reserve price. That was the seed of destruction of the whole program and the whole reserve price arrangements. Members of this House will well recall that in 1990 the government and the leaders of the wool industry lowered the floor price from 870c to 700c. That was a major political debate in this parliament and within the wool industry. There were people who felt that the wool industry at that level was going to become bankrupt. What a comparison between the 700c and some of the figures we now see. In February 1991, the reserve price scheme was abandoned overnight by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), on the advice of the Australian Wool Corporation and all those people involved. The debts had become too great, and the results are there for everyone to see. The growers had spent $1.8 billion of their own funds that had been carefully conserved over the years. They had also managed to have about $2.9 billion of borrowings that had been injected into the reserve price scheme. It is interesting to observe that the Wool Council of Australia had recommended the price of 870c and, even to this day, there are members of the Wool Council who hanker after the reserve price and who see its operation as a panacea for the problems that are now facing the wool industry. We have these two problems. We have a stockpile of physical product in wool bales and we have a debt. I would like to concentrate on those two aspects here in the parliament. The Vines report recommended that in view of this basic problem a wool realisation commission should be set in place. At that time, it was agreed in the wool industry that a high there be a repayment schedule to try to remove this debt and remove the physical stockpile overhanging the market. Over the seven-year period, as members would fully understand, there was a schedule to remove the debt in the first year of $300 million, with a sliding scale up to $600 million, with no debt being left in 1997-98. That was the program that the Vines committee recommended. In recent times, that has run into a number of difficulties. The key issue involved in this whole proposition was that the government demanded that there be a repayment in monetary terms for all the debt that had been incurred for which the government had given a guarantee. So when things got tough more wool was being sold just to meet those monetary targets. With the depressed price that is now operating down as low as 380c on the indicator, these schedules were almost impossible to meet. The government could see that there was a possibility of a fire sale. The market fell even further and it was obvious that we had to take some further actions. That necessitated some recommendations from the Garnaut committee. We have the result of that in the legislaworld tion here today. I do have reservations. These recommendations have emerged rapidly. There has not been a very full debate on some of the ramifications of the Garnaut recommendations. However, it is a positive option put forward by the government and I would like to make some observations. We do have the physical stockpile of 3.9.billion bales; we do have the $2.2 billion of debt-which is guaranteed by the government-but let us not forget that that money has been borrowed from the private sector and it is serviced by wool grower funds. I think sometimes it is overlooked in this debate that the Australian wool growers are now servicing this debt-which was incurred by previous wool growers-and are servicing it with the government guarantee. Let me just deal briefly with the reorganisational aspects of the legislation that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has put down. We see some changes yet again. Those of us who have been in the wool industry wonder what will be the next set of changes in terms of the promotion and research. The shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), has dealt with the details of that. We had a recommendation of the Vines committee to split the organisations and now we have a recommendation to put the promotion and research together. I support that general approach and the levies 0[0.5 per cent for research and 3.5 per cent for promotion. I note that the government has withdrawn its $20 million from these activities at a time when the wool industry could well do with the government's support. Hopefully, these structures will remain in place. They will fulfil a role which historically they done well. Promotion and research over the years in the wool industry have been effective. There has always been an argument as to whether the promotion has been value for money but I think over the 20 years that promotion has been very much a feature of the wool industry. Wool growers have managed to maintain their market share or their particular niche in the fibre market and they have been able to promote wool around the and generally within the market circumstances. I tum to the formation of Wool International. Obviously, this is a key part of the government's legislation and the recommendations of the Garnaut committee. I am interested to observe that Wool International will be a statutory body with a set of directors under the Corporations Law. One of the ironic twists is that because the equity of Wool International will not be there in the first couple of years trading a liquidator will have to be appointed to run its affairs. That is an interesting way to set up an authority-to have a liquidator supervising its affairs because there is no equity in the outfit. Wool International is enjoying the support of government guarantee for its operations in its early years. The minister has indicated that he wishes to privatise this operation in 1997. I would go along with that particular approach. Hopefully, the mechanics of the process of change will be acceptable to wool growers and to the government, the operation will be privatised, and the equity will flow to wool growers in the method outlined by the minister. This whole operation of Wool International begins on 1 July 1994, which is at the end of the wool selling season. I do wonder what might actually happen over the next few months when a big proportion of the Australian wool clip will be sold. There will be a new set of circumstances by 1 July 1994 when Wool International gets off the ground. Happily, Wool International is now under the 'up-front regime of a monthly and quarterly disposal schedule for selling wool. This is clear to both the wool buying and wool selling fraternity. The conceptual basis is that have we have a physical stockpile of 3.8 million bales. The conceptual approach, to put it in simple terms, is that the stockpile is like a big sheep station in Queensland. Wool International and the government have determined that there will be a steady flow of wool onto the market on the predictable basis of 27,000 to 29,000 bales from July 1994 to December 1994. I find some difficulty in establishing exactly how the figure of 27,000 bales was arrived at. However, from January 1995 to June 1997, there is a clear determination to put 46,700 bales per month onto the marketa total of 561,000 bales per year; about half a million bales per year on the physical disposal schedule. That is the key argument to which I will allude a little later. Wool growers are concerned to know their equity in the stockpile at the end of this program; whether there will be an upside or a downside and who will handle whatever the case may be in 1997. A lot of these arguments are based on the interesting figures last year Australia sold 4.1 million bales. Production was 3.5 million bales last year, and wool production is falling around the world. Given that seasonal conditions in Australia, especially in Queensland, have been bad, and given that sheep numbers have dropped dramatically because of the profitability of the industry, these figures help support the total proposition. The Garnaut schedule for selling this number of bales fits in with the fundamental proposition of the productive potential of the industry and future trends over the next couple of years. The fundamental question is whether that Queensland sheep station-the stockpile-will feed the wool onto the market at a high price or at a low price if the market changes dramatically. For example, I ask honourable members to consider whether, if the price doubled, Wool International woqld be tempted to put more wool onto the market. If the price fell even further, what would Wool International do with its physical release schedule? The directors of Wool International ,would be greatly tempted to make yet another change in their arrangements, given that these arrangements seem to tum up every two or three years, and given the categorical undertakings by the minister. I, notice that the former Minister for Primary Industries, the honourable member for Werriwa, is in the chamber. He gave an immutable undertaking that the Australian wool industry would maintain 7ooc, and we know what happened to that. Can we be sure that wool processors can be confident that Wool International will maintain its schedule of disposal in view of the fact that it is a statutory authority under the guidance of this parliament? One part of the Garnaut proposals that I do like is the thesis that futures options and physical delivery should be developed in the marketplace. The introduction of the reserve price removed the futures operation. It has been one of my strong recommendations that a futures operation would be very helpful to the Australian wool market and Australian wool growers. I was pleased to note that in his second reading speech the minister said, that 'Between now and July 1994 the government expects Wool International to make significant progress in setting up forward selling mechanisms for the industry'. I entirely support the minister when he says that a futures operation should be set up and encouraged. As happens with commodities in other industries, futures markets operate with exchange rates and hedge a position at some future time. Futures give the processor-the grower-a known price at the time of sale. Amongst wool growers there is a fear of the operation of futures and, in many cases, a lack of understanding that futures establish a price. Futures in the private marketplace can provide a stabilisation of prices that the reserve price never could. The Garnaut report and the recommendations of the government are very much dependent upon increasing world demand for textiles-for wool in particular. We all know that the world is in recession, and textiles are particularly affected. The wool industry will depend upon a resurgence in buying by China, Japan, western Europe, and some of the eastern European mills. At this stage there is no indication that this will take place. An increasing demand for fibre, in particular wool, is a fundamental assumption in all the proposals put forward by the government and the minister. With the fixed schedule of selling, I speculate on what might happen if there were falling prices, falling production around the world and no increase in demand. All I would ask is that the government hold its nerve in this set of circumstances. Historically, this has not been the case, as we have seen over the last four or five years during this saga of the changing legislation surrounding the wool industry. I want to refer to a couple of other items which are not really so fundamental to the main thrust of the legislation. I draw to the government's attention that it was the coalition that encouraged the government to set the wool tax at the lower rate of 8.5 per cent. Honourable members would well recall that the government wanted to set the wool tax at 13 to 15 per cent. The minister would well recall that there were long hard debates in this parliament, and our prediction and suggestion of a rate of 8 to 9 per cent turned out to be correct. I am pleased that the minister has adopted our suggestion and maintained the wool tax at 8.5 per cent, with the debt handling charge of 4.5 per cent, promotion at 3.5 per cent and R&D at 0.5 per cent. Finally, I express my concern at the recommendations of the Wool Council of Australia. Over the years we have been having these debates in the parliament, the Wool Council has had a range of positions and views. I hope its support of this particular proposition does not sound the death knell of the recommendations before the government. The Garnaut report now moves the wool industry into the commercial world. I hope that the future of the wool industry is secure after 1997; with few statutory bodies; with quality standards enforced at the shed level and through processing; with wool growers maintaining their 4.4 per cent of the total fibre market; and with a free market for wool with no levies imposed by either government or their own organisations. I join with the minister in hoping that the wool industry will recover and will return to prosperity in a free and open market and that all my forebodings about some of the recommendations will not come to fruition.

197,Mr KERIN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"I am very pleased to see the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), in the House for this important debate. We are debating a package of bills, the Wool International Bill and cognate bills, that hopefully will set in place the arrangements for the wool industry past the run-down in the stockpile and into the next century. Decisions for and by the wool industry typically have been taken in times of crisis. I well remember the problems of the 1960s and the courage displayed by people such as Sir William Gunn at the time. I grew to understand the profound conservatism in all sectors of the industry while working for the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics in 1971 and 1972 as part of the Australian objective measurement project. It is an industry in which there is no shortage of reports. When I looked in my library recently, I found reports from 1973 and 1974. There is still some very interesting reading in them. The final version of the minimum reserve price scheme for wool was introduced by Ken Wriedt,as minister for primary industry in the Whitlam government. Paradoxically, almost immediately it was. sabotaged by the Whitlam cabinet when an increased rate of buying in started to occur. I remember very well arguing against the cabinet's view in the Labor caucus. My friend Bob Whan, the lhen member for Eden-Monaro, and I were successful in dissuading the government from acting in the way that it intended. Not long after caucus took that decision, Doug Anthony went out to the slathering hordes and the media and took the credit. So I well remember that. The minimum reserve price. scheme for wool worked well and withstood two periods of buying into the stockpile. But the changes that put the scheme and the industry into threat were really the 1983 decision to float the Australian dollar, worldwide financial deregulation through the 1980s and my decision to allow the Australian Wool Corporation board to set the minimum reserve price in consultation with the industry. The government and I did this in the belief that the board would act corporately and would be mindful of the advice of its professional staff. It is a matter of conjecture whether I, as then minister, would have set the price lower than 870c, having taken the price up by 70 per cent over two seasons in the heady days of 1987, 1988 and 1989. There were many at that time who believed that the price of wool had reached, to quote a phrase that was bouncing around the industry, a new plateau. I think many people were persuaded that we had arrived at a different time, including some hard-headed, Canberra based departmental officials. The biggest problem was that the minimum reserve price and international generic promotion had worked well, so well that the industry became complacent and stopped thinking. I have had the view since I became involved in the wool industry professionally in 1971 that insufficient attenprice tion has always been paid by the industry and by industry analysts to the requirements of buyers, the markets and the dynamics of the textile industry. Leaner, smaller government and all that went with it meant that a lot of analysis that could have been carried out by government and a lot of the push for continuing innovation that could have resulted from such analysis did not occur. By the time we faced the crisis in the early 1990s, we lacked much of the analysis that we had done previously on this industry. Decisions taken by the government, the Australian Wool Corporation in the industry in the early 1990s, again were taken at a time of crisis. The build-up of the stockpile was speedier than ever before and the large financial reserves of the Australian Wool Corporation were being locked up very rapidly and large borrowings with government guarantee ensued. For wool growers there had not been much profit in wool year in and year out through the 1970s and 1980s. But, with the price hike in the late 1980s, the 870c minimum reserve price, a run of reasonable seasons and the price pressure on wheat and grain growers due to international subsidisation, the sheep flock expanded rapidly and many new entrants came into wool production. This, together with factors such as warm northern winters, consumer response to the previous higher price, the collapse of European communism, changes in the structure of the wool processing and textile industries, the Gulf War, and the onset of world recession meant that supply and demand were getting even more out of balance. The ethos of the industry at this time generally was an implicit belief in the virtues of wool, particularly fine wool, and a belief that we had been through all this before and that the minimum reserve price was our saviour and guide in a time of trouble. There was also a Eurocentric ethos in the industries' institutions at a time when.the industry was moving to Asia and the developing world. One of the virtues of the minimum reserve was that it limited risk for buyers of wool for processing. This in tum meant that, the in a period of lack of demand, Australian growers through the minimum reserve price scheme carried the risk not only for buyers and, users of Australian wool but also for other countries producing apparel wool, such as South Africa, Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand. Although the using industry had coped with the decline in the market price from 1257c a kilogram clean in April 1988that was the peak-down to the guaranteed price of 870c a kilogram, the majority of the growers and others in the industry were clearly opposed to any drop below the minimum reserve price. It was true, as I was advised then by the Australian Wool Corporation, that Europe and developed country users such as Japan would pay 870c forever, particularly when the structure of the industry means that, for example, men's suits are priced between $500 and $2,000 when the cost of the wool content is about $20 to $40. But this argument was transformed by some to say that price and supply and supply and demand never count. People were forgetting that the demand for wool is a derived demand; that wool is a small proportion of total world textile fibre usage, but not, of course, for some products; that the price of competitive fibres really does count; that wool could only extract a price premium up to three times, not eight times, more expensive than its competitors; and also that the developing markets were and are price sensitive. I took the view that the industry in Australia-and eventually the taxpayer-should not take all, the risk; that in this period of crisis there was a need for supply also to be brought back into balance. The decision to drop the price to 700c was mine. I wrote every word of the speech I gave at Roma in Queensland. It is a matter of historical record that the Australian Wool Corporation board was not prepared to accept the drop, nor was the industry generally. I believe, and I still believe, that if we had not dropped the price the stockpile would have grown further and, on the best available cl,llculations, the industry would have faced an impossible financing situation out some years. With drought always threatening in Australia, it was best to take the decision earlier good years rather than later. I reject any view that the decision was taken on the basis of some free market ideology. The cabinet and three key coordinating departments were dealing with an unpredictable circumstance, as was I, where the arithmetic and risk were clear. We were very clear that we had to take a hard decision to save the industry. I would like to place on the record my gratitude and enduring respect for the probity, courage and work of Hugh Beggs, Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, through this period. As is known, I disagreed with the board of the Australian Wool Corporation, and Hugh Beggs's' job was extraordinary difficult at that time. The government, the Australian Wool Corporation and the industry all did absolutely everything to maintain the minimum reserve price at 700c and the taxpayers spent hundreds of millions of dollars to see the industry through once the minimum reserve price at 700c collapsed some seven months after its installation. The factor that caused the minimum reserve price to collapse was that the buyers moved out of the market, allegedly on the basis of three or four factors-in the end, they were provoked possibly by three of those eventsbut in reality on the basis of the buying trades' calculations of the size of the stockpile and the debt that the producers were facing. After having been sued by some buyers over the collapse of the minimum reserve price and having to produce every piece of paper and advice given to me, I can only reiterate that we did everything possible to maintain the 700c minimum reserve price. I have spoken earlier of decisions being taken in times of crisis. However, I would like to emphasise that there is one matter that differentiates the late 1960s early 1970s crisis period from the 1990s. That is, whereas there were real doubts about the future of wool in the 1960s and 1970s, there are none now despite the current price and difficulties. The findings and recommendations of the Garnaut report-the review of the wool industrymake this clear, as does the government's response to that report. Most importantly, the after most significant response to the Garnaut report has been that of the wool growing industry. Even the maddest of the mad in earlier times now accept that we have to continue to direct the industry towards the market and not towards regulation. No longer do we hear of recommendations for a 45 per cent tax to save the minimum reserve price by those who wanted the price at 1000c. No longer do we hear of subsidies to shoot 20 per cent of the flock. No longer do people think t11at laptop computer calculations equal sales of finished goods. No longer do we hear of proposals to bum the stockpile. Although there is an inevitable nervousness when the price falls on the open market at various times during the season, the factual reasons why we should be optimistic in the medium to longer term and back the government in its policy for industry structural reform and arrangements is really that a lot of wool has been sold in the last two yearsonly slightly less than in the period of maximum demand in 1987, 1988 and 1989. We are now selling, or have sold, up to 850 kilotons with a weak market. Supply this year in Australia is expected to be about 690 kilotonnes. World supply is also dropping and the supply response to market conditions, while slow as expected, is now based more on market reality and the inevitable seasonal conditions than on a guaranteed price. One cannot emphasise too much the importance of the level of industry consensus behind the Garnaut review of the wool industry, the government's response to it and the positive indications for the industry's future. No-one expects that a review, report, plan or policy will always change every basic problem or factor facing an industry.:... - particularly with a stock overhang-but we can aim to reduce the inventory and increase market orientation. After a close reading of the report, I have questions and queries of it and points that I would like to contest, but this would not be constructive. The industry will need to hold nerve in the period ahead with a fixed stockpile release schedule. I would like to emphasise, for example, that it is only with industry support that Wool International will be able to operate with less transparency than the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The question of a fixed or non-fixed schedule release from the stockpile was discussed at length in 1991. On balance, it was the industry view that release be as flexible as possible and out of the hands of government. The reason why the AWIC was set up at that time was to try to demonstrate to the growers and their organisations that there were other stakeholders in the industry who had a lot of knowledge of the industry, and that their ownership of the Australian Wool Corporation was insufficient. While the benefits of a fixed schedule can be overemphasised, I accept the logic of the Wool Industry Review Committee that effective development of forward risk management mechanisms will not occur as long as the flexible debt schedule remains. We have to try to get depth in a futures market. I also accept the reasons for, and logic behind, the phasing in of the fixed release and organisational structure of Wool International. Ownership by producers at the end of the period of the release schedule is also attractive to producers. The target date for privatisation of Wool International is 1 July 1997. For that to be achieved, Wool International must have reduced the stockpile and debt to a level consistent with a viable, commercial business which can operate without a government guarantee. The major analysis on which I based my decision to lower the minimum reserve price to 700c was the simulations and sensitivity analysis provided by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. While no projections are infallible, and most eventuone ally prove wrong through time, they are the very best information one can get. By taking a range of both simulations and sensitivities, what one cannot do becomes clear. In terms of simulating the Gamaut prescription, the status quo and the government's compromise, it is my understanding that this provides the largest overall return to the industry at the end of the stock sell down period. The government has decided to wind up the Australian Wool Corporation and create the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation which will carry out research and development and generic promotion. Functions of the Australian Wool Corporation such as market reporting, quality assurance and shearer training will be transferred over time to other industry organisations. There is sense in having R&D and generic promotion together. The industry always resisted research and development being at arm's length from, but closely linked to, the Australian Wool Corporation. The reason why we previously separated R&D from marketing and the other functions of the AWC was that half R&D funds came from the Australian taxpayer, research and development funds were in effect not being subject to competitive forces, and there was an assumption by regular users of the funds that the funds were available forever. Pet projects of directors became their playthings and there was a disinclination to give up some production directed projects or look to marketing and innovation. In line with the government's view on corporatisation, deregulation and privatisationso beloved by all those concerned unless it applies to them-we made a partial separation, introduced some competition for funds and subjected project approval to wider perspectives. Funding for promotion has to be continued to be supplied and the activities of the IWS need to be constantly scrutinised, monitored and tested. We should not be afraid to promote Australian wool. The new arrangements give even more emphasises to the opportunities that may be available to producers and buyers, particularly in respect of innovation. Hopefully, there should be more pressure on producers to produce and pack uncontaminated wool and to work cooperatively to produce longer lines of wool. The processing and wool textile industry has been moving to Asia gradually and the Australian Wool Corporation and the industry have been adopting a strategic approach, particularly to the development of the Chinese market. The wool initiative, the Australian China agricultural cooperation agreement, ACIAR-the Australian Council for International Agricultural Research-the sale of genetic material, and the constant work put into advising on methods of buying by the Chinese and the lowering of their tariffs, are gradually having their effect. The efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in keeping with this strategiC campaign are to be praised. There are many matters that would and should be touched on. But in 20 minutes, one cannot really encompass all that is in this package of bills or all that is inherent in a debate about an industry that is the backbone of Australian agriculture. This industry has gone through a very turbulent 20 or 30 years and two crises. But, as I have been intent on emphasising, the most important thing about the Garnaut report and the government's response to it is its majority backing by the Australian wool industry, in all its parts, and the way that they have finally realised that here is an industry in which Australia will also have a comparative advantage. We can always maintain our share of world textile markets if we use our heads and do not stop thinking. What the government has done in this instance is to give the industry the chance, by setting up some new structures, to be clearly targeted to a stock run-down, to the market and towards a future which I believe will be bright once we get through this period of industry disability in terms of prices. I believe this will be seen as a very important step in the history of the industry and that the industry will come out of this period in a very strong shape indeed. I commend the bills to the House.",135
198,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"I am pleased to speak on the Wool International Bill and cognate bills. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) comment-I suppose, flatteringlyabout what benefits these bills will bring to the wool industry. I happen to have in front of me a speech he made in this House on 30 May 1991 when he introduced a series of structures in which he said, 'The government has decided on the structures appropriate to take us into the next century'. He is here tonight praising a new set of structures-the third we have had in trying to solve this desperate situation. Mr Crean-At least you are not living in the last century.",139
199,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, seems to have become the instant expert on an industry in which he used to run wool strikes. In fact, he ran an II-week wool strike in 1980Mr Crean-Tell us about the future and not of the past.",139
200,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,He locked up the wool of this country for 11 weeks. Perhaps if he quietened down he might learn something.,139
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Barker will refer his remarks through the chair, and the minister will cease interjecting.",139
202,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Even ministers from the past have the same view as I have about instant experts. This minister believes that he is an expert. The problems that this industry will see in the future are exampled by some, of the problems it has had in the last few years. Those problems are not going to go away in a hurry, or disappear in double-quick time. It is quite disgusting that we have only a few hours to debate, yet again, another guillotined bill-it happened last time; it is the same old stuff-on probably Australia's most important agricultural commodity. In my view, it is also quite disgusting that the minister has not been out in the industry explaining his position. He employed some people to do a job for him and pulled it on holus-bolus. I want to declare my interest in this great industry. The economic textbooks on this industry will be rewritten because all of us w?o have been involved in this industryWith no excuse-abused the floor price scheme and decided to ramp the price with the acquiescence of the government in power at the time. This occurred during the time of the previous minister for primary industries. We went from a floor price of 460c in 1984 to 870c in three years. Mr Crean-Everyone knows you were wrong.",139
203,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,That is right; there is no doubt we were wrong. But the former minister was in charge of the scheme and approved it. Mr Crean-You were running the industry.,140
204,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"No, the minister is wrong. I got out as chainnan of the Australian Wool Council in 1984 when the price was 46Oc. The minister should make sure he is right when he starts to make those sorts of statements. We wrecked the industry by ramping the price-the wool growers, the government and the parliament. It is no good people walking away and coming up here with excuses that they were not involved in it; we were all involved in it if we did not stand up and say that the scheme was wrong. I have said that many times in this place. At the same time, the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was responsible for an interest regime which has probably broken more wool growers than the fall in the reserve price scheme. As I said in this place a couple of years ago, the overproduction in wool, which was caus- by the reserve price scheme, would be felt nght on the price of wool. We introduced the idea, which was taken up by the minister, of a stock slaughter scheme",140
205,Mr CAMPBELL,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,What a disaster that was.,140
206,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,It was not. Let me tell the honourable member what happened,140
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,Mr Newell)Order! The honourable member for Kalgoorlie will cease interjecting.,140
208,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"We got rid of 11 million sheep. We got rid of the next 25 million sheep right on the price of wool. If that scheme had gone ahead in the next three or four months we would not have had the overproduction that this minister was complaining about last April. The minister stood up and said that we had too much production. We do not have it any more because we are now down to 690 million kilograms. We are down to that figure because of one single reason: the price has been so rotten, the seasons have not been too good, and people are moving out of wool. It is quite easy; if we do not put the fertiliser on, we grow fewer sheep.",140
209,Mr CAMPBELL,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,That is two reasons.,140
210,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"1\vo reasons. It is one Western Australian reason. The former minister, the honourable member for Werriwa walked away from that scheme. That was great tragedy because we could have 'sold more wool out of the stockpile at that time. With regard to the financial aspects of this scheme, there are two very good reasons why I have absolutely no conscience about the government picking up whatever debt is left. I might say that there is no reason whatsoever for the wool growers to think that they should not pay the debt off. .In 1984 the government walked away from the lED scheme so that the $6 billion that came into the wool industry for two years in a row was not able to be put aside for hard times, as had been done previously. The government brought the lED scheme back on 1 July 1990, just after those - wo. good years of wool had disappeared, so It picked up the income tax. The second reason is that the reserve price scheme itself topped up the price of wool from what the market price would otherwise have been. The scheme was as follows: money was borrowed from the bank; the growers were paid more than the market price; and the growers 'took the money and paid income tax. My calculation is that somewhere between $500 million and $700 million was paid to the government in grower income tax in two years. The AWC borrowed the money. It paid it to the growers, topped it up, and the net beneficiary was the federal government. Up until now, the government is the only net beneficiary of the last two years of the reserve price scheme. As I have said before, those schemes-the 870c, and subsequently the 700c-were agreed to by this parliament. When we dropped the reserve price in this parliament, with the agreement of both sides, from 870c to 700c, we made a vital mistake because we added to the debt and to the stockpile. That is the point from which we are trying to get back. There were wool processors in this country at that time who said, 'Don't do it. you are going to walk away from the scheme, you have to walk right away from the scheme'. They were right, as it turned out. We could not hold the 700c because the world processing and buying trade did not believe us. Apart from that, we know the problems that were developing in eastern Europe and Russia, and that there was a world recession. There are two main aspects of these bills which I would like to speak about. There are some very positive aspects of the Garnaut report. There is a great desire in the Garnaut report-which led to these bills-to try to create a market in financial instruments. Whether it is in the futures, in options or in wool bonds, one of its main purposes-and I commend the committee for it-is to try to get the commodity insurance market moving. A great drawback, a result of the reserve price scheme, has been that as the reserve price smoothed out the fluctuations in price, as it did for many years, then there is no reason for people to take positions as they can more or less forecast what the price of wool will be. Even if they cannot, futures markets rely on violent fluctuations, or fluctuations in price. I am in favour of those arrangements, including the thrust to create more financial instruments, and getting rid of the number of bodies that were created back in 1990. We on this side of the House-including the shadow minister, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd)-disapproved and said there were too many bodies. It is nice to see that the government has decided to bring them back to a sensible number. There are a couple of matters on which I would like to comment and the first relates to Wool International. I do not believe that Wool International will be much of a problem for the industry for the first two or three years. After that, it probably will not be much of a problem at all because I doubt whether it will last for very long. I cannot imagine any organisation lasting too long when it is expected to profit in the long term by buying wool, placing it around the world, and getting that placement right. I do not believe that the If old concept we had of holding a stock of wool in a permanent sense has any merit whatsoever. It has been looked at many times before and the problem with it is that, if we want to hold a permanent barrier or stockpile of wool, whether it be one million or two million bales, against market fluctuations, at some point at least some of it has to be sold and then bought back. The fact of the matter is that we could never have that theoretically permanent barrier that people talk aoout. I believe that Wool International will have its time. It will run for a while but in the end its purposes could well have been perpetrated in earlier times by other firms had those same purposes had greater financial merit. After all, as it will be a corporation bent on earning profits, other people could have done that just as well years ago. And since that could have been perpetrated just as well in the past, one might well ask why it was not done. The fact is that the Wool Corporation did carry out some aspects of this plan and placed wool around the world. One of the problems it found was that it sometimes had it in the wrong place. I imagine that that is a human failing which we may well see repeated in the the future. So I have not worried too much about Wool International because I think it will solve itself. There has been much discl 1!'lsion about fixed release of the stockpile, ale,:mgh not nearly as much as there should have been because of the time limits that have been imposed on this whole matter. Presumably because the minister for primary industries has to go to Europe, these bills came into this place last Thursday night with almost indecent haste. Discussion prior to that had been on the Garnaut report. All of a sudden, one week later, we are debating, finalising and voting on these bills. . I have attended meetings with growers around the country and I have found that they know almost nothing about the proposals in the Garnaut report. What they are worried about is the inflexibility in the stock release system. I know that members of the government will stand up here, as the honourable member for Werriwa just did, and say what a wonderful scheme it is. The honourable member said exactly the same thing ab()ut the previous scheme. I want to make one particular comment about it, and I think Mr Garnaut himself would agree with it. In Argentina, wool supply is down from 200 million kilograms to 90 million; in South Africa, it is down from 100 million kilograms to 65 million; in Australia, it is down from 1,000 million kilograms to 690 million. If it is true that the supply of wool has come down to that extent, and we can therefore implement a fixed release scheme after 1 July 1994, as suggested and indeed required by these bills-if that is a reasonable proposition, it is also reasonable to suggest that wool was going to go out of stockpile in any case. That would appear to be totally logical. My guess is that we will see wool go out of stockpile at some later stage of this financial year. As Mr Garnaut said, as recently as yesterday, the fixed release scheme is based on the fact that the current annual production around the world is down to the point where a fixed release has a chance to work. If there is a shortcoming in this scheme it is that, if the price of wool really starts to move up, there is no facility to sell into a rising price market. What really worries me is that half the wool stockpile will still be there in four years from 1 July this year. I understand the purpose of the fixed release scheme is to bring out part of the stockpile, sell it and make it part of current production. Buyers will then know more or less what is coming onto the market and that will enable the financial instruments to commence operation. My own guess is that the sooner we get down to half the current stockpile-that is, under two million bales; a psychologically correct amount because we have gotten rid of that number of bales three times since the war-then the quicker all those financial markets will start to work and the quicker the buying and processing trade around the world will start to operate in a free market sense. We have not been able to obtain any figures on what would have happened had this fixed release scheme been brough- into operation in the last couple of years. One could bet, however, that it would not have been too good. I have requested through the Freedom of Information Act some information from ABARE. Three weeks ago I asked for access to all the information and advice generated by ABARE in the course of its assessment of the Garnaut report. The minister, who has just left the table, by one means or another has contrived to produce not a single page. Mr Ronaldson-Not one bit?",140
211,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Not a single, solitary page. Not all of it could be secret. This information used to come out of ABARE for everyone to look at-wool growers, parliamentarians-and I cannot for the life of me think of one reason why this information should be so secret. Why would someone lock it up? What is in the information-the drafts, the models that go to cabinet-that is so secret that the rest of the industry should not have access to it in order to make a decision? Why should the opposition not see the work that a government instrumentality does before it makes a decision? Mr Ronaldson-It begs the question.",142
212,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,One would have to ask why that information is locked up. I have no idea what the government is hiding. Nobody knows.,142
213,Mr CAMPBELL,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,I am sure if you had asked you would have found out.,142
214,Mr MCLACHLAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Perhaps the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has seen the information. I have asked under the Freedom of Information Act. I have rung eight times and it is always 'coming tomorrow', but there is always some little drawback. Either the PM&C will not let it out, or the Attorney General's Department will not release it. We have rung eight times since 10 September 1993, the last time being this morning, to ask for this information but it has been held up by. the man who was sitting at this table not so long ago, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It would not be a bad idea if the honourable member asked him for it; he might learn something too. As sure as we are all standing here, the industry is not aware of that information because it has been locked away. Like everything else, we are into phase 3 of the tragic saga of the wool industry. I can only conclude my temarks by saying that the sooner we can get down to a figure of 1.6 million or 1.7 million bales in the stockpile, the greater will be the move to a normal market again because that psychological barrier will have been broken. I only hope that in the end this government does· not become so rigid in the release of the stockpile that if some new use or even some new geographical area opens up, that is not taken into account in the amount of wool that is released. (Time expired)·",142
215,Mr CAMPBELL,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION," I will not speak for long on the Wool International Bill and cognate bills due to time pressures, but I just want to get on the record that we have had a catastrophe in the wool industry and are slowly working our way out of it. It should be clearly understood by the people of Australia that this catastrophe was not just the fault of wool growers. In many cases they are innocent parties. I agree with one of the things the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) said, that there is no doubt that the government and opposition bear a large share of that blame. There is no doubt that when the previous Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), went to Roma the figures available from ABARE indicated that the price had turned. He allowed the Australian Wool Corporation to put the price to 850c when it was clear that the price was on the way down. We should bear in mind, however, that some people in the Wool Corporation wanted to put it at l000c. The minister told me at the time that he had given autonomy to the Australian Wool Council and did not want to rescind its first decision, although he kn'!w it was wrong. I believe that the minister should have clearly dissociated himself from that decision. That he did not says something about the loyalty of the former minister-probably loyalty to a fault. I want to put it very clearly on the record that I believe the problems of the wool industry should have been borne by the whole of Australia-everyone was involved. I want to praise the former minister because he has shown an enormous amount of courage. There is no doubt that the implementation of the Garnaut report will depend virtually entirely on the quality of people appointed to that board. It is clearly in the court of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) as to who those people will be. If it fails, the minister understands he will have to wear it. If he is silly enough-I am sure he will not be-to allow onto these boards the recycled people from the Wool Corporation who were there in the past, we are doomed. If this thing is to work at all, it will be management alone that drives it. I am no great fan of Garnaut. Very few people have wreaked the damage on this economy that he and his doctrine of the north-east Asian ascendancy and the level playing field have done. The minister has removed the excesses of Garnaut in this legislation, principally by limiting the ability of Wool International to trade while it is a government entity. When it ceases to be a government entity, it will be governed by the fact that it can go broke. If it does not perform, it will fail and that, undoubtedly, will be a good thing. I believe that the 4'/2 per cent tax on growers is an enormous impost. It is a front-end tax on their income. I would not like a 4'/2 per cent reduction in my take-home pay-nor would my bank manager. This is a very substantial tax. The sooner it can be lifted the better. The honourable member for Barker, in his rather churlish speech-i am sure he will not mind my saying that-seemed to be trying to have it both ways. He lambasts the proposal and talks about the dangers of having a fixed release from the stockpile. He also talked about the need to develop an indepth futures and options market. There is no doubt that we do need depth in that market. But there cannot be depth if there is any uncertainty about releasing the stockpile. That is simply fundamental. Mr MCLachlan-You can't get into the stockpile.",143
216,Mr CAMPBELL,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"We cannot at the moment. It is important to get that depth into the market first. I have the view that while there is a stockpile it will be hard to do that. We certainly cannot do it if we go down the opposition road of indiscriminate releases. Let us look at the consequences. If there is a sudden demand for wool and we are limited to a set release from the stockpile, what will happen? The price of wool will rise. Would that be such a bad thing for growers? Many growers need to get some meat back on their bones. The concept of the need for security and stability has been, around for many years. There is some truth in this. But growers need stability of income, not stability of price. The way to get stability of income is through the futures mechanisms. I concede that those opposite have a very valid point on the IEDs. This minister fought tenaciously against a lot of opposition to get the IEDs reduced. They were taken off initially because they were so rortable. That is what made them vulnerable. He fought to get them back in. Those opposite ought to have enough decency to give the minister credit for that, because the IEDs are very valuable tools for farmers. We need very little in the way of research and development. I am very sceptical about what marketing we need. I do not believe in the generic promotion of wool. I believe that Australian wool is unique and this is what we should have been promoting all the time-not just Australian wool but wool from localised areas, because some of our wool is better for some things than others; some wool is extremely rough. This is· the problem in America. It has the view that wool is a prickly, unfriendly fibre. This has hindered every effort to get our wool into potentially the largest wool fibre market. Had we concentrated on Australian wool promotion, we would have been much better off. This was brought home to me in China when I was in a store that sold to Chinese people. I was looking for mchair, but the store had very high quality woollen jumpers made in mills on the Scottish-English border. I said to the girl, who spoke excellent English, 'This would be all-Australian wool?'. She said, 'No, we use only the best British wool'. She produced the garment for me and it was clearly labelled, 'Best Botany Wool, Made in England'. Those mills were selling on quality and they did not use the woolmark. If we asked them why they did not use the woolmark, they would say that woolmark goes on some awful rubbish. One of the things we should be using research and development funds for is education of growers. Growers have been kept totally ignorant of their industry. The average wheat grower or cotton grower has always known more about his industry than the average wool grower. Wool growers have been fed nonsense by the Wool Corporation, which they have paid for. It cannot be said too often that what the Wool Corporation did to this nation is at least two Alan Bonds worth of damage. Unfortunately, retribution will catch up with Alan Bond. But we are likely to find that the clowns in the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council will get the Order of Australia. That is usually the way of things. What happens to Wool International does not matter. If the scheme works as planned and it is privatised, it will be good to have another body out in the market. But the wool industry has been changed irrevocably by what has happened recently. We will see new ideas and innovations in this industry which no-one will be able to stop. We will see a spread of informa'tion to growers; there will never be the same level of ignorance. When one sees the ignorance out there-most of it funded by the Wool Corporation-one can understand why the National Party got so much support from them. Developments will change marketing for the future and for the better. Australia will be a very large producer of tops, the premier top producing nation in the world. Japan, Europe and China will come here for wool tops. It will make wool the most valuable export commodity we have. It will return wool to its position as our biggest export earner. Wool is already our most important industry because it is our most diversified. The wool industry is the biggest small business in Australia. We are going to see employment increase in country areas due to advances in processing wool. This will increase the voting power of wool. I am very pleased to see it and I hope that this new voting power will be more educated than it has been in the past.",144
217,Mr COBB,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"I would like to start off my contribution to this debate tonight on the Wool International Bill and cognate bills by offering a few bouquets. The first one goes to Professor Ross Garnaut, Stephen Bennett and Rod Price for doing a mighty job in a short period. It was a very wide ranging inquiry which, under difficult circumstances, came up with a pretty fair recommendation. I think the only regrettable part is that, since the wool legislation was brought into the parliament late last week, we have had virtually no time to study such an important piece of legislation because I hear that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) wants to get it through before he goes overseas. It would have been far preferable to have had another couple of weeks to study this legislation in detail. I think the wool growers themselves deserve at least a month or two to look at it. Anyhow, that is the situation. I also give a bouquet to the fanners organisations around Australia which have spoken, rightly or wrongly, with one voice on this issue. I think that is a step in the right direction. I know that in my neck of the woods the New South Wales Fanners Association, led by John Crawford, has been very definite and vocal on this issue. It has the unanimous support of the Wool Council of Australia. I give one bouquet to the minister. He did not fiddle with the proposals that were put before him. He may have been tempted, but it is to his credit that he did not do that. I give him a brickbat, though, for guillotining the debate tonight. Something as important as this legislation, which was brought on so quickly, should have been allocated more time to enable people to discuss these vital issues. I particularly want to give a bouquet to the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who virtually ended up doing the work of the minister. I think he held 23 major meetings around Australia, plus numerous other smaller ones. He did an absolutely herculean job and no praise is too great for what he did in trying to explain the Garnaut report to growers and ascertain their opinions. All wool growers owe a debt to the shadow minister for what he has done over the last month. There are a lot of critics of the Garnaut report, as we would expect. We are all critics to some extent. I have been quite concerned about the level of sales-four years down the track and we still have almost half the stockpile. I have also been concerned about what the precise activities of Wool International will be, and I confess that I have not had the time to study it so as to make up my mind. Some critics have rejected most of the Garnaut report, although I find, from talking to most of these people, that they usually fall into vested interest categories. They usually put up no alternative and, if they do, it is usually very thin in detail; or they may have disregarded some critical factor, such as the debt repayment schedule. I notice that the wool exporters, in particular, fall into the category of wanting to have the Wool Realisation Commission stay as it is. I will explain in a minute why that cannot be. The wool industry, as we know, is in a parlous state at this stage, even though the outlook may be good. As a member who represents 40 per cent of New South Wales, and nearly all the western division of New South Wales, I am only too aware of that fact. Many of my wool growers live in very remote areas. They have no choice but to derive an income from wool. Considering that less than 18 per cent of the wool growers of Australia produce more than 100 bales, there must be a fair slab of those growers in my electorate. We are in the position today where we have 3.9 million bales in the stockpile, which is down from 41/2 million bales two years ago. If we think back to the time of the reserve price scheme, we will remember that there were only four years-between 1974-75 and 1976-77-when the stockpile exceeded one million bales. We had 1.6 million bales, 1.3 million bales and 1.1 million bales respectively in the stockpile. For a brief period in 84, the stockpile got up to 1.2 million bales. The amount we now have is historically high. We also have a $2.2 billion debt, which is down from $2.9 billion two years ago. When we consider these factors, we realise that the magnitude of the problem is so great that, whichever way we try to solve it, the news at the end of the day will have a considerable downside. I guess it is a matter of picking the least worse case scenario, and we have to remember that. If this legislation does not go through, this is what will be hanging over our heads: under the debt repayment schedule, growers will have to pay back $400 million next year, rising to $500 million the year after, and then going up to $550 million for each year until it is paid off. On top of that, next year they will have holding costs-intra-storage, handling and other costs-of about $200 million. That is a total of $600 million that the growers will have to find next year. At the moment, wool is making only about $500 a greasy bale, which means that wool growers will have to sell 1.2 million bales to meet dollar debt schedule. The buyers know that and, as the time ticks on to 1 July next year, they will start to hold back, uncertainty will rise in the marketplace and we will probably, because of a falling price, have to sell considerably more bales than we anticipated. If we did not sell any bales, the alternative would be to shove the debt repayment tax component alone up to 24 per cent, which would be absolutely intolerable. I think Garnaut's recommendation that the debt repayment schedule, as structured by this government, be abandoned is the No. 1 recommendation that we should all embrace. To those who are putting up alternatives to Garnaut, I say again that, before they do so they should study this point very closely because they cannot move anywhere until this point has been addressed. Last year we produced and sold 820 kilotonnes of wool-that is about 4.7 million bales. This coming year we will be producing about 690 kilotonnes of wool-and that amount is falling-which is about four million bales. The amount we got rid of last 1983year was moderately above the historic average. Back in 1989-90, we produced 1,030 kilotonnes, which is about 5.9 million bales. So the difference between what we are expecting to produce next year and what we sold last year is about 130kilotonnes of wool, and that gives us somewhere to move. The Garnaut requirements have brought down a recommended schedule. I am the first to admit that, if this wool stockpile and debt were privately owned, we would probably handle things much differently. We would probably get rid of it a lot quicker-I would if I were in that situation. However, the wool stockpile is publicly owned and we are restricted in the ways we can move. Garnaut says, and it is in the legislation, that next year, 1993-94, for six months we should sell an average of 28,400 bales a month-plus or minus five per cent tolerance-which will amount to 170,400 bales. Then for the next six months that will step up to an average of 46,750 bales a month, which will amount to 280,500 bales in that sixmonth period. That gives a total for the 12 that months of 450,900 bales, which is something just shy of 80 kilotonnes of wool. If we add the 80 kilotonnes to the 690 kilotonnes that growers will be producing in new shorn wool, that comes to only 770 kilotonnes of woolor 50 kilotonnes less than we sold last year. So we will not be flooding the market with wool, and I think that is a very critical point. For the next three years, 1994-95 to 199697 when this arrangement cuts out, we will be required to sell 46,750 bales a month for the 12 months of each of those years. That is 561,000 bales a year, or something just short of 100 kilotonnes of wool. When we add this amount to the 690 kilotonnes, it comes to a total of 790 kilotoones of wool. I think Garnaut has pitched those levels very cleverly indeed. We will have to off-load something like 4.4 million to 4.5 million bales a year. I know some people are concerned-I have some cqncerns myself-about what will happen if demand suddenly takes off, as is quite possible, and we do not have enough wool to meet the market. The first thing that will happen is the price will be driven higher. Some people are concerned that it will drive the price through the roof, the ratio of the price of wool to other textiles, such as synthetics and cotton, will get out of kilter again and we will lose more market share. I. do not think it will happen to that extent, but I remind those people who have that concern that since 1950 for more than 50 per cent of the time we have sold less wool than we are proposing to sell over the next four years, and the world has lived with that. Of course, if the price rises, that sends an immediate signal to the growers to start producing more. We have learnt that, despite the lag periods in the industry, growers can respond very smartly, short of a national drought. We have masked these sorts of signals, and we are still doing that at present. If the price starts creeping up, wool starts coming out of the stockpile onto the market. This creates uncertainty and the price usually stagnates. I believe the buyers will be better off under the proposed system because they will know exactly how much wool will be coming out of the stockpile, they will have a very good idea of how much wool will be coming out of production and they can factor this in. Therefore, I think, despite the pleas of some, they will actually be in a better position. The stockpile overhangs the market and we must start to get rid of it for many reasons including, of course, to pay off the debt. While we have such a vast stockpile, we have this glut mentality. It psychologically depresses the market. Buyers will not fill their pipeline to the extent that they should. It is a very comfortable arrangement for the buyers because they know that if they are short at any time they can go to the stockpile and top up. There is a constant uncertainty about the market. Buyers would be foolish to top up because if the market slumped they would be caught with expensive wool vis-a-vis their competitors in the industry, so they do not do that. As I have said, every time the market rises, wool comes out of the stockpile and it dampens the price rise. Buyers are never sure how much will come out of the stockpile. That is why it dampens the price rise to the extent that it does. The existence of the stockpile and the previous reserve price scheme killed off almost entirely risk management systems across the world as far as wool was concerned. We have had virtually no future trading at all. If we can get to a situation where risk management mechanisms come into place, speculative investment will come into the industry. I welcome this because the wool industry desperately needs that money to be invested in it. That is a point not to be overlooked. Some people would shy away from speculative money coming into the wool industry. I take the opposite point of view and say that it is desperately needed to get a healthy wool industry going. While the stockpile sits there it is chewing up growers' money because it costs around $60 per bale per year to store. That runs into something over $200 million, which in itself is equivalent to an eight per cent tax on growers. They cannot keep that up forever. At the moment growers are wearing the costs of holding all the stocks, and at the same time are taking all the risks in the wool industry. That should be spread throughout all sectors of the industry-buyers, processors and growers. On top of that, the stockpile is deteriorating to a small extent. That will be an increasing concern, the longer it stays there. As I said earlier, while ever it is there we are killing market signals. Until we get a price rise, growers will continue to produce less wool and, to an extent, will transfer out of the industry. If we do not get reward for effort, we will go back to the old boom-bust days: when supply runs out, prices go up, people tum off wool and then production falls as the price comes down, and so on. We have been through that so much in recent times. I am pleased to see that this bill puts down a proper program to address reducing the size of the stockpile. There are, of course, many avoidable costs in the industry that, unfortunately, we do not have much time to discuss. The minister-he is not here at the moment but he was here at the beginning of the debate-is always talking about value adding. The best thing he can do for value adding in this country is to clean out the industrial relations system. Mr Braithwaite-That will get the value adding going.",145
218,Mr COBB,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"I acknowledge the comment of the honourable member for Dawson: that will get value adding going more than anything else. I would like to see the minister work more on getting tariffs and protection down. They are restricting trade, which means less wool is consumed around the world and there are lower prices for growers. Protection costs on textiles are higher than for any other sector in the manufacturing industry, and protection costs on wool are higher than on any other sector in the textile industry. They usually increase as we move up the processing scale from greasy wool, through to tops and yam, fabrics and garments. The multifibre arrangement, which 54 countries abide by, affects anything between 25 and 75 per cent of exports of countries. We have to get this into the GAIT negotiations, wind it down and get rid of it. One study showed that the removal of the USA apparel protection of tariffs and quotas would benefit Australian growers by $450 million. The United States, which is only a small purchaser of wool compared with some countries, pays subsidies of between $4 and $6 a kilogram to producers and it caps the payments to each producer at $USI50,OOO. That is the sort of silly nonsense it goes on with. Of course, apart from all that, tariffs farm imports into this country, mainly on agricultural and veterinary chemicals, are affecting our producers. That amounts to another $39 million impost on our wool growers that they cannot afford. I would like to see this government wind back wholesale sales tax. We were going to get rid of it entirely. That puts an impost on our farming community",148
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,Mr Newell)Order! The honourable member f-r Parkes might bring his comments back to the bill.,148
220,Mr COBB,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"This was in the Gamaut report. That puts a $200 million impost on our farmers, which works out at $1,600 per farm per year. Gamaut says quite clearly that that should be addressed. What has the government done in the budget? It has added approximately 10 per cent to those costs. Gamaut also talks about getting shearing costs in the industry down to make growers in this country more viable. New Zealand can shear its sheep for about a third less than in Australia. If we had the industrial relations system that New Zealand has, we would save our growers about $100 million. With oncosts, superannuation, workers compensation, et cetera, it costs us about $1.68 just to shear a sheep and 62c to crutch a sheep. In New Zealand, before the on-costs, which are less than ours, it costs about 60c to shear a sheep and about 30c to crutch a sheep. There is room for movement in that direction. We could do other things, such as use modem presses to get our bale rates up from, on average, 175 kilograms to something like 204 kilograms. That would reduce our costs a little. The government could be doing much more about waterfront costs. Australia's waterfront costs are 25 per cent higher than New Zealand's. That runs into a several million dollar impost on our wool industry. In conclusion, after close examination, the coalition supports the recommendations in the legislation going through tonight, but we all have certain doubts and what-ifs. For example, what if demand and price go up? Should we put a trigger in place? What if Russia wants an extra million bales? I think we can on address these things if and when they arise. I do not think they are particularly likely to arise. We can be sure of one thing: some of these predictions in the legislation will go totally awry, but we are saddled with a massive debt and we must do something. The present scheme, if it continues, is within 12 months of disaster. The Gamaut proposals, imperfect as they may be, have offered us an improvement on that. Wool does have a positive future-possibly in the short term but almost certainly in the medium and long term-and I am delighted to see the great majority of the industry behind what is being proposed here tonight.",148
221,Mr HORNE,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"I rise to support the Wool International Bill and cognate bills and the foreshadowed amendments. I would like to preface my statement by saying that in my opinion this is not only a positive response to a disastrous situation but also one that is long overdue. In retrospect, we can see the danger of any producer organisation setting the reserve price of its own commodity. The high reserve prices of wool have caused buyer resistance and uncompetitive practices by growers and past marketing practices have encouraged the expansion of the use of fibres other than wool, which is what the wool industry wanted to prevent. That is behind· us; that is history. This group of bills is about making wool more competitive again. I am pleaSed to see that we do have the support of the opposition. Essentially, it is a statement by this government of its support for a great industry. The Wool International Bill is a common sense bill. It provides the blueprint for combining four statutory organisations of the wool industry into one-the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Wool International will market the stockpile and develop management and marketing strategies. The important factor about Wool International is the manner in which it will be developed and ultimately privati sed. But Wool International must develop into a completely commercial organisation that will survive on its own merits. The wool industry has to accept the ultimate responsibility for its own I have already mentioned how wool has to become a competitive fibre. It is no use w()rrying about onkaparinga or physician blankets in a world that wants doonas. It is no good producing a fibre that the world does not want to buy. The demand for wool will grow only when we can show that it is the best fibre for the job. The quality will be measured by the buyer and not by the vendor. I have full faith in the ingenuity of Australian research and development and there is no doubt that we will find new uses for wool. That is already happening. The blending of wool and cotton and wool and synthetic fibres has been accepted by the fabric industry for years. The existence of knitting and weaving mills that are capable of using dual fibres is commonplace in the world today. The conditions necessary for these dual purpose mills to function is the diameter and the length of the staple of the fibre they are working with. I understand that there has been a continuous market during the depressed price for wool that is capable, of being processed by the same machinery that processes cotton. This is a further indication that the buyer is the driving force in the modem economic world. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), started his speech this evening by saying that wool would stay in the doldrums until world markets were prepared to buy more wool and pay more for it. That is pretty obvious. It is no good the wool industry sitting back and saying, 'We have the best wool in the world. Come and buy it'. We need to be thoroughly proactive and aggressive in convincing the world that our fibre is the best for whatever purpose it is to be used for and that it is commercially viable. I have already indicated that I support the legislation. At this point I would like to digress and refer to the Garnaut report which has engendered much of the legislation. The intention of that report is to make the wool industry more commercial, and part of that commercial activity is to value add to .Our wool output. I appreciate that there is currently an excess of wool scouring and tops making facilities in the world-I agree with the destiny. honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) that Australia has a bright future'·in this area-but much of it is ageing and does not meet the exacting environmental standards of today. It seems quite unreasonable to me that there is a world trade in pharmaceutical grade lanolill-a very valuable by-product derived from Australian wool-and that Australia does not participate in it at all. It is a that is grown here and we have nothing to do with it because it is taken from the wool after it leaves our country. Another by-product of a non-aqueous or solvent scouring plant is low grade nitrogen and phosphorous fertilisers which are very environmentally friendly. These are the sorts of practices that a wool industry in the future must address. I am also concerned about wool storage facilities and their location. The facility at Yennora in Sydney currently holds about 15 per cent of our stockpile. I must question the feasibility of storing wool in the geographic centre of our largest and most congested city with its associated highest real estate prices and rental and transport costs. Wool stored at Yennora cannot be included in value adding because Yennora is at the end of the line-the last stop before being shipped out of the country. It makes little sense to ship it back to the west to process and I am sure it will never be processed in the Sydney metropolitan area. It is a point of interest to me because there is currently a consortium seeking to establish a storage facility in my electorate at Maitland, adjacent to the New England highway and the main northern railway and with excellent access to the port of Newcastle. I know that members of this' consortium have met with the staff of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and that they have done their homework. They have seen a window of opportunity, they are prepared to invest in the order of $200 million and they will provide a competitive service. Proposals such as these will allow our industry to become more competitive, but it can do so ()nly if the participators in the industry are prepared to accept new rules and new players. I am aware that other members wish to ,,,contribute to the debate this evening and I will conclude. I am pleased to have participated in a debate that has been supported by both sides of the House and has been proposed after a very thorough report. There are great hopes riding on this legislation. No-one underestimates the contribution that wool has made to the development of our country-$6 billion alone in 1988-89. Let us hope that it product will return to that sort of export earning again. I believe that this legislation has achieved consensus and will deliver, but this Hme we will be marketing the fibre the markets want to buy, not demanding that buyers purchase the wool that we produce. There is a vast difference.",149
222,Mr TUCKEY,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"I stand with some enthusiasm to support the basic fundamentals of the Wool International Bill and cognate bills. If honourable members went back through the Hansard, as this debate has surfaced time and time again, they would find me saying, right at the beginning, that I had substantial doubts about the means by which the stockpile of wool was to be disposed of. I have always advocated that the only means by which we could successfully recreate a market in this outstanding commodity is to identify and catalogue the stockpile for disposal to a fixed schedule. Whilst this particular legislation goes most of the way to fulfilling that proposal by suggesting fixed quantities of wool in kilograms that must be put on the market from time to time, I believe that we should have gone the whole way, put out a catalogue and let the trade know exactly when every bale was to be sold. I am not yet convinced that we will be trusted with this arrangement. The position needs to be fixed because the trade has lacked confidence for a long time now. There cannot be a market while people are second-guessing politicians. The market has been more of a lottery than a proper market. It is interesting to read the concerns of some people, and I can understand why they are concerned. At this point I must declare an interest as a wool grower, Mr Deputy Speaker. These people are concerned that wool prices might get too high. Whilst I understand their reasoning, I hope I am so lucky; I think it will be a while before we see that. I repeat: we are dealing here with the known stockpile that is already in store. We are not dealing with a stockpile that exists in many shearing sheds around Australia today. I do not know what it is-I am not sure that anybody does-but I know of places in my electorate where substantial qualities of wool have been held over by fanners of long standing in the industry. Those fanrters have turned to alternatives such as wheat growing. They have literally said, - At this price if I do not sell the wool, it can. stay where it is; I won't even pay the freight to town'. So that substantial wool stockpile will find its way onto the market as soon as there is any escalation in the price. This legislation will ensure that the wool stockpile is·unquestionably sold at· whatever price it brings. That might frighten people. The concern is: how low might the price go? As far as I am concerned, the only solution for this industry is to get rid of the stockpile and we have to take the available price. I hold the view that the price obtained will be better than some believe. Once the industry realises that it has to take the market as it is, and carry its own stocks, the industry will bid for wool because it knows that, if it miscalculates a little, it will not get it from the stockpile. I trust that this time the industry will have confidence that we will not make other changes in the future and, consequently, it will buy with confidence in its own judgment. Hopefully, we will see the development of hedging type markets where people can protect their investment. But such markets were not prepared to bet against the decision making of politicians. The simple fact is that, for the first time since we have had the tragedy of the wool stockpile, we see a solution which comes back to simple arithmetic. There is some wool there and it has to be sold. The figures provided by Professor Garnaut suggest that in most years the amount of wool that will go onto the market-together with new production-will generally be a little less than what has been sold recently. So we will not actually flood the market with this stockpile, but we do have a plan to get rid of it. I have never seen any other solution. I have argued for it since day one. At times I have argued for it in my electorate when people did not welcome my thoughts on the matter. I am sure it is the solution. Interestingly; there downside to this legislation. It does not provide for a continued government contribution to wool promotion, and that is a bit disappointing. I know that people get carried away with other aspects of our export potential. The government, quite proudly-and I have no objection-put some $100 million forward as being necessary to assist in the promotion of certain manufacturers that will never produce the sorts of import or export income that Australia wants, but which wool would produce. The government is rushing off into some new, green area to give some money for some unknown returns. A lot of this money is going to very large companies. We are told that they are small companies but, when we look further into their backgrounds, we find they are small companies, but subsidiaries of very large companies, including Telecom. Those companies have been identified in that report that suggests that small business has this wonderful future in export markets and in manufacturing. While the government is proposing to put forward some $100 million in that area, why can it not at least continue this contribution of $20 million to promote wool, the product that has stood us in good stead for all these decades-nearly centuries? Wool has been a major contributor and will continue as such. We have to promote the product. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home) mentioned that the doona had taken over from the wool blanket. I suggested and introduced national wool day, which was first undertaken in this parliament, simply because I discovered the best doona in the world-a woollen one, using technology developed by the CSIRO. I sleep under a wool doona every time. I return to Perth. I can recommend it. It is no dearer than a high quality feather doona. The difference is that, because the wool is done in a sort of carding bat, it can he stitched into the doona so that the contents do not end up at the end of the bed and leave the sleeper freezing. I hope many more honourable members in this place will demonstrate their genuine commitment by buying woollen doonas. We talk about export potential. Here is a is a value added product. As part of national wool day, we visited the manufacturer of that particular doona and said, 'We read that the Japanese buy 10 million doonas a year. How many are you selling?'. The manufacturer replied, 'Our problem is that when we get the doonas there and put them through the Japanese wholesale system, the price is doubled. The doona costs $500 in Japan and $200 in Australia'. The air freight component would probably be less than $5. It raises the question of where this government should be looking when it talks about being market orientated. Perhaps we should put in some shops, or whatever, at the retail level in some of these countries that have these peculiar wholesaling structures so that some of these products can be put in there directly on consignment. Let the government meet some of the costs of running the stores. We could demonstrate to these people the real product at the real price and, over time, have people knocking on our doors to take over the retailing of these products. We have to do these sorts of things to address existing problems. We are not prevented from entering Japan with these products; there are no substantial tariffs that make a difference. It is a fact that country has a marketing system that makes these products so expensive that we cannot afford to sell them. The same thing should be happening with our meat and other products., We should go into demonstrate to the Japanese the real price of these products, and over time their own retailers will want to handle them, otherwise they would lose business. These are the sorts of things that are of great, importance. The honourable member Paterson also spoke about value adding. I support the concept of value adding but it has to be done at competitive rates. We cannot force our own industry into the ground because we want to add some value and some jobs in another sector of that industry. We have to remember firstly that many countries buy our raw materials simply to give work to their own people. If we tell them they cannot have the work, they probably will not buy the material at all. If we cannot do things in Australia as efficiently as other competing countries, we are reducing the competitiveness of the raw product, and that cannot be allowed to happen. In that regard, I am deeply concerned that the government is contemplating these new labour measures which, to my mind, will add nothing to the competitiveness of these products and could put a lot of farmers out of work, as well as a lot of other people who might have the opportunity to enter these areas and achieve these sorts of situations. It is not as easy as some people think when they look at our raw production and they tell our farmers that they should look at value adding. Sometimes I am surprised to see many of the farmers I represent running around saying, 'If we only value added, we wo-dd get more money'. They will only get more money if shareholders express an interest in that value adding and if that value adding is efficient and competitive. We are not doing much for the competitiveness of wool against other fibres by adding 5c a litre to the cost of fuel. Surprisingly, it was not that long ago that Elders or the Australian Wool Corporation put out a pictorial table of what it costs to sell a bale of wool. I think it that was something like $250 by the time all the various marketing costs were gone through. I wrote to that organisation asking where the government's share was indicated. That table had shown what the shearer got, the cost of transport, the cost of dumping and the cost of commission, but it did not show the government's share of the extra 31c a litre on diesel. That adds about $30,000 to the price of a truck that carts the sheep that carts the wool. The government is imposing all of these costs on an industry that is suffering through drought, international depression and international competition. It has always astounded me that in this country we can tax transport at three times the rate we tax other industries. It is just so plainly silly because we are such a large nation and we rely so heavily on transport in many ways. The wool industry has been the victim of this problem, both on the way in and on the way out. I do not know how long it will be before the honourable member for Paterson, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and these other people go to their government and say, 'Let's think this thing through again'. Why would the government tax transport at three times the rate that it taxes other industries within Australia, when this country is so reliant upon transport? I am told that the New South Wales rail system will pay $9 million a year in additional fuel taxes as a result of this budget. That will be a great help to the wool industry. That will increase the ability of these scouring works that are being funded in regional New South Wales. Their competitiveness will be substantially reduced. I cannot understand how a government can make the claims this government has made. It has people running around the countryside in these great wool-growing areas talking about regional development, yet it is taxing rural people an extra 5c, $200 a semitrailer, a week. It just does not make sense. It is foolish. It does not help the economy. The best way to help the economy and to reduce the budget deficit is to increase the productivity and profitability of our country. I come back to my specific concerns about this proposal-that is, that this legislation never brought back into the parliament again. We have to know, and we have to make sure that the industry knows, that this is the final decision. It is the correct decision. It was always the correct decision to dispose of the stockpile by a quantity of wool, not by all of the other mechanisms that have been put up from time to time, and not by trying to second-guess the market. I think that those who survive-and I am deeply concerned for those who have huge problems today-will find that Australia has become a more efficient producer of wool. Many growers are quite wisely using this downturn to upgrade their flocks. They have sold off their second-rate sheep. When they come back into the market, we will have a much better system. I am hoping that the RAS arrangements and so on will not be used so much to get people off their properties as to help them stay there wherever that is even reasonably practical. Farmers will work hard to recover their circumstances. This is an excellent situation. The detail relative to Wool Australia, or whatever we will call this company, is yet to be decided; it is not part of this legislation. I know there will be great interest in some of the specifics of that. I hope that the government, as has been suggested, makes it a very private company. In other words, we do not want another Wool Corporation or something of that nature; people should be able to sell on the market they choose. If there is a private company that wool growers seek to own, as this one may develop into, I have no problems. But that is for a further debate.",150
223,Mr ADAMS,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Like the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) I too hope that the work being done on some farms, improving their flocks and so on, will bear fruit in the long term. I congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for getting on top of the problems that exist in our wool industry very quickly. These bills, the Wool International Bill and cognate bills, seek to establish a new institutionalised structure and marketing arrangements for the wool industry. They include the development of corporate plans is and the fixed schedule for the disposal of the stockpile. The rest of the legislation deals with the structure of Wool Internationalmembers, audits, finance, taxation, the nuts and bolts of setting up the organisation. The area that I am interested in is the opportunity that this gives Australia for a new focus on wool and our wool industry. It makes it more commercial and looks at new ways of marketing our wool. It will give a lot of people new opportunities in product development, new ideas in marketing, and develop a more local and regional strategy for wool and a more local focus on the region where that wool comes from. This is the direction in which we have to go. We can do so with these new endeavours. It is the old commodity versus product argument. We have to sell products. We have to get to where we are influencing where those products are recognised as coming from. There are people who will take this new approach to marketing wool with greater success than possibly there has been in the past. I was recently in the Ansett lounge at Melbourne airport. I see that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) is in the chamber. He was with me at the time. There was an Australian suit being marketed as Merino Gold. Mr Hawker-It was from my electorate.",153
224,Mr ADAMS,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"The honourable member informed me that it was from his electorate. That sort of product, from a local area being sold and marketed as Australian wool, is the direction in which we sQould go. I congratulate that group and wish it well in the venture. I could hark back to my maiden speech where I pointed out that I· believed we were well behind other countries in our marketing strategies for selling wool in a localised manner. I am concerned when I see Tasmanian fishing crews not wearing woollen jumpers made from Tasmanian wool, or even Australian wool. If we were to travel to Scotland, we would see the Scottish fishermen wearing Shetland Islands woollen jumpers, as do many other people in Scotland. They wear them because they are the most serviceable garments for them to wear in their line of work. The quality is excellent, as is the quality of any woollen garment. The spin-offs from that are enormous in creating an image for Scotland and for the Shetland Islands and woollen products. It goes right through to the tourism industry and the rest of the garment industry, right through to casual wear and everything else. On the other side of Scotland there is tweed coming from the Harris Islands. Their wool is not as good as ours, but they have a product name and product that are identified with their country and with regions within that country. There is no Tasmanian tweed, which I have always been concerned about. I have spoken on that matter before. New markets will open up. I have faith in this industry in the long term. There will be a host of opportunities in the long term for this industry. I believe it will come of age and be part of the world scene in the true commercial sense. I do not believe this has been the case in the past. There has been too much pressure keeping it down. I support these bills. They will give a new focus to the Australian wool industry. I have been disappointed in some of the niggling around the edges by the opposition. I congratulate the minister for his efforts in getting the industry into the 1990s.",154
225,Mr HAWKER,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"In joining this debate, first I would like to declare an interest. I am a wool grower as well as being a member of parliament. I would like to thank the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) for his compliments about Merino Gold and the very fine fleece that goes into making that cloth. It is a superb cloth. It is very much a superior cloth, made of superfine wool. It certainly will make suits of the quality that we would find in Italy or anywhere else that has very fine wools. Mr Downer interjecting",154
226,Mr HAWKER,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Since the honourable member for Mayo wants to interject, my suit was made in my electorate, at Fletcher Jones. Mr Downer-Is it wool?",154
227,Mr HAWKER,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Of course it is wool. Taking up the challenge that the honourable member for Lyons issued about people niggling around the edges, I will not be going around the edges. I am coming straight through the middle. I am pretty disgusted with the way the present government has treated the wool industry over the last few years. I want to come back to that in some detail, but I also want to mention that I have some real reservations about several major parts of this legislation, in particular the. fixed release schedule and Wool International. The way I see it, this proposal, while there is much merit in it-and many people have pointed out its merit-also shows that the government is walking away from the industry, saying to it, 'You are entirely on your own from now on'. This is the fifth change in three years. Do honourable members remember the words that were being used about three years ago-for example, 'immutable', 'ironclad guarantees' and so on? Let us just think for a minute about all of these changes and about how much they have cost the industry. People have talked about confidence and lack of confidence, but what undermines confidence faster than continually changing the arrangements under which an industry operates? I do not believe that the entire responsibility for the loss of confidence and the cost that this has meant for growers should· be borne entirely by growers. I raise that question in some detail because I think that is the debate that has not occurred tonight. I also reinforce the view that has been expressed about the scandalous treatment of this debate. This is the second time wool has been debated this year in this House. Guess what? It is the second time it has been under guillotine. That is absolutely appalling management by the government and shows just what little regard it has for the wool industry. I go back to some of the comments made about the way the government has supposedly got it right every time it changes the acts under which the wool industry is supposed to operate. Let us go back to 1991 when the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), said: This Billthat is,. the Australian Wool Corporation Billand the package of associated legislation provide for an institutional structure and market arrangements which will enable the wool industry to recover from the present crisis and establish a sustainable and viable future for the Australian wool industry. That is what the then minister said. He also said: The Government is now putting in place new institutional arrangements which will take the industry into the next century . . . It is up to all individuals and organisations interested in the future of the industry to get behind these arrangements and make them work . . . I am sure that, with the right decisions by the new organisations, the wool industry will recover to regain its place Australia's premier rural industry. That is what the then minister said a couple of years ago. Here we are with a whole new set of arrangements and with the same high hopes from the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) saying the same sorts of things. I thought the former minister, the honourable member for Werriwa, in his speech tonight made a rather tragic sight as he was presumably making his swan song speech in the way he was trying to justify his role in the crisis that the wool industry has been facing for the last three years. If we look back to the comments he made in 1991, we can see just how unfortunate and how galling it must be for him to see all his efforts having failed so dismally. If we go back to 1987, we can see that the minister was riot innocent. He approved the 870c floor price. He had his own source of information, most of it probably coming from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. It was interesting to hear his comment about the efforts of. the bureau in assisting him in his decision to reduce the floor price. Not only did he approve that but ,also he had to actively approve the increase in the borrowing limits for the Wool Corporation. Again, he cannot walk away from saying he was not responsible for some of the decisions taken; he was actively involved in those decisions. We then go to 1990-91 when the minister said that the 870c was to be reduced by 700c. I compliment him on saying that it was his decision and that he had written the speech in which he said that he was to make that decision. The fact is that he made that decision. He then went out and told the world that it was immutable. Seven months later, he pulled the plug on that. This cost one of our customers-not to mention many others-$50 million. Is it any wonder that there has been a lack of confidence in the industry? Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you in the strongest terms possible that much of that responsibility surely stiIl has to lie with the government of the day and the minister involved. In considering some of the other aspects as that have never been addressed in this debate that has not occurred yet, in October 1990 the wool tax was increased-this was for debt servicing-from 141h per cent to 21.15 per cent. Clearly, no grower has ever been compensated for that, no grower has asked for compensation, but again it shows the sort of mismanagement that was being undertaken. In 1991, we had the situation where the minister chose to split the Wool Corporation into three. Now, just two years later, we are seeing them being reduced back to two. All of this reinforces the view that the government has made one hell of a mess of the whole thing. As has been pointed out by my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), during the time that the stockpile was being accumulated the govern--nt benefited directly by between $500 mtlhon and $700 million in additional tax that it would not have otherwise received had it not been for the accumulation of wool in that stockpile; yet at the same time, as was pointed out, the income equalisation deposit scheme was cruelly delayed in its reintroduction until July 1991. All this leads to a fundamental question: what about the government's share of the responsibilities? The Garnaut report says that there is no straightforward answer when trying to decide who owes the debt and who owns the stockpile. Having made that observation, the Garnaut report goes on to decide that it is entirely the responsibility of the wool growers. On what I have pointed out so far, while I have great respect for the members of the committee who put together the Garnaut report, I come back to the question of the government's responsibility for the mess and the fact that, under this report, all costs are being borne entirely by the wool growers. Whichever way we look at it-whether from the point of view of the' ethics of responsibility, the economic responsibility or the integral role which governme-t, t-e minister and the parliament played m thiS whole sorry scenario-there is obviously q-ite a big responsibility resting on more than Just the wool growers for the current crisis. It makes me very angry when I read in the press and hear some people refer to it being all the fault of greedy wool growers. There were a lot of wool growers who did not a?ree with wh-t was being done and have had httle opportumty to disagree. I have heard an interesting extension of this argument. If the government has said that wool growers should be brought to account over the collapse of the reserve price scheme and be responsible for the wool debt, we could extend that argument to other industries that have benefited from government interventions of various kinds. This raises some interesting issues. For example, would a government now contemplate suing workers and firms in the textiles, and car industries because they got additional benefits that they no longer get? Should the government therefore recover the higher than current levels of assistance given to those industries, given that things have now changed? Those are the sorts of nonsenses that we might say are not relevant, but I suggest we think again because they are. It is an extension of the argument that has been put that it is entirely the responsibility of growers to pick up all the cost. I come back to the question of the fixed release. While I accept the argument that has been put very eloquently by many of my colleagues that we have to get wool moving out of the stockpile, I do raise the concern that, if the price were to collapse or t- go to a very high level, there would be, m my opinion, very strong pressure on the government of the day to change the release rate. Notwithstanding the fact that I have an assurance from the Wool Council that it would not be putting that pressure on, I do question whether the government of the day would be able to resist that. Accordingly, while there are some very good things in this legislation from the Garnaut report, I do raise the concern that the schedule should be maintained. The second point that I raise on the Garnaut report is the premise behind it. We have heard honourable members talk about the undue haste with which this has been pushed through particularly given that the legislation is not t- take effect, as far as the stockpile release is concerned, until 1 July next year. In today's Australian there is a letter questioning some of the reasoning and logic of the Garnaut report. I hope that the minister would, as a matter of urgency, investigate this matter. I know, as the honourable member for Barker has already pointed out, that much of the figuring behind the Garnaut report and the government's decision is still being kept secret. That always raises questions as to what is being hidden. Mr Crean-It depends on how you ask for it.",154
228,Mr HAWKER,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,There is no point saying he has not asked for it. He has been asking for it for three weeks. Mr - rean-He has not. He sought FOL,157
229,Mr HAWKER,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"What is FOI if it is not asking for it? When is the minister going to provide the information? The Gamaut report has used some figuring from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics about the benefits of following its stockpile reduction versus the denaturing of the stockpile altogether. It claims that there is a benefit over 10 years of some $66 million. But Dr Henry Haszler of La Trobe University has wntten to the Australian today and raised some questions about the assumptions that have been used in the modelling. He questions whether that result would be the same if different assumptions were used; in other words, the whole premise on which the Garnaut report has based its conclusions is now being challenged. I would have thought that the government, as a matter of urgency, would clear that up. One way to do that is to release all the working papers so that they can be properly examined by all members of the parliament; then we can do our duty in properly scrutinising this legislation. I have a few other concerns, but I come back to the major question: what is the real level of government responsibility in this matter, and how long will this plan last? Professor Gamaut has even admitted in his report that the 4.5 per cent tax probably is not necessary; it is really a bit of insurance for the government. So the government assumes no r-sponsibility. Most wool growers, and all specIalist wool growers, are finding it desperately difficult to survive. I have many in my electorate who are in desperate straits through no fault of their own, and that 4.5 per cent tax would. be very valuable to them. Given that it has' been admitted that it is not really necessary, I come back to the question of what responsibility is the government prepared to take, given that it has played such an integral role in the current demise of what was a once-great industry. A number of other points have been raised by my colleagues: the question of promotion; the question of the minister assuming the right to appoint all members of the board and I will not go over them again. Give- the concerns that I have raised, obviously I fervently hope that this legislation will hasten a recovery in the wool industry. I certainly believe there will be a recovery, but I have reservations which I have made clear. We look forward to seeing how the government will respond to the quite serious matters that I have raised.",157
230,Mr CREAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"in reply-In summing up in relation to this suite of amendments, I will make some general comments and have them relate to the next two bills that are going. to be dealt with in the context of the procedures before the House. I appreciate the contributions that have been made in this debate. It is clear that there is very broad and wide support for the package of proposals that have come forward. There have been some amendments circulated by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) on behalf of the opposition. He did foreshadow in his speech that consultations were continuing. I am pleased to be able to report that those consultations have been successful and they have resulted in me being now in a position, when we get to the committee stage in respect of both bills, to move a series of amendments that pick up a number of points. The consultations have been with the opposition and with the Wool Council of Australia. The amendments that will be proposed in the committee stage on behalf of the government reflect the outcome of those negotiations. I want to acknowledge the spirit with which the opposition and the Wool Council of Australia entered into these negotiations because I believe that, given that we did have such broad support with the basic thrust of the proposals before the House it was important to try to continue to ensure that we had as wide as support as possible for the full package of measures. Briefly, in summing up, I can foreshadow the range of amendments that will be embraced so' I do not need to take the time of the House when we get into the committee stage. In relation to one amendment that we are not accepting-the one in relation to the wool tax for the promotion of fellmongered wool-that issue was not before the Garnaut committee, nor was it argued, as I understand it, before the Garnaut committee by the Wool Council of Australia. However, I do understand the argument that is put but, given that we have not been able to have full discussions with the industry upon whom such a proposal would impact, my commitment is being prepared to examine this issue further, but certainly not to accept \ the amendment. So far as the other amendments are concerned, the ones that the government has been prepared to accede to relate to the Wool International Bill providing for a selection committee procedure to be introduced into this package of measures-providing the minister with nominations for consideration in the appointment of members to the appropriate bodies. I also foreshadow a number of amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993. 1\vo of the amendments that we are prepared to accept to this bill place obligations on the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to consult with the Wool Council of Australia in relation to the corporate plan, and also will make provision for a genuine consultation provision. Other amendments which the government is prepared to accept as a result of these negotiations provide for the selection committee which I referred to before. They move the facility for the Commonwealth appropriations for wool promotion from temporary provisions in the bill, as it currently stands, to make it a permanent feature in the legislation. We are extending the period of application for the temporary arrangements whereby the quality management functions that are to be divested by the AWRAP can occur over a longer period of time; we are extending the time period by one year. I conclude on the point that this has been a very lengthy process. Some can argue that it may have been rushed. I do not deny that we have worked to a very tight timetable, but at all stages we have announced what that timetable would be. We have met the timetable. We have consulted fully with all sections of the industry, and I am pleased to be able to bring the package of measures to the House and to be able to indicate that, now we have reached agreement on these final details, the package of measures will have the full support of the House. I thank those who have cooperated in this exercise for that. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In committee Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Amendments (by Mr Crean)-by leaveproposed: (1) After clause 10, page 9, insert the following clause: Consultation ""lOA.(l) Without limiting section 9, Wool International may, for the purpose of considering any matter relating to the performance of its functions, make arrangements for consulting persons and bodies representative of different sectors of the wool industry, including the Wool Council of Australia.

231,Mr ANDERSON,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has pointed out, negotiations have been going on behind the scenes all day between the coalition, the government and growers' representativesnamely, the Wool Council of Australia-over amendments to this legislation. These negotiations in relation to the amendments were along the lines of those foreshadowed by me in this place earlier tonight. I am pleased to hear the minister indicate that he is prepared to move amendments which satisfactorily cover our requirements. Perhaps the most important of those amendments goes to the matter of the selection process by which the boards of both Wool International and AWRAP will be chosen. There will now be a selection committee of four people-three chosen by the minister and one by the Wool Council. The minister has given me an assurance that he will also seek to consult with me, and I thank him for that. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) pointed out tonight,having the right people running the industry in general, and these boards in particular, will to a very great extent be the determinant of success or failure. No minister is the font of all wisdom when it comes to selecting the right people for any job, let alone this one. It is therefore appropriate that the amendments allow for what I believe is a much more balanced at:td mature approach to selection. I know that will do much to allay the fears and concerns about this area of industry leadership. The only other amendment on which I would like to comment is the one, that allows for further government contribution. As I said earlier, promotion will be the other great determinant of the way in which this industry looks in a few years time. This is an industry which, until recently, contributed no less than one in every 10 Australian export dollars earned. Of course, that is not the situation today. We must, therefore, get wool back to its premier position. In conclusion, I would like to say that industry leaders have called long and loud for support of this package. They have indicated to both sides of this House that they do not want any further instability and that they want this package to go through subject only to the amendments as largely negotiated. I trust that that leadership will work overtime to have the package succeed for the sake of all in the industry-indeed, I could say for the sake not only of the entire rural community but for this very nation as well. In the national interest, we desperately need a restored, reinvigorated and prosperous wool industry as soon as possible.",160
232,Mr CREAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) for his support of these amendments.

233,Mr MCGAURAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION," Together with wool growers, the federal coalition hopes for the sake of the industry that this latest round of restructuring of the organisational base of the industry will be last and that the changes targeted, arising from Professor Garnaut's report, actually grip and yield real and lasting benefits to struggling wool growers. I know that amongst wool growers there is a great deal of scepticism about the changes planned. My electorate of Gippsland has a large wool-growing sector and many growers have watched reports and industry plans come and go. In fact, in the course of this century we have seen industry reviews taking place at an average of one every three years. We would all have to understand if growers, who have to struggle day in and day out without having the time to look up, are not exactly applauding in an unqualified way the Garnaut report, because the immediate outlook for wool remains depressed. When farmers in my electorate actually get the chance to look up, all they have time to do is to check the surrounding properties which have gone to auction and worry even more about the valuation of their own properties and what the banks are thinking. However, the changes recommended by the Garnaut report represent what is likely to be the last best chance for the industry's longer term recovery, at least in regard to what this government will be able to provide. The bill before the House creates the new Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, AWRAP. That organisation will work in parallel with the commercial objectives of Wool International, stressing market based research and development ventures and pushing the development end of wool research effort. Equally, AWRAP will have responsibility for conducting the industry's promotional program, an effort of extreme importance given the competition from other fibres. We must bear in mind that wool accounts for only four per cent of the world apparel market and that there are many markets that still do not understand the versatility of wool. That is a point about which Sir William Gunn had a little bit to say on national television earlier this week. Regardless of that, the coalition does have concerns about the selection methods employed by the Minister for Primary Industries the and Energy (Mr Crean) to constitute the board of AWRAP. Those concerns were expressed in the draft amendments ·floated by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). Because AWRAP is meant to act in the interests of growers-it is paid for by growers' funds through the wool tax-and because the body is not carrying any debt, there is no solid reason why grower representation cannot be greater than it is. As always, the guillotine has prevented honourable members on this side of the House from further comment on behalf of their constituencies. Under an agreement with the government, I must draw to a close because my three minutes is almost up. However, I say again that the minister has yet to properly answer the question of why the board of AWRAP cannot more fully represent growers' interests. Question resolved in the affirmative.

We cannot get to the substance of this legislation tonight. I do not believe that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) accepts·that this is the way to conduct proceedings in this place. It is a matter of extreme importance to in wool growers from one end of this country to the other. The whole debate has been guillotined. Every time there have been debates on this matter, they have been guillotined. There are wool growers in my electorate who go to their bank on Friday afternoon at 4 0' clock to get sustenance money for their families for the next week. This industry is in absolute crisis. The one thing it desperately needs is stability. We cannot have stability when we have been running around this place for the preceding two hours, with the Australian Wool Council members ensconced in one area and the minister, the shadow minister for primary industries, the honourable for· Gwydir .(Mr Anderson), in another area, trying to resolve these matters in the short time available. The' coalition amendments, which I am pleased the minister has taken up, have addressed at least one area of concern of the VFF. However, the promotion question is still the big noose hanging over the whole legislation. I do not know whether the legislation ' will work; the great number of wool growers who have contacted me do not know either. But everyone is absolutely desperate to see something that works. I sincerely hope that we will not have to come back to this place in two years time to go through the whole process again. Mr Andrew-There won't be any wool growers left.",163
236,Mr RONALDSON,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"If we do, as the honourable member for Wakefield said, there will not be any wool growers left. It is not just for the individuals and their families, but for the whole social and economic structure of rural areas that are deeply reliant on the survival of wool growers. We desperately need to protect that and, if we do not, this parliament, economy and the whole Australian public, will pay the most extraordinary price. I ask the minister on behalf of the people who have contacted me-of whqm there are very many-to please ensure that something is done about promotion. At the end of the day that will be the key to the success of this whole package. It is the vital element, but unfortunately it is missing. Despite that, and with reluctance because of the time frame allowed and because of the concerns expressed to me by large numbers of wool growers, I am prepared to give this a chance. I think the wool growers in my area will too. But I ask the minister again to address the promotion question. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

237,Mr MCGAURAN,AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION,"Following the comments of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) regarding promotion, and as possibly the last word in this debate, I stress that the coalition does not believe that the promotion of wool can proceed effectively without the government extending its funding commitments. There is no way around it. Consequently, we have sought an extension of promotion support for the industry in line with its own funding undertakings, which have been in the public arena for some seven months. The government has been happy to restructure the indu-try and make wool growers pay the price, but has been reluctant to dip into its own pocket in the interests of the industry and the nation. This is a continuing theme of the government's approach to the industry. It has been prepared to restructure the industry to the last wool grower, but not to use its resources or exercise discipline to help the industry positively. We have had battles-and they will continue-over access to entitlements by farmers, the use of asset testing on allowances and so on, and how inflexible capital gains rulings have weakened the safety net in rural regions. There are other government driven costs to wool growers which, if removed, could provide .added incentive for growers to stay in business. I have never believed that the starting point of a restructuring exercise ought to be with depleting industry numbers and constricting supply. This is the easiest policy for a government to pursue because it puts the onus on someone other than itself. If governments could reduce the cost burden on wool growers, we could keep more of them in the industry, allow them a decent chance to restructure, work their financial situations out and have a choice about their futures. But under current government policy they have no choices. Buried under escalating costs they have no chance. Every farmer pays up to $1,600 per year in sales tax. That is going up a further 2 per cent as a result of the budget, unless the Greens or Australian Democrats support the coalition in the Senate to block that iniquitous tax measure. The industry has lost another $4.5 million with changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The growers pay processing costs, which are uncompetitive. Their on-road fuel bills have jumped by 5c a litre. Their road and rail freight shipping costs have risen with the 5c increase in diesel for non-rebated users, the trucking industry and rail networks included. While the government might like to congratulate itself on its courage in inflicting so much pain on fanners to get the restructuring policies through, it might spare a thought about how much of the pain was needless and unnecessary and driven only by its inability to put its house in order first. There has been a virtual halving of the supply of wool in the space of three years. Production is now around 690 million kilograms, and still sliding; That is down from 1,100 million kilograms in 1989-90, a massive change in industry activity in anyone's reckoning. It has come at an enonnous cost. Some wool growers have been lucky enough to hold on for a variety of reasons, others have diversified, moving into other commodities such as dairy, beef or grains. Sadly, many wool growers have gone under and their lives and those of their families have been scarred forever. Those who do not live in rural electorates will hardly understand the impact on the community of fann foreclosures and the like. The government cannot neatly and so simply pass the onus of industry restructuring onto wool growers. There isa great deal it can do to put its house in order and lower the savage input costs that make so many wool growers and those in other agricultural pursuits uncompetitive, particularly in the light of so many world-corrupted markets.

241,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"I am delighted to find that the nonnal practices of the House are going to continue to be observed. I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on ensuring that that is the case. Tonight I want to bring up a situation which is, unfortunately, all too familiar. It is the case of an Australian technical invention which, because of the lack of official support, looks like leaving Australia. It is not just invention. As you would know, Mr Speaker, from your close attention to television and films over many years, the 3D presentation of films has been looked at by the major technical corporations around the world for many years. They have sought a way in which 3D pictures can be projected without the usual encumbrances of red-green spectacles and all that sort of paraphernalia, as has been the case in the past. This particular technology has been sought, as I have said, by leading companies overseas for many years now. The fact is that a small Australian company has, it appears, come up with not only a technically feasible but· also a very workable system for projecting images in 3D onto television screens and simulators and for a whole range of other uses. The unfortunate fact is that, despite the knowledge of this technical breakthrough being available in Australia, there is no official support for this company from any avenue of government or non-government sources which would enable this breakthrough to be developed in Australia. Just think of the ramifications of accurate 3D projections in simulation activities, television, film or medicine-right throughout these avenues. The inventors simply do not have, at this stage, the commercial or government backing for the development of this breakthrough here in Australia. But that is not the case in relation to the interest evinced in this development by major overseas corporations. There is no doubt that the inventors of the system will do well out of it, simply because a path is being beaten to their door by major overseas investors. The point I wish to bring to the attention of the House tonight is that this major technical breakthrough, developed in Australia, is simply not being supported within Australia. There are enormous ramifications, not only for overseas sales but for potential employment opportunities, should this development be kept in Australia and further developed here in Australia. I put it to the government tonight that this is yet another of those interplex esting and exciting developments which-if we do not take a special interest in it-will any forever leave our shores. In the future, we will be buying back this Australian technology in so many different fields unless interest is manifested from either government or commercial organisations in Australia to ensure that the development stays in Australia and is further developed in Australia. The government should look at this development very closely. It is an exciting development which has been sought throughout the world for literally decades. It has not been achieved anywhere else in the world. It has been discovered in Australia. It can be developed in Australia. The amounts of money required to further that development are not very great. It is something the government should place emphasis on to make sure that we do not, yet again, allow a technical breakthrough to be taken away from Australia simply because we do not support· it here. Republic",165
242,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Melbourne) (11.37 p.m.)The Turnbull committee report is a balanced and measured examination of the issues associated with Australia becoming a republic. The monarchists in our community and, indeed, certain prominent members of the opposition have complained about the fact that the report does not advance reasons as to why Australia should become a republic. They obviously have not read the committee's terms of reference which c'learly imposed an obligation on the committee to report with respect to how Australia could go about becoming a republic. That is why the committee was established-to further the implementation of the commitment made by the government at the last election for Australia to move towards becoming a republic. The report is about the mechanics, the logistics, of Australia becoming a republic and it is for that reason that it is entirely logical that the committee was headed by a republican. It was not intended to ask: 'Should we or should we not become a republic?' It Was intended to report to the government how such a move could be made and to examine in· detail the obviously comissues associated with republican change to our constitution. The committee focused, quite rightly, on key questions relating to the powers granted to, and method of appointment of, a head of state. The committee correctly identified that, if we were to have a popularly elected president or head of state, that person would need to have his or her powers very strictly defined. The committee has, unfortunately, failed to identify a key problem with one of the possible methods of appointment of a head of state, namely, a special majority of parliament, and that relates to an opposition that would use its effective veto power-if a two-thirds majority were required for appointment-to force an election. The situation that currently prevails in Greece-which honourable members are probably not aware of-is that, in the near future, the Greek President will be required to be re-elected and a special majority will be needed in the parliament. If that special majority is not obtained, an election-well short of the term the government is due to serve-will be forced. Particularly when we recall the events of 1975, I can foresee a situation where a president of this country has finished a term of office; and, if a two-thirds majority were required, an opposition, seeking to force an election, could simply refuse to vote for any nominee of the government: The committee also makes a number of other very worthwhile points, one of them being that there is a need for far greater education, at both the primary and secondary level, with respect to our constitution and our system of government. Ignorance is the foremost weapon of reaction. Certainly, conservative political forces across the world generally streets last year, (TIme expired) do not desire ordinary people to be knowledgeable about political frameworks, the system of government and the country in which they reside. I would say to the House that, in other spheres, we should be pursuing proper education about our system of government and constitution. I applaud the report for that reason. . I now turn to the question of what sort of debate we will have from the monarchists and the opposition. Will we see a continuation of the frothing at the mouth that we have seen from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) about the so-called hidden agenda that the government has to abolish the states, the Senate, and so forth? We might even see the honourable member for Bennelong debate some of these issues and put forward to people like me some reasons why we should not abolish the states, rather than this foaming at the mouth that is most characteristic of him. Instead of accusations that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is rewriting history, perhaps we will see a serious examination of the history of this country that looks at both the good and the bad. Perhaps people will recognise that, even if we have only a symbolic change-a change to a republic effectively is only symbolic because it is a minimalist position-symbols are important. Honourable members on the other side of the House surely recognise that the Australian flag is a symbol and that symbols can be very important; that, therefore, an Australian republic is equally a very important symbolic change. Will we hear absurd outbursts from the opposition, such as: 'Well, this country here is a republic and it has an unstable situation; therefore the republic is causing that', or 'That country is a monarchy and it happens to be stable'. It is the nature of the society that produces a stable society and government; it is not the reverse. For example, Switzerland is one of the most stable and wealthy countries in the world and it has been a republic for a thousand years. Thailand has a very revered monarchy. That did not prevent many people being massacred in the . Tourism: South Australia  last few weeks grandstands, pit buildings, fences and crash barriers have been going up around the south-western boundaries of Sturt in preparation for this year's Australian Formula One Grand Prix. It will be the ninth time the race has been mn. Thousands of tourists will be flocking tc- .he circuit, giving a bonus to nearby pubs and restaurants. Millions of people around the world will view the race on television. It is a great promotion for South Australia. Uilfortunately, there are not many others. Ever since the days of the Dunstan government, tourism has been a much touted panacea for South Australia's economic ills. Despite this, our market share of international visitor nights has declined throughout the 11 years of the Bannon and Arnold Labor governments. In 1985, the year the Grand Prix was first run, South Australia had eight per cent of the market. Since then, the figure has fallen to 4.9 per cent, a massive 40 per cent drop. This is despite $77 million worth of taxpayers' money being' spent on tourism marketing. Australia-New Zealand Aviation Fast Fax reported only last Friday that Adelaide international airport has the second lowest number of international air passengers in Australia, in front of Hobart. The Labor Party has failed to develop successful marketing strategies for the interstate and international tourism markets throughout. its 11 years in government. Its advertisements and promotions have been unimaginative and, with the decline in tourism growth, scarcely cost-effective. South Australia offers a fresh and friendly environment that should make an attractive tourism destination. Adelaide has a strong reputation in the arts and cultural circles, and we offer visitors a unique mixture of desert landscape, ocean and classic Australian countryside. However, when it comes to serious promotion of South Australia, we seem to have an 'It's all too hard' approach. Earlier this year the American ABC network broadcast Good Morning America to its 23 million viewers from Australia for a fortnight. Two pre-taped segments shot in South Australia were used, but no segments were actually broadcast from the state. Bob Nichols, the Managing Director of Tourism SA, claimed he did not know about GMA's visit until its itinerary had already been decided. Kay Hannaford, a local tourism and public relations consultant, interviewed Nichols for a piece in the Adelaide Review. She asked him what he thought of Good Morning America being broadcast from only the eastern states. He said: It didn't really surprise us, to be honest with It was too late to do anything by the time. I personally knew about it. It's worried me for years that the advertising of Australia will always feature the places where the aeroplanes land and the big visual images that immediately trigger a recognition in the viewer's mind-Sydney, the Rock and the Reef-it's still a very strong image in the minds of those who brand and sell Australia. This is the man who is trying to sell South Australia internationally and interstate. That is his attitude. Tourism SA decided that at $20,000 a spot it would be too expensive to advertise during Good Morning America. However, the producers are interested in returning. Tourism SA has asked its Los Angeles representative to 'take it up with his counterparts'. It sounds rather like, 'Don't call us, we'll call you'. Hannaford concluded: The GMA story is symptomatic of a far bigger problem that SA has. That is, while we sit back and accept, even expect, that SA won't get a look in, of course we won't. While we worry and complain, but do little or nothing, nothing will change. Tourism SA ignored opportunities for cooperative advertising in the Good Morning America program. The state government's own tourism advisory body refused to demonstrate initiative and creativity in marketing my state. There is a clear need for greater cooperation and coordination between the government and all sectors of the industry. We should be doing everything we can to market South Australia, proudly and professionally. Mike Rann, the Minister for Tourism, is often touted as a fpture Labor Premier. If he wants the job, he will have to learn how to sell South Australia' rather than himself. Wool",166
243,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with great regret that no-one from Queensland was allowed to speak tonight on the wool debate because of the guillotine and the arrangements as far as speaking orders are concerned. A recent report, the Newman report produced by the Longreach Arid Zone you Research Station, indicates that the debt levels in this current financial year will reach $400,000 for two-thirds of the industry and the operating losses will be $40,000 a year. That means that within two years, since most of these properties are 25,000 acres and their land values will probably be down to about $20 an acre, 50 per cent of the entire number of wool producers in the state of Queensland will be insolvent. The Garnaut report, which effectively was passed here tonight, will not do one single thing to help those people. What will help those people is the fact that a 30 per cent increase in demand and a 30 per cent decrease in production will indicate clearly that somewhere over the next one, two or three years the price of wool will rise very dramatically. Maybe we will be lucky enough to see that happen within 12 months and rescue most of these people; maybe we will not. The thing I deeply regret is that, yet again, we have seen the collapse of a primary industry in Australia without any ability on the part of this House to involve itself in the marketplace to assist that industry. Constantly the most dreadful error has been reiterated throughout Australia-and I regret to say by people on my side of the House-in attributing the collapse of the wool industry to some sort of market fluctuations. Mr Snowdon-Ha, hal",168
244,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to put on record the fact that the honourable member for the Northern Territory is laughing. He finds this funny. I think a lot of people on his side of the House do find this funny. Before the infamous press conference of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), only 20 per cent of the wool coming onto the Australian market was being purchased by the government instrumentality. After his press conference, 80 per cent of the Australian wool clip had to be picked up by the Australian instrumentality at the time. So what actually happened was: he went public and said that the price of wool will be put down by the Australian government. That is effectively the clear-cut signal that he sent out to the entire world and to all the wool buyers in the world. Every single one of them had to stop buying wool and, of course, the auction system went down. So the sellers were still there but there were no buyers and the price fell through the floor. Any person who wishes to do the research will see clearly that before that press conference 80 per cent of trade was being taken up by the free market forces purchasing that wool and after the press conference those figures were exactly reversed. The same people that destroyed the wool industry in Australia, the biggest export earning item of this nation, then proceeded to attribute the wreckage to some sort of shortcoming in the pricing mechanism which we had. Let me say to the House once, again that where we have tens of thousands of sellers and only half a dozen or a dozen buyers-:-that is exactly the situation in the wool, sugar beef industries-the economists have a name for it. They call it an oligopolist situation. It is a big name. To most of us it means a monopoly situation. It is not a pure monopoly. There is not one buyer; there are half a dozen buyers. It amounts to much the same thing. Every book I have ever read and every viewpoint of every industry that I have seen throughout Australia in my lifetime indicates clearly that in that situation the sellers are at an enormous disadvantage. The marketplace will work very much to their disadvantage. Any nation that enables half a dozen international commodity brokers, foreign commodity brokers, to buy our product at half the cost of production has to be very foolish and the weakest trading nation on the planet. Trevor Sykes, in the Bulletin magazine recently, said that that is what Australia is at present-the weakest trading nation on the entire planet. This is a major export item. The government has stood idly by, twiddling its thumbs, whilst we are now selling the product for half the cost of production. For those who say that nothing can be done, I say, 'There are a hundred things that can be done'. The last time this situation existed, Doug Anthony did something about it. (Ttme expired) Electoral System",169
245,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (11.52 p.m.)Problems of instability, corruption and public dissatisfaction abound in most of the world's democratic systems of government. Even established democracies such as Canada, New Zealand and Italy have found it necessary to engage in constitutional reform. Democratic political systems which depend on one group attaining outright majorities are facing difficulties and contain the dilemma that they are, in the end, incompatible with the concept of one vote, one value. The diversity of communities, the growth of education and information technology are now such that a majority of the vote can rarely be attained without electoral distortion. The Australian version of the Westminster system was always a parochial compromise irrespective of the rosy rhetoric about founding fathers. To the extent that it has worked reasonably well since Federation is a tribute to the nature of the Australian community as much as the system. The last decade has seen an increasing breakdown of the system as a majority of the 15 Australian houses of parliament have slipped from the respective government control. The present Senate impasse is a continuation of the trend. The Senate, created out of fear of centralism and given equal legislative power with the House of Representatives, always contained a number of dilemmas. The equal legislative power of the Senate, but based on equal representation ftom the states, means that federalism is really incompatible with democracy. Given the fact that senators never fulfil their originally restricted role to consult and represent states, it is inconceivable that one Tasmanian. voter should equal 13 New South Wales voters. For all that, the argument propounded by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the Senate should not frustrate the people's house and the legitimate government does not stand scrutiny. The House of Representatives hardly represents the legitimate popular will, given the distortions of electoral distribution within states, minimum Tasmanian representation and the winner-take-all nature of single member electorates, which means that the number of seats in relation to votes is virtually random. The introduction of fairer proportional voting has led to upper houses becoming more representative of the community than lower houses. The Senate at present certainly is, with the number of seats reflecting the people's will to a much greater degree than the so-called people's house even with the massive distortion of equal state representation. Here, 44.9 per cent of the vote has given the government 54.4 per cent of the seats and 100 per cent of the say. The non-major party vote of 11 per cent is rewarded with 1.4 per cent of the seats. In the Senate, the government has 43.5 per cent of the vote and 39.4 per cent of the seats. The non-major party vote of 13.4 per cent across Australia is reflected with 13.1 per cent of the seats. The development of the effective Senate committee system has added to the view that the Senate has a more valid claim to be the people's house. Over and above these structural defects, the rigidity of the party system is the fundamental distortion of the Australian political system. I could not put it any better than the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, who stated in a recent paper that the rigid party system has destroyed the Westminster system, promoted corruption, undermined the public service and even destroyed objective truth and standards in much the same manner as communism and fascism at their zenith. That statement only confirms the words of a former Clerk of this House, J.A. Pettifer, in 1979. We therefore have a continual conflict between the two houses with only arguable guidelines, a minority government residing in an unrepresentative lower house, a Senate which is closer to being a people's house, which is effectively forever changing its original reason for being and the lot distorted in its operation by the rigidity of the party system. The Senate possess genuine power or it does not. If it does, it can frustrate the lower house; if it does not, it is a pointless talking shop. Either way it is unsatisfactory. These problems together with the changes in society, both nationally and internationally, since 1901 create an overwhelming case for constitutional reform. As the republican debate develops, the political parties will realise that only a oirectly elected government will serve both its interests and the public interests. In a diverse society which aspires to be a democracy with fair voting systems, a directly elected government with fixed terms and a proper separation of government, legislature and judiciary is the only way to achieve stability and accountability and democratically reflect a diversity of political opinion. Gideons International",169
246,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"Hinkler) (11.56 p.m.)Last Saturday I was privileged and humbled to address the 35th annual convention of Gideons International held in Bundaberg. I say 'privileged'because the convention represented 390 delegates from 141 branches-or 'camps' as they call them-throughout Australia. n was inspiring to address a group whose values both mirrored and promoted the Christian ethic. I say 'humbled' because I realised that this comparatively small organisation of 2,400 members and 1,400 auxiliary members has over the last 37 years been responsible for the distribution of 8.6 million Bibles throughout Australia. Put another way and assuming all were still in use, this means that this unselfish and dedicated group has given out sufficient Bibles to cover half the population of this country. The extent of this commitment is even more impressive when we consider that the organisation has distributed 600 million Bibles in 70 languages throughout the world, and that the various branches around the world now hand out one million Bibles every 9 11z days. Its next target is eastern Europe with an estimated distribution of 500,000 per month. After 70 years of atheism and materialism, it is a remarkable if not daunting task. I suppose we have all noticed Gideons Bibles unobtrusively tucked away in the top drawers of our hotel rooms, motel suites or hospital wards. More importantly, the organisation extends its ministry to prisons, schools and universities. In an age that wrings its hands at the loss of values, the break-up of marriages and the disillusionment of youth, this organisation is an unpretentious and effective beacon to a searching society. I congratulate the out-going president, Ivan Gow of Sydney, for three years of leadership and I wish his successor, Allan Stewart of the Sunshine Coast, an equally successful term. As a member of this House and of parliaments in general, I was most warmly and generously received. I enjoyed the fellowship of these gentle and visionary Australians, and I will cherish the beautiful leather bound Bible they presented me with as a memento of that day. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.59 p.m. until Monday, 18 October 1993, at 2 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day.
