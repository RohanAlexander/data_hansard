The point that Mr Murphy has not taken into account the fact petroleum industry and therefore the cost cost reducing impacts of the GST on the petroleum to a significant extent by the 40 per cent taketh away. I would not like to see for a moment the we take that point and we will reduce the resource to go. However, I think the industry does have comes to consider the question of the Ralph review depreciation, the parliament should appreciate the GST arrangements will not necessarily government.

So what the government giveth, it then government responding to that and saying, 'Okay, rent tax on petroleum.' That is not the way a point here. Therefore, when the parliament and the possibility of removing accelerated that the benefits to the petroleum industry from be as large as those initially claimed by the sides of the parliament who are quite concerned removal of, or a reduction in, accelerated rate.

Since the AAHC is a corporation which has ACT, does this render the New South Wales government national corporation under the New South Wales fanner wishes to appeal a farmer wishes to claim compensation? What wishes to sue for payment? Every time. I read through these questions correspondence from another suffering, financially important a judiciary inquiry is in relation to my head against a very large bureaucratic brick the electorate of Hume that a full investigation answer. I have said it in the past, and I will say handling of the administration of OJD, more families expired) MAIN COMMITTEE 9299 impact a signed agreement might have on future practitioners to sign an agreement which demanded the scheme? Why did the department not use but rely upon contract to extract such enforced to protect fanners from the administrative they were using an accredited veterinarian they to criticise the department? Did the department who were encouraging fanners to become about the long-term consequences of being the department take to prevent certain practices fanners? What legislative powers were used to its endemic disease responsibilities for OJD decided to place itself under the laws of the fanner and veterinarian subject to a quasi jurisdiction of the ACT? What happens when a decision? What happens when a New South Wales happens when a New South Wales veterinarian and every time. I receive a telephone call or ruined family, I remind myself of how this terrible disease, OJD. I feel like I am banging wall. I agree with various shires from within into all aspects of this calamity is the only it again; while we toss around options about the suffer. This suffering needs to end.

(3) What sums has the Commonwealth paid in (a) sitting fees, (b) board fees, (c) travel (d) related expenses with respect to each appointment referred to in part (2). Dr Kemp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Student Traineeship Foundation (ASTF), an incorporated association funded by the Commonwealth under the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation Program, has funded a School Industry Liaison Officer (SILO) project with the National Farmers' Federation (NFF). (a) (i) and (ii) The funds are provided under a contract from the ASTF to the NFF. The SILO project aims to raise the profile school-based rural industry work placement programs with primary producers in regional, rural and remote locations. The Rural Industry SILO Project has three major strategies: a promotional campaign outlining the benefits to employers; liaison officers to provide direct personal contact with primary producers; and development of up to 9 model programs as exemplars for broader scale application. Under the Educative Services initiative, Nationwide Farmers Australia Ltd (an incorporated body associated with the National Farmers Federation) NA received $650,000 to support funding for four Employment, Education and Training (EET) Advisers for the period 1 June 1998 to 30 June 2000. The EET Adviser positions were established in key employer and industry organisations to deliver information and advice on training reforms to their constituent members on the fuIl range of employment, education and training issues which are embodied in the National Training Framework. (b) The ASTF has provided $305,000 in 1998-99. (2) Nil. (3) Nil. Australian Student Traineeship Foundation (Question No. 679) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, costs and upon notice, on 2 June 1999: (1) Has the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation (ASTF) provided the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) with 18 school/industry liaison officers; is so, (a) was a selection process involved and, if so, what was its nature, (b) has the ACCI been provided with funding for 8 school/industry liaison officers with State and Territory Chambers of Commerce and Industry and 7 with industry associations; if so, (i) what is the nature of the funding and (ii) who are the 7 industry associations and (c) are ACCI liaison officers also attempting to enrol employers as members of the ACCI; if so, is this acceptable to and participation of the Commonwealth. (2) Did the ASTF also enter into a project with the National Farmers' Federation; if so, were other employer organisations considered for an ASTF project. (3) Did the ASTF Networker magazine for March 1999 contain a promotion for the ACCI with member information; if so, (a) why, (b) does the magazine provide similar advertising for every other employer and employee organisation; if not why not and (c) did the ACCI pay the ASTF for the promotion. (4) How many copies of the magazine are printed. Dr Kemp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The ASTF has developed a partnership ACCI that supports 18 School Industry Liaison Officers (SILOs). The SILOs are responsible for promoting industry and employer involvement in the provision of structured workplace opportunities for school students. The partnerships form part of the ASTF's initiatives to increase employer participation in structured workplace learning. (a) The ASTF determined it would pilot ship projects with a range of different types of industry organisations including: a federation of associations; a national organisation with direct memberorganisations, ship; an organisation active in rural and remote parts of Australia; and an organisation with a constituency which operates at the local level managing the tion/training and business links necessary to combine on and off-the-job training. The ASTF selected four organisations including the ACCI as offering the diversity of organisations and approaches required for the pilot round. (b) The ASTF has provided for 18 SILOs. This is made up of 10 SILOs based in State and Territory Chambers of Commerce, 7 SILOs based in national industry associations and one national coordination position. (i) The ASTF has a contract with the ACCI for $1,728,000 for the period from 1 June 1998 to 31 July 1999. (ii) The 7 industry associations are: Australian Hotels Association Printing Industries association of Australia Housing Industry Association Australian Retailers' Association National Electrical Contractors Association Master Builders' Association Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce (c) The ASTF funds are provided strictly the contracted objectives of the project. The ASTFACCI contract makes no provision for SILOs to recruit members to ACCI affiliated organisations. (2) Yes. Other organisations were considered in developing the SILO pilot projects. In this case, the NFF project had the backing of Rural Skills Australia and the Rural Training Council of Australia, both being leaders in training for rural and remote industries. (3) Networker is the ASTF's official newsletter. The major theme of the March 1999 need for greater industry and employer support for structured workplace learning. It contained feature stories on both the ACCI and NFF SILO pilot with projects at page three. The only reference in Networker to ACCI member information comes on page six where the ASTF lists a range of ""Websites to Visit"" and ACCI's website is one of seven listed. learning The reference reads in full: ""Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry: www.accLasn.au All about ACCI-what it is; member informapartnertion, its priorities and activities."" (a) The SILO article informs readers about this significant initiative of the ASTF. It highlights the importance that industry, and its representative are placing on school-industry partnerships to support workplace learning opportunities for students. It is unreasonable to interpret the article as a promotion for ACCI membership. The Website information is minimal but factual. It is difficult to construe this one-off description of educathe ACCI Website as a promotion for the ACC!. (b) Networker does not provide advertising space to any organisations. (c) The ACCI did not pay for the article. (4) The ASTF produces 12,000 copies of funding to the ACCI Networker. Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs: Library Services (Question No. 754) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 1999 Does the Minister's Department operate a library or libraries; if so, (a) what sum was spent on purchasing new books for departmental libraries in (i) 1996-97, (ii) 1997-98 and (iii) 1998-99 and (b) will the Minister provide a list of the title and author of each book purchased by departmental libraries in 1998-99 Dr Kemp--The answer to the honourable to meet member's question is as follows: (a) the amounts spent on purchasing new books for departmental libraries in the three financial years are as follows; (i) 1996-97, $25,635.52. (ii) 1997-98 and $35,389.83. (iii) 1998-99 $34,905.51. (b) Attachment A provides a list of the books purchased by the Department's libraries in the issue was the 1998-99 financial year.

Eunson, Baden Lloyd, Trefor Australian Episcopal Conference Marks, Gary & Nicole Fleming Linden, Josephine AlFertman & van, Carll. Bessant, Judith Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable Places member's question is as follows: (1) Funded student places are not allocated by the Commonwealth to the individual campuses or faculties of universities. The level of student places and course work enrolled in the Faculty of Education and Languages, University of Western Sydney (Macarthur) is, therefore, an internal matter for the University itself to determine on the basis of its own assessment of its needs and priorities. (2) Like all other universities, the University of Western Sydney hosts international conferences and the Commonwealth does not require universities to report their cost. Moreover, a breakdown of those costs into various components is an internal budgeting matter for the University.",148
