2,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Unde r the law, no year. returned soldier ean receive seven days' notice to vacate his home. The law for-' bids any action being taken against soldier in default until three months have expired, and then it is the practice of Department to give at least three notices. Under those circumstances no case of hardship is likely to occur. However, assure the honourable member that when is made known to the Department that' any .person, owing to adverse circumabout'the stances, sueh as ill-health, is temporarily unable to meet his obligations,- no drastic action will he taken against him.

4,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I ask the Postmaster-General whether this statement, appears in today's Age, is correct - it is a .portion of the evidence of the manager of Metal Manufactures Limited, Renvois, given before a Select Oomor mittee in New South iWalesIn view of recent official statomente that In telephone orders had been held up owing to a lock of supplies of copper wire,' witness surprised the Committee by stating that his firm 100 tons of copper wire a month, and that the Department used .about 500 tons a year. They could give them1,200 tons a Thoy had written to the Department in Melbourne, and had circularized the Deputy Postmasters-General .in each State that they any would be glad of orders, If so, will the right honourable gentleman the take steps to secure - an ample supply of material, and carry out works, some of which have been held up for four years I owins; to lank of material-work s such as it the North Coast metallic circuit?",19
5,Mr WISE,Unknown,"I shall make inquiries statement in the Age, which I bave not yet seen. The Department has already anticipated practically the whole of the vote for next year in ordering material so that it may be ready for use. TASMASI AN MAIL-SERVICE.",19
6,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta-Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.7] -(B y leave.)-The Government have concluded a new Tasmanian mail contract. ""We have been in negotiation for some time past with the shipping companies concerned, and it has not been ensy to secure an agreement.",20
7,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Does the new contract effect any economy?,20
8,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If economy means lower prices there is no economy in sight in connection with this agreement as in connection with most other contracts to perform services for the Government.,20
9,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,Eve n the is dearer now than it was last month.,20
10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Our negotiations have been with representatives of Messrs. Huddart Parker and the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, those companies arranging in combination for the service. Having investigated their figures, having seen their books, and having made as thorough an examination of the case as we could, we have satisfied ourselves that even with an increased subsidy the service will be run Avithout a profit. It seems extraordinary that with a subsidy twice that paid under the pre-war contract, no profit will be made by the companies, but having investigated the whole of the figures, I feel certain that the service will be carried out without profit. That is not an exaggeration; my statement is a result of careful deliberation, and is under the mark. The companies would prefer to have no mail contract, but the Government has persuaded them to accept a subsidy for the continuance of the mail service. They would prefer to run their steamers without being tied clown to the conditions of a mail contract, managing the service according to circumstances, and to the greatest commercial advantage. However, Ministers felt that Tasmania has the same right to a direct and frequent mail service as any other State, and we have taken the steps necessary to secure it to the people of that State. I regret that the new steamer which was ordered during the war is not to be employed to give a better service than there was before; a3 in the case of the Orient mail contract, we must be satisfied in these days with a service not better than the pre-war service. I hope that conditions may soon so change that we may increase these facilities, and give the people the better services to which they are entitled. The war is still over all these matters, not only in the direction of increasing the cost, but in multiplying the difficulties > of conducting these businesses. The companies would have preferred to have nothing to do with the mail contract. They would rather have carried our mails on the poundage system, and have used their boats with a view to obtaining the best commercial advantages available. It is our duty, however, to try-as we have endeavoured to do in the past-to secure Age a service for Tasmania conducted with such ships as are capable of coping with the passenger traffic and of maintaining a good speed. With the present rates for fares and freights, the difference between the earnings and the running costs of the ships was so great that it could not be met wholly by an increased mail subsidy. It has been agreed, accordingly, that the rates for freight shall be raised by 2s. 6d. per ton-whic h is 16s per cent - whil e the fares will be increased by 20 per cent. These increases make the rates approximately the same as those now existing in respect of the Australian coastal shipping services generally. The companies will have the right to review the rates of fares and freights after six months; but any further increase must be approved by the Postmaster-General. We cannot get them to agree to the subsidy without that right of review after having given the contract a test. I said, in my opening remarks, that the firms were likely to make no profit. I will say now that they are facing a distinct loss.",20
11,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Will the Government claim the same right of review?,20
12,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I understand so. The old contract provided for a mail subsidy of £-15,000 per annum when the Nairana was brought into use. ""Under the agreement now to be made, the mail subsidy will be increased to £30,000. The contract will provide for a service of three trips a week between Melbourne and Launceston for seven months of the year, and for two trips a week for the remaining five months. Between Melbourne, Burnie, and Devonport there will be two trips a week throughout the year. The contract will be for a period of twelve months, and will be continued thereafter subject to either party having the right to give twelve months' notice of its termitinued, nation. I take this earliest opportunity of making the House acquainted with the terms of the contract, which were concluded only yesterday. The whole matter will be submitted to Parliament later.",20
13,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown," This is a very important matter, and I sincerely hope the House will be given the fullest opportunity of discussing it .",21
14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Postmaster General (Mr Wise) will give notice to that end at once.,21
15,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am gratified to hear, it. The change in the contract is very drastic, seeing that the amount of the subsidy to be paid is to be doubled, and that thero is provision also for increased passenger fares and freights. The Acting Prime Minister pointed out, of course, that those increases would be in accordance with the rates now prevailing along the Australian coast. But in fully discussing the whole subject it will be the duEy of honourable members to see that the best interests of the whole of the people of Australia are conserved. COCKATO O ISLAN D DOCKYARD.",21
16,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, in connection with the resumption of work at Cockatoo Island, the Government are setting out to get work done and to pay wages there for, or whether they are proceeding to pay wages and to find work as a reason for the payment.",21
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Government are setting out to put the whole business under the best management possible, giving aa free a hand as may be conceded in the discharge of the work carried on at the Dockyard.",21
18,Mr BELL,Unknown,Have they not had a very free hand there in the past 1,21
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , that has been my trouble-to o free a hand, indeed, for my finances.",21
20,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Does not the Acting Prime Minister think he should wait, of discussing the whole subject. before making'comments like that, until he has had our report?",21
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member wants work to be begun at Cockatoo Island, and I have been asked to describe the conditions under which it will be begun. It will be begun, and conI hope, within the terms under which the Board of business men has been set up. I invite the* attention of honourable members to those terms. As for the personnel of the Board, which is to control all future operations at the Dockyard, the chairman will be Mr Farquhar, formerly of Walkers Limited, Queensland. His colleagues will be Mr Aird, of Melbourne, and Mr Brown, late of the Prime Minister's Department.",21
22,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Do the Government propose to give this House an opportunity to discuss the report of the Commission ?,21
23,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have received only an interim report.,21
24,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I refer to the final report.,21
25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes .,21
26,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"There are also some features in connection with the appointment and powers of the Board which Parliament should have an opportunity to discuss before that phase of the matter is completed. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - To that comment also my remark is, "" Yes."" All that the interim report recommends is the completion of the two boats at Cockatoo: and, with respect to the conclusion of those jobs, there can be no controversy. The vessels should be finished at the earliest possible moment. NA ISLANDS AND NEW 'HEBRIDES MAIL CONTRACT.",21
27,Mr WEST,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"I call the attention of Acting Prime Minister to the faet that the mail contract in connection with the Lord Howe and - Norfolk Islands and New Hebrides must be renewed in July. Since there is no one in this House but myself who has any idea of the terms of that contract and of what is generally involved, I ask whether, before anything is done in the matter of renewing the contract, I shall be given an opportunity The subsidy amounts to something like £12,000 for the conveyance of mails and from the three island groups. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - I invite honourable member to put his question the business-paper, and to address it the Postmaster-General. Mr WEST. - I have already done and have got the usual Ministerial reply, which nobody can understand. TARIFF. MANUFACTURE OF CARDIGAN JACKETS.",21
28,Mr GREGORY,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"In the course of the opening debate upon the Tariff the Minister for Trade and Cuspayment toms (Mr Greene) made certain soldiers statements in which he referred to the inability of Free Trade England supply cardigan jackets to the troops. Later, I read a statement which was ridiculed by some honourable members. have now a copy of a letter from the Office, and, if I am permitted to read I will ask the Minister a question thereon.",22
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK," The honourable member is finalize them? evidently dealing with something that arose in the Committee of Ways and Means, and I think he had better defer the matter until the Committee resumes.",22
30,Mr GREGORY,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"Ver y well. I wish now to hand to the Minister for Trade and Customs a copy of a letter and stateable ment of receipts and issues by the War Office, and to ask him if he will give these papers consideration, and either confirm or withdraw the statement which he previously made in connection with this matter.",22
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,Yes . I will. REPATRIATION UPPER BURNETT LANDS - SOLDIEK SETTLEMENT INNEW SOUTH WAXES.,22
32,Mr CORSER,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"I ask the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers), whether he will kindly give the House and the country the benefit of the opinion he has formed of the Upper Burnett country in Queensland from a closer settlement point of view, as the result of his recent visit of inspection:",22
33,Mr RODGERS,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"I have recently an opportunity.of visiting the vast stretch ment of rich and fertile country referred to tralian ir company with the honourable member matical for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), and to General Sir Thomas William Glasgow. I should like time to give a conthe sidered opinion on the Upper Buron nett area, which, unquestionably, has to few equals in the Commonwealth for extent and fertility of soil, and readiness so, for settlement. Its settlement by returned soldiers is a proposition well worthy of consideration. I defer any further comment upon it.",22
34,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"Is the Assistant Minister for - Repatriation aware that for two or three years quite a number of people have been waiting for for lands purchased for returned in New South Wales, and that they have been repeatedly told by the to Under-Secretary for Lands in New South Wales that they cannot be paid or the purchases be finalized until money is I provided for the purpose? Is the honorWar able gentleman aware that in a number it, of these cases great inconvenience and loss has been caused, and will he state M. what steps he proposes to take to",22
35,Mr RODGERS,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"I regret to say that complaints of the nature referred to by the honourable gentleman have reached the Department of Repatriation. I cannot personally accept responsibility for the condition of affairs of which the honormember complains, nor can the Commonwealth Government. I stated yesterday, and now repeat, that the Commonwealth Government made provision for, and this Parliament approved of, an. allocation of £4,000,000 for soldier land settlement in New South Wales. The Treasurer has since supplemented that amount by a further grant of £250,000..",22
36,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"The Government gave Victoria £1.,000,000 more than it gave New South Wales last year.",22
37,Mr RODGERS,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"Speaking from memory, I do not think, that there is one fully certified account for land settlement in New South Wales that has not heen met by the Commonwealth Government. INCOME TAX . Mr FLEMI NG asked the Acting had Prime Minister, upon noticeHas his attention been directed to the statemade by a professor Of the West AusUniversity, as follows :- "" In a matheexamination paper only three out of seventy-six University students tackled the problem of computing the Federal tax on an income. All three were incorrect."" What steps, if any, are being taken to simplify the forms of taxation used by the Commonwealth?",22
38,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,It is said that in considering a problem the first thing to do is to define tenns. How are we to interpret the statement of this West Australian professor? Is it a reflection on the teaching of mathematics in Western Australia ?,23
39,Mr FLEMING,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,I guess it is a tion on Mr Knibbs' curves.,23
40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LORD HOWE A ND NORFOLK,"My answer must be that my attention has not previously been drawn to the statement referred to. I have, however, now seen the statement which was made to the Royal Commission on Taxation. matters referred to the Commission was to inquire-into and report upon "" The simplification of the duties of taxpayers in relation to returns and in relation to objections, and appeals."" The report of the Commission has not yet been .received by the Government, but I hope that this is one of the matters which we shall soon be able to clear up. NA AGRICULTURISTS.",23
41,Mr FLEMING,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeIs it the intention of the Government that , Australia should be represented at the Empire Conference of Agriculturists to be held in London on 14th and loth July next?",23
42,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I have no in formation whatever on this matter.

Item 158Wire netting, per ton, British, 68s.; intermediate, 35s.; general, 105s. Upon which Mr GBEGORY had moved by way of amendment That the following words be added :- "" And on and after 10th June, 1921, ad val., British, free; intermediate, 10 per cent.; general, 10 per cent.""",23
43,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Dampier) [11.28] I should like to be permitted to amend my amendment. I wish to make it operative as from the 31st July, 1921. Wire netting is essential. for the settlement of new land, and I think that it should be admitted free - In my. view, the industry established here should be protected by a bounty. If the amendment in the form in which I now wish to submit it is agreed to, the Government will be given ample time- a couple of months-in which to reflecintroduce legislation in connection with Tariff reform, and make provision for a bounty for the wire-netting industry. I think that until the 31st of July the duty proposed in this Tariff should remain in force, and that after that date wire netting should be free under the British preOne of the ferential Tariff, and there might be a small duty against continental or other wire netting. The demand by members of all parties is for greater production, and that can only be brought about by a better use of lands already occupied, or the opening up of new lands. Tn the opening up of new areas, particularly in remote districts, wire netting is an absolute necessity for the protection of sheep from dingoes and the protection of crops and cereals from rabbits. No one would consider for a moment the opening up of a new sheep station in any of the remote districts of Australia without making provision for wire netting. I remember that, nine or ten years ago, with another, I was opening up some 6,000 acres of land, and we had to put rabbit-proof fencing around the whole area. The cost was then from £57 to £58 per mile, including posts and ordinary barbed wire, as well as wire netting. We need not worry much about the TARIFF. - barbed wire,- although it forms an essentia l part of fencing against vermin, because the cost is smnll in comparison with the cost of wire netting. A vermin-proof fence at the time. I refer to cost anything from £ 5 7 to £ 6 0 per mile. It is idle for honourable members to talk about dumping when the price of wire netting today is more than 200 per cent, higher than its pTe-war price. This article must be used extensively if we are to develop the resource.3 of Australia, and yet the Government ask that a duty shall be i m posed upon it . I admit that if they will not grant a bonus to encourage its production, there is no justification, in view of the duties which have been imposed upon iron, steel, and wire, in leaving it Avithout some measure of Protection. To do so would be grossly unfair to those Avho are engaged in its manufacture, and who will be compelled to pay duties upon the iron and steel which they use in their operations. But if the conditions obtained today, under which the iron and steel industry Avas established in Australia, there Would be no excuse for protecting wire netting. We have in poAver at the present time a .Government Avhose members pretend that they are desirous of fostering production in this country, and yet they bring forward a proposal to levy a heavy duty upon this very necessary commodity.",23
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Does the honourable member knoAv that, based upon present prices, the duty proposed in this schedule is less than that which was imposed under the old Tariff ? The duty upon wire netting today is less than the duty which Avas collected for some years.",24
45,Mr MATHEAVS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The honourable member for Dampier has bad luck with his statements.,24
46,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I have nothing of the sort. The statements which have been prepared for me are just as complete as any which come from the Department of Trade and Customs.,24
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,What Avas the old duty?,24
48,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"The old duty was, British, free; general, 10 per cent.; hut I am under the impression that at a later stage it was increased to 15 under the British preferential Tariff and 20 per cent, under the general Tariff. I know that the duty collected upon Avire netting in 1913 amounted to only £123, A\diile Will the same importation today the duty would be £75,424.",24
49,Mr GIBSON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Fro m the stand-point of the value of Avire netting today, hoAv does the duty now proposed compare with the duty which Avas levied prior to the Avar?",24
50,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I have said that, based upon present prices, the duty noAv proposed is less than Avas the old duty.",24
51,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The Minister said that later. His fir3t statement Avas that rhe duty was lower.,24
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,IsTo . The honourable member should point out that the present - duty is lower than was the old duty.,24
53,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,'Pe r mile of netting?,24
54,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Yes .,24
55,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"-Certainl y not. I do not intend to institute a comparison between a free and a 10 per cent, duty, when wire netting cost £50 per mile, as it did in 1913, and the duty which is noAv proposed, Avhen that article is costing £100 to £150 per mile. I regard the importation of wire netting as of very great importance to our agricultural and pastoral production. The Government have recently incurred an enormous expenditure in sending agents to England for the purpose of attracting desirable immigrants to Australia, and an intense anxiety has been exhibited to secure English reservists, Will a view to pushing forward the development of our back country. But surely we cannot dump these reservists in the bush, and tell them that upon every t article .which they require they must pay a high Tariff taxation. If the Government had the slightest desire to aid in the settlement of our rural areas, they would remit the duty proposed upon wire' netting, and stimulate the manufacture of that article by the payment of a bounty.  then be able to purchase Avire netting any cheaper than we shall be ahle to purchase it under the Government proposal?",24
56,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"B y that means we should be building up the industry. The  Moloney) has argued more than once that no matter what taxation is imposed upon any commodity, its effect is to decrease the price of it. Let us test that theory. There are quite a number of orehardists in his oivn electorate, many of whom are obliged - to cover the Avhole of their orchards with Avire netting.  ists ought , not to he at the mercy of a foreign combine.",24
57,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Honourable members arc Avell aware of. the enormous losses which have been sustained by the man upon the land on account of the rabbit pest, and of the huge sums which have been expended upon Avire netting in an endeavour to cope Will that pest. We also knoAv that it has been used extensively in. some parts of the country by pastoralists who desired to protect their flocks from the ravages of the dingo.",24
58,Mr FRANCIS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Is wire-netting not now obtainable?,25
59,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Yes ; hut only at enormously high prices. Prices have been 400 per cent, over those ruling before the war, and on many occasions wire netting has been unobtainable.",25
60,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I tbinkPthat the honourable member's move is really to prevent an increased duty being proposed, and that he is not actually out to secure,a duction.",25
61,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Not at all. I desire to secure free netting, and make the people of Australia pay by means of a bounty. The Government, realizing the great value of wire netting in connection with the development of Australia, allowed imports from the United Kingdom to come in free. T, do not know that local manufacturers have asked for any duty provided that their raw material is allowed to come in free. The Minister is so imbued with the idea that high Protective duties are of marvellous value to the community that I do not expect to get any concession from him.",25
62,Mr COHSER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,That is a very unfair observation.,25
63,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am speaking as the result of my experience of what has been done so far in connection with the Tariff. The honourable member (Mr. Corser) was, no doubt, placated by the increased duty placed on bananas. The increase was so enormous that it astonished honourable members.",25
64,Mr CORSER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I did not move that increase.,25
65,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I hope, at all events, that the Minister will give serious consideration to the demand for some concession in connection with this important item. I desire, by leave, to amend my amendment by substituting "" 31st July,"" for "" 11th June"". Amendment, by leave, amended accordingly.",25
66,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Wakefield) [11.45] - I hope that honourable members will give very earnest consideration to item under review. I do not know whether the Committee would approve of ihe application of the bounty system to the manufacture of wire-netting; but I certainly cannot support the duties set out in the schedule. I am aware that a new industry for the manufacture of wire-netting has been commenced in Australia; but, while the Committee has been more than generous in its efforts to protect new industries, this impost comes into direct conflict with primary production in Australia to an extent that should convince even those who favour, a highly Protective Tariff that relief must be regiven, either by means of a bounty on the local manufacture of wire-netting, or by returning to free imports from Great Britain, placing a duty of only 5 per cent, on imports from other countries.",25
67,Mr GIBSON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The Minister has said that the rates under the old Tariff were higher. We will accept the old Tariff.,25
68,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Yes . I want to tell the Committee the exact position in regard to the manufacture we are now discussing. The rabbit and the dingo are the greatest enemies of the primary producer in Australia. That re^ mark applies equally to the farmers' within the Hundreds, and to the pas-, toralists outside. The State of which I am a representative has had a rather severe experience in this direction, and other State Governments are beginning to admit that they will have to incur enormous expenditure, as South Australia has done for the last thirty years, in order tb contend with the ravages of the dingo outside, as well as the rabbits inside, the Hundreds. The duty on barbed wire also has an important bearing on this question. In the outside vermin districts, where dog-proof fences have to be erected, barbed wire is a very considerable item. Not only two widths of the netting, but at least three spans of the barbed wire are used in order to make the fences thoroughly effective. I do not propose to go into details; but I may say that, in order to rescue the outside pastoral areas of South Australia from the ravages of the dingo and the de-population which that pest brought about between twenty and thirty years ago, so large an expenditure had to be incurred on vermin-proof fencing that the vermin-fencing rates were the actually greater than the rents for the pastoral areas. The Government had to spread the repayments over a period of twenty-one'years, and in many instances even that period had to he extended in order to prevent the country from being once more deserted. The Minister says that, per mile, the impost is not so great as it was prior to war.",25
69,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I did not say that. Mr RICHARD FOSTER, - The Minister spoke to that effect.",26
70,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,No .,26
71,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Then I shall be glad to hear what the Minister did say, and what he means.",26
72,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"What I said was that the application of the ad valorem duty at sent means a greater impost, at the moment, than the particular duty for which I am asking.",26
73,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"""At the moment"" ? Well, I wish to tell the Minister that the dingoes have had free play during the war period, where vermin-infested districts had not already been provided with fences.",26
74,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,That is the trouble.,26
75,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"The reason for this non-provision of fences was the fabulous price that was charged- a price that the country could not pay. Wire netting during the war was 400 per cent, higher in price than prior to the war.  caxise of that?",26
76,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Largel y the cause was that the machinery employed in this business was being used for war purposes. For instance, barbed wire was required for the war; and many of us were hoping that, when the war was over, and valuable material was being disposed of, we might get it at cheap rates. That, however, has not occurred, and is not likely to occur.",26
77,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Do you know why?,26
78,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,It would be very difficult to say; there are several reasons.,26
79,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,It was not any goodthat was the trouble.,26
80,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The Minister is quite right; the material was of such inferior quality that if it had been brought here it would have proved practically useless.,26
81,Mr CHARLTON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Does the honourable member know that the barbed wire manufactured here is cheaper than that imported ?,26
82,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"That may the be; hut it is still nearly 300 per cent, higher in price than before the war.",26
83,Mr CHARLTON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,".Still , it is cheaper than the imported article.",26
84,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Produc ing interests in Australia, particularly in the interior, cannot pay either 300 per cent., 200 per cent., or 100 per cent, on the previous prices. We hope to get back to former conditions, and, until we pre- do, we must not simply sit down and allow the dingoes to ravage the outlying country. This item affects the wool industry, which is the biggest in Australia. Are we going to hamper that great industry, and production all over the interior of Australia, simply because a manufacturer has started to turn out barbed wire here? If we are going to stand by this manufacturer, I see no other course open to us than that suggested by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), namely, to give a bounty instead of imposing a duty. At any rate, something must be done by the Government, in their own interests as well as in the national interests. Squatters who were doing fairly well at one time are being ruined, and no revenue is obtained from them, either through the Customs or by way of income tax, while the wool industry, which is the largest in Australia, and as a wool industry the largest in the world, is jeopardized. - These remarks apply equally to the wheat industry. We cannot get rid of the rabbits, except on little garden crops, by which I mean small farms of 200 or 300 acres. Farming is conducted in Australia on large areas, and it is practically impossible to do without wifenetting. I know that shire councils have passed by-laws and made provision for simultaneous destruction, but that has never proved effective. The only effective means is to give the individual fanner wire netting at a price which will enable him to encircle his own property. I am reminded that there are large areas of Government lands which are open, and form breeding grounds for pests; this, to my sorrow, I know to he a fact. Every State Government of Australia is equally wicked in this relation, and it is the State Governments who ought to be made responsible.",26
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,They never take the responsibility.,27
86,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"And they never will; it is hopeless to expect it. The position, during the war, was simply one of helplessness, and it is nearly so now, because, as I have said, the price is nearly 300 per cent, higher than before the war. I urge the Government to look at the matter from a national point of view. Honourable members should see that this proposed impost cannot be. to the national interest, if it is simply the purpose of building up one manufacture while many millions of acres are laid waste.",27
87,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"That statement would appeal to anybody if it were true, but what caused the 300 per cent, rise in the price of wire netting-wa s it the Tariff?",27
88,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am glad the honourable member has raised that point, for it is one with which I propose to deal. ""We are told by some honourable members that the establishment of this industry in Australia, even if only by the creation of one big company, will give us a cheaper article. Let me tell the Committee that, in pre-war days, if there was profiteering amongst importers, there was none in regard to this particular article.",27
89,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,They must have been angels from heaven.,27
90,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"No ; I shall tell the honourable member the reason. The Governments of the various States, following the lead of South Australia, given nearly thirty years ago, viewed this as a national question. The great object was to stimulate and increase production, and it was arranged to supply farmers and graziers at prime cost. The Lands Department of South Australia imported wire netting, as also did Elder, Smith, and Company and other big firms, and every farmer and pastoralist was supplied with it at, as nearly as possible, prime cost; in no instance were they called upon, to pay more than 5 per cent. Without such an arrangement, what would have been the position of the wool and wheat industries in the districts chiefly concerned? I ask the Government to take the inatter into speedy consideration; and I say definitely that I shall not vote for this impost unless relief is given in some other direction.'",27
91,Mr BELL,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Darwin) [11.59] - I do not know whether it would be practicable to offer a bounty in order to encourage this industry, but"" I believe that the proposal of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has the sympathy of the majority of members. To come straight to the point-w e require cheap wire netting. If it is necessary to protect this industry to the extent that the Minister considers essential, the only alternative to the high duty proposed is a for bounty. I want the Committee to realise the seriousness of the vermin trouble in many parts of Australia. I am not familiar with the portions of the Commonwealth where the dingo pest prevails, but I know the serious state of affairs that the small farmer and settler is up against with regard to rabbitsThe honourable  last night, in reply to something I said, wanted to know why settlers who had been on the land for thirty years did not fence their holdings while wire netting was cheap. The honourable member is evidently not familiar with the position that prevailed in Gippsland, a district that I knew a good deal about some fifteen or twenty years ago. We had no rabbits there until about twenty years back. Eventually a ,few appeared, but the settlers would not believe that they were ever likely to be a serious menace, although they knew that rabbits were eating out the graziers in other parts of the Commonwealth. Until about ten years ago the rabbits had not increased to such an extent as to be a menace to the holders of land in Gippsland, but today there are districts where numerous settlers, after clearing their land of virgin forest and making it productive, are being compelled to abandon it to the rabbits. This applies particularly to areas of cleared land surrounded by second and third class country, some of it worthless and overgrown with rubbish, and offering a harbour for the vermin. It is absolutely impossible for the settlers to make their own land productive unless they can fence it securely. About that time wire netting began to increase in^, price, and about six or seven years ago the price was almost prohibitive. I am not going to argue asbo what the cause of this was. The question that confronts us today is, How are we to get the necessary wire netting at a lower price? Will the system of giving a bounty to encourage the industry meet the case? The position in Tasmania today is very similar to what it was in Gippsland fifteen years ago. The rabbit is now making inroads on the settlers' holdings, and in a few years' time. I can see a state of affairs arising there exactly parallel with what it is in many portions of Australia, and the settlers having to walk out ruined. Can we afford to see a vast area of some of the finest land in the Commonwealth become absolutely unproductive ?",27
92,Mr FENTON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,That is a pretty black picture.,28
93,Mr BELL,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,It is. One honourable member last night accused honourable members on this side of crying. I shed a few tears after listening to him because of the absolute want of knowledge he displayed of the conditions prevailing in the agricultural and grazing industries.,28
94,Mr STEWART,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,If they were put on some of that land they would talk pretty eloquently after a few years.,28
95,Mr BELL,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am afraid that many honourable members, especially those who come from the cities, continually focus their attention on the wealthy farmers and graziers, forgetting that the overwhelming majority of those on the land, both in agriculture and grazing, are strugglers. They have been strugglers even during the last five or six years, and it is their interests that I am trying to look after. There are too few members in the House familiar with the circumstances and - struggles of these people. I am sure that if other honourable members had the same knowledge of their circumstances that some of us have, they would extend their fullest sympathy to these struggling people. I want the Committee to look at this case in the light of the absolute necessity of providing cheap wire netting in order to save large areas of the finest land from the ravages of vermin. As to what the Minister said ahout the duty today being less than previously, it must he clear to the Minister and others, after consideration, that the wire netting industry today is getting more protection than it did under the 1914 Tariff. Tbat is the point, and there is nothing else to consider. Whether or not that protection is necessary for the .industry, obviously the price of wire netting will increase in proportion to the increased protection that we grant. We have heard from high Protectionists and Prohibitionsts frequently that to give more protection to an industry does not increase the price. I have not yet been able to satisfy myself that that is"" the case. On the other hand we have heard, during the debate on this division, and particularly on pig iron, that, unless a high duty was imposed, certain industries would run a serious risk of being wiped out, and that the working people engaged in them would have their wages reduced. How can that come about unless the greater protection is going to increase the price of the commodity? We want cheap wire netting, and I urge the Minister to consider seriously whether it is not possible to adopt a bounty, as suggested by the honourable member for Dampier, in preference to the high protection which the Minister wishes to extend. If the Minister has any other scheme to propose that will be acceptable to the Committee I shall be delighted to hear it, but it is absolutely imperative, if we are to save many struggling - settlers, and if our land is to continue productive, that we should have cheap wire netting. If we can bring that about without doing any injustice to the people engaged in the wire-netting industry, I hope that means will be taken, so that the settlers for whom I am pleading may be given a measure of relief.",28
96,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Eden Monaro) [12.9] - I urge the,Minister to give further consideration to the arguments of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I am not in accord with the honourable member as a rule, but it seems to me that in this matter he has a very good case. The Minister has said that the duty today is lower than it was.",28
97,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"You need not be frightened. They are making wire netting in Australia today more cheaply, I believe, than it can be imported.",28
98,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"That is the trouble. It is contended with good reason that, although they are making it cheaper in Australia today, they are not selling it cheaper. That is the experience of my constituents who,, I suppose, are typical of many others. If some i of them are big holders and ""squatters,"" that is not a crime. Years ago many of those big holders were struggling selectors, and they have worked their way up from the shearing sheds and the agricultural fields. These are the men who pioneered this country. Surely it is no crime for some of them to be wealthy today, but, as a matter of fact, the rabbit pest has brought a number of them back to scratch. There can never be a golden rule in fiscal. matters, applying the same degree of protection to all things; and this particular article, I contend, is an exception. The industry does not require a big plant, because wire netting is being manufactured in many of our gaols. The admission that the effect of the duty would be to increase the cost of the material should be sufficient for us to cry halt, because wire netting is as essential for the orchardist and the grower of other primary products as for the farmer and grazier. The rabbits have become so plentiful in recent years that in some quarters, unfortunately, have come to be regarded as an industry instead of a pest. Freezing works and other large establishments have been erected throughout the Commonwealth, and the business of rabbiting gives employment to a large number of people at high wages, but it is not an industry that 'we should encourage in any way. We ought never to lose sight of the fact that the rabbit is the greatest curse that Australia has ever experienced. The Minister should tackle this problem seriously and see whether, hy means of a bounty, it is not possible to encourage the manufacture of wire netting in Australia, more especially as it is not likely that the bounty would be collected by two or three big companies or firms. That has been the objection to bounties hitherto, but the manufacture of wire netting might bo undertaken in quite a number of country centres, because, as I have already shown, an extensive plant is not required. Unless something is done to make it possible for the producer to get cheap wire netting there is very gi-ave danger, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) has pointed out, of . many of the richest districts in Australia becoming depopulated. I appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to. the proposal Mr Austin Chapman. made by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). This is not a party question.",28
99,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The debate last week on another item was made a party question.,29
100,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"That is no reason why this should be, and I hope the honourable member for Newcastle will not regard it as such. I am always glad to know that good wages are paid in any industry. The go-slow policy is' the curse. I believe that the higher the wages, provided the men earn them, the better it will be for Australia. We should do everything possible in this matter for the man on the land, because, unless we have a prosperous and contented yeomanry, the . industries of our cities must suffer, and eventually we shall find the grass growing on many of our city streets. The argument of the honourable. member for Dampier is an appeal to common sense. We should, by means of a bounty, help the they small manufacturers to engage in the manufacture of wire netting, so that the struggling settlers, especially those in the isolated districts of the Commonwealth, may be encouraged to check the inroads of the rabbits. Taxation is increasing every year, and these people are up against difficulties at every turn. If we impose the duty provided in the item, we shall only be adding to their troubles. Quite recently, a member of the Ministry paid £90 per mile for wire netting for fencing purposes; how on earth is it possible, then, for our struggling settlers to buy wire netting in order to keep the vermin off their land, especially when,, in some cases, they are' alongside Government reserves that are unfenced, and are nothing more than breeding grounds for the rabbits?.",29
101,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Then , why not appeal to the State Governments? Why ruin' the wire-netting industry?",29
102,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am tired of all this talk about appealing to State Governments, because, after all, the taxpayers of the Commonwealth have to bear the burden, and I think the State Governments are just as anxious as any one else to prevent the increase of the rabbit pest. I again appeal to the Minister to consider the request made 'by the honourable member for Dampier. Surely, if three or four experienced men got together and in quired into this matter, they could evolve some proposal which this House could accept, because, we are all aiming at the one goal, namely, to promote the industry and at the same time cheapen wire netting for the man on. the land. Personally, I favour a bounty.",29
103,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Newcastle) [12.17] If I thought that, by voting for this duty, I should in any way be imposing an additional burden on the farmers of the Commonwealth, I would readily agree to the proposal made by the honourable member for Dampier (ME .

112,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"We always had a duty on the Continental wire, and you",30
113,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am not very much concerned about the Continental wire. I would always prefer the British wire if we could be sure that it really was British, and not wire imported from Continental countries through Great B r it a in . The prices of many articles have increased enormously, and the men on the land have been affected, because it has been impossible to get supplies of many things from overseas, but the position today is quite different. There is in existence in Sydney one big firm which is producing considerable quantities of wire netting. We have been told by another honourable member that that article is being produced elsewhere in the Commonwealth, and we know that one establishment has been started which will be able to supply more than Australia's total requirement of wire netting. That being so, what have the farmers to fear?",30

126,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"That is beside the question. If the Government had not come to the aid of those industries, what price would the producer have received for his products? I did not object to what the Government did in time of trouble. We desire to see the people on the land prosper, and we do not wish to set the land-owner against the people in the cities, but that is what is being done. We must all realise that city and country are dependent on each otlier.",31

138,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I have never been in favour of bounties except when we could get nothing else, and even then only at the inception of an industry. The fawners have nothing to fear ih regard to wire netting. The Australian production within the next few months will be greater than local requirements. There is far too much decrying of the locally-made article.",31

140,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Particularl y not in regard to onions. I stated last night some of the many .unfair things that are done to interfere with the progress of Australian industries.

I hope the Minister will not agree to any reduction in the duties, so' that our industries may be adequately protected. One plant now being established will produce more wire netting than we have ever used in Australia* and will manufacture the wire netting, not from imported material, but from iron ore raised in Australia.",31
145,Mr ROBERT COOK,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Indi) [12.31] I have listened with considerable interest to the debate, and I trust the amendment will be agreed to. I feel that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) is honestly endeavouring to do what is right, and I also believe that the honor(able member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) is quite in earnest. I am a protectionist, but I desire to afford protection to all classes in the community. We have heard a great deal of the importance of the wire netting industry; but very little has been said concerning the pastoral and farming industries. Are we to sacrifice the greater for the benefit of the lesser? The arguments adduced up to the present appear to be in favour of supporting those industries that are of the greatest consequence to the Commonwealth, and I trust the vote will be recorded in that way. There has been a good deal of repetition, and it is not my desire to discuss points that have already been mentioned, but I wish to submit a few figures of interest. During the years 1880 to 1919 Victoria has spent .£1,082,458 on the eradication of |>ests. The losses in stock during that amounted to approximately £6,000,000, whilst those on crops amounted to £4,000,000. Private expenditure in the inatter of poison costs, fumigating, the digging out of burrows, &c, amounted to £3,000,000, or a total of £14,082,458. The New South Wales Government expended from 1890- I could not obtain the figures before that year-to 1919, £69,800 in fencing, and private individuals spent, is erecting division fences, £6,166,466. The direct losses in stock from 18S0 to 1919 were approximately £20,000,000, whilst the losses on crops were £7,000,000, or a total of £33,236,266. The grand total for New South Wales and Victoria is therefore £47,318,724. Private expenditure in New South Wales on fumigating plants, digging out, &c, has amounted to £15,000,000. I have not the figures for South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland, or Tasmania, but I understand that thousands of miles of wire netting are required for adequately protecting the orchards in the last-mentioned State. We can safely estimate that the expenditure in the States for which I have not the details would amount to another £15,000,000, on the basis of the figures I have quoted. I have been very conservative in my estimate; and during the past few months I have been to considerable trouble in obtaining the information. The Victorian Government are at present considering a Bill to provide for the eradication, of pests, and recommendations have been made to the effect that wo should submit to an increase of 5 per cent, in the Land Tax in order to provide money for destroying vermin. In the magnificent Gippsland district, which for some years has not 'been affected, rabbits are now becoming numerous, and are threatening to be a menace to settlers. We have settled 22,000 returned soldiers on the land, and after many years of bitter experience, I believe, their chief means of protecting their holdings from vermin will be by means of wire netting. Frequent reference has been made to the importance of the wire netting industry; but what has wheat and wool alone meant to Australia during the recent war? The value of these two commodities alone has been £400,000,000, which would be sufficient to discharge Australia's war obligaperiod tions. Notwithstanding the importance of these industries to Australia, they have not been given the consideration to which they are entitled. The wire netting industry is not at present in a position to .supply our immediate demands, and until it is we should not give it a monopoly and allow it to bleed the consumers in our community. In 1908, 7,604,453 pairs of rabbits, valued at £336,093, were shipped abroad; and in 1917-18, 13,154,307 pairs valued at £985,109, were exported. I estimate that eight rabbits are equal to one sheep; so that the 26,308,614 rabbits exported in 1917-18 were equal to 3,288,579 sheep. If those sheep were valued at 10s. per head, which is a conservative estimate, because many of them were worth 30s., their total value would be £1,644,289, whereas the value of the rabbits was only £985..109. 'Thus we have a loss in one year-1917-18-of £659,099. Then, in 190S, 65,391 cwt. of rabbit skins were exported. These skins had a value of £304,999. Allowing eight skins to a pound, and assuming that eight rabbits are the equivalent of one sheep, had we been exporting sheep instead of rabbits, the exportation would have been worth £3,500,000. Thus there was aloss of £3,,195,000 incurred by exporting rabbits instead of sheep. The following table shows the exportation of frozen rabbits and rabbit skins, and their value, from the year 1908 to the year 1917-18:Year. Rabbits-Frozen . Rabbit Skins. Fairs. £ cwt. £ 1908 7,604,053 336,093 65,391 304,990 1909 9,181,312 423,679 62,180 347,244 1910 9,652,127 486,592 86,930 566,739 1911 8,362,994 407,034 92,587 498,037 1912 6,494,259 320,887 87,878 576,179 1913 9,306,290 497,568 86,998 620,487 1914-15 .. 10,290,016 531,920 56,437 230,139 1915-16 .. 11,367,538 724,624 51,857 261,868 1916-17 .. 12,674,472 913,142 48,403 433,546 1917-18 .. 13,154,307 985,190 71,991 1,155,824 The Minister, of course, is possessed of these facts, but some honourable members areignorant of them. Last night the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) said that when the farmers had got in their wheat they had nothing more to do until the Great Giver produced the golden grain for their harvesting; but the honourable members for Darling (Mr Blake who know the true position of the farmers, have pictured it quite differently. As a practical man, I know that the rabbits are a pest, and that they and the dogs will be a greater pest in future unless ParClancy liament helps the primary producer by letting him get wire netting at a reasonable price.",31
146,Mr FLEMING,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Robertson) [12.45] I cannot allow the occasion to pass without again expressing the hope that the Minister willdo something to relieve the man on the land, who is struggling against adverse circumstances. I should be loath to injure the trade of Newcastle, but I am opposed to allowing its interest to drain away the life-blood of the country.",33
147,Mr CHARLTON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"We are concerned, not with building up Newcastle, but with making the Commonwealth self-contained. Wire is made all over Australia.",33
148,Mr FLEMING,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Newcastl e is apparently destined by nature to be the great manufacturing centre of Australia, and is at present the chief seat of the and steel industry. I know New South Wales, from the coast to beyond the Darling, and from the Murray to the Queensland border, and to me it seems that the octopus-like city of Newcastle is draining the life-blood of its country tricts. As a boy, I used to see coming along the Barwon 30,000 wethers, four and six-tooth, one mark, which means that on the stations where they were bred there were at least 60,000 lambs in two years. Does any one see flocks like that today? Vou can travel from one end of New South Wales to the other, and will not cross three stations with such magnificent flocks of sheep as used to be seen in my boyhood. Men are being driven off the Western Plains. The flocks that I speak of gave employment to camps of thirty men and fifty horses, and indirectly provided work for scores of trades connected with the pastoral industry, and assisted to maintain the homes of hundreds of shearers. The question now before the Committee is of such importance to the men of the western districts of New South Wales that it astonishes me that the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), who is president of the Australian Workers Union, is not here to protest against the imposition of high duties on wire netting, because his people are vitally concerned, and the bread and butter of thousands of working"" men throughout the Commonwealth is jeopardized, Paterson has written of Clancy, of The Overflow, riding behind his cattle singing, but there is very little of that nowadays. Men like have mostly disappeared. Will Ogilvie tells how many of those who put up a hard fight to break in new country have gone' down. This Committee,' by putting high duties on farm requisites, is helping to destroy the homes of the people outback; homes which have been built up with such stress and trouble. What did Henry Lawson prophesy of the men of those great Western areas of New South Wales whom this Committeg-would now ruin? There are boys out there by the western creeks, who hurry away from school, To climb the sides of 'the breezy peaks or dive in the shaded pool, Who'll stick to their guns when the mountains quake' to the tread of a mighty war, And fight for Right or a Grand Mistake as men never fought before. And did they not fight? This Committee iron would destroy those who have done so much to make Australia great,, and merely for the sake of a small concentrated city industry. I appeal to honourable members to take the broader and dis- more generous view, and to desist from trying to tie Australia's grand manhood to the city streets and lanes. I ask them to help to maintain that happy and vigorous people, for the rearing of whom Australia is already noted, of whom the Empire is proud, and of whom the whole world stands, perhaps, in some awe and, certainly, in respect. We know that the men who set the pace in the recent great conflict were those Australians who had been bred in the bush. Men from the cities played the game well, and to the utmost of their ability; hut those who really set and forced the pace came from Australia's broad acres, where they had been face to face with nature, and knew the hardships of life through drought, and flood, and fire. To-day we would fatally injure their prospects, in casual fashion, because one or two powerful voices have made themselves heard in the cities, and, perhaps, because one who should be present in this Chamber to speak for those men, women, and children - of the great Western districts-r-sinc e they are his constituents-is absent. In making that passing' reference, I do not impugn the honourable member at whom it is directed. He, no doubt, has some good public reason for being elsewhere. But I spent my young days on the wide Western plains, and I know full well the fight which the settlers there have had to wage against every variety of obstacle, natural and otherwise. Shall we now take away their birth right ?",33
149,Mr WEST,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"East Sydney) [12.54] - I intend to use every opportunity to thwart the miserable cry that we are belittling Australia, and that all our actions tend to throttle the man in the bush. The honourable member for Indi .(Mr Robert Cook) deluged the Committee with"" a mass of figures. The effect of his on' slaught was similar to that which I nearly always secure when I have to face a hostile crowd at a public meeting. I fill them up with figures, which get them mystified, and distract their attention from myself. The statistics of losses furnished by the honourable member were so startling that one would believe that Australia today is all loss and no profit. As for the honourable member foT Robertson (MT.* Fleming), I pity him, because he is one of .those unfortunates who has ""chopped over"" from one party to another. He knows, as I know, that the National Caucus is now doing its best to poison' his electorate. He has made his pathetic - speech today with that fact in mind; and, no doubt, since he knows the game, he w ' ll have copies of his beautiful thoughts, as recorded in Hansard, printed off, and forwarded in pamphlet form to every one of his electors and all the newspapers, if any, in his electorate. , Although! live in the city, I am not without friends in the country, I actually have friends in the electorate of Cowper, who, although they are good Labour people,- made the best choice possible, in the absence of a Labour candidate, when they sent Dr Earle Page into Parliament. More than one of these ipoor miserable struggling farmer friends of mine in Cowper has written, asking me to look out for the best brand of motor car that I could recommend them. One of them, who has been for nine years in the electorate, bought a farm for about £55 to £60 an acre. To-day this poor, miserable country man tells me he has been asked to sell at £115 an acre. What a shocking state of affairs after nine years on the land! I would like to find a way in the .city for turning over capital as rapidly as that. Even in an alleged drought season my friend wrote, telling me that he was doing very well, considering: He said, "" I can only send down a little bit of butter, but I get an awfully big cheque back."" There are honourable members sitting behind the Government, whose life interest is in the land, who could buy out the whole of the members of the Opposition. When any one of them dies the probate duties connected with his estate will swamp all the means of the living members of the Labour party. Poor, miserable country folk! Look how soft and sick they are. The delicate honourable member for Robertson, if a drayhorse were to kick him, would never feel it ; whereas, if a hard and wiry city man, who has to spend his life in the salubrious atmosphere of a factory, were to receive that same kick, he would not live to learn what had struck him. Altogether, the man on the land is doing very well. There is no need to cry over him. He has only to ""raise a holler,"" and the.Government come to his rescue, whether it be a-matter of wool or wheat or onions. Millions are advanced to see him "" round the corner."" Bank deposits throughout Australia are enormous because the bank is where the wretched, struggling farmer puts his hoardings.",34
150,Unknown,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,34
151,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,".Franklin) [2.15]. - I listened with great interest to the speech made by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook). Whilst the honourable member, and other honourable members, have dealt with the duty on wire-netting as it affects pastoralists and large land-owners, I want the Committee to bear in mind that, perhaps, the smallest land-holders in Australia- I refer to the holders of orchards of 10 or 15 acres in extent-mus t have wire-netting if they are to carry on their industry. I do not know of one district in Tasmania in which it would be safe for-a man to plant out young trees in his orchard without first putting a rabbit-proof fence around it . Even when this is done, it is often found necessary to flag the trees to prevent them being ring-barked by hares and rabbits as effectively as if a man went round them and scraped the bark off with a knife. We are placing many hundreds of returned soldiers on orchard properties in Tasmania and in Victoria. We often speak of the value of closer settlement in Australia, and there is no industry which is more useful for closer settlement than is the fruit-growing industry. In my own electorate, there are hundreds of men whose orchards do not exceed 20 acres in extent. It is considered that 25 acres is as much as an ordinary man and his family, with a little outside help occasionally, can attend to. We are being asked today to impose a tax on every one of the owners of these small areas to keep one industry going.",34
152,Mr WATKINS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"We deny that. We say that if you wipe out the duty, those who require wire-netting will have to pay more for it. Mr MoWILLIAMS - I admire the fight which the honourable member is put-' ting up from the stand-point of encouraging a particular industry at the expense of those engaged in other industries. I wish to encourage the wire-netting industry; but I utter my protest against encouraging one industry at the expense of men who, in my view, are more deserving of encouragement than are those engaged in the wire-netting industry.",35
153,Sir ROBERT BEST,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Is the honourable member referring to onions?,35
154,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am referring to something which the honourable memrotted ber for Kooyong { Sir Robert Best) does netting or not. not understand, and that is common sense. The honourable member waves the flag in this House, and would die for the flag, but he will not trade with it. It is ahout time that kind of hypocrisy was put an end to. What does the honourable membe ber think about that and onions? I was not here when the debate upon the duty on onions took place. It would spell ruin to the orchard industry in Victoria and Tasmania if the orehardists did use wire-netting for the protection of their orchards. Hundreds of miles of must be used. I have said that we putting returned soldiers into the orchard industry, and before the returned soldier can plant his trees, he must protect his orchard withwire-netting. Those engaged in the fruit-growing industry have io labour hard for seven or eight years before they can look for Is. return from their labour. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) is exceedingly fair. He says that we require to encourage the wire netting industry, and are prepared to do so by the payment of a bounty. That bounty would be paid by the whole of the people of Australia for the protection of the wire-netting industry, and not by a particular class or section of the community. This duty is absolutely a class tax imposed on those who use wire-netting. Without wire-netting, the pastoral industry, the agricultural industry for the most part, and practically the whole of the horticultural industry, cannot be carried on. The Minister (Mr Greene) is asking that orehardists, who have to wait for seven or eight years before they can look for a return from their labour, shall pay tribute to a wealthy company like the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. I am prepared to assist the wire-netting industry, but I am not prepared to allow the Broken Hill Proprietary Company to levy tribute on a class of the community who are unable to bear it. During the last few years, orehardists have had to meet particularly bad times. Every honourable member knows that, in the orchard districts of Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales, thousands of tons of fruit have rotted on the ground because there was no market for it.",35
155,Mr WEST,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The f r u it would have whether there was a duty on wire,35
156,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Of course it would; but my point is that men who have laboured under such serious disadvantages, because of high freights and the disorganization of the markets should not taxed on their only means of salvation. We are being asked to tell those men that they must put wire-netting fences around their properties, and before they can do so they must pay tribute tb one of the not wealthiest companies in Australia.",35
157,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Richmond-Minister it for Trade and Customs) [2.25] - The are honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) has made a speech typical of all those which have heen made during the debate in opposition to this duty. He has talked of the tremendous hardship it will be to the small orchardist if we i m pose this duty. I take the typical orchard of, say, 30 acres, and I ask the honourable member what is the distance around it in chains ?",35
158,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Let the honourable gentleman work it out.,36
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"It is 26 chains, or little over a quarter of a mile.",36
160,Mr WATT,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Is the honourable gentlefor man sure of that figure ?,36
161,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Yes . Ten chains by 1 chain is an acre. There two sides of 10 chains and 3 at each end: does bhat not give 26 chains?,36
162,Mr WATT,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"The honourable gentleman has said that 10 chains by 1 chain is the helpless now. distance round an acre; that is two sides of 11 chains, and that should be multiber plied by 30 for an orchard of 30 acres.",36
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"No ; but I think that the distance round a 30-acre orchard would be 80 chains, which is 1 mile.",36
164,Mr WATT,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,That is a little more the honourable gentleman said at first.,36
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"That is so. The pre-war price of wire netting was £ 2 5 peamile, and this duty represents 12£ per cent, on the pre-war price.",36
166,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Is the honourable gentleman sure that the pre-war price was £25 per mile? I think that his figures are all wrong.,36
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am speaking of wire in Australia. netting 42 inches deep, l j - i h ch mesh, and 17 gauge.",36
168,Dr EARLE PAGE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"And you can get rebate of 50 per cent, if you take a mile the land. of it .",36
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am talking from the trade circulars put into my hands. Take the price as £ 2 5 per mile, and I the duty represents 1 2 | per cent, on that. Assuming that 1 mile of fencing is tralia. required for a typical orchard of 30 acres, that would mean a mere bagatelle per orchard; and yet the honourable member for Franklin talks about this duty as a ridge? crushing burden on the man on the land.",36
170,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I did not say it was a crushing burden. I said it burden that we had no right to place upon him.,36
171,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I do not admit for moment that the imposition of the duty means dearer wire; but supposing that the up this industry from its base the whole of the duty were borne by the man on the land, how much would it represent to a man with 30 acres of orchard? It would be a mere bagatelle; and yet that is the sort of argument we have been listening to all the morning.",36
172,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,What about the wider areas?,36
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I admit that, in the case of the wider areas, if the whole of the duty is passed on to the land-holder, a it may represent a considerable burden. The argument of the honourable member Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) this morning was that during the war we could not get wire; that the pastoralists would be were absolutely helpless, as the dingoes were coming in , and that they could do nothing to keep them out.",36
174,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,And we are,36
175,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"The honourable memsaid, further, that the price of wire netting went up so high that it was utterly impossible for our land-holders to fence out the pests. That is exactly the reason why I believe we should endeavour than to establish the wire netting industry in this country.",36
176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"We got cost price from the factories at Home before the war, and no firm in Adelaide put more than 5 per cent, on that.",36
177,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,That does not interfere with my argument that it would be desirable I o have this industry established,36
178,Mr RICHAB DFOSTER,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I can tell the honourable gentleman further that the cost a of the netting was more than the rent of,36
179,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Non e of these statements affect my argument that our war experience has shown us that this is an say industry which, perhaps, above all others, we should endeavour to establish in Aus",36
180,Mr BAMEORD,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Is the Minister aware that, years and years ago, miles and miles of wire netting were being made in Pent",36
181,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"The authorities there that were importing the actual wire and the was a inmates of the gaol were simply weaving it. It was because of that policy that we found ourselves in the position of a being unable to effectively help ourselves during the war. Instead of having built t blast furnace, we had merely undertaken the work of weaving the netting from imported wire, with the result that we found ourselves in an extremely parlous position during the war, as we could not obtain any wire.' The high price which we have been paying for some considerable time for Australian-made wire netting is largely' accounted for hy the fact that that netting has been made from imported rods. Had we been able to manufacture our own rods and draw our own wire from our own material, using our own spelter, we would have been in a position to supply the farmers and graziers of Australia with wire netting at a reasonable price. The remarks of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) in regard to the immense losses which our people have sustained through their inability to obtain wire netting, are perfectly true. It is because the Government are cognisant of those losses and realise that they are the direct result of the industry not having been established in the right way, that we are now attempting to build it up from the base. The honourable member for Wakefield has complained that we are seeking to impose a duty upon the raw material for this industry. But we are doing that because of the lessons which we have learned as the result of our war experience. It is perfectly true that we have had for some time in Australia looms for the weaving of wire netting. Our difficulty has been that we had not the wire to weave. . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Giv e us the old duty.",36
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Unde r the old Tariff wire netting from the United Kingdom was admitted free. Those honourable members who have spoken upon this item have recognised the desirableness of establishing the industry in this country. Even the honourable member for Dampier. (Mr. Gregory), strong as are his leanings towards Free Trade, has said that we ought not to destroy it. He has urged that we should stimulate the production of .wire netting by the payment of a bounty. But the policy which we have hitherto adopted has been to give a bounty only in cases in which it - was necessary to gradually build up an industry until it was capable of supplying the reasonable requirements of our own people. Where an industry is in a position to supply the whole of bur requirements in any.particular line, we have always protected it by means of a duty. What is the position in regard to wire netting? There is one establishment in Sydney, the capacity of which is 1,600 miles per month. Another factory is in course of erection at Newcastle, and part of it is already producing. That establishment has a still greater capacity than have the works in Sydney. There are several other firms which are manufacturing wire netting, but which are not in a position to draw the wire. Because we found ourselves in such an awkward predicament during the war, I believe, the Sydney factory extended its works very considerably. Then, Messrs. Ryland, one of the best English manufacturers, whose product is more favourably known than is that of any other manufacturer in the world, have come here, and have erected a very large factory which, within a short space of time, will be in a position, along with the other factories already established, to supply our whole wire netting requirements. We are not in the hands of a monopolistic institution in respect of this commodity.",37
183,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,".Would not the British firm mentioned by the Minister have been willing to conduct operations without the aid of a duty, if their raw materials had been admitted free?",37
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"They may have been. But have I not been attempting during the past ten minutes to show ""that it was because we had admitted iron and steel wire free that we found ourselves ih such a hopeless position during the war! Yet the honourable member says that we ought to continue that state of things. I say that it is a suicidal policy to follow.",37
185,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The industry was built up under Free Trade.,37
186,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"It was not an indus - 1 try. In effect, the honourable member says that we must not use our own raw material, our own iron ores, or our own blast furnaces, but that we must use the material, ores, and blast furnaces of other countries^ He says that we should import the rods. and weave the netting from them. That is not my conception of an industry. Here we have an opportunity to make Australia self-contained in regard to one of the commodities which I regard as essential to our' welfare. The honourable member' for' Dampier' (Mr. Gregory) suggests that we should revert, to the'old condition Which was responsible for one of Australia's greatest drawbacks during the war period, and one which caused greater losses' to our primary producers than did any other factor; have' the interests of the primary ducer as dearly at heart as has any honourable member. But I do not believe that it is in the interests of our primary producers that they should he told that we are imposing a crushing burden upon them by means of these duties. I believe that the very opposite is true; and that is why I stand for duties which I conof 14 gauge and under? ceive to be necessary, not only in the interests of the community as a whole, but in the interests of the primary promember ducers in particular.",37
187,Mr GIBSON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Is theTe sufficient wire of the finer'gauges being manufactured Australia to enable the industry to carried on?.,38
188,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Undoubtedly. The wire-drawing establishments the present time can supply all our requirements.,38
189,Mr GIBSON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Has the Minister the - telegram which was received honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Marr) ?,38
190,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Yes , but that does not affect my argument. I know where that telegram came from, and-all that lies behind it. As a matter of fact similar telegram was sent to me. I not wish to occupy further time, but do suggest that we should take a vote upon this item immediately. The Gopossible vernment feel that the duties proposed are not high, but that they are sufficient to permit of th« establishment of the industry.",38
191,Mr WATT,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The honourable gentleman has not yet de°lt with the bounty question.,38
192,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"^When an. industry has heen definitely established I do think that the payment of a bounty is question. the right .way in which to assist it. Of course, a bounty may sometimes be usehonorahle fully employed to build up au industry in its earlier stages.",38
193,Mr WATT,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,But if we impose duties upon this item we shall destroy what previously been done.,38
194,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Of course, no bountycould be granted except fof wire netting manufactured"" from Australian wire rods. One cannot conceive of the payment of a hounty for the manufacture of netting from imported wire. We shall I have to leave the duty upon wire at the prorates set out in item 136E.",38
195,Mr GIBSON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Does the amendment submitted by the Minister yesterday for the imposition of .a duty upon barbed wire of 25 per cent, under the British preferential Tariff, of 30 per cent, under the intermediate Tariff, and of 35 per cent, under the general Tariff, cover wire",38
196,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I have promised the Oommittee, and I told the honourable himself that it was not intended to apply those duties to this particular wire, and that I would take the necesin sary action to Testore that class of wire be to the duties which are set out in item 136E.",38

The proposal to grant a bounty for this particular purpose would, if a the duties were arranged in the manner do suggested by the honourable member, enI tirely close up the smaller manufacturers of wire netting.

This is a matter of importance to' the mining industry. The .amendment I suggest would not interfere with local production. I . have been asked by the Chamber of NOES.

Men working a show with a small battery use wire of this mesh, whereas the big companies, working large reduction plants on a scientific basis, have practically done away with its use.",40
210,Mr CHARLTON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Hunter) [3.0] - I am not quite satisfied yet. I wish to know definitely from the . Minister whether this particular wire-mesh is made in Australia. I quite understand that it is used for battery purposes, and that there may be anxiety to have the duty reduced, or, if possible, abolished. ought not to pass these items in such a hurried manner, but should be furnished with reasons for any action taken. The statement that this mesh is not made in Australia may be altogether erroneous, and the Minister ought to let us know why he has agreed to accept the amendment. Of course, if the honourable gentleman can satisfy us that it is not manufactured in Australia, we may agree with the amendment, but we ought to have further information. There was an arrangement made, in which the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) concurred, that certain items should be passed by 4 o'clock today; and, though it is now 3 o'clock, we have not finally dealt with the item with which we started this morning.",40
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"(Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.2] - The position, roughly, is that there is one manufacturer who can manufacture this mesh up to 40 holes to the inch. The finest mesh made by the other manufacturers is 30, and I thought that, as by far the greater amount used is the larger stuff, we might agree to the amendment.",40
212,Mr CHARLTON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Does the same firms manufacture the larger stuff?,40
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I think so.,40
214,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"If this mesh is let in free, may it not be used for other purposes, and thus compete with other wires ? - Mr MASSYGREENE - I do not think so; the various gauges are used for specific purposes. So far as I can see, the amendment will make no material difference. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 160 (Agricultural machinery, &c.)",40
215,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Melbourne Ports) [3.5] - It will be agreed that, in dealing with this item, it may be necessary for honourable members to also refer to the succeeding items up to and including item 167, all of which deal with agricultural machinery and implements. I rise now to ask that threshing machines be removed from the item before us to item 163, in order that they may have the advantage of the higher duties. I do not ask that all threshing machines be removed from one item to the other, hut only those, machines with a 3-foot drum We or under. Many years ago threshing machines were largely manufactured in Australia, but the industry was destroyed by importations. It has never yet been proved that increased prices are brought about Iby the imposition of duties. In Free Trade countries, where there is no local opposition, the highest prices are obtained. It cannot be shown that in Free Trade New Zealand agricultural implements are any cheaper than they are in Australia.",40
216,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I think that can be proved.,40
217,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"The Prime^ Minister of New Zealand takes a great interest in the agricultural industry, and is fully conversant with the position in the Dominion, and he emphatically says that because of the high prices there for agricultural implements the farming community are brought to a dead stand-still.",40
218,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Thes e implements are dearer here than there. ' Mr MATHEWS - The honourable member may prove that if he is able to. I know that the price of the imported article has increased to an enormously greater extent than has that of the locally manufactured article, quite apart from any effect of the duties imposed. This I shall prove by figures, showing the relative increases in price of the imported and the local articles.",40
219,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"We shall be prepared to go fully into that matter on Tuesday, when we are dealing with larger items.",40
220,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"That may be; hut I fancy that much that is now being done may have to be reviewed. I know the Country partu intend to put up a fight on these items; if so, after the waste of time on wire netting and kindred items, we cannot dispose of - the matter within the next fifty minutes. Further, I may say that I do not see why the implements and machinery mentioned in item 161 should not also be placea in item 163, seeing that all are used for the same purposes and hy the same class of persons. The debate has shown that Unless an honourable member has the support of the Government, it is impossible to obtain any increase in the duties, and t do not intend to weary the Committee in the absence of any prospect of success. I leave the Minister with the suggestions I have made.",40
221,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I do not propose to do anything at present.,41
222,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Dampier) [3.14] This is, comparatively, only a small item, but I ask the Minister to include in it side^delivery reapers, side-delivery hay rakes, combined hay rakes and tedders, hay loaders, and grain drills, n.e.i. These machines are very rarely used; for instance, the side-delivery reaper is an old type of harvesting machine that was used before the reaper and binder was invented. The total annual sale of these machines in Australia amounts to less than fifty. Most of them are sold in Queensland, where they are used for harvesting lucerne seed, and on account of the small demand no Atistralian manufacturer would undertake to make them. At present they fall under item 161, agricultural implements n>e.i., 35 per cent, general. Tariff. That is .the side-delivery reaper. Then there is the side-delivery hay rake. A very limited number of these machines are imported, and they are used mostly in harvesting sub-irrigated lucerne. On account of their large size they cannot be used to advantage in irrigated paddocks checked for irrigated lucerne. As they are not bought in large quantities, no Australian manufacturer is likely to interest himself in them. I shall be satisfied if the Minister will make a record of these matters at present. .It.would be unfair to ask him to make an alteration now, but he can look into them, and may he able later to see his way clear to place on the free list certain machines, some'of them fairly well obsolete, that are still required for specific purposes, and are not being manufactured iri Australia. ,:",41
223,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"We might-postpone the item, and if , after we have concluded dealing with agricultural implements there are any which, on investigation, we find ought to he included in' this item, - we can then include them.",41
224,Mr CHARLTON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"We might' pass the item, and then, if the Minister finds that what the honourable member says is correct, it can be recommitted.",41
225,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I am willing to do that.,41
226,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"If all the items up to 164 are passed, will the Minister agree to report progress? ' Mr MASSYGREENE - Yes , if you give me up to 164 inclusive.",41
227,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Then , when we reach item 165 I want to deal with the whole aspect of the importation of agricultural machines into Australia. I propose to show the cost of these machines in foreign countries, New Zealand and elsewhere, and to deal generally with the question in all its phases in order to prove that the statements supplied to Ihe Minister were not wholly in accordance with the facts. Of course, in saying that I have no desire to reflect on the Minister in any way. I shall hand' copies of my stiggested amendments to the Minister, so that he may have them investigated, and let the Committee know what he thinks about them.",41
228,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Melbourne Ports) [3.20] - The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) wants, in. an "" airy-fairy "" way to get rid of every item up to 165. If we pass items 161-4 as they ' stand we shall place ourselves in an anomalous position as regards item 165. The articles enumerated in thoseitems are just as important as those in item 165. I do not see how item 165 can govern them, but if it is to govern them the position may he made worse. Will the Minister do anything in ' connection with the thresher' I have mentioned in item 161? Mr MASSYGREENE:-I . do not know anything about it,'and do not propose to deal with it now in any case. If ; later' on, after investigation, we see that it is desirable tb do something, we may. ' Mr MATHEWS - I ' understand that the Minister has promised'the honourable member for Dampier to re-operi the'item later for the inclusion in the free list, if necessary, of any machines that the honourable member for Dampier desires. I .shall .not oppose the honourable member for Dampier's suggestion to place the machines he has enumerated on the free list, because I do not think they are manufactured in Australia. I understand that item 160 is to be passed now, and may be recommitted if that is found necessary, Will the Minister promise that if I can satisfy him in the meantime as to the position of the thresher referred to, he will recommit the item for that purpose also ?",41
229,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I will promise the honourable member to reconsider it. Item agreed to. Item 161 (Agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery and implements, n.e.i.).",42
230,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Melbourne Ports) [3.23] - Why is the duty different on item 163 from what it is on 161 and 162? The machines covered by item 161 are dutiable at 22$ per cent. British, 30 per cent intermediate, and 35 per cent, general.",42
231,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"They are nearly all Canadian and American, so that you can say 35 per cent, for pretty well all of them.",42
232,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Thirty-fiv e per cent, is not nearly enough for anything associated with Canadian machinery manufacture.",42
233,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I do not propose to give any more. .,42
234,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,The natural protection nt present is over 50 per cent.,42
235,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,If it were not so serious one could laugh at the natural protection which the honourable member so frequently quotes.,42
236,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"On the single grain drill, without any duty at all, the importing cost is actually 81 per cent, of the invoice value.",42
237,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"There is no such thing as natural protection when a manufacturer is determined to get a market, because he can dump until he has. thrown his local competitors out of business, and then charge what he likes. "" Local manufacturers would do the same thing if they could. I ; do not claim that they are angels. In this matter the . Canadian and American/r manufacturers assist one another whenever they can. If the Canadian manufacturers are not making a certain portion of a machine they get it. placed on. the free list, so that it can come in from the United States of America from the same firm, with the same money invested - Now the war is over, we have' to face the question of re-establishing our position. Europe and Australia are burdened through having borrowed enormous sums of money. The United States of America is in exactly the opposite position,, although there the people have their own difficulties to face. They find that, with the high rate of exchange, it is impossible to trade with other countries. They are forcing down wages in that country by the threat of withdrawing food supplies. It is essential for them to ger into the markets of the world again, and they will do it by hook or by crook. I do not want Australia to suffer in consequence. I do not wish to see thousands of men in my electorate thrown out of employment. Mr GREGORY.:-They will not send us machinery unless we .can send them something back.",42
238,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"The politicians^ of the United States of America are racking their brains to discover some method of improving the position in which they find themselves. Thecables show that they recognise the peculiar position they are in, and I am sure that some peculiar method will be. resorted to in order to remedy it. That country.is our principal competitor in agricultural implements. What position are we to occupy so far as trade with the United States of America is concerned? Although we have the "" stinking fish"" crowd, headed by Knight and Ashworth, the "" buttoners "" for the Age newspaper, talking about economy, and howling that we are "" going to the dogs,"" we know that Australia is as financial, and offers as good a market as any other country in the world. Our finance's are just as stable, and we are certainly one of the countries that the United^ States of America will look to to trade with.",42
239,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"A lot of credit is due to us, is it not, for the way we. paid our debt to the Old Country for the upkeep of our troops?",42
240,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Whateve r peculiar .methods'we may have resorted to to pay our debts, they are not one scrap more discreditable than those which some nations adopted to reach their present financial position. I do not give a "" j o t "" for the men who own the big manufacturing industries in my electorate or for the millions of money they have invested, but I am deeply concerned about all the people who are employed in those in dustries.",42
241,Mr ATKINSON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,What do you want?,43
242,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I want the whole of these articles placed under the same heading as 163A, and made dutiable at 27$ per cent. British, 35 per cent, intermediate, and 40 per cent, general: The Minister has promised certain legislation to obviate the effects of dumping on our industries, but a great deal of damage may be done before he can interfere. The honourable member for Dampier is "" wagging his ear"" for joy at the thought of all the items up to 164 inclusive being put through as they stand, because they are so near to Free Trade.",43
243,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Fre e Trade, with duties of 35 per cent, and 40 per cent.? Mr ' MATHEWS - They are j "" s t as near Free Trade as the honourable member can desire for those commodities.",43
244,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"The articles mentioned in this item are not used very much, and so I was asking the Minister to consider my suggestion.",43
245,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,I know the honourable member desires to have them passed for a certain other purpose.,43
246,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,You will change your opinion next week when we are dealing with other items.,43
247,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I know the honourable member wants to get to item 165 for a very special reason. In my opinion the articles covered by these intervening items are not sufficiently protected, though I know it is useless to submit any amendment unless I can get the Minister's approval. These items deserve very special consideration. Will the Minister say why it was thought desirable to differentiate between these items and item 163?",43
248,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,Because we think the protection is adequate' in each instance.,43
249,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I am not going to ask the Minister if he has given each item his personal consideration, because I might be inclined to doubt his assurance if he said he had, as I know that certain resolutions have been passed on to him There has been a considerable increase in the importation of agricultural machinery mentioned in these items. For instance, in 1910-11, the imports were valued at £ 3 9 2 , 8 3 5 ; in 1915-16, £ 2 7 5 , 7 0 6 ; in 1916-17, £ 2 3 4 , 9 1 8 ; in 1917-18, £183,369. These were war years, but, in 1918-19, after the armistice, the imports were £ 4 1 8 , 1 9 6 ; in 1919-20, £ 3 0 2 , 3 3 6 ; and for the ten months of the currentyear, £341,549. This is evidence enough, surely, that the higher duties have not prevented importations.",43
250,Mr CHARLTON,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Perhaps the Minister will meet the member for Melbourne Ports by allowing item 161 to pass, and making the Tariff in item 162 the same as in item 163.",43
251,Mr MASSYGREENE,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I cannot agree to that, because I think these duties are sufficient. Item agreed to. Item 162Chaffcutters and horse gears; corn shelters; corn huskers, cultivators, n.e.i.; harrows, ploughs other, plough shares, plough mould boards; scarifiers, ad, val., Britisli, 22$ per cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 35 per cent.",43
252,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Melbourne Ports) [3.38] - The secretary of the Agricultural Implement Union assures me that this duty has had no effect upon importation, and that they are unable to extract satisfactory wages fro m the importing companies. I suggest that the Tariff be the same as in item 163. The figures show that for the ten months of the current year there have been large importations. The articles mentioned in this item are of as much importance as wire.",43
253,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I admit that ; but I think you will admit there has been a substantial increase in the duty which, with the extra cost of freight and insurance, ought to be sufficient.",43
254,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"I have already shown that if the United States of America and Canadian companies desire to get into the Australian market, the present duty and the higher freights will not prevent them.",43
255,Mr GREGORY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,That is a reflection upon our local manufacturers and employees. 1,43
256,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,It is no reflection at all.,43
257,Mr STEWART,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Yes , it is. There must be something wrong somewhere.",43
258,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"E v e n the Japanese with their allegedly cheap labour have found it necessary to take action, to prevent dumping in Japan, and it cannot be said that their purpose is to protect Japanese manufacturers from cheaper labour in, say, the United ' States of America. We know that their anti-dumping legislation is not aimed at Australia, BO it must be againstsome other country.",43
259,Mr STEWART,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,lb is quite likely that the Japanese manufacturers are afraid of Canadian and American brains and efficient plants.,44
260,Mr MATHEWS,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Now , if I made the suggestion that the farmers of Australia, were afraid of the brains and energy of - farmers in other countries, the honourable member for Wimmera would feel insulted; but I would make no such statement, because I know our farmers are as efficient as the farmers of any other country. I know also'that our manufacturers are efficient, and that our workers use their brains in an endeavour to maintain their present conditions of living. These duties, together the natural protection which some honourable members so often refer to, ore not sufficient. They are today in the position of a man conducting n lolly shop at a profit of £5 per week on a capital of £10,000. The firms in the United States of America are overcapitalized, and are sheltering themselves behind the high rate of exchange. But they find that that is having a boomerang' effect, and no one knows to what methods the industrial magnates may resort in order to collar the world's markets. Australia being a ' financially solvent country our market is one that the Americans would endeavour to exploit. I shall not further deal with this matter now, but on item 165 I shall have more opportunity of - placing on record the methods of importing firms in thoir dealings with their employees and customers. I know that. I shall-be told that if they are charging more than they should they are making things easier for the local manufacturer. I shall take another opportunity of discussing the whole subject. Item agreed to. Item 163 (Combined corn shelter, husker, and bagger, Sec.) and item 164 (Churns) agreed to. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. COMPULSORY MTTI.ABY TRAHUNQ. Motion (hy Mr GEBBNE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",44
261,Mr FOLEY,LONDON CONFERENCE OF,"Kalgoorlie) [8;47] - I desire to make an appeal to the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) in regard to the compulsory drill of students in the various technical educational establishments. The theological students throughout Australia are exempted from compulsory drill, and I ask the Assistant Minister to consider the placing. of ordinary technical students on the same footing. The various schools of mines, technical.schools, and continuation classes cost the States a good deal of money, and they are a boon to parents who, through them, can give their children an education - that .would not otherwise be possible. I have in mind' particularly the Kalgoorlie School of with Mines, the students of which are mainly the sons of workingminers. During my recent visit to Kalgoorlie I heard of four graduates from that school who have gone to different parts of the world to take up good scientific appointments. Whilst I desire to say nothing to the detriment of theologians, I think that well-trained scientists are just - as good an' asset to the community, and they are also a decided advertisement for - Australia if they obtain important positions in other parts of the world. Six GRANVILLE RYBIE (North Sydney-Assistant Minister for Defence) [3.51] - I am prepared to see that consideration is given to the matter raised by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who may rest assured that the Government are favourably disposed towards trainees, and will do their utmost to insure that no hardship is placed upon them. Everything possible will be done to see that their studies are not interfered with by the drill. However, the consideration of this matter may well be deferred until the new. Defence Bill is before the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 8.53 p.m.",44
