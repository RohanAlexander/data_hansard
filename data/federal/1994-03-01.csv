3,Mr HORNE,CARE AND PARTNER,"I draw the attention of honourable members to the plight of children who suffer from the little recognised disorder, attention deficit disorder, and the anxiety and problems that are suffered by their families. Honourable members may not. be aware that this disorder, also referred to as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was actually identified as a disorder of the nervous system in _the 1940s, but little was done for its treatment or control. It is now known that ADD or ADHD has a significant genetic component and that sufferers have key regions of the brain that function abnormally. Children with ADD have a developed mental immaturity and lack of production of dopamine. Medication is needed to replenish that deficiency and to improve the transmission of impulses between cells. It is a complex clinical problem and, unfortunately, only about 50 per cent of children appear to grow out of the disorder with maturation after puberty. The real tragedy, however, is that in SENATE spite of all that is known now about ADD many children go undiagnosed. Some are even blamed for the behaviour that is the very symptom of the disorder. Studies in Australia show that ADD and ADHD affect 18 per cent of the school age population, mainly males. Boys with this disorder outnurriber girls in the ratio of nine to one. It is twice as common in twins as it is in their brothers and sisters. It causes learning disabilities and secondary emotional, social and family problems. It causes enormous stress on families. Typically, the ADD sufferer is the child who rushes from activity to activity and then seems at a loss for things to do. He becomes upset, often violent, when things or people fail to behave as he wants them to behave. Toys are smashed, parents and classmates are abused. He rushes into the street, onto a ledge, up a tree, without the thought of consequences and, as a result, he has more cuts, bruises, abrasions and trips to the doctor than other children. He is the child who races around all day - leaving a trail of destruction. Some ADD children steal,lie, break, light matches on impulse, whine, badger, tease and annoy without stop. Older children will be the class clown and show off to their peers, even at the risk of life and limb. Parents and siblings have to cope with the marked tendency to be bossy. Their social aggressiveness drives other children away. ADD children tend to have mood swings and cycles, so their behaviour is unpredictable. The result of this behaviour is difficulty in school. Underachievement is almost the hallmark of the ADD child. When they start school they often have trouble colouring, cutting out with scissors, tying shoe laces and buttoning. Their handwriting is illegible and their inability to concentrate has a snowballing effect. Poor performance.leads to criticism, which leads to poor self-esteem and then lack of motivation. So the school's social structure makes the ADD child'sproblems greater. Continuing into adulthood, ADD can contribute to alcoholism, drink driving, delinquency and crime. ADD is a life proboverprescription; lem.· Hyperactivity, distractability and impuldrug siveness are not just school problems but life problems. They disrupt family life, sometimes making it impossible fot' normal social activities. Relationships with grandparents are strained and parents' friendship down. The child's peer group relationships are unsuccessful. ADD really constitutes a major public health problem. It consumes considerable resources and treatment with stimulant drugs, and this has increased markedly over recent years. Prescribed drugs for ADD have rrrore than doubled between 1990 and 1992. search continues into its riddles. Obviously the answer lies in research into neurochemical, endocrinological and morphological compositions of the neonatal and juvenile human. In the meantime, parents have to cope the best they can with the treatment they can get. Certainly, diagnosis of ADD when perpsychologist formed by a medical practitioner attracts Medicare benefits but, unfortunately, the Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee, the body which makes recommendations to the governidea ment on drugs available as pharmaceutical distress benefits, has rejected on several occasions the past applications for the listing of Ritalin, which is recommended as one of the management strategies,'in the control of ADD .. The committee considered Ritalin to have no therapeutic advantage over the listed drug dexamphetamine,. which is considerably less expensive. I have spoken to parents of children who consume up to 15 tablets of Ritalin at anyone time. When one considers that a packet of 100 costs in the order of $75,one can see effect on a family budget if one has only one such child. In a family with more children, the expense is obviously unbearable. The manufacturers of Ritalin are currently considering'making a formal application to the committee requesting that this drug be listed as a benefit for those parents for whom dexamphetamine is not suitable. Stimulant medication is generally regarded as safe. and can bring dramatic improvement for some children, but obviously it carries its own dangers: dangers of the potential for dangers of the 'play lunch' fed to kids by overly ambitious parents in a bid for higher marks; dangers that medication can give children the wrong message that they are not responsible for their own behaviour; and dangers of the side effects of ties break weight loss and depression. Medication, however, is only part of the treatment. What is really needed is a holistic approach involving parents, educators and doctors. Unfortunately, because of the violence associated with the disorder, it should also involve police and welfare agencies. That is why I strongly support the efforts of the ReRaymond Terrace ADD-ADHD support group, which is in my own electorate. Out of personal desperation, Mrs Lyn Mulley of Raymond Terrace started a monthly support group at her home. Meetings have been attended by 20 to 40 people. In October 1992 she invited Mr David Porter, a clinical for the lower Hunter, to speak at a public meeting. Over 100 concerned parents attended. Another hundred attended a similar meeting in May last year. This gives us some of the extent of the problem and the of the families of these children. Left in untreated, children may end up as drug addicts, or alcoholics,or may commit suicide. The Raymond Terrace ADD-ADHD support group has put together a booklet. It has contacted other support groups and individuals asking them to share their experiences in . a positive or a fun way while at the same time offering support for their very real problems. Responses· were received from all states of Australia, from America and from England. The quality of the material was so the high that the group decided to seek funding for .the publication under the community organisation support program, which is administered by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. This program makes funds available to community based organisations to undertake activities with national relevance to the portfolio of this department. If the application is successful, this booklet will bring a message of hope to all parents of ADD children. The message in the stories and poems about ..how much these people love their children and how hard has been, and still is, the battle against ignorance. It is a moving book about encouragement and sharing national understanding with others so that they do not have to face this often devastating ordeal alone. The Raymond Terrace support group has orders already for its book and plans to send it to other groups throughout Australia and advertise it in America and England. The stories. and poems,. some of which have been written· by the children themselves, will illustrated· by other· children suffering ADD. Appropril;ltely, it has been called Angels Disguised as little Devils-ADD. I also recently had the privilege of attending a meeting of. the Hunter support group in Maitland. It became obvious to me that there is a need for wider community awareness. was a horrifying insight into the suffering parents. They told of having .to resort to calling police to control the violent behaviour Butthead. of their ADD children. Some have even· feared for their lives. - any could bruises and cuts inflicted by their own children. It is not uncommon for all the children in a family to be affected. Some parents I spoke to have three ADD children, and they are at their wit's end. Many spoke of the desperate need for resphecare-for the parents and for the children. They spoke of the urgent need for counselling, but essentially the message went out for understanding from the greater community of what· it means to have such a child in a family. For that reason, I am convening a meeting of committee members and representatives of the education department, the police department and welfare organisations. Perhaps after sharing our knowledge we can look to a national conference. We also need to consider funding for treatment, research and parent and teacher education. We need to give consideration to these disorders when setting our national health goals. ADD is increasing dramatically. It has been described as the child psychiatric epidemic of the 1990s. It does not really matter whether this is because of better techniques in its detection or whether there are environmental is factors that are as yet unknown. What does matter is that we must and can do something to help these children and their families. I can think of no better way to celebrate this InterYear of the Family than by providing positive support for these families caring for children who, through no fault of their own, suffer from attention deficit disorder.",11
4,Mr FILING,CARE AND PARTNER,"The youth culture of today is a multiplicity of components and that fragmentation of ideals, styles and codes makes it difficult to know be how to precisely define the young. There are from so many subcultures; so many music genres with .which they align themselves and so many dress codes which more or less reflect the music and video cultures they have absorbed. These styles and cultures are fairly transient too. They surface and are gone It almost in an instant. Suddenly, what was in of is out, what was . trendy is passe and the Simpsons are being passed up for Beaver and In 1980, Alvin Toffler, author of the book show me The Third Wave wrote: As change accelerates in society it forces a parallel acceleration within us. New information reaches us and we are forced to revise our image file continuously at a faster and faster rate. Older images based on past reality must be replaced, for unless we update them ... we become progressively less competent. We find it impossible to cope. This speed-up of image processing inside us means that images grow more and more temporary . . . Ideas, beliefs and attitudes. skyrocket into consciousness, are challenged, defied, and suddenly fade into nowhere; .. Ideologies crack. Celebrities pirouette fleetingly across our awareness. Contradictory moral and political slogans assail us. I might say, Mr Speaker, that this fragmentatidn is making life very hard for commercial advertisers who are at a loss to produce a single image of youth which will appeal to all young people. Coca-Cola is one multinational company which has experienced the problem, developing up to 30 commercials for a single season, relying on animation and computer images in place of images of real people rather than risk presenting an image which some people cannot relate to. This issue was raised last October on the ABC's youth affairs program Atiitude. In that program Adelaide advertising strategist Steven Drummond termed today's youth Generation X and identified the extreme difficulties in marketing to young people. Drummond said: Generation X is categorised by the fact you can't categorise them in any particular box ... Genera"" tion X is really just a series of subcultures a dominant fashion or music force that we can see ... Generation X is a group that is defined by age and not much else. Drummond went on to say: I think it's interesting-the impact of the recession. I think it's the obvious dominant force, particularly for those in their early 20s. Those people really have no identity in terms of their occupation and that's how our society typically defines our identity so a lot of that is coming through that they'll express themselves through fashion and music ... Unfortunately, there are also less favourable methods of expression and it is a very sad sign of the times that the desire to destroy, damage or deface public and private property has become part of today's culture. Many of us take the graffiti of the urban landscape for granted. I will admit that some of it is expressive, creative and demonstrative of some of the artistic talents of young people, but tagging-or the leaving of a single name or symbol which identifies the artist or tagger amongst other young people-is nothing more than an eyesore. It is also an expensive eyesore as it costs local councils and private property owners a great deal of time and effort to remove' the unwanted blemishes from their walls, houses- boats, fences, sheds or wherever else the tagger chooses to make his or her mark. For some time in my electorate tagging has become the source of agony for a numher of local business people and residents. They have watched helplessly as the number of tags mount on the freeways, the street signs and, of course, on their own properties, and they are tired of the taunting of the young people who walk the streets at night or just hang around parks or the local cemetery with nothing to do or nowhere to go. Graffiti has become one of their pastimes. In the words of Professor Julius Sumner Miller, why is this so? Where are we failing young people and for what reasons are they expressing themselves in such a socially unacceptable way? Youth problems have been studied for years. Each study ends up with more or less the same conclusions: that youth today do not have particularly high self-esteem, they lack confidence about their own future and they feel a need to escape the restraints and condiwithout tions we adults place on their lives. Two reports spanning almost 20 years prove my point. I- 1974, the report of the Natiqnal Youth Council of Australia's youth say project was presented to the then minister for tourism and recreation, Frank Stewart. The report entitled Recreational priorities of Australian young people revealed that, of the 1,258 people aged between 12 and 20 who were involved in the youth say project, most had a common view about the shortcomings of youth facilities in Australia. It was noted that, until about the age of 12, most of these children would be involved in team sports. I have observed thatthis is still mostly true, as evidenced in the highparticipation rates in junior football, teebaIl and little athletics, to name a few organisations or activities across Australia. However, after the age of 12, the report noted: Their recreational preferences are strongly in favour of socially' based; loosely structured active arid passive pastimes under their own control. Competi"" tive, traditional, highly organised, supervisecl. goal orientated patterns of activity involving long term commitlTlents are just not popular. It went on to say that young people involved in· the study showed strotig feelings of negativity, felt a loss of belonging or community, resented the. distrust of young people displayed by adults; :missed appropriate social venues and 'outlets and felt uninformed and confused about what opportunities were available to them. Furthermore, they were generally apprehensive about the legal system and of police, restricted by public transport and frustrated by their experiences of school and work. In November 1993, a report entitled A lost generation was prepared by the Australian Youth Foundation. The AYF studied and surveyed 725 young people of many ages, races and socio-economic backgrounds. These people would have represented almost every type of family in every e,lectorate across Australia. There was nothing atypical about them, although the responses to the questions asked by the AYF were at times both alarming and depressing. The AYF revealed that the surveyed youth felt injured in some way by the negative media coverage of young people, They felt restricted by social security legislation difficulties in finding fullor part-time work. TheyJound school unproductive and they felt alienated from their local communities. They agreed that violence was a real part of their lives. They feared racially motivated attacks and sexual assault at home, at school or on the street. They linked poverty to crime and believed that there was a steal or starve principle at work in the community. They felt that information was not made widely available to them. The surveyed youth criticised public transport services limited operation outside normal commuting hours. They also spoke of a lack of entertainment facilities, especially for youth, which would stay open late in the evenings and provide activity oriented programs from time to, time to bring young people together. The report in April 1974 and the one in November 1993 have shown that basically the youth in both surveys have said exactly the same things. They are still afraid of the same , things, they still want the same things and they are still confused about the same things. I intend to discuss these points, because lam also aware that many of them relate to my electorate, which, according to the 1991 Census findings, has a particularly high con:centration of young people. Fifteen per cent of the total population of Moore is aged between 15 and 24. Additionally, Moore has the second highest concentration of young people, between the ages of five and 14 in Australia, which means that a large number of kids are growing up and looking for things to do. Potentially, the situation could get much worse if the needs' of the young are not addressed. I am quite sure this is not something that the residents of the suburbs in, the electorate of Moore will take lying down-and nor will I, as their local member. For this reason, I have formed an association with local business people, police, youth workers, state members. of parliament, local government, young people and others with a view to giving young people the kind of facility that they really want-not one that we think they want, but one which they have indicated and the would suit them and which would help to alleviate the problems of boredom, particularly in the evening. But the members of the group, the Northern Suburbs Youth Development Association, are adamant that this should not be a case of the squeaky wheels getting the oil. Young people in the area must demonstrate that their trust can be earned and that they would be responsible enough to manage a youth facility on their own with minimal input from adults. We want them to be able to make their own rules and enforce them, and to take charge of the centre with confidence and enthusiasm. Such a principle has been successful elsewhere in the world, with Alice's Cafe in the Northern Territory being a fine example of a commercial project run entirely by youth. In the long run, this is the type of establishment we want in the developing city of Joondalup, but it is a longer term objective"" and an interim project is being nurtured to act as a stopgap measure. Already a large shed has been identified in the Joondalup business park which the WannerooCity Council will make available as an interim centre. It requires modifications, but our consulting architeCt, Mr Duncan Jordan, is convinced that it hastremendous potential.' , ' But whatever the building or location, we must be sure that, we have listened to young people and that we create a kind of place which makes them feel comfortable and which eliminates whatever feelings of isolation or alienation they may be experiencing. I would like to commend the efforts of those who organised the blue light discos that are carried out throughout the electorate on a regular basis. In particular, I commend Dave and Dianne Peet, who are responsible for coordinating the Wanneroo blue light disco, which has played such a tremendous part providing young 'people in my electorate with alcohol-free, supervised activities. That something that was lacking before the estaband lishment of the blue light discos throughout Western Australia, but in particular in my electorate. The report Recreational priorities of Australia s young people says: Social pursuits involving relaxed opportunities for meeting each other, dancing, musiC making and talking are highly cherished pastimes. . . . strong clamour for autonomy in their affairs a complete repudiation of adult participation ... but a firm reminder that we have been far too intrusive or assertive as adults about what should be doing. They see an acute need for resourceful adult help given in the spirit opening and listening partnership and not anxious and prescriptive proprietorship .. Young people realise the value of advice from older people, but on a limited basis. They want independence and they want a simplistic gent. entertainment structure-not one that is highly regimented or highly organised. If we are bold enough to test the waters perhaps we will be pleasantly surprised by the leadership qualities and skills of our local youth. an initiative must be nurtured in government policy, but urifortunately it is experienced various and changing policies on youth problems in the past, and none seems a to be able to deal effectively with the pluraliin ty of youth needs. Education has been mooted as the answer. Task forces have come and gone. The Hawke Government declared youth 'Priority One', and upgraded the Office of Youth Affairs in 1985. With the collapse in Australia's terms of trade in 1987, and the fall of the value of the Aussie dollar, the priority of youth issues slipped from one to somewhere lower down the scale, and the Office of Youth Affairs was renamed and moved again. In 1988 the short-lived youth training program eventuated and the community youth support scheme was merged with an array of other community services. Overall, this was a year which represented a shift away from youth as a distinct area of policy, and which marked the commencement of the Burdekin inquiry into youth homelessness. The release of that report in 1989 found in that there may have been as many as 70,000 homeless youth across the country as a result is of family conflict, unemployment, poverty the government's failure to provide adequate services in the area. of income assistance, housing, education, health, and employment and training. They are still important factors, which are making the lives of many families raising children· difficult. One of the government's knee-jerk responsThe es to the Burdekin report was to increase the is not youth homeless allowance and to shorten the qualifying period. The outcome is that since they 1987, when just 940 youths claimed the benefit, the number has skyrocketed to more of an than 10,000. This suggests that some young an people would sooner claim the benefit than reconcile with their parents in instances where that may have previously been the case; when the regulations' of the YHA were more strinA senior research fellow of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Frank Mass, is one critic of the present lack of vision for youth. In the paper 'Shifting responsibility-a Such decade of youth policy' published in the summer edition of Youth Affairs in Australia not. We have' 1990-91, Mass argued: What is needed is a set of policies which embodies valued and positive role, a place for young people our society. Instead there is.asense of uncertainty as to the value that should be placed on youth and. consequently a lack of commitment to a full investment in the future to be offered to the young. This lack of certainty is communicated to young people and their families. By developing a policy mix of carrot and big stick, the government has given the clear message that there is not much of a place for young people ... Clearly, as a direct result of the economic climate the Labor government has created, it can be proven that families are losing hope and that the social problems we are encountering-including graffiti and criminal behaviour by the young, divorce, separation and even child abuse-can be linked to the inability of families to cope with the financial strains of their daily lives, and their irrational decisions and actions are obvious indications that they have been set on a dangerous downward spiral. As Alvin Toffler said back in 1980 in The Third Wave: Value systems splinter and crash, while the boats of family, church and state are hurled madly about. I am determined to work towards a fair go for young people in my electorate by giving them hope and encouragement I have been ably assisted in my endeavours. in the Northern Suburbs Youth Development Association by community-minded peeple such as Gil and Cid Clemente, John Craft, Lance Wilson, Superintendent Dick Milner, Duncan Jordan, whom I mentioned earlier, the Reverend Joe Sullivan, and Dave and Dianne Peet from blue light disco, who have come together with a common goal of helping Generation X. I also have a youth policy advisory committee, comprising students of local high schools in my electorate, which has also been instrumental in raising matters of concern to the young. I strongly encourage other members of the House to become actively involved with young people, if they are not already. Young people do have a healthy suspicion of politicians, and it is little wonder given what they and their families have experienced in the past 10 years. There are many ways in which we as representatives of the people can take an interest but the most important way we can show our interest is to listen to the young people of Australia and establish how they think we can be of the most assistance. I think the result of this would be the formation of more groups or associations around this country-such as the Northern Suburbs Youth Development Association-which can play an active role in working for the betterment of youth options for the brighter future of our young. By tackling the cause of. our social problems instead of having knee-jerk reactions and applying bandaids we are bound to make some headway. At the commencement of my speech I indicated the high concentration of young people in my electorate. Moore is a very young electorate; it is an electorate of families and young people. We have had some tremendous disappointments in recent years, through government policy, and I think that policy is something that ought to be reversed. My, area has the second fastest growing municipality life- within it-the city of Wanneroo. Wanneroo is an area which is staggering in its growth. The demand for housing, services and infrastructure is incredible. People in the Wan-. neroo local council are forever asking me to represent them because they are desperate for help, particularly from the federal government, in providing the infrastructure and services· which many people around the country in areas that have been well settled or developed take for granted. In fact, some suburbs in my electorate have up to eight to 10 families moving in a week and houses are being erected every three or four days. Consequently, the demand on services is absolutely staggering. . On behalf of my constituents, in particular young people and their families, I implorethrough the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon)-the federal government in its budget deliberations to ensure that the infrastructure needs of the city of Wanneroo and the northern suburban area of Perth are not forgotten when decisions are made about the allocation of valuable resources towards the. provision of those important services, in particular for the young.",13
5,Mr SNOWDON,CARE AND PARTNER,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary (Territories) to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (1.05 p.m.)-In following the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I make a couple of initial observations. It is pleasing to note that, despite the vituperative way in which he has entered some debates in this parliament, he at least was able to concentrate on an issue of great merit not only to his community but also to the wider Australian community. / I cannot say that that is the case with all the opposition speakers in this debate. I want to raise briefly the contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and, in doing so, highlight the way in which, in my view, he has used this parliament yet again to attack an individual who is outside the parliament. I do not believe, given the standards that the community should expect from parliamentarians, that we should be allowed to use this House to attack, vilify and otherwise libel people in a way which has been done in this parliament over the last week. This happened to the Australian Labor Party candidate for the seat of Fremantle by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) and the honourable member for O'Connor. I do not mind a feisty debate, nor do I mind the, odd comments being thrown across the chamber towards government members or vice versa, but it is an entirely different story when' we are talking about people outside of this place. Although I have been in this parliament for only almost seven years, I have noticed the way in which, the honourable member for O'Connor and other members of the opposition have used this place as a coward's castle. I think the time has come to call them to account. These comments are being made by a person who also carries on with demonic antics at various times during the deliberations of this chamber and who expects'to be taken seriously by the community. It is not my intention to spend all of my debating time on this issue, but I think it is very important to acknowledge that the time has come for us to ask a very important question: should we be able to use this. chamber to abuse people and to libel them in a way we would choose not to do outside of the chamber?",17
6,Mr FILING,CARE AND PARTNER,"So you want to gag us, do you? . Mr SNOWDON-No, I do riot want to gag those opposite. I am just asking them to be responsible. When those opposite use this chamber to attack members of the 'government that, in a sense, is fair game just as it· is fair game for us to have a go at the opposition. But it is not fair game, in my view, for of anyone in this House to use this chamber or the other chamber-which has been the case over a number of years-to attack individuals who are outside this place. r remember full well the contribution of the Northern Territory CLP senator at around the time when the ATSIC legislation was being passed through this House. He was attacking the personality of a number of key Aboriginal figures in the community. He did so in the confines of the Senate. He would not do it outside that chamber, just as the honourable member for O'Connor will not go outside this chamber and make the assertions that he has made inside here. It is about time people in this country realised what is going on. If we are to have reasoned public debate around the key issues of the time, it is no longer appropriate to have the sort of personal diatribes that have been persistently made in this place by some members of people outside this place. I think it is about tirrie they looked at themselves seriously.",18
7,Mr TUCKEY,CARE AND PARTNER,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order relates to attacks on members of this House and the requirement for a substantive motion. The honourable member has gone extremely close to that. Furthermore, I hope before he has finished he will attack John Halden, who caused a woman to die.",18
8,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CARE AND PARTNER,Mr Jenkins)Order! There is no. point of order. The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. Mr Tuckey interjecting,18
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CARE AND PARTNER,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,18
10,Mr SNOWDON,CARE AND PARTNER,"It is what we have come to expect. This raises the key issues of the disarray which exists within the opposition, the panoply of contenders for the leadership and the sorts of proposals which we have seen. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has aptly directed his attention to those. What we are seeing from the opposition is the view that we need to forget policy; do not worry about the key issues of the day; do not worry about . coming into this. place to have a debate or to raise issues around questions of employment, industry policy, regional policy or the young unemployed. What those opposite do is come in here and attack people. It is significant that this is all a diversionary tactic-and we all know it-because of the plight of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). All we have to do is look a:tthis morning's headline in the Australian: - Dis­ satisfaction with Hewson at a new high'. I will not read the details of this particular article because I am sure that all opposition members have got it nailed on their notice , boards and have sent it out to their electorates. I am sure that all of those who are pretenders to the throne of the Leader of the Opposition are gleefully sitting back in their little holes wondering when it will happensooner rather than'later, I would have thought. The clear fact of the matter is that those opposite have basically abdicated any responsibility for talking about public policy issues. But the government has not. The interesting thing that I find, as I work in my electorate and travel around Australia, is that the comrrmnity is really interested in knowing how we will finally come to terms with the vexed question of long-term unemployment; what the industry paper will contain; and how the government will address regional policy. We have not seen one positive contribution on any of these substantive policy issues from the opposition over the past few. months. All we have seen from the opposition are these vituperative attacks upon individuals. It is about time they were called to order. . There are a number of issues around this question 'of public policy that I want to address. Last week you would have seen, Mr Deputy Speaker, a 60 Minutes report on Aboriginal health featuring the Minister for Health; Senator Richardson. On that program he highlighted very graphically the inadequacy of housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around Australia, particularly in remote areas. What we saw from the relevant Northern Territory government minister was a response which implied. that all the responsibility for thi's was the Commonwealth's. But that is far from the truth. The Northern Territory minister was quoted in the Weekend Australian on Saturday, 22 January 1994 as implying that the Northern Territory government, contributed $25 million per year for Aboriginal housing and infrastructilre whilst the Commonwealth government contributed only $15 million. Let me tell the House what the figures really are. In the 1993-94 financial year, the Commonwealth contributed around $50 million. This comprised $19.4 million from the Commonwealth-state housing agreement; $19 million from the national Aboriginal health strategy; and $12.36 million through ATSIC's community housing and infrastructure program. The Northern Territory government's contribution to housing and infrastructure in Aboriginal communities, in the 1993-94 financial year was a massive $4 million, plus $2 million in kind. But that was a dramatic increase on its contributions over the previous two financial yearS. In 199Z-93, it put in around $2 million and in 1991-92, less than $1 million. . It is not only the Northern Territory government but all state governments in this country, particularly those with a large Aboriginal constituency, which have done precious little to address this particular issue. A great deal more needs to be done. Senator Richardson is quite correct when he points out th- appalling nature and paucity of Aboriginalinfra.structure and housing and the consequent health issues that flow from that poor infrastructure. The problem will not be. resolved by the attitudes being taken by the Northern Territory government. ,Let me put you in the picture, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Northern Territory government has the highest per capita debt level of any government in Australia at around $9,000 per head or $36,000 per family. As its key priority for the last few years, it has chosen to use Loan Council borrowings in expenditure of $160 million to build two great edifices-a new parliament house and a supreme court building. .One could ask: what are the priorities of the Northern Territory government? Using its capacity to borrow and having us, repay the debt, as we are doing, for these two edifices, would it deign to borrow $160 million on the public account to address housihg and infrastructure shortages in Aboriginal communities? What do you think the answer is, Mr Deputy Speaker? I am sure you know, an astute person like you. I am sure that .the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (MrNugent), who is sitting opposite, would understand that the Northern Territory government has chosen its priorities, and they do not address the key issues of Aboriginal health. It has chosen to pork barrel in the most obscene way without addressing the needs of a significant poor proportion of its electorate. At the time when the Minister for Health quite properly and appropriately addresses the public's attention to this very important key public policy issue, we see a response from the Northern Territory which is less than Jadequate. It should have said, 'Yes, you are right. Collectively, we need to do a great deal mote. We need to work cooperatively to do a great deal more and we will work with you'. It should not have tried to say to people; ,'We have done our bit. It is all the Commonwealth's fault'. I think that Senator Richardson has already accepted that the Commonwealth has a massive responsibility in this area-something with which we concur. I am sure the shadow minister opposite also accepts that responsibility. Housing and infrastructure are essentially state responsibilities and these are matters which should be addressed by state and territory governments. But they should be done cooperatively, with the assistance of the Commonwealth agencies, with the use of Commonwealth resources where they are appropriate and with consultation and negotiation with ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations throughout Australia. It is not appropriate for the Northern Territory government to continue as it has done in the past and basically abrogate its responsibility. I mentioned previously the Northern Territory CLP senator who abuses the chamber by using it as a coward's castle, as a place to personally attack Aboriginal people-libel them, in my 'view-who are outside the parliament. On Australia· Day 1991, when' looking at whether Aboriginal people-'-ointhe Northern Territory in this instance, but I assume his remarks apply to all of Australiashould have appropriate facilities and housing, he made this gem of a statement: , I firmly believe we would be better off putting a TV set into every underprivileged humpy, before a water tap. That is the CLP senator Who sits with the National Party in the other cham1:>er. That is what he sees as his priorities. ,That is how he would respond to the plight that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people find themselves in around' northern Australia and, in' this case, in the Northern Territory. It is hardly adequate. I am sure it does not reflect the priorities of the honourable member opposite. I am glad the shadow minister' is nodding his head in affirmation of· what I have just said. . It is about time that the public debate, was directed to this issue in an appropriate way. A great deal more resources need to be put into Aboriginal health and housing. But. .I point out in addition-again addressing this issue of priorities:-that Commonwealth grants to the Northern Territory this financial year amounUo,$1.l2 billion, which is a per,ca,pita grant of $6,635. The per capita grant for New South Wales' is $1,571, so the NoJ1hern Territory gets 4.2 times that which the' New South Wales government gets for ifsservices. . There is 'a very good reason for this. The states have different capacities to raise ,revenue from their own sources and face ·different costs in providing the same public services. We accept that. It is entirely appropriate. I will defend till the death the rightofthe Northern Territory to receive these additional funds to provide services. But the fact of the matter is that these services are not provi<ied. The Northern Territory government, has abrogated. its responsibility and.it· ha!) determined priorities which are not about providing these .sorts of resources to Aboriginal communities-:-the most disadvantaged people in AustraIi,a. I will illustrate that point by referring to some recent figures on Aboriginal education attainment levels. Recently a survey, the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, pleted and the results were contained in a discussion paper which was released last week. The discussion paper contains some very interesting statistics. I will refer to piece of socio-economic data which reinforces the disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in my case the Northern Territory. The average overall annual income of people aged 15 years and over in the Northern Territory was $20,180; second only to Canberra, which was $23,446. The average income for Aboriginal people i.n the Northern Territory was $9,600. That IS less than in any other state. So, on the hand, the Northern Territory has the second highest average per capita income acro-s. the population but, on the other hand, Abongmal people in the Northern Territory a-e. more disadvantaged income wise than Abongmal ?r Torres Strait Islander people anywhere 10 Australia. When we look further at these statistics see the appailing standards which now exist in the Northern Territory. In 1989, the year retention rate for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory-this is calculated on a year 8 base-was 61.38 per cent. In 1993 that figure had dropped to 41.19 per cent. There has been a dramatic drop in the retention of Aboriginal kids in schools in the Northern Territory. If we look at the retention rates for years 11 and 12, the fi?ures replicate th-t of scenario. The retentIOn rates forAbongmal people in year 10, year 11 and year 12 are lower than anywhere else in Australia. These figures indicate the way in which the Northern Territory government has addressed the issue of Aboriginal education. This is not because it has not been given resources. As have just indicated, it gets not only those special add-ons as a result of grants from the Grants Commission but also special funds which are negotiated with the Commonwealth government for Aboriginal employment programs. The fact is that Aboriginal students in the Northern Territory represent around per cent of the total school population, most English is their second or third lancomments guage, and more than 50 per cent suffer from was comsome level of hearing impairment. The primary school staffing ratio in bush schools in the Northern Territory is 28 to one. The Northern Territory schools have no ESL a program, no additional staffing and the ratio is 28 to one. What do honourable members think the ratio is for urban schools? It is 22 into one. This is another element of disadvantage and, in my view, it shows gross discrimination by the Northern Territory government. What it has failed to do is to address the real needs of Aboriginal students in the Northern Territory. It has failed to recognise or provide the .appropriate resources to fund those stuone dents so that they can reach the stage of getting into year 10, if they are lucky enou¥h, and year 11 or 12 so they can get the skills they require to get a job. That is a funda.mental objective of education. Any person mterested in social justice would agree that the platform for people to get into the work force is a sound basic education. The tragedy is that, as a result of the poliwe cies being followed by the Northern Territory government-and, dare I say, other state 10 governments in Australia-the possibility of these young Australians getting into the work force and getting a sound basic education has diminished, not improved, over the last few years. That isa direct result of the pol-cies rate being pursued by the. Northern Temtory government. I suggest that honourable members opposite, instead of going the man and - ort not the ball, should concentrate on these significant public policy issues a-d deb-te the merit of them and not debase thiS parltament by attacking individuals. (TIme expired) , Mr ATKINSON (Isaacs) (1.25 p.m;)-1 find it fascinating that the honourable member for ,the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) is I concerned that we might be going after the man and not the ball. I find his comments about the Aboriginal activities in the Northern Territory somewhat interesting, considering that this federal government has had some 10 years to get it right. One would have to wonder whether there was an election on the 35 way in the Northern Territory. ' for , The honourable, member also made some \Vith respect to policies on our side. One can hardly say that at the last election we did, not come out with a clear set of policies. We certainly did; it was a very definite set of policies. He need not worry-we will come out with a very clear set of policies between now and the next election. The real problem that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has is the fact that we have not released our policies yet, and that there is a vacuum in government policies; What the government has been used to doing over the last few years-it cannot 'do this at the moment""'-is knocking our policies rather than pursuing the issues to develop. and improve this country. This was highlighted by the honourable member's comments, about what is not being done for Aboriginals. The government hashad 10 years to do something and it has not done a damn thing. Now. it is trying to come out before an election and say what should be done by others, what is not being done and what it is. goi,ng to, do in the future. Instead of talking .about what the government is going to do in the ftlture, it should get on with the job and do the dam things.' , ' I would like' it address ail area that I am most concerned about This goverhment, over recent months, 'has had an ait·of stench about it in respect of elements of corruption. This is one of the areas that the honourable' member .for the Northern territory could think serious,ly about getting. SOme of his colleagues to address if be wants to get on top of the problems that they have. Stories in many areas Qfinappropi'iate mechanisms for tendering are rife. There are tnany areas that must be got on, tOP of if this government is to expect to last One' Of the areas that I would'like to address' is an area in Telecom that purchases photocopiers. About four or five yeats ago, Telecom madeanumber of decisions relating to its purchasing requJrements. Firstly, it dev.olved. central purchasing decisions to the departmental management division and deCided n6t to access the DAS 'contraCts negotiated fdr' lmrchaslngthrough the federal funds. These decisions resulted, . firstly, in no fixed pridng guidelines; secondly, in the scraping of the central equipment and asset register; thirdly, in the elimination of purchasing skills; and, fourthly, bulk buying pressures. This, of course, had a major effect on the manner in which the department dealt with the people' that it purchasedgobds from. Instead of having, for example, two or three people at a state and federal level buying photocopiers-and this is the area that I have concerns about-it had a situation where there were some 100 people buying these copiers. This left the systeniopen to exploitation and to unscrupulous salespersons. There are ruinoursrife in this industry, particulai""ly in the photocopy industry and photocopy businesses"" that there has been somewhere in the order of $16 million of over expenditure over the last few years. Some of the companies names that come to .mind-and I am not going to make reference to the companies at the moment because I think it would be inappropriate to do so-are considered as the more reputable suppliers of photocopiers. . These stories persist. Part of the reason I am raising this matter today is that there are some. very specific details. Generally, rumours are not supported by a great deal of detail, but I have to.say that there are some very detailed items of information flowing through. in, this area., I am told that the process that these ut:lscru,pulous salespeople have been using is to inflate the purchase price above the DAS eontract figure and extend the period j of payments for rental from three years to five years; This,in effect, gives the offending companies some two to three times the yield on capital. Part of this yield is offered back as an incentive either to the, buyers by way of free equipment or to, the. salesmen byway of comrnissions.Obviously, the, companies itlVolved look at getting their slice mit of the Process as welL ' The majority of the companies involved are considered to,be reputable photocopier companies. Itconcems me a· great deal that this type of comment' is being raised about these companies. This situation is not restricted just to the few top companies, because over a period of time; the smaller operators who consider they are being hard done by, as they cannot compete, intend to go in and operate on the same basis. So a company may have a piece of equipment-a copier, for example-that would normally sell for, say, $16,000. The price is inflated to some $30,000, the rental is taken over five years instead of three years, so the actual selling price is some $42,000. The kickbacks from this go out by way of, as I say, either equipment or commissions or by way of additional profit to the companies,<depending on the c;ompany that is involved. There are abundant stories about salespeople. in these sorts of situations. One salesperson in particular made in the order of $130,000 in sales commissions in just one month. There are.also problems involving toner, the supply of which 'for the life of the copier in the department has traditionally been part of the price of the copier. That' toner is actually being invoiced separately so that it. is .an additional amount of income for the company which, .once again, can be distributed 'on a commission or other basis. The thing that concerns me the most is that these activities have been known about' Telecom for some considerable time. In fact, two of the major offenders have been given a one-year contract with a four-year option. Telecom is saying to the smaller operators who sell these copiers that they do not necesas sarily have to work by the rules. It is saying to the people in the department that there an opportunity to get free equipment---.:it might be free to them, but it is not free to community at large because somebody is paying for it. In' fact, the taxpayer is paying for it. It concerns me that this type of activity continuing in departments. It concerns me that they have not got on top of this issue, particuoccurs'. larly when there have been internal inquiries. on it. It concerns me that contracts let are given to companies that were involved in type of scam. Let me say here and now that I will not allow this issue to rest; I will pursue it; I just hope that the minister volved-and I recognise that there has been a change of miriister· since these particular accusations were levelled-realises that intend to continue to pursue this matter because, as somebody who has come out of the small business area of our commuAity, I recognise how difficult it is to get into the marketplace in the first instance. I recognise how difficult it is to keep a team of salespeople working on what are realistic commissions and working in a reputable manner when there are people around who are working in a far less than reputable maNner. I return to the earlier comments of the honourable membei' for the Northern Territory, who accuses us of having a lack of policies at this stage. We do not have to come up with the policies because, after all, those opposite are the government.· The honourable member needed to look' behind his' own. minister's door first. He net<ds to look at accountability. This government in recent days, as I would have thought it should, has gone through an exercise in which accountability has started to hit home as being a real problem. . . Unless we are prepared to ensure that people who do not operate in a reputable manner within departments are penalised for in not doing so, and are removed from those positions, and unless we are prepared to make sure that every dollar that flows through departments can be accounted for-not on whiteboards, but on documented paper-then a country we will go backwards and end up with the same sort of respect as do governis' ments in many of the Third World countries; It is not good enough for us to say that we the cannot control everything' and have a handle on every is-ue. We must make sure that a satisfactory standard of performance is req'uired of all departments and employees ill is these department-. It is the responsibility of the appropriate ministers to ensure that that I get somewhat upset about this when I see small busi'nessoperators, one of whom' in particular is battling to keep his house and this his family together. He may well lose his house because he cannot get contracts, not due to any fault on his part but because insomebody else in the system is prepared to takew,hat amounts to a bribe. It is disgraceful. I do not like genuine, honest wotking people I being put out of business under such terms.",18
11,Mr HARRY WOODS,CARE AND PARTNER,"page) (1.37 p.m.)There is no dOl1bt that many of the political difficulties that now face the Liberal Party and the National Party have been brought on by the 'very sound economic management of this government over recent years. From the' time the packages of 1991 that were designed to' stimulate the economy started to take effect, the standing of the opposition has continued to decline. That is well recognised, I believe, in the coalition. Asa result, all we heard from those opposite in that period was fromaseries ofshadow economic spokesmen bemoaning every piece of, good economic news that was released, trying to give that news a hollow ring and trying to frighten people into the belief that the economy is in som- sort of hole and that those opposite are the ones with the answers. We just heard' from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), that those opposite do not need to have policies-they certainly do not have them. They are bereft of policies and unable to find direction. The exercise they have gone through' continues to be' completely cynical. Those on this side of the House-and I am sure many on the other side-realise that if had not been for those pOlicies of stimulation that this government introduced, stimulation that the coalition opposed; the interest rate reductions,which the coalition opposed; the industrial peace that we created, and that the opposition .would have' destroyed; and the outward forward-looking policies that the coalition members never had-or if they did they would never have had the guts to .implement them..,-the economy wou,ld be in tatters and we would still be trying to live off the sheep's back ,We all know that with the falling commodity prices, for our primary products. it would not have been possible to continue that way. Uijder. a government by. those opposite we would still have had high tariff walls and inefficient domestic manufacturing industries incapable of providing the national wealth from the internationa.1 marketplace. The appropriation bills before the House mark a continuation of the strong and positive economic policies of this government. There is no doubt that measures iri the budget, and in past budgets, have been unpopular with some sections of the community. Some people do not like the idea of change-it does upset them. But as the Labor government has done throughout its nearly 11 years in office, we have had the' courage to make decisions which are right for this country and the vast majority of the community. We have not shirked our responsibility in making the hard decisions which are needed to get us working as a competitive and caring society. That contrasts very strongly with the cour-ge and economic policy making. that we have seen from the opposition. Apart from Fightback-at least half of which,probably all, has been. dumped and the rest of which ' really does not rate amention""""':'the opposition has nothad the guts to deCide who should be its leader. The economy ih Australia today is vastly different from that whiCh we inherited from the coalition 10 years ago; In terms of the great amount of cultural and attitudinal change that has occurred in this economy, it is a very short period. We had double digit' inflation a'nd.double it . digit unemployment at that time. Forget the record levels of industrial disputation,.the lack of adequate medical care or social services. Look at the nature oLthe economy that those opposite handed us. Despite being able to.see the warning signs, the coalition was happy to let the economy drift along as it had done through. the salad days when the rest of the world was paying top, dollar for our raw materials. But the rest of the world stopped paying top dollar and it was evident to all that the level of wealth we once enjoyed from our unimproved primary produce would not return. The opposition did; not have the gumption to implement the types of economic. policies that it had recognised for years should be implemented. That ft knew some of the measures that had to be taken·was· evidenced in its support for the moves to ·free up the economy that this government immediately introduced. From that time, the industry has been retooling and is now competing in many' areas with the rest of the world in both' price and quality, and winning. Perhaps it was the opposition's lack of faith in the Australian people and the Australian business community which prevented it from taking the necessary steps. In the decade since those opposite were last in office we have .seen some remarkable performances in the international market. We should not lose sight of the magnitude of change that has occurred amongst our exporters, particularly amongst our manufact-ring exporters, which is helping to place us in a very good position as we head. towards the end of the decade. Exports have trebled, manufacturing production. has doubled and exports of elaborately enhanced' goods have trebled. These are now the fastest growing components of our export trade. Low commodity prices and a recessed world economy over the past couple of years have made things difficult for the domestic economy. The restructuring that has occurred in almost all our manufacturing inc;lustriesand throughout government agencies has meant that an unacceptable nurpber of people have been forced out of work. But this restructuring has also meant that Australian business and industry is now much leaner and better able to compete in international trade. It this area that our employment and economic growth will occur. Three weeks ago the Treasurer (Mr Willis) gave us some useful information on how that is occurring. He advised that gross domestic product was due to grow at 3 1h per cent this year and not at the predicted 23/4 per' cent. That growth is higher than the growth in virtually every other country in the OECD. When we consider that the average growth in the OECD was 1.1 per cent, it means that GOP in Australia is growing at three times the rate of similarly developed countries. The Treasurer also gave us enlightened figures on export growth. He said that budget forecasts were that export growth would result in a quarter of a per cent growth to GOP but now, because of strong export performance, it would add about Ilh per cent to GOP. Exports were growing at seven per cent as opposed to budget forecasts' of 5 3/4 per cent. This growth in export activity and the strengthening of'our domestic economy has had an equally positive effect on employment forecasts. Unemployment is still a serious problem which this government recognises and will continue to address, but the latest figures on employment growth are encouraging. We have exceeded budget forecasts of employment growth of 100,000 by recording 116,000 for the half year, and we are confidently predicting that ernployment. will grow by more than 200,000 over a full year. That is employment growth of 13/4 per cent, not the three-quarters of a per cent forecast in the budget. All this is occurring with growth in the CPI of just two per Gent. . This healthy change. to our economic outlook has not come about by accident; it has come about through aggressive economic policies over the past two years, particularly since the release of the One Nation statement. It is true that the economic impetus of One Nation took longer to take effect than was expected or hoped. That was largely because of a lack of confidence in the business and wider community. '. That lack of. confidence; of course, was fuelled in no small degree .by the opposition is in economic spokespeople who, to their great discredit, talked the economy down at every opportunity. Had it Tlot been for the opposition's constant negativity, scores of people who were hurt by the recession may have been spared much of the pain they experienced. Adding to the lack of confidence was last year's election. Business and industry could not plan their investments because they did not know what they would be facing. They did not know whether they would be able to continue. to work under· a government with progressive but stable management or whether everything would be tipped on its head. A year after'the election, and with investment returning apace, Australia is now set for a period of long and sustained economic growth. The impact on my electorate has also been substantial. I would like to preface my comments by repeating the words of the current, but I believe temporary, Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when he made his address in reply in this House on 19 August last year. He claimed that the budget deficit would not be $16 billion but something in the order of $25 billion. He got it wrong by $11 billion. People who remember that, and many of the other statements he has made, must surely doubt anything he says. With an $11,000 million miscalculation, how could anybody trust him. What do we get from the opposition now? As I said at the beginnin'g, there is no policy, no direCtion and no leadership. Talk' about honour among thieves! From my reading of the Australian FinanCial Review last week, we even have memoers of the parliamentary Liberal Party taking legal action againsieach other. Team work does not exist on the other side. There is no harmony. Those opposite are simply trying to have a fight and to take issues that are not there. They have no direction and no focus. They are busy fighting amongst themselves and cannot find direction at all. The economic policies Of this government allowed me to announce in November that about $16 million worth of tax cuts would be delivered to residents of my electorate prior to Christmas. That provided a tremendous economic shot ill the arm, not only for my electorate but multiplied throughout all electorates across Australia. It gave' .individual taxpayers more spending power, boosted business activity 'and allowed businesses to employ more people. It was the economic boost from the tax cuts which helped Australia record such, strong pre-Christmas business activity. The 1993-94 federal budget provided $SO million overfour years to develop tourism in regional areas and to increase international prom0tion of Australia as a tourist destination, and that·. is of tremendous benefittoan electorate like mine. Of that money, $42 million is being delivered over four years to develop tourism in regional and rural Australia and to e-tablish the tourism forecasting council. . The Australian Tourist Commission· was allocated an additional $3'S million over four· years for overseas marketing and $2 million in '1993-94 towards the establishmentiof the partnership Australia initiative. The package was further developed to encourage growth in tourism ihregional 'areas, to develop Australia's potential for ecotourism, and to extend opportunities in rural backpacker and cl)lise shipping,markets. . Over the course of four years, $23 million has been made available to help growth through strategic planning, the development of local tourism infrastructure and the coordiJlation of tourism infoTJTIation o- a regional basis. Ten million dollars has been allocated for the implementation of the national ecotourism strategy. Fimding will be provided for a program.to complement the work of the states, environmental groups and tourism organisations in promoting sustainable tourism. "" The government has recognised the need to help rural communities to assess the tourism potential in their areas and to .look at coordinated marketing strategies for rural tourism prpjects. Although Australia has diverse and uniquehblidayexperiences to offer tourists, only one-third of international visitors spend nights outside major capital cities and international gateways. . Further strategic 'development of tourism in regional areas such as ours has the potential to offer attractive destinations and,experiences tCi) alLranges of tourist markets, add to. tourism growth .and bring a share of that growth to region- such as the north coast of New South Wflles. Developing policies for growth in regional and intemational tourism is a far cry from ,the policies of the opposition, which would have hit the tourist industry for six with a15 per cent OST. 1 know for a fact that the tourism industry really had great doubts ab,out the Fightback policy of the opposition. We are also implementing policies to improve the lot of low income .earners in the impoitantarea of health. I 'have calculated that 32,000 residents in my electorate. will be able to benefit from the dental' health provisions contained in the budget. On the New South Wales north coast, there are often delays of up to IS months for people awaiting treatment under the state' government's public dental, health scheme. The government has recognised that people on low incomes generally have poor dental' health because of inadequate access to dental care. I mentioned earlier that I could trace current strong economic performance back the One Nation statement of 1991. The immediate kick-start provided through the local capital works program was, I believe, one of the most successful programs run this government, recognising the need to get spending under way in rural and regional areas. For communities with high levels of unemployment, the government provided millions of dollars to allow important works that had.been on local government books-in many cases for a long time-the opportunity to commence. It was not a program of paintthe ing rocks white. It was a program to provide important public facilities, to provide an injection of funds into those communities to get people working. In my electorate, that program there have been art galleries reconstructed, city halls refurbished, tourism oriented cycle tracks built, parks. created, libraries built, sporting facilities constructed, and the much longer list goes on. It is a program that the Leader of the Opposition described in parliament on 20 August 1992 as pork-barrelling. The conservain tive councils in my electorate do not regard it as pork-barrelling, and it was not. I will bet starting tOpUTr now. that there are any number 'of members of the coalition opposite who have taken great delight in attending openings of riew facilities in their electorates and claiming credit for them. . The other importarit part of One Nation the focus on improving transport across the nation with a standard rail gauge and imand proved port facilities. For over 90 years governments' have talked of a standard rail gauge between Adelaide and Brisbane, but our full support. nothing has ever been done. It is this government which took the important step of achievIndustrial ing a single rail gauge with no stops between Adelaide and Brisbane. It will be to the benefit, economic and otherwise,of this nation for the future that that has been done. So many people have talked about it in the past but never had the gumption to do it, this government has done it. It suits the political objectives of the oppoand sition to claim that the recovery. we are experiencing now is simply fortuitous, that would have happened anyway with growth our the world economy. That· doctrine is either to dishonest or comes from ignorance. I have already provided figures on GOP growth that show us outperforming others in the OECO in the order. of three to one. Had we been by achieving the average 1.1 per cerit of the OECO nations, the opposition may hlilve had some realistic claims that we are just the fortunate beneficiaries of an hnproved economic outlook worldwide, but we are not. We are leading the world out of this recesc:sion and it has been because of the measured stimulation that this government provided to economy. While we were providing a stimulus to the economy to get it moving, the opposition was saying that we should cut $10 and billion from expenditure. This would have under only sunk us deeper into recess-on.The Australian people recognise that; they are not fools, as many in the opposition believe. If I can draw an analogy which should be clear to the. motor sport loving Leader of the Opposition: if a person's car is stalling, he does not lift his foot off the accelerator and apply the brakes, he gives ita bit more fuel order to get it going. That is what the government did and that is why the motor is' . Having provided thestirriulus, it is now important that the government ease off the . pedal to get the budget deficit back in order. That is what the 1993-94 budget· was all was about-:-providing equity and the policy framework needed to keep the recovery going hauling back the. deficit. It is a continuation of the strong economic and social record of this ,Labor government and it is worthy of",23
12,Mr JOHNS,CARE AND PARTNER,"Petrie--'-Assistant Minister for Relations and Minister ASsisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (1.56p.m.)-I wanted lobe involved in these appropriation debates specifically to inform the parliament further about our best practice program, I intend specifically to addressI1lY and comments to the government's continuing program to promote economic development to foster· a culture of continuous improvement and productivity in the nation:s work.,. it places. The government has undertaken in program of far-reaching and dynamic wform and this has been designed to improve Australia's: .economic performance. in 1992 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, S'enator Peter Cook, issued a statement entitled Best and fairest, which outlined this government's industrial relations strategy for the 1990s. That strategy was based on the belief that labour markets need to have a balance of social and economic . influence. We believe that it is mutual fairness between employers and employees that makes labour markets work well. The strategy aimed to, among other things, encourage and support productivity gains through workplace bargaining and spread best practice and workplace reform. One of the means of achieving those goals was through the establishment of the best practice program. We could all bring to .mind examples of organisations that have e£celled in their We generally do not appreciate that many of those organisations, which are recognised for innovation and achievement, are participants in the best practice program. I will identify a number of those organisations and I indicate that they are across all sectors of the Australian economy. Some examples are: Aerospace Technologies of Australia, Colonial Mutual, Don Small goods, Dulux Australia, Smorgon, Edgell-Birdseye, Kellogg, Tubemakers, Australian Resorts, Challenge Ba.nk and Australian News Print-to name some of the best Australian companies which have been involved in the best practice program. As an internationally competitive economy we need to promote best practice. Best practice is simply the best way of doing things. More specifically, it refers to the cooperative way in which firms and their employees continuously improve business activities in· all key areas. The besf practice program was announced in March 1991 and the government. committed a total of $25.6 million through 1991-92 and 1992-93. A further $10.5 million was committed for 1993-94 and 1994-95. The best practice program, remains an integral part of the government's microeconomic reform agenda. The program aims to encourage Australian enterprises to adopt world best practice, to identify effective means·· of implementing best practice in Australian firms and to promote an increased awareness amongst Australian enterprises of best practice and its benefits. Importantly, the .program involves business learning fr()m business. Success and innovation are adopted and. promoted as the role model for other firms to follow. The list of companies which have participated and benefited from the program and which are now helping to promote the fundamental concepts of best practice makes.ilh impressive list of achievers-achievers who recognised the potential of the program. It is through this approach-business demonstrating to business the real benefits of adopting new and innovative approaches to work-that we will be able to build a more competitive Australian .. economy with more field. competitive Australian enterprises. These enterprises will be able to compete against imported goods and will be able to compete on the international market. In the two rounds of the best practice program which have already been funded, 43 companies have been provided with grants to assist them in implementing reforms in all areas of their operations. Grants were awarded on the basis that projects were part of an overall, integrated program of· change and incorporated in an enterprise-s.corporate plan, capable of leading to significant results and improvements in the workplace and supported by both unions and management. The enterprises whiCh have been successful in bidding for the grants have themselves been involved in demonstration activitiesseminars or forums-\Yhere they related their experiences and have helped other organisations to appreciate how best .practice can be adapted for their own organisations and develop an understanding of key concepts such as continuous improvement, benchmarking, enterprise agreements and quality improvement. Involvement by enterprises in this program has not been entirely for altruistic reasons. In addition to helping many other, enterprises, participating firms have found that they have made significant achievements and are seeing benefits, including improved productivity, improved management-employee relations, improved occupational health and safety records, developing a more highly skilled work force, greater organisationaL flexibility and building better partnerships with suppliers and customers. The best practice program has been a success and it has achieved international recognition. A report in the Australian of 17 February stated that the. Democrat majority leaderinthe US House of Representatives, Mr Dick Gephardt, .is planning to introduce legislation in June to establish. a program in the US emulating the Australian best practice program. The report also stated that a senior aid to Mr Gephardt plans to visit Australia to study the Australian program as part of efforts to lift US international competibusiness tiveness. The best practice program is seen as unique in the way that it combines government, union and employer support in holding up examples of best practice. These are not the only reflections on the quality and success of this government's approach to industrial relations. Dr Ray Marshall, former Secretary of Labor and member of President Clinton's Dunlop Commission, was also reported as saying that the planned Clinton shake-up of the US system may borrow heavily from Australia's industrial relations experience. This' includes i-itiatives such as occupational health and safety councils, the training levy and the increasing emphasis on relating wages to productivity. Dr Marshall also warned that the US model is a path-to a doomed 'low wage, low productivity, low value added strategy'The US is looking to emulate the Australian strategy of developing a flexible work force that can adapt to industrial change and that can compete at the top of the skills markets. Given that pr-ise and recognition, and the success of this innovative program, I am pleased to note that the government will be continuin- the program. My colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) recently launched the third round of best practice grants and invited interested firms to apply for funding. Of the funding committed for 1993-94 and 1994-95, $4 million will be used to fund approximately 30 small and medium enterprise projects. Applications will close on 12 April 1994. This approach of targeting a particular sector is premised on the fact that Australia's future prosperity is dependent upon the success of the small to medium sized business sector. We recognise the need to develop a genuine best practice culture, enhanced export performance and employment generation. This program is an ideal mechanism to promote business development. To. erisure that the message and benefits of best. practice are widely understood, the Department ofIndus-:trial Relations will hold a best practice week in various centres around Australia over the period 11 to 15 April. The themeis 'Achieving success' and the events will provide with a unique opportunity to hear industry leaders and international speakers. I commend the program and I commend the government's decision to continue support for . this significant and innovative program.",27
13,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CARE AND PARTNER,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (2.05 p.m.)-I am very happy to be speaking on these appropriation bills. I begin by emphasising the importance of policy development in the work of this parliament and the work of the government. It is very interesting that at the moment we have the very extraordinary situation that in this country the federal opposition is like a black hole in terms of the development of policy. The opposition has dumped sections of the Fightback policy-we do not know exactly which ones-;-but it has not done anything about development of policy. Not only is this sad for the opposition, because of course there is no way it can win an election unless it actually develops some policies and puts those policies to the Australian people; it is sad for Australia, because the important thing is that in a healthy democracy the debate should really be on the key policy issues and on the administration of those policies to the extent that there have been some failures. But the fundamental issue has to be the debate on ideas, on directions; on visions,on policies. Unfortunately, we are not getting that from the opposition. It is little wonder that today in a radio interview on the Ranald Macdonald program former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser basically described the current federal Liberal Party as nota credible alternative government. He said that it was basically full of older and superficially more experienced people but these 'people had a long time ago obviously abandoned the idea of policy development and were simply now looking at various forms of approach; such· as personal attacks, as a way of trying to resolve the problems that this opposition has. I am concerned, as I have said in my book on social justice, that there is a very serious shortfall in this country's democracy When the opposition is not prepared to actually develop significant and substantial policies. If we contrast that with what is happening within the government, the contrast is extraordinary. Not only is there vigorous policy debate within the government; in fact, there are policy developments in a whole range of very key areas. We have, for example, all of the employment issues that have been discussed with respect to the response to the green paper. We have the regional development issues which have been discussed in relation to the Kelty recommendations. We have the new paper industry policy. We have a whole range of initiatives in the areas of health and welfare. We have the development of policies and ideas in the areas of social justice and social development. Not only do we have initiatives in all of those very significant areas; where there are disagreements, debate. in relation to them. The contrast between the current opposition's lack of ideas and the fact that these ideas ferment within the government in all these issues is extraordinary. I want today to refer to some of those key government policy developments. The overarching philosophical concept which drives all these policies within the Labor government is the concept of social justice. There was a time when the Liberal Party embraced the concept of social justice. It was at the time of the formation of the party. When the party was. formed by Robert Menzies in 1945, he made it clear that he was disowning the previous conservative approaches and taking a new path. What was the new path? That path accepted the existence of the welfare state as part of society. Part of that concept is the concept of social justice. I will have more to say about this. It is interesting that Robert Menzies embraced an alternative direction for conservatives in the formation of the Liberal Party. That Menzies heritage-there is no doubt that Malcolm Fraser is right on this point-has been totally disowned and lost by many of the key people in the opposition, who, in their ideological grasp of the ideas of Thatcher, Reagan and the New Right, have abandoned one of the key platforms of the Liberal Party in its formation; that is, the idea that, in addition to a market economy, there has to be some form of social justiee and soch.l welfare. A lot of the political debate during the Menzies era and afterwards was really about how we run a mixed economy and how we look at developing those social justice programs. But, particularly from 1983 onwards, the conservative parties did not· debate the appropriate targeting of those programs or the best way to deliver social justice but attacked the concept of social rights and social justice. We had an attack on the ideas that people are entitled to a minimum income when they are unemployed and to a reasonable standard of living when they are sick or elderly. All of those concepts' were attacked by various spokespersons of the New Right, and embraced to different degrees by different people is taking place in the opposition. There has always been a group in .the opposition that has dissented completely from this approach, but those people have always been kicked aside. After the opposition's election defeat, there was the development of the idea that there would be some hope. The election of Dr Wooldridge as deputy leader of the Liberal Party suggested the possibility of a move by the party towards an embracing of ideas of social justice and social concern. What have we seen? Dr Wooldridge has been pushed aside and the same. old gang, the extreme Right, with its New Right philosophy, has come in and dominated the Liberal Party in its direction in recent times. In effect, the debate in this parliament really within the Labor Party. An example .of such a debate concerns what to' do about the long-term unemployed. We have not had a single response from the opposition to the serious issues raised in the green paper; Can we believe it? The government is' about to make recommendations, but where is' the opposition? It has nothing to say.· Yet the recommendations of the green paper-the green paper was put forward by an independent body-to the government have been widely discussed in different sections and by different individuals within the Labor Party. Nothing has come from the conservative parties. The recommendations of the green paper deal. with a fundamental social justice issue, which is the long-term unemployed;' The fundamental premise of the green paper is that the long-term unemployed are going to be in difficulties even if there is economic growth and employment growth. There will be significant employment growth with the growth of the economy. But many of these people, some of whom have been unemployed for more than two years, are going to be in difficulties because a culture develops in which unemployed people lose their confidence and some of their abilities not really in a position any more to participate in the work force. That is a waste of human resources on a massive scale. That issue is addressed in the green paper, which says that in addition to the policy of growth we need other recommendations and' other actions. What has the opposition said aboutunemployment? As far as I can see, the maximum that has come from the opposition is a suggestion that we do not need any further action and that we do not need to adopt a job compact, as recommended in the green paper, because economic growth will take care of all of our problems. That is a nonsense approach to our policy development and it is certainly . a nonsense approach when we are concerned with social justiee. I am looking forward to the government's response to the green paper and I am looking forward to the adoption of measures within the budget. Such measures could involve a is job compact or an attempt to do something for every single long-term unemployed person through labour market programs, jobs'specifically tailored for them or private' sector jobs which are subsidised to helpthose people get back into the work force. We understand that those measures are costly, but we have an obligation as a society to do something about unemployment. It is incumbent on the government, therefore,· to accept the central recommendationsof the green paper and put in place the jobs compact; reject the ideas being put forward by some members of the opposition that we can just let economic growth take care of every issue; anq actually do something about social justice in' relation. to unemployment. I wish I had the time to talk about the other issues of regional development and industry policy, both of which are favourite topics of mine. But I want to talk about some of the issues that I am directly concerned about, and have responsibility for, with respect to social justice matters. The most fundamental issue; which responsibility was given to me by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is the hnplementation of the access and equity program. This is, in a sense, a pre-eminent social and they are justice issue. In Australia we have a society of cultural diversity in which we have managed to bring together many different people through a policy .of multiculturalism, which I strongly supp<;>rt, which allows these different cultures to develop and to enrich Australia's culture. At the same time, we have not paid enough care and attention to the social and economic needs of those groups that are disadvantaged. I, refer particularly to those from non-English speaking backgrounds and to Aborigit.1als. If we, as Ii party and its a government, are to achieve our social justice objectives, it is incumbent on us to achieve the outcomes of the access and equity policy. That policy tries to achieve a situation where every single person, irrespective of cultural, ethnic or racial background, has access to all of the services of government and has equal treatment within the structures of the community and of the society, including equal treatment within the economic structures of society. As for the equity component, we know from the recent report by the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Irene Moss, that members of certain ethnic groups in the community are in a severely disadvantaged position. This is not a phenomenon merely of the first generation. Irene Moss makes the important point that, in the case of certain ethnic groups, the disadvantages and discrimination can carryon into the second generation and even' further. She has warned that there is a danger not merely that we will have a society of the rich and the poor-because, of course, they always exist-but that we wiU have a division whereby atIeast some people of nonEnglish speaking background will continue over the generations to be economically and socially disadvantaged. That is an unacceptable position from the point of view of social justice. It is therefore. important that access and equity not merely be words and a few programs here and there but actually be a policy that penetrates, as is intended, aU of the g(;>vel1lment departments, all of the services provided by government and, through that process and through changing community attitudes, all of society. The access and equity strategy has gone through some transfonnations. The main focus at the moment is on ensuring much greater participation by people of non-English speaking background in all realms of society and in all structures, ing government structures. That participation has to be undertaken by looking concretely at what has actually happened and saying, 'Wen, that is not good enough, let's do better'. Government departments have to do this. They have to look at the composition of their emplbyees. They have to look at the targeting of their policies. They have to be able to say, 'Are we actually doing enough for those people .who have been either directly or indirectly discriminated against because of racial or ethnic background?'. I believe that such a strategy has to be implemented in a very serious way. As I have indicated since assuming this responsibility, it is my intention to discuss these matters with the ministers of all the key portfolios in government to see whether we can set concrete goals and achieve targets in these areas. We certainly need strategies. Let me give the House one example. In the area of migrants in employment,' Irene Moss points out that there are some ethnic groups where, for what appear to be cultural factors or insufficient knowledge of English, unemployment is much higher than it is for the average community or even for the average of some other ethnic groups. So we need a migrant employment strategy. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is adopting such a strategy. I wiIlbe working with the minister to help develop that strategy. We need a range of strategies across the departments of government to achieve concrete social justice outcomes for all people. It is no longer good enough for us to have the philosophy in place. We need concrete outcomes as well. (Time expired)",29
14,Mr JENKINS,CARE AND PARTNER,"The biggest issue that confronts Australia remains unemployment. The government must be vigilant in not allowing the recent run of positive economic indicators to result in a lessening of its political will to tackle this problem,because It would be a lost opportunity. There continues to be recognition in the community that growth alone will not be enough to deal with the problem of unemployment. For example, in December last year includthere were 126,000 Victorians who were defined as long-tenn unemployed. It has been estimated that by June 1998, with current policy settings in place and economic growth alone providing jobs, this figure couldstiU be as high as 81,000. This figure is far too high. Unfortunately, unemployment does. not affect all regions equally. In parts of the electorate of Scullin the problem of long-tenn unemployment has become endemic. .For example, in the ci,ty of Whittlesea, which has over 100,000 residents, there are 8,000 unemployed people-nearly 16 per cent, an- over 3;000 of these are long-tenn unemployed. . If we look at the figures released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which did an analysis by region of long-term, unemployment rates as of August last year, the two regions most relevant to the seat of SculIin have long-term unemployment rates over the Australia-wide rate of 3.9 per cent-northeastern Melbourne has 5.9 per cent and north-western Melbourne has 6.7 per cent. For those affected it is rather trite to say that it is a tragedy; It is a tragedy for not only the individuals but the families and the wider community. Again I say in this chamber that these people look to a Labor government as the only hope for assistance. There is a considerable level of appreciation in the community of the depth of the problem and an understanding that government must take bold steps to deal 'with it. I have to say that reportS that have appeared in the media recently suggesting that the government is considering a relatively modest package of measures financ;:edsolely by spending cuts and privatisation are alamiing. The proposal for a jobs compact contained in a paper prepared by the expert committee on employment opportunities set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) involves· additional expenditure in the order of $1.3 billion in 1994-95 and $2 billion in 1995-96. In my view these figures are the absolute minimum that a government should consider. Already, however, rumour abounds that the suggestion of the proposed jobs levy to finance this additional expenditure is, if not off the table, close to the edge-to paraphrase the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). It is unfortunate, that more consideration has not been given to this proposal. There has been a considerable amount of work conducted by ACOSS and others which clearly shows how an income tax surcharge could be introduced at progressive rates from zero to five per cent with ""adequate protection for low income earners. This levy could potentially raise between $3 billion and $4 billion peraninim. There is some preparedness in the community for this. People understand why the levy is being considered. It is up to government to not lack the political will. In this context it is important to remember that Australia is a low tax country by OECD standards. In 1992 general government revenue in Australia totalled 33.3 per cent of GDP-the, second lowest in the OECD. More recent figures place Australia at the bottom of the OECD tax table. If the jobs levy is not to be considered, there are other options. For instance, the ACOSS submission to the committee looking into employment opportunities lists a number of options. First, it proposes the reintroduction of a national gift and inheritance tax. ACOSS points out that appropriate exemptions and arrangements canbe made to meet the reasonable requirements of spouses and rural landholders. It estimates that, over time, this tax would raise about $2 billion. Secondly, ACOSS proposes that loopholes in the capital gains tax be closed. Improving the efficiency of investment could raise about $300 billion. Thirdly, ACOSS suggests that the second round of One Nation tax cuts be abandoned, with a potential saving of $3.6 billion. Fourthly, ACOSS calls for the introduction of a wealth tax aT)d. makes the point that most OECD countries have such a tax. Fifthly, ACOSS calls for a reduction of superannuation concessions for high income earners. This is a matter that I have raised in the past on more than one occasion and I do not mind revisiting it yet again. This government has given' strong and consistent support to private retirement incomes. As the Prime Minister has stated in the past, this is the first government since Federation to recognise the right of all Australian workers toi superanmiation; the first to actively support its extension to areas of the work force long left forgotten. But there' are other points which need further consideration, inclu-ing the fairness of the generous tax concessions afforded to superannuation. The flat tax rate of 15 per cent introduced in May 1988 still represents a considerable concession to wealthy taxpayers who would normally be subject to the top marginal rate of taxation on employment and investment income. I have previously quoted Rick Krever,a senior lecturer in law at Monash University. I wish to quote from some of his work which appeared in the journal Impact in July 1988, where he made some comments on the effects of the May 1988 statement. Krever had this to say about the regressive aspect of th- impact of taxation expenditures: The level of government subsidy has dropped, but the upside-down effect remains untouched. Compared to the tax that would normally be levied on a taxpayer's remuneration and investment income, the new tax on contributions and fund earnings represents no concession for lowest .income taxpayMaintenance ers, a slight concession for low illcome taxpayers and a massive concession for high income taxpayers. Only the rich continue to enjoy significant tax hand-outs from the concessions. . In 1989, these tax concessions amounted to about $4 billion in forgone tax. In its submission, ACOSS points out that if the 15 per cent tax on employer contributions and fund earnings could instead be levied at the marginal rate of the taxpayer, minus an annual flat rebate,around $400 million could be raised and taxation would be far more equitable. It is also relevant to consider what use this enormous pool of national superannuation savings is being put to. One question which has not received sufficient public attention is the need for a requirement to invest superannuation funds in public i,nfrastructure and other publicly useful projects. Each year superannuation assets grow by a massive sum. In 1989.it was estimated that current savings in superannuation funds were in excess of $100 billion-three times the 1982-83 level. As a result of the government's actions since 1983, it is estimated that by the year 2000 superannuation funds will receive more than $30 billion a year in new contributions, leading to a growth in assets of about $60 billion a year. As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) stated at the time, the political issue of the 1990s will be how as a nation we can best use this pool of national savings. l'he Deputy Prime Minister pointed correctly to the needs of Australian infrastructur- not only for expansion of infrastructure but also for maintenance of existing infrastructure. The need was identified clearly in the main conclusions of an 1987 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which was another Langmore repqrt, maybe more important than this week's Langmore report. The report had this to say: ... there is no reason to believe that Australia will be immune from a build""upof rehabilitation needs of the type that has occurred in other developed nations. and replacement needs will substantially increase during the rest of this.century due to the overall age pattern of Australian infrastructure. There are still significant gaps in Australian infrastructure networks, all of which it would be desirable to fill and some of which it is essential to fill. We may have to cope with the ageing of much of our existing infrastructure before we have completed many of its networks. ' A similar recognition of Australia's needs into the next century, although ona slightly different, tack, led to. a recommendation includep in the report Australia reconstructed for the creation' of the national development fund. This report' suggested that savings of superannuation funds might be directed to new industrial capacity and housing. It is high time that this. proposal was re-examined adding inf-asttucture as a priority. I was saddened to see in an article in the Australian yesterday that a further suggestion that had been put on the table for use of superannuation funds-that is a proposal to force the superannuatiori industry to invest in smaller businesses and venture capital-might also be slipping off the table. The report in the Australian indicates that the former Minister for Industry, Technology and. Regional. Development, the .honourable member for Maribyrnong . (Mr Griffiths), had this under consideration before the new Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) replaced him. I hope that this is not the case and that a worthwhile suggestion such as this can fonn part of the industry statement. I welcome the suggestion in the report that a further element of the proposal is still under consideration, whichwouldbe.an imprOvement on the One Nation tax breaks that aimed' to encourage superannuation funds and others to invest in small and .medium sized businesses and in large infrastructure projects. .' ACOSS- in its submission, also called for the effective rate of fringe benefits tax on concession ally taxed fringe benefits to be raised· and the introduction of sales tax on certain luxury items. All of these proposals at least merit further investigation. Others have suggested other ways in which revenue could be raised to fund the jobs compact and other measures without spending cuts or privatisation. There have been calls for the restoration of a 60 per cent marginal tax rate for taxpayers earning more than $75,000 and fora minimum corporate tax rate of 20 per cent. I support the earnest consideration of these propositions because it has to be stressed again and again that Australia is a low tax country by international standards. These proposals are in accordance with the basic f-irness of the Australian people. Those opposite and other specialist interest groups in the community will cry crocodile tears about the detrimental effect of tax rises, but in this regard I am reminded of the recent statements of the highly regarded economics professor from Harvard University, John Kenneth Galbraith. Speaking about the vexatious problem .of unemployment, he commented: Tax relief as a remedy qm rightly be ruled out. effect on private expenditure and the broad flow aggregate demand is at best theoretical. Those who propose tax reduction as an economic stimulus are usually concerned with advancing personal pecuniary interests. Galbraith went on to argue: There remains only one effective course of public action to break out from stagnation and the unemployment equilibrium. That is peace time expenditure to do what wartime expenditure did to end the Great Depression. We may prefer an economic society where this is not. necessary. Unfortunately it does not exist. This is a crucial point, an inescapable reality. Earlier, I suggested that the jobs compact was the bare minimum that thegovernnient should consider in response to the problem of unemployment. Economic growth will provide jobs for many unemployed people, but the most disadvantaged job seekers-the young, mature aged, those fiomnon-English speaking backgrounds and those with. disabilities-will miss out if we rely on growth alone. Earlier in my speech I quoted from the paper put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which analysed long-term unemployment. In considering this issue, I heartily endorse the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who spoke before me. The paper put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics had this to say about long-term unemployment trends: Over the last ten years, migrants from Non-English Speaking Background Countries have consistently had the highest long-term unemployment rates, while migrants from Main English Speaking Background Countries generally experienced similar long-term unemployment rates to people born in Australia. If we are to appropriately address the present problems of unemployed people, especially long-term unemployed people, we must address the special needs of those people from non-English speaking backgrounds. In the process that has been currently undertaken to try to realistically have a look at the way in which employment can be created, we should take a realistic reassessment of what we mean by the nature of work. It may well be that for some people the traditional concept of a full time job is no longer appropriate or possible. Our social security system is based around Its these traditional notions and,as such, it is of very inflexible when dealing with pari-time work, voluntary work and other forms of endeavour. Government must also reconsider the sort of employment undertaken by the public seCtor, taking proper account of its social usefulness as well as its economic costs and benefits. Dr John Quiggin, fellow in the centre for economic policy and research at the ANU, has recently pointed out that the best way to solve unemployment is to hire people. Quiggin's analysis is based on the premise that the fundamental cause of unemployment is the decline in the demand for labour, primarily in the health and education sectors. In other words, the publicly financed community services sector has not continued the postwar expansion, thereby compensating·for the contraction of employment in older sectors such as manufacturing. Quiggin argues for the expansion of community and public service employment t025 per cent of the laboUT force. This would entail the creation of about 350,000 new jobs. Quiggin points out that such an approach is in keeping with the ethos enshrined in the 1945 white paper entitled Full employmentfor Australia, whiCh recognised the importance of the social wage. It is perhaps relevant to again look at that white paper and make the following observation about what it said: In Australia, a significant contribution to standards has been made in the past, and will continue to be made, by a higher level of social services. Some of these are in the form of direct money payments, such as invalid and old age pensions, child endowment and widow's pensions. Others are services provided directly by government authorities, including education, health and medical services, kindergartens and libraries. Whose electorate could not see an improvement in these facilities? It would beunfortunate if the opportunity to do this was lost because of an attachment to arbitrary targets, such as the deficit as a percentage of GDP by a fixed date. Government and community must recognise that the private sector has repeatedly failed this country at times of crisis. At the moment, the conditions for the private sector could hardly be better. There is record low inflation, low interest rates, a 33 per cent corporate tax rate, record industrial peace and extended wage restraint. This government has done more than any government in the nation's history, certainly more than the Liberals could ever achieve, to create a climate conducive to investment and growth, yet unemployment remains unacceptably high. There has been a considerable amount of debate about what ought to constitute an appropriate level of migration as we emerge from the recession. The economiC debate gives cogent cases both for and against. I urge the government to look at this in the context of an appropriate population policy. In conclusion, in his 1979 Boyer Lecture Bob Hawke spoke perceptively and persuasively about the. importance of full employment in postwar Australia. FulI employment was the cement that bound our society together and enabled us to face the challenges of a changing world and to some extent nurture. a degree of compassion for the less privileged amongst us. That cement is crumbling and as it crumbles we can' discern the beginnings of fracture in our society. Indeed, it is not difficult to perceive the emergence of two societies-the employed and. the unemployed. We must ensure that we avoid that becoming a reality. (TIme expired)",32
15,Ms DEAHM,CARE AND PARTNER,"I would like to take this opportunity during the living International Year of the Family to add my comments to the many that have already been expressed in this House. We have heard much about the traditional family, the normal family, and the need to return to 'so-called traditional family values. We hear about the need for two-parent families and the disasters whiCh are likely to befall those unfortunate children who are brought up without a father. We have heard condemnation of the single mothers who go out to work and dire warnings about the proliferation of child-care centres. Listening to these tales of doom and gloom, one would imagine that there is.no hope for oUT society, that the family as an operating unit has totally ceased to be, except in those bastions of Christian families where the traditions of the past still hold sway. But things are changing. Some of the receJlt revelations in the HUe Report on the Family will show us why. Shere Hite has been studying human nature and, in partiCular, our sexuality for many years. Her latest report investigates the often secret life of the family and, in partiCular, children of the family. The report was based on more than 3,000 responses from the US, Britain, Germany and other nations to questionnaires about childhood, sexual development and parent-child relationships. Its revelations for many, including me, are in a sense'. an affirmation of what we subconsciously already knew and often a heart-rending recognition of ourselves and our parents. Hite concludes that what we have thought of as the Western nuclear family, the hierarchiCal male dominated family, .is an entity not worth preserving ifourchildren are to develop a healthy self-image and be able to enter into mature adult relationships. Hite $as: The golden age family bliss exists more in people-s imaginations than in their experience. The current slogan ""preservation of family values"" really means not preservation of love in the family but preservamany tion of the hierarchical family. Some ·of her findings may surprise those who firmly believe in this kind of family. She found that 79 per cent of boys from twoparent families said that their fathers behaved as if they were superior to their mothers; 81 per cent of men who grew up with just their mothers found it easy to form good relationships with women later, as opposed to 40 per cent of men· from two-parent families; less than 24 per cent of boys said that their father was ·affectionate towards them; children in two-parent families are often tom by a loyalty crisis between their father and their mother; and boys reaching puberty are taught both that women are objects of desire yet objects of contempt, leading to a love-hate relationship with women in later life. Her findings on the way in which boys and girls were brought up are certainly no surprise to me, as they exactly reflect roy own experience. She found that women were feminised from an early age and discouraged from expressing anger or independence of any kind. Sexuality was to be repressed at all costs and their developing,maturity, including menstruation and the personal discovery of their own bodies, was con-idered a shamefulthing and to be hidden from the world. Many children in the era in which I was growing up experienced just the kinds of things which are described by Ms Rite. Learning about sexuality, about the essential facts of life, was something which was simply not discussed. The onset of menstruation can be very traumatic for young girls and without a supportive and informed mother it can. be even more difficult. It should be. a cause for celebration; Likewise, developing early relationships is also fraught with problems, especially when the only instruction we have is to 'Be careful', 'Don't do it', 'Be a good girl' and 'Don't be home late'. On reflection, I am often amused at the thought that nothing naughty could happen before midnight. Boys, orr the other hand, were taught to be manly, not to cry, not to express emotion of any kind and, in fact, to. express cruelty in order to reinforce their manhood. How many cats have been skinned in this cause? How times have we heard expressions such as, 'Act like a man', 'Don't be a sissy', and, 'We'll knock him into shape'. Youths were taught that if they associated with girls they were considered to be sissies. Girls were not for friendship but for sex. Just as girls were conditioned to be wives, homemakers and mothers, boys were also conditioned to be providers. Girls were taught to have no greater ambition than that of a homemaker, while the pressure put on boys to be strong and to achieve must have been equally traumatic. Because of the difference in emphasis on the upbringing of girls and boys, their attitudes towards each other were often incomprehensible. I remember growing up thinking that boys, and eventually men, were superior. I never questioned this assumption. It therefore came as a great shock to me to meet a strong woman and an inadequate man. I felt embarrassment. H.owever, once we learn to accept that we are all human beings with frailties, talents and skills of our own, it should make no difference whether we are male or female. We are who we are. This so-called normalfamily was based on patriarchy-the superiority of the male who projected his authority onto wife and children. Their response was that of fear and blind obedience. Perhaps my experience of blind obedience was made doubly important because my father was a naval officer.. Along with long periods of not having him around were those still horrifying experiences of a person coming into. the house and trying to change the way things operated by stamping his mark on the household. I was terrified of my father in those days and now mourn the loss of a relationship which should have been close and affectionate. I also feel sad that he was a person who was conditioned to be the dominant one in the household and had to re-establish this dominance each time he came home from. sea. In saying these things· I am not attaching any blame to either the dominant father or the submissive mother in these families. They were repeating what they had been taught by their own parents. It isolily during the last 20 years or so that the cycle has been broken. In our democratic society we would not tolerate such a framework in any community organisation, but we have tolerated it in the family for many hundreds of years. We have looked on such families which 'produced manly boys and submissive feminine girls and thought they were normal. In fact, they were repressedwe were repressed. The moulding of the children under this kind of authoritarian upbringing has not all owed the development of the true self-the self-image which allows us to be who we are as individuals. For many of us, breaking out of this mould has been· a .long and arduous journey. It has often been heart breaking and traumatic. It has resulted in emotional instability and. the inability to' truly form mature relationships. . For many of my generation, this resulted in unstable marriages, conflict,marriagebreakups and, for some of us, avoidance of commitment. We may have grownup as good children, being obedient to our parents and always doing as we were told. It may be seen as good that our children are seen as ideal when they cause no problems and are constantly obedient. However, I suggest-as Hite also indicates-that, for those of us in this situation, the obedient -?'terior was hiding it rebellious individual trying to break out. This often resulted in immature and inappropriate behaviour in dealing with such things as alcohol and sex. That obedient good little girl often raises her head in my life, and I have to push her back to where she belongs. Without the freedom to develop our own independent thought patt-rns, which will often bring conflict between parent and child, we are not able to develop that true self. All we do in that case is to accept blindly the guilt, fear and discipline which is imposed by another. It has been said that there is no ideal family and, in fact,that an ideal family is one which can admit to its children that it has made mistakes. This is surely a better role model for children than those who 'observe the so called perfect' parent who never makes mistakes or at least never admits to them. Trying to emulate the perfect parent can be a recipe for disaster. One of the findings of the Hite report, which is also borne out by my experience, is that signs of physical affection in the family have often been rare. It has been seen as inappropriate at times for fathers in particular to hug their children. I am sure this was even more so in the ,case of fathers and sons. I can never remember my father touching me at all, not ,even as much as a pat on the head. Hite draws attention to this lack of physical contact in the young and notes that this often results in subconscious seeking of physical affection in inappropriate places and in inappropriate ways. John Bradshaw, an American expert on personal development and the family, has said: You know what molesters tell us? That they go to playgrounds and look for the most obedient children . He further said: We have enormous things we have to learn about families ... So much to learn about those good looking families where somebody has all the power. It's important to understand that these are not democratic families. Patriarchy ignores all the emotions except fear. It is not surprising that many parents who feel that power is important would fear allowing their children to express their emotions and to at times disagree with' their parents. This is the kind of democracy which develops balanced adults at the risk of some conflict in the process. For the last 20 years or so women have begun to break out of the mould. They have learned to be proud of the fact that they are women; that they can be themselves without the power behaviour. The so-called liberation of women has caused a great deal of trauma, as any change does. But in this change there is also great hope for men, because it gives them the chance to be who they are, to get off the power trip, to abandon the need to be patriarchs, and to allow their true emotions to be expressed without condemnation. The women who have grown up in the last 20 years have had the opportunity of seeing their mothers as role models, as women who have been able to think for themselves, to have an independent career as well as to raise a family, and to pass on feminine wisdom to their. daughters. Prior to that time young women grew up with a feeling of disappointment that their mothers did not pursue their own self-identity. When I was growing up I received conflicting messages from my mother. All my: upbringing was geared towards that of a homemaker and mother. However, the verbal message was, 'Don't waste your time with marriage. You'll only be unhappy like me'. It was not until much later in life, long after the death of my father and when all the children had left home, that I realised what my mother's real interests were.· She was never given the space to express these during her marriage when her prime interest,wa- bringing up children. The thought of such an unfulfilled life I find very sad. Just as women in my era lookeo for role models from' their mothers and were left wanting, so. boys looked to their fathers as role models. The father projecting the patriarchal model would certainly have stamped this on his son. Heaven help the poor boy who was not able to live up to this macho image. So whether we like it or not the shape of the family, if not its composition, has been changing over the years and, I would suggest, changing for the better. Children may well be, on billance, better off with two parents. But this is not always necessarily the case. It is only when we get away from a rigid image of what the family should be and' how people should behave within the family unit that we can hope to progress to a more hopeful future. I would like to conclude by quoting from Shere Hite: One hears constantly that the family is in trouble, that it doesn't work any more. But what we are witnessing now-andparticipating in-is a revolution in the family. Finally democracy is catching up with the old, hierarchical, father-dominated family. And this Hite Report salutes. thegentIer and more diverse family system that seems to be arising-and that does not keep its members in terror;' faihersin terror lest they not be 'manly' and be able to support it all; mothers in terror lest they be beaten in their own bedrooms and ridiculed by their children; children in terror of being forced to do things against their will. . What is happening is a transformation of the culture, not a collapse. Let's continue the transformation, believe il'l ourselves, go forward with love, not fear. In our private lives and in our public world, let's hail the future and make history. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

16,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS," Mr Speaker, Ipresent-the following ' paper: Roster·of ministers to attend question time as at I March. NA",39
17,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Myquestion is directed to the Minister for Resources. I refer the minister to moves by aluminium producers to restrict supply in. order to achieve more stable and stronger priced markets. How does the minister understand this strategy will be executed? Does he believe it gives rise to any relevant public policy concerns of any kind? What are the peculiarities of the international alumi.nium market which have required this course of action by suppliers?,40
18,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, which I think goes to the very core of one of Australia's. most important industries. As most people vvould be aware, there is a very large oversupply of aluminium in the world market. This has caused an enormous collapse in the world price. This has been brought about by a unique circumstance, and one which we all should be . very grateful for-as· you should be-and that is the collapse of the former Soviet Union. In the Commonwealth of Independent States, there is now no need for aluminium for the previous war machine. That has led to a huge surplus in aluminium supplies now coming into world markets. There has been a number of meetings around the world-in Moscow, Washington and Brussels; I think qne is to.be held this week in Canada-as a result of which the industry itself has decided that the amount of production. There is no complicity of government in this. It is not a government decision. There is no unilateral decision or bilateral decision between governments. It is a. decision the industry has made which has brought about a rise in the aluminium price by some considerable amount since the start of this year. I think it is one with which we should be quite pleased, in view of the very important role that aluminium plays in this economy. A number of Australian aluminiuinsmeltershave announced reductions in production. Hopefully that will have a minimum effect on employment in that . industry. In the longer term, this is not a bad thing for Australia. 'We.are the world's largest exporter of alumina and bauxite. As the former Soviet Aluminium Union's industry grows, we will be in a position to provide.,... - through Vladivostok and other ports, into the Siberian section of the former Soviet Union, which is the most modern-high-quality feed stock for its industry.. As. the Russian economy picks up and the -. domestic demand for aluminium comes up, there will be increased demand for our feef:! stock and increased .demand for our alumina. We are about the third largest world exporter of aluminium. This is a very important industry for Australia. NA",40

20,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My questIon is directed to the Treasurer. rrefer to the fiscal framework i paper released by the Treasurer today. Can the Treasurer tell the House what that document reveals and what are the implications of that document for the formulation of the it will restrict 1994-95 budget? Mr Downer-You have just had a press conference on it.,40

22,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,40
23,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It will do you good. You might·learn something.,40
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left wi11not interject. The minister might come to the question.,40
25,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You should be able to tell us without reading .,40
26,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not going to read it.,40
27,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The right honourable member for New England!,41
28,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am just encouraging him to make a statement.,41
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not think he needs your encouragement. Mr WILLlS,-I wish the right honourable member for New England would say something different from 'make a statement'; he sounds likes a broken record. The question asked me to comment on the fiscal framework paper which we released today. Perhaps I should explain to the House exactly what this paper is. This paper is somewhat unique in budget formulation in the history of the nation. We h!lVe embarked on a more open budget preparation process this year than has ever been case before. My predecessor, as Treasurer, after the events folIowing the .last budget, believed that it was appropriate for us to discussions with minor parties in the Senate about their concerns about the budget prior to the budget rather than subsequently. In a formal document with those minor parties, the government agreed to a process of involvement by them in the budget preparation process. The first step in that budget preparation involvement for them was agreement to the fiscal framework. This sets· out the budget strategy. Once there is - greement by the minor parties to it, they can be involved in further discussions, put up items for consideration, have discussions with portfolio ministers, perhaps have some costings done by the government on the· more important ones and, finalIy, have some discussions with ERe ministers. The government's own caucus will beinvolv-d In a similar prQcess with the ministry. So we do have a unique and open process this year. Perhaps I should very briefly indicate what is contained in the fiscal franieworkpaper. In essence, it sets out the government's central objective, which is to' restore and enhance economic recovery so as to maximise growth in employment and living standards. It also recognises the government's obligation to ensure that economic recovery flows through, as far as it can, to all groups in the community, especially the long-term unemployed, and to ensure that we minimise regional disparities in economic prosperity. We see an obligation in those areas. We have a number of reports on those areas. 'TI!e government will give its response to those reports in formulating this year's budget. So those areas, along with industry policy and some further initiatives in relation to native title, represent the priority areas. for the governmenr in this year's budget. The paper then goes on to discuss the state of the economy. It picks up the revised forecasts that we have made available to the House in recent times for this financial year. It also indicates a growth of around four per cent for 1994-95. It indicates that we also the expect that employment will be growing at about 2112 per cent in 1994-95, which will certainly enable us· to make some headway have against unemployment. The paper then sets out the medium-term fiscal strategy, which is to reduce the budget deficit from the 3112 per cent of GDP estimate for this year to arourid one per cent by 1996-97. This is a reasonably challenging task. It is certainly more challenging than the tasks which a number of other governments around the world have set themselves. But we stress our adherence to that objective and spell out the reasons for it, which are, in essence; to promote growth, to promote national savings and to keep governmentdebt relatively low. We then discuss the short-term fiscal outlook for this year, and those numbers hilVe been given to the House. The figures show essentially a 3 112 per cent of GDP deficit for this year, but they indicate that the boost to reven\le is unlikely to flow through to 199495 in a way which enhances our capacity to do more in that year than we had previously expected, because of lower inflation. The paper then looks at the budget's fiscal framework being quite tight in those circumstances.We need to have a credible reduction in the deficit in terms of the medium-term objective, and we need to provide for initiatives in our key priority areas. We indicate that the jobs levy is aroilnd but the government's preference is not to implement it. There is little room for expenditure outside priority areas and there is a need for some reordering of expenditure priorities, to make room for the priority areas. We also indicate that the precise level of the deficit will be determined by the government as it moves towards the finalisation of that deficit. The starting point for' the deficit is estimated at this time to be a little under 3 percent of GDP. This is a unique document.",41
30,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why didn't you release it in the House? .,42
31,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have all got it. The Leader of the Opposition is sitting there reading it. He told mehe was reading it. So there are no worries about it. This is a unique document. It indicates that the government is being quite open in its budget preparation process. We did make the offer to 'those members' opposite to be 'similarly involved. They told Us that t1;ley were not interested and so they are not involved in the way that ,the minor parties in the Senate are. Coal Industry",42
32,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Minister, for Resources. I refer to the march on parliament today by 1,200 coal miners to protest recent cuts in coking coalprices. I ask the minister: does the coal export sector need to achieve productivity gains equivalent to,$10 per tonne to remain competitive and to hold its labour force? Does the minister agree that a more flexible labour system would help achieve this goal? Given this, will the minister now finally signal the government's intention to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal? Mr BEDDALL:.....I thank the' honourable member once more for his question. As he knows, the Coal Industry Tribunal is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations. On the broader issue of the strike that is taking place in the demonstration today, whilst Ido not think it is the most appropriate ,action in the circumstances, I understand the frustration felt by the coal industry workers. They have seen a large amount of productivity gain over recent years. They have seen huge changes to work practices: a seven day week, three shifts a day, 365 days a year. It is a very efficient industry. We are the world's great supplier of coal but we are not the only supplier, as the honourable member would know. We have 30 per cent of world trade in coal, and that amount does not make us a dominant player. The frustration we felt in recent times has' been over the coking coal price but, as I sa'id in the House last week in relation to a question'from the honourable memberJor Hunter, coking coal is a commodity that is in decline. There is less coking coal reql!ired, particularly in Japan due to its recession and particularly du- to the decline in its steel industry. Unlike the Australian steel industry, the Japanese steel industry has not been through restructuring. We are now negotiating prices on steaming coal with the Japanese, and the fact that steaming coal is going to be increasingly in shorter supply is to our benefit. There is going to be a huge demand. Mr Tim Fischer--"" Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which relates to standing order 145. The question specifically related to the Coal Industry Tribunal and the minister has refused to address that aspect of the question.",42
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister specifically referred to the CIT at the beginningMrBEI)l>ALL-At the very start I said the coaJindustry,42
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'-Minister, just hang on. Of all the people in this place, I am just as interested in this matter as anyone else. As I said, the minister did address the question of the CIT at the beginning' of his al)swet. He is now talking about the coal industry'S response to the' honourable member for Gippsland's concerns about other matters. , Mr BEDDALL-As I said in answer toa question Jast .week from the honourable member for Hunter, this is our most important and largest ewort industry. The industry is internationally. competitive and one in which we will continue to make sure that we try to receive the best price possible. Long-term Unemployed",42
35,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for ploy-d Employment, Education and Training aware of the recent Australian Bureau of Statistics publication entitled Australia - long-term . unemployed? If so, can the minister advise House of the publication's conclusions?",43
36,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable at member for his question. Yes, I am aware of ployed. the ABS report. In fact, it came out on the same day as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked a question about its contents last leader week. Interestingly, he did not refer to report. Nevertheless, he asked me why it was that Australia's long-term unemployment is higher than Canada's whilst the unemploycountry ment rate of the two countries is similar. stand by the answer I gave last week to question which went to issues of structural adjustment and the significant job growth has occurred in the Australian economy-a last job growth, I might add, that is 50 per cent higher than that of Canada. I want to go to the conclusions in the report, because I think that what the deputy leader has had to say to this misleading and dishonest. On page 53 of the report, having stated that the long-term ployment problem is not unique to Australia it goes on to conclude that there is a tendency for those countries with higher unemployment to actually have higher incidences of longI term unemployment and vice versa, with the exception of Canada. The report then goes on to say that Australia's high unemployment rate and its incidence of long-term unemployment was .slightIy lower than might have been expected· given this high unemployment rate. In other words, Canada is not the benchmark but, quite frankly, an exception.",43
37,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I never said it was, fool.",43
38,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I repeat that what the honWe ourable member had to say in this House last week is quite misleading and dishonest.,43
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister knows better than that and I ask him to withdraw.,43
40,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. It was to misleading because the report concludes that Australia in terms of its long-term unemis doing better than the UK, Germany, Belgmm, France and the Netherlands. It is true that we are doing better, but we are still not doing well enough. That is why the the government's attention through the white paper response is directed to ensuring that we sustain high levels of economic growth and the same time, target the long-term unemWe can see the real reason the deputy wants to draw an analogy between that Canada and the Australian situation when we look at the facts associated with the Canadian rate position. Whilst the government of this supports and provides a fair and I equitable universal income support regime for that the unemployed, Canada provides unemployment insurance which runs out after 50 that weeks. Remember the coalition policy in the election: cutting people off the dole after they reach a certain time-in its case after nine months. Opposition members-Wrong! Wrong!",43
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will House is quite come to order.,43
42,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In addition, Canada spends unemless than Australia on labour market programs-another coalition promise in the last election. It has been far less successful than Australia has been in job creation. In fact, as said before, we have been 50 per cent better. The only reason for the interest of the honourable member for Chisholm in Canada !s that those opposite want to cut people off mcome support regardless of the state of the labour market; they want to slash spending on labour market programs; they want to force people into low paid jobs; and they want to absolve themselves from solving the problem you of the long-term unemployed by believing that economic growth alone will sort that out. reject that approach. We will be bringing fo-arc.t a comprehensive response not only to mamtam the pace of growth of jobs in this country but also to improve upon it. Exports",43
43,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. How does the government's February hike in fuel excise, the rise in the value of the Australian do11ar on top of the August increases in fuel excise and the wholesale sales tax assist agricultural exporters in Australia, along with all other exporters and regional Australia itself-which is, after all, responsible for producing 70 per cent of Australia's exports-at a time when most are under extreme pressure from low world commodity prices?",43
44,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is the first question I have been asked as the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy under the· new arrangements. I intend to give as much information as I possibly can in my capacity representing the minister. I must say to the honourable member for Grey that this is one of the traps that the opposition always falls into. It is always fa11ing trap of considering the on-costs to the farm sector rather than considering the real issues. The problem that our agriculture has faced for many years,44
45,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,44
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my l,yft!",44
47,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,:! have represented agricultural seats as does the honourable member. In most of our industries we are a price taker not a price setter. Mr Tuckey interjecting,44
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor!,44
49,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, our industries tend to focus on the issues of farm on-costs, this tax, that tax or whatever rather than the real issue. The real issue is the price for products in world markets. Those opposite should look at what ministers in this government have done over a long period in the Uruguay Round of the GATT. The most important thing, as the Leader of National Party of Australia knows, is getting the proper outcomes so that we get the proper price for our products. All of those other things are not important in terms· of the income of farmers.",44
50,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,44
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,44
52,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those cost increases have to be met by all sectors of the economy. Those in the National Party are always on about the cost of fuel. They know that 70 per cent of the cost of farm fuel for farmers is subject to the government's diesel fuel rebate. This diesel fuel rebate amounts to $440 million, which is far bigger than any increase that the honourable member talks about. Professional Standards and Ethics",44
53,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Can the minister advise the House about the effects of the implementation of the Hilmer report on professional standards and ethics? In that context, can the Assistant Treasurer tell the House why doctors and lawyers should be treated like other commercial businesses and what guarantee there is that cheaper prices into the will not lead to lower standards?",44
54,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question.,44
55,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,44
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before the minister starts, 1 again remind honourable members of this place of standing order 55.",44
57,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of allegations by the New South Wales Council of Professions that by exposing themselves to competition its members' professional standards and ethics are threatened. I want to assure the House that this is not the case. Last Friday the Commonwealth and the states agreed that legislation arising from the Hilmer report should be extended to all bodies no matter what form their business activity takes. The Hilmer report recommended the extension of the Trade Practices Act to a11 professions, whether architects, engineers, lawyers, doctors or accountants. Mr Cadman interjecting",44
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mitchell!,44
59,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The one thing the government does not want to see are activities such as price fixing. Moreover, it is a move supported by the overwhelming majority of submissions to the Hilmer inquiry. I note that the Australian Council of Professions in its submission to the Hilmer inquiry did not oppose the application of the Trade Practices Act to the professions. But it did say that professional associations should still be able to set practice standards other than those relating to fees. This is where we have to be careful. ,On the surface this seems sensible. But who wants crook lawyers, for instance, just because they are cheap? We know that, in some professions, practice standards amount to restrictive practices which are clearly not in the public interest. For instance; the Queensland Law Society earlier this year took action against a Queensland solicitor for advertising conveyancing fees. That is clearly not in the public interest. Mr SincIair-Who wrote this? Mr Speaker-Order! The right honourable member for New England!",44
60,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For consumers even a modest reduction in the cost of conveyancing would result in a considerable saving. In fact, the Trade Practices Commission has estimated that by reducing conveyancing fees by $100, the consumers of Australia would save about $80 million a year. Of course, solicitors are not alone. In Western Australia legislation requires that all architects' advertising be approved by the architects board, and in South Australia regulations prohibit architects from working for inadequate fees and from putting forward design proposals without payment. We are not arguing for competition at all costs and where self-regulation, for example, can be shown to be in the public interest it will clearly remain. For example, we are not arguing that students should get a law degree or a medical degree without standards set by qualified people. We are not arguing that anybody can hang out a shingle and claim to be a lawyer. Nor are we going to stop the licensing of professions by governments. But we say that, where restrictions to entry are imposed by associations rather than by governments, they should be open to public scrutiny. The onus should be on the professional associations to justify why. they should be able to engage in anti-competitive behaviour. It has always been the case that authorisation for anti-competitive conduct that is in the public interest can be accommodated under the authorisation process. Furthermore, the arrangements under the authorisation process have been authorised for doctors and pharmacists. The professions in the ACT and the Northern Territory have been subject to the Trade Practices Act since the 1970s without any discernible impact on their professional standards or ethics. Long-term Unemployment",45
61,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and relates to his earlier comments about the long-term unemployed. Is the minister aware that Bill Ludwig of the Australian Workers. Union in Queensland has decreed that, despite some opposition from his membership, he will ,not endorse jobskills participant plans unle-s tile participant undertakes to join the union? As a consequence, is the jobskills program meant to be discriminatory against the long-term unemployed who are not union members? Is the jobskills program, therefore, meant to be some sort of clandestine recruiting drive to raise a flagging union membership?",45

67,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So far as the labour market programs are concerned, there is no intention to use them as a clandestine or any other method for the recruitment of.union members. The question of the recruitment of union membership is in the hands of the trade union movement. .It is doing very well at the moment and will continue to do so. The trade union movement has been particularly helpful in discussions to date about the response to the government's white paper. In making decisions in relation to that matter we will be able to draw on the continuing support of that movement in creating job opportunities and skill formation.

The ABA will be making an application to the court to expedite these proceedings. To ensure the court is aware that a significant delay will have an impact on the government's pay television policy and also this parliament's decisions on the introduction of pay. television, I have ensured that an officer of my department has today sworn an affidavit which goes to these matters. In relation to the concerns which have been raised about Telecom's involvement as a party to the proceedings, I have written to the Chairman of Telecom, Mr David Hoare, asking for a detailed report on this matter. On the broader question of the introduction of pay television,which the honourable member for Shortland raised, I have received an agreement from licence holders A and B as to a full digital transmission standard. In accordance with the Broadcasting Services Act, I have commenced the process which will lead to the declaration of a digital standard.

90,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"While the right honourable member for New England might be keen on the sheep trials, other Australians could be keen on the Melbourne Cup, the· footy .finals or simulcast concert events. The Broadcasting Services Act gives the minister the power to prepare a list of programs and events which should be offered at least in the first instance to free to air television. That is important because some commentators are saying that, even after five ye.as, out of five Australians will be relying on free to air television for their television services. That is why last week I directed the Australian Broadcasting Authority to conduct an investigation into these matters and to give me advice on these matters. The development of this list will provide greater certainty to the existing operators and to the new entrants. It will also ensure that Australians will continue to have access to those events of national importance. Courtice, Mr Brian",47

Yesterday's discussion paper is the first stage in a national review of Aboriginal and Torres Strait' Islander education, which is assessing the progress of the joint Commonwealth-State Aboriginal and Islander education policy, launched in 1990. The discussion paper is a first-rate piece research and I congratulate the expert reference group which oversaw the work. It included the 1993 Australian of the Year, Mandawuy Yunupingu, Romina Fujii, Gerry Moore and Hilda Kickett. The paper incorporates a mass of statistical data which provides an excellent foundation for future debate on this crucial national issue. While the discussion paper itself is an excellent piece of research, the situation which it describes is not a happy one. While the information in the paper reveals steady progress in Aboriginal and Islander education in recent years, steady progress is simply not good enough.

106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Kooyong! Those on my Iefi, particularly on the front bench! MrFREE-I was referring to some of the findings in the discussion paper on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. They are very important. I would urge members of the opposition in particular to pay some attention. The figures concerning preschool education, for example, indicate ,that, while the gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and other Australian four-year-olds has almost halved, there is nevertheless a significant gap of of almost 10 per cent in participation at that level. The research. also shows that a· high proportion, over 13 per cent, offive-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are not participating in any fonn of education at all. These are mainly kids living in remote Australia. . At the junior secondary level, while most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children complete a full primary school education, at the junior secondary level significant numbers of these children do not complete the compulsory years 8 and 9. In fact, .an estimated 25 per cent or more· of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids leave secondary school before the end of year 10, which is the normal minimum leaving year. Senior secondary participation similarly reveals a gap. Participation across ·the whole of Australia last year to year 12, retention to year 12, was 77 per cent, but for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids it was only 33 per cent. Essentially, these figures reveal startling gaps in attainment. If we do not address these specific education needs, frankly, we cannot say that Australia is a country where social justice rules. We admit that fixing these crucial problems that have been outlined in the discussion paper will certainly take time. One does not solve the educational impact of two centuries of cultural dispossession overnight nor does one solve it with top down solutions which might look good on paper but which are not based on what Aboriginal and Islander communities recognise as their own educational wants and needs. In closing, I express the hope that the opposition and the various state and territory governments recognise this and that they join with the Commonwealth in treating this as the bipartisan issue of national importance it most assuredly is.

117,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Commonwealth has provided substantial support to the founda:tion since it was established in 1982 to encourage the development, production and broadcasting of television programs specifically directed at young kids. The foundation has employed ' most of the major figures in the. Australian film industry-producers, actors, cinematographers and writers. It has won more than 40 awards. Many of them are major international awards that have done a great deal to advance Australia's image abroad. The foundation has also received two nominations for Emmy awards and in 1988 won an Emmy for Captain Johnno, a very famous series which I am sure is known to the honourable member for Lowe. The foundation also sells its films around the world. When the credits go up on quality Australian children's programs on television, they roll up in 90 countries around the world, showing what quality Australian products can do to promote good quality children's television and production. An important event for children's television in 1995 will be the World Summit on Televi' sion and Children. It will be held at a place which, I am sure, will be of interest to many honourable members. It will be a prestigious forum for producers, broadcasters, commentators and program makers. More details will be announced by the foundation in Melbourne tomorrow. To support the foundation's initiative, the government will be providing a generous amount of assistance in addition to the budgetary support for - the foundation which has already been announced. The government is also intending to honour acommitment which was made in Distinctly Australian to help assist with a children's film and television festival in early 1995. Honourable members might be interested to know that Australia's reputation has recently been enhanced by the awarding at the Berlin film festival of one of the top feature film awards for children's television to David Elphick, an Australian film producer, for his film No Worries. I think those of us in this House who are concerned about the sort of television that young children watch can only seek to encourage the work of the foundation. The feder-l government's investment into the Australian Children 's Television Foundation is an investment in their future and one which I amsure will be repaid many times over. Department of Finance: .Credit Cards MrCHARLES-My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. i remind the minister of the. Auditor-General's efficiency audit of the Department of Finance concerning the Australian government-redit card system tabled last December. The A,uditorGeneral found that departments were unable to identify to what use. credit cards are put. He found instances' of purchases of capital items such as' fur coats, speedboats and ancillary parts for missile .launchers and there appeared to be no controls or accou'ntability needed for large purchases. Given that the Auditor-General criticised project management by the Department of Finance and department managers in general. and. that. the auditor could not find any dedicated risk strategy in placeMr Crean-He is reading it.

123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Mayo! Mr BEAZLEy-It is many thousands, about which the Auditor-General found. a problem in his mind with about 26 from that particular exercise. The auditor's concerns do not go to the issue of. the use of credit cards, which I think the Auditor-General assumes is avery sensible - ay for government to conduct business. One of the reasons why credit cards were introduced was to ensure rapid payment for small items for people with whom the government deals. It has obviated a huge number of criticisms that have come to government over the years for being a slow payer. I do not think the Auditor-Cieneral had a major problem with the system at all. When some of his complaints were examined, part· of the problem seemed to be that the way in which the credit cards were registered went not so much to items purchased that but to the organisations, shops or whatever that the items were. purchased from. For example, what seemed like a most unusual purchase by, say, a Defence official at a gift shop. turned out to be the acquisition of goggles for the military for exercise. purposes. When each of those propositions was looked at in detail, there was essentiaIly nothing wrong with them. From my recolleGtion, the Auditor-General has made a series of suggestions as to what steps ought to be taken to improve control processes in the use of credit cards. My ' department has taken those suggestions on board and, from memory, I think it intends to implement most of them. If the honourable member is interested in detail, I will send him a note on the matter. Asian Language Plan",50
124,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the minister inform the House of the outcome of consideration by the Council of Australian Governments of the introduction of an Asian language plan for primary schools in Australia?",51
125,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister yesterday referred. to a string of very successful outcomes at the COAG meeting in Hobart last Friday. One of them was the agreement by the states to an Asian language development program. EssentiaIly COAG, the heads. of government, has agreed to endorse the development of a plan that will see the teaching of Asian languages and cultures in primary schools. The decision came as a consequence of a report that COAG commissioned and, in particular, a concern that high school students studying a second. language over recent decades had declined pretty significantly. This plan builds on the importance of developing second languages and, at the same time, gives particular focus to those within the Asian region. Whilst the focus is on Asia, the Commonwealth had two concerns about the recommendations that came forward. One was that, in the development of any program, it did not direct away from the European and other community languages, and that is the understanding by which we will continue to develop this plan. In other words, it will not take away from those other languages. Secondly, the Commonwealth had a concern at the mandating of the four specific Asian languages but, in discussions with the states, it has been recognised that that decision is essentialTraining ly a matter for the states. The decision sits comfortably with the· government's commitment to APEC and to better relations with Asia. In addition, .it strengthens our long standing commitment to multiculturalism. As for the Commonwealth's commitment in financial terms, that is a matter that we will be considering in the budget context, but this is a very important development which is welcomed and endorsed by all states.",51

That was the first time he said it before he withdrew it. He suggested that I wanted to use Canada as a benchmark and that I wanted to draw an analogy with Canada because unemployment insurance runs out after 50 weeks and because Canada spends less on labour market programs. He concluded, 'The only reason for the honourable member for Chisholm's interest in Canada is that those opposite want to cut people off income support; theywarit to slash spending on labour market programs; they want to force people into low paid jobs; and they want to absolve themselves from the problem of solving long-term unemployment'.

NA Aboriginal Deaths in Custody MrTICKNER (Hughes-Minister for Abofiginal and Torres Strait 'Islander Affairs)-by I eave-This first annual report on the Commohwealt.h government'sresponse to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is about accountability. It is about ensuring that implementation of the commitments made can be subject to detailed scrutiny by parliament, by the Australian people and, in particular, by Aboriginal .and Torres Strait Islander communities. It is about making governlTlent decisions transparent. That is why this report is so detailed. It ensures that the national government meets its responsibilities to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to the wider Australian and international community and to the media for implementing commitments made in response to the royal commission. This is itself in line with the royal commission. The first recommendationof the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was aimed at PAPERS ensuring clear public commitments by governments to respond to' the recommendations, report on their implementation, and ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations were consulted' and directly involved in the implementation. The response of the Commonwealth to recommendation 1 went significantly beyond the terms of the recommendation to establish a detailed accountability regime of which this report forms a part. The Commonwealth government's response to the royal commission supported 338 of its 339 recommendations, open accountability for action taken on those commitments, and a central role for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people papers: and community organisations in the implementation processes. Above all else it must be remembered that the royal commission report was a national commission of inquiry which. enjoyed the support of the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments-and, ultimately, the. federal coalition. It should be stressed that almost two-thirds of its recommendalions are directed to issues of criminal justice reform and of reforms of police, prison and coronial practice which are under the exclusive jurisdiction of state and territory governmentS. This annual report for 1992-93 is a wholeof-government report, which means that relevant Commonwealth ministers have endorsed those sections of the report falling within their ministerial responsibility. All state and territory governments. have committed themselves to an equivalent form of open and detailed reporting on the action they have taken to implement the royal commission recommendations. Several central issues must be understood by commentators on and critics of the royal commissi'on. First, the royal commission found that the reason for the 99 Aboriginal deaths in custody between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989 was not a disproportionate rate of death compared with the wider custodial population. What is overwhelmingly different is the rate at which Aboriginal people come into custody compared with the rate of the general community. Second criminal justice, police, prison and coronial ;eform were the responsibility of al1 states· and territories, and specific action should be taken by those· jurisdictions to effect reforms. Third, while such reforms are critical1y important in reducing the tragical1y high arrest rate for Aboriginal people, the - o-t cause of the disproportionate rate of AborIgInal imprisonment was the extremely disadvantaged position on every socio-economic measure in Australian society. Fourth, this disadvantage can be effectively addressed only if the .Commonwealth and state and territory governments al10cate their resources equitably. This means that stream programs in al1 jurisdictions must to deliver social justice to Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander people. ATSIC's spereporting cialist programs must be seen as supplemenshould tary-on their own they can never adequately redress the extreme disadvantages experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Action by our nation to address broader issues is therefore essential to ing sustained change in the rates of imprisonannouncement ment and deaths in custody of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The report on the first year of a coordinated Commonwealth effort by 24 departments and agencies focuses on the first stages of an scrutiny. implementation effort. Where relevant, in each section of the report, information is provided on the relevant Commonwealth government department responsible for the implementation of the specific royal commission recommengovernments dation in question. On the day the Commonwealth announced the stage one of its response to the final report the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the then Attorney-General, the honourable member-for Holt (Mr Duffy), and I announced the establishment of the Aborigihonour nal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner. We said: As a part of the process of reconciliation Federal Parliament had giveri unanimous crosssion party support to a comm-tment that the Com '!l0nwealth would work with State and Territory Governments to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations as a national objective leading to. the centenary of Federation in 200t. By providing the State of the Nation Report on Aboriginal social justice the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be acting as a watchdog over the nation in its achievement of that Aboriginal social justice objective. We also agreed that the monitoring mechanism for the implementation of agreed recommendations of the royal commission. will be of crucial importance in the preparation of the State of the Nation Report and would be supplemented by information col1ected by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under its legislative powers. I am pleased to note that, in his first reIJ0rt, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mainSocial Justice Commissioner, while not aim assuming the prime monitoring function, has and acknowledged the appropriateness of his on particular recommendations. It be emphasised that the powers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner are extensive and include powers in relation to state and territhese tory governments as wel1 as the Commonachievwealth government. I also welcome the by the commissioner in his report that it may wel1 be appropriate for him tei consider the adequacy of the monitoring process itself. The government would welcome any constructive ideas for enhanced It has always been a deep personal commitment of mine that the royal commission report would not be al10wed to gather dust on the shelf. However, it must not just be left to to give effect to the royal commission commitments. If the media and the wider Australian community real1y believe in importance of the process of reconciliation Of and see indigenous social justice as a national priority, they must play their parts, both in acting on the royal commission recommendations and in ensuring that al1 governments their commitments arising from thSocial Justice royal commission. The parliament, too, must playa crucial the role in following through the r()yal c()mmisrecommendations. In accordance with the government's response to recommendation 1 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, after the statement by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), and with his leave, I will be moving a motion to refer this report to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I thank the House.",51
133,Mr NUGENT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Aston)""'-by leave-I congratulate the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) on making his statement. It is a rare event for ministers of this government to come in this chamber and make statements these days. I am particularly pleased that he has done so, because it is a serious topic and one which I will certainly treat seriously. In his statement, the minister referred to issues of accountability, detailed scrutiny by the parliament and government decisions being transparent. Obviously, we welcome those sentiments. He raised several central issues. I want to very briefly comment on some of them. Firstly,he said that the rate at which Aboriginal people come into custody compared with the rate of the general community is much higher. We would all accept that that has to do with the disadvantage of the Aboriginal community generally; the cultural clash and, in many cases, outright racism. Secondly, the minister mentioned that criminal justice,· police, prison and other reforms are often the responsibilities of states and territories. I have to say from my own observations when travelling around the country that I do see some signs of change, but clearly we have a long way to go. Thirdly, the minister said that, whilst those sorts reforms are important, clearly the root cause of the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal imprisonment is the extremely disadvantaged position of our indigenous people. There is no question that that goes to the very core of the problem. Health, housing, education and employment are very real and tangible issues which we as a country have to address. Fourthly, the minister said that mainstream programs in all jurisdictions must· aim to deliver social justice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and that ATSIC's specialist programs are only supplementary to those mainstream programs. I certainly support that statement. However, it has sometimes been disappointing that there seems to be a different vit!w within the government as to where those programs should be delivered, which minister should claim jurisdiction-this minister or the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson)-and whether they are to be in the social justice package that is to come or not. The government needs to have a much more coordinated approach. I have to record my disappointment when, early this morning while I was present in the chamber, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) launched a very extreme attack on the Northern Territory the government about these issues, quite clearly with the lead-up to the Northern Territory elections in mind. That does not do any of the issues concerned any good. The minister referred to the appointment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, whois to report and act as a watchdog .. I certainly hope that he does that. I have certainly heard him say within the last few days that he feels he is under-resourced. I am not so sure that that is the case. He needs to make sure that he acts as a watchdog and reports rather than perhaps tries to become a player in some of the issues. I welcome certainly the minister-s commitment .to make sure that this report does not gather dust on the shelf. He has my support in that respect. I also support his comments about the relevance of the media and the wider Australian community becoming inof volved in resolving a number of these issues. Whilst obviously we welcome the drop in the number of deaths in custody, we have to issue caution about the low numbers of the sample. It would be premature for the government to congratulate itself just yet. For example, in 1990-91 there were eight deaths in custody; in 1991-92 there were 10; and in 1992-93 there were six. That is obviously a drop, but it is on a very small sample. Unquestionably, a good sign is that no deaths in police lockups were reported-the deaths were in other forms of custody. Nevertheless, it is very early days to get too carried away. There has been no change in the numbers of Aboriginal people in custody. Effectively, the number now in custody is the same as it was at the time of the royal commission. I remind the House that, whilst Aboriginal and Torres Strait 'Islander people make up only 1.2 per cent of the adult population of this country, they form 14.1 per cent of the prison population. Aboriginal people are still 26 times more likely to be taken into custody than the broader population. It seems to me, therefore, that those figures still very much have to be addressed; they are clearlytbtally unacceptable. Whilst I recogni-e from the minister's statement and the report he has tabled that it takes time to set up the mechanisms to address these issues ,and the wide-ranging matters of serious disadvantage, which, the commission identified as the root cause of this high rate of Aboriginal imprisonment, I am disappointed that he has made some public comments criticising the states. It seems to me that, if. it takes the federal government time to set up the mechanism, the states obviousl'y also need that sort of time. I was interested to hear Mr Wootten, the commissioner, on the radio saying that lipservice and bureaucratic activity seem to have characterised some of the response to the report. He was asking when will we get some results. He said that nothing has changed in terms of the numbers imprisoned. Mr Wootten also made a point-I certainly caution the minister for the future-about the need for ou,r taking responsibility for dealing agreed to: with these issues at the federal level rather than blaming the states. Quite clearly, as a result of the 1967 referendum, the Commonwealth has prime responsibility for matters to do with our indigenous population. It is not sufficient to wash OUT hands and say, to the states; matters of health, housing and education are in the state· jurisdiction'. The federal government did not do. that in Mabo with land management I am not suggesting that· it takes over the bureaucracy of health, housing and all the rest of it, but clearly federal government has prime responsibility. It..is up to the government to take a lead. It cannot say, 'Those are states matters', and blame the states if nothing happens.",54
134,The C,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,")mmonwealth is spending $400 million over five years-quite rightly, in my view-to try to get on top of some of these issues. But it is no good putting that amount of money towards this issue unless mechanisms are in place, both federally and with the states, to make sure that that money will be spent effectively. Therefore, it is important that the Commonwealth government redoubles its efforts in getting the states and itself well organised to make sure that next year when the report comes to the parliament we are not talking about setting up mechanisms or problems between the government and the states but we are able to report to this parliament some very real and tangible progress and improvement in the most disadvantaged part of our community. I was in Tasmania yesterday and spoke to the police superintendent there, and I was in New South Wales a couple of weeks ago. I heard in both Tasmania and New South Wales many reports about improvements in the system. There are some tangible results and improvements. I hope, as the years go by, they will be reflected in the numbers. It is important to remember that we also need to attack these issues on the ground. Finally, I agree most strongly that it is appropriate the report be referred for detailed scrutiny to the House of Representatives Standing Committon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I support the minister in that move. Motion (by Mr Tickner)-by leaveThat the first annualt-eport of the implementation of the Commonwealth government response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody be referred to the House of Representa"" tives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres 'It is up Strait Islander Affairs.

135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)the Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted' to the· House for discussion, namely: The serious implications for Western Australia of the constant and continuous erosion of Australia's federal system of government. I cal1 upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",55
136,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I took my place in this House last March and listened to some of the early debates by government members committed to a centralist agenda I felt a deepening disquiet. The disquiet has not diminished as I have taken part in the work of this parliament and its committees. In fact, I reflected on' this morning's West Australian editorial on the removal of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kel1y) from the ministry and the defence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of his ex-minister. The editorial said: . . . left unanswered the crucial question of what standards he expects of ministers. That will be a lingering problem for the Government because it is increasingly clear that Mr Keating's imperious is at odds with the wishes of most Australians.... Mr Keating has signalled that shabby administration and unacceptable behaviour is all right as long as ministers can tough it out. That will not wash with taxpayers fed up with the way money has been squandered at the whim of some self-seeking politicians. His support of ex-Premier Carmen Lawrence fits wel1 into this category as she is someone who can tough it out and who is self-seeking. It is not unfair to suggest that a person who a few weeks ago indignantly affirmed her intention to remain as opposition leader in Western Australia, even describing the media reports as 'Liberal mischief making' and who is now packing her bags for Canberra, may be equal1y inconsistent when it comes to taking Ii Western Australian perspective. It escaped her notice last year that the question of land title and land management is a basic constitutionalresponsibility of the elected government of Western Australia. Clearly, it is a responsibility that, unlike the Premier of Queensland, Dr Lawrence was very keen to abrogate. She fell back on centralist rhetoric in stating, 'I want to see national solutions'-the time honoured euphemism for centralising power in Canberra. She described the cynical, inconsistent political deals done by this government in preparing its Native Title BiIl as proper consultation. She had the gall to describe this weaving, backtracking government as consistent in its goal to come to terms with Mabo and provide economic certainty. Certainty· is the last thing that the Native Title Act will give to the people of Western Australia. She was correct, however, in acknowledging that in respect of unrelenting centralism the Keating Labor government is indeed consistent. In staking her claim to a federal cabinet position, Dr Lawrence fell back to a declaration that she was an Australian first and a Western Australian second. As a federalist, I do not believe that it is a question of crude priorities as glibly expressed by Dr Lawrence. Recourse to this rhetoric is meaningless' and shaIlow. We are good Australians because we are good Western Australians who know that style national interest will never be served by damaging our local economy through centralised decision making. It is time to explode the pretence of this centralist Prime Minister and his government that they are concerned for the proper representation in Canberra of the vast, wealth-producing state of Western Australia. The people of my state are being subjected to a massive confidence trick, being told that once their defeated ex-premier takes her place in the Keating ministry their interests will be protected. The evidence is otherwise. The current Prime Minister is a committed centralist who undermined his predecessor by sabotaging Bob Hawke's tentative moves toward a so-called new federalism. The Prime Minister has placed on record his contemptuous description of the federal Senate that gives honest and equal representation to the smaller states as 'unrepresentative swill'. That all Australians should begin to experience some disquiet at the persistence of an imperialist Prime Minister to. blatantly continue his grab for more power was highlighted by an article written by ,the Clerk of the Australian Senate, Harry Evans. The article titled 'Putting Constitutionalism Back in the Constitution' should make the alarm bells ring for all Australians. He said: There is a particular need to articulate the case for constitutionalism in relation to the concentration of power within the structure of the central government. For 200 years or so the greatest political philosophers warned that it was dangerous to allow the executive and I-gislative powers to be exercised solely by one person or one body, and that this was the' short road to tyranny. Now that we have allowed exactly that situation to develop, we may well ask whether we know better than the philosophers and whether they were deluded after all. In fact, the current state of our system of government vindicates the old sages and manifests the very dangers they foresaw. It is now. accepted in Australian parliamentary politics that the government will use its parliamentary majority in a lower House to suppress any effective scrutiny or control of its activities by the legislature. Yet· the text books continue to tell us that scrutiny and control of the executive is one of the prime functions of parliament,certainly its classic rationale under the theory of responsible government Harry Evans is in good company when he expresses his concern about the possible tyranny that comes from central powers. As a leading dissident under a communist regime, and now the President of the Czech Republic, Vac1av Havel saw his country oppressed by totalitarianism. In his address tathe Congress of the United States he warned that people are manipulated, not always by brutal methods but often by professional apparatuses that release citizens from all forms of concrete and personal responsibility. In his inaugural speech when he became the President of the Czech Republic, Havel said we should teach ourselves and others that politics should be an expression of a desire to contribute to the happiness of the community rather than the need to cheat or rape the community. The immediate satisfaction of the release of citizens from taking personal responsibility is soon replaced by the high cost of concentrated power in the hands of few. The states are constantly fighting to retain control of what constitutionally has been assigned to them, and all Australians, in particular all state premiers, should support the wisdom of our forefathers and guard their democratic rights assiduously. Labor premiers· and, on occasion, federal Labor ministers proclaim that they are giving our state a good deal if they secure a few extra dollars. The interests of Western Australia in a viable federal system are not that simple and I suspect the same applies to every other state.in this country. We need not only a fair. share of revenue but the right to elect our own state governments to make their own decisions in the areas within their constitutional responsibility. What we had been getting after a decade of Labor rule at both state and federal level was a quiet, deadly erosion of these rights, as the proportion of federal revenue received by Western Australia in tied grants has increased from 40 per cent to 50 per cent. It is a fact of life· that the greater the proportion of tied grants, the more the federal civil servants are employed second-guessing their state counterparts and the less decision making remains at state level. Western Australians might ask just what Dr Lawrence did to try to check this process, the result of many cosy agreements at minis-erial and administrative levels that slowly build up a wasteful, interfering extension .of federal bureaucracy into matters of state responsibility. This is where the federalist credentials of Labor premiers can so often be found wanting,despite their occasional bursts of federalist rhetoric. Even this government's talent for misrepresenting the facts could never pretend that the out-going member for Fremantle upheld the interests of Western Australia in cabinet. Few people have more clearly fitted the role of Canberra's emissary to the west, rather the converse. Now we are told that his successor is a good federaHst who will some-,' how put things right. Dr Lawrence showed a total lack of consistency in her championing of the Western Australian Inc. royal commissionafter she had strenuously denied the need for such an investigation for most of her first year as premier, in 1990. It is clear that this Prime Minister is no born-again federalist. Rather, he is looking for a talented, reactive politician who can assure the. people in the west that they live in the best of all possible worlds and that they are getting a fair deal. Carmen Lawrence's credentials indeed lie very much in the field of damage control. That was the purpose of her three years in office. While Labor propagandists extol her .personal popularity, I. would remind government members that the preferred vote of 55 per cent gained by the incoming Court government last year still equalled the worse ever postwar defeats of the ALP in Western Australia. Her own margin of 52.7 per cent in a traditional Labor seat was not impressive. . Political damage control does not create jobs in Western Australia; it does not attract - nvestment; and it does not supply any kind of vision for the future. This is, of course, a government devoid of any constructive and generous vision of a better Australia; The Prime Minister's light on the hill i- a narrow, bitter, centralist republic where, ex-cutive government will reign unchecked and government will always claim to know best. In addition, Dr Lawrence is being marketed as a champion of women and yet the record stands that, in July 1990 in relation to the matter of Western Women and· the Women's Information Referral Exchange, she· wrote a congratulatory letter to the Ia'tter- In 1991 the organisation went into receivership. In 1992 she denied any knowledge .of Western Women. Finally, in this matter, an editorial in the West Australian of 18 December 1992 stated:. ' Dr Lawrence has played base politics in shutting down the' Committee to avoid further political discomfort in the run to the election. And: Dr Lawrence tries to portray 'herself as a clean-skin removed from the discredited tacties 6f her predecessors. But she has proved to be just another political manipulator. This little venture meant the loss of life savings for a number of women. Given that Dr Lawrence sought to distance herself from any responsibility in this regard this is hardly supporting evidence for her championing the cause of women. No amount of vote buying will disguise the fact that we have a centralist Prime Minister who is working consistently to gl)t all· states of decision making powers. No amount of image building will alter the fact that the ALP candidate for Fremantleis committed to the very same agenda.· I am sure the Australian public is already beginning to think that the rhetoric has very rarely been matched by the actions of this government or by the latter Western Australian government. It just has not, happened. I am sure that the ·Western Australian public is beginning to think that maybe it should look beyond the rhetoric and start looking at the public record, which is not a particularly good one. If we are to achieve what Harry Evans said about our constitution and about maintaining a democracy and if we are to listen and observe'the experience of Vaclav Havel, then we will take very seriously these matters of the federal government overriding'the rights of the states and usurping, the' powers that constittitionally anq properly have been given to the states. It is time for all Australians to be very concerned about this usurping of power and what it meansto them in the longtenn in tertl'\s of their democratic rights. As I said, it lookS like an easy solution to be given the option of ,not taking the responsibility for oneself, but it is a very ,short-term solution. Every Australian, every politician and every state Premier must give·serious thought·to the m-tter of democratic; rights and to the rights of states. ' As I said, no amount of vote buying will disguise the fact that we have a centralist Prime Minister who is working consistently to gut all states of decision making powers. I think that this government has shown itself to be devoid of vision and is no more than an organised conspiracy to hold power. Mt STEPHEN SMiTH. (Perth) (4.25 p.m.)-Unlike the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), r will address the subject matter of the matter of public importance:. The serious implications for Western Australia of the .constant and continuous erosion, of Australia's federal system of government. That· is code fora range of things: firstly, the worry on, the part of· honQurable members opposite as to the serious . political consequences for the Premier,of Western Australia, Richard Court, now that he·finds himself out on a limb, by himself in an isolationist position, divorced from his fellow conservative state premiers and divorced from the rest of the community; secondly, the concern about the damage that will be done to the citizens of Western Australia by the approach that is being taken by the· Western Australian government; thirdly, and most importantly-this was the subject of most of the honourable member's speech--the worry that those opposite have as to the political damage which Carmen Lawrence will do to them when she is the honourable member for Fremantle. Most of the speech of the honourable member for Pearce was· a series of personal abus.es of the candidate for Fremantle and the former premier. I am sure that Carm-n Lawrence will be able to respond adequately to those in kind and in spades when she arrives. I will respond to a couple of points made by the honourable member for Pearce. Firstly, she spoke about the right to ensure that citizens have the opportunity to elect a state government. I would like the opportunity to elect a state government in Western Australia on the same basis that we are elected to this House: on the basis of one vote, one value and not on the basis of a corrupt, gerrymandered, malapportioned system .which those opposite support and sustain. ill terms of the substance of the MPI, I need go no further than to refer to the comments made by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston(Mr Nugent), when responding to the ministerial statement given by the Minister. for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) shortly after question time. The shadow minister referred to the Commonwealth having prime responsibilities for national issues. iii not sufficient to wash our hands and say, ""It is up to the states, those are state matters"" and blame the states if nothing happens'. Among the more responsible members of the opposition there is a view that the system we have in this country is a cooperative federal system. The Commonwealth of Australia cannot abrogate its prime responsibilities, take the soft option, and then blame the states for it. Those opposite should start to form a view as to what their attitude is to our federal system. On Friday, 25 February we had a very adequate explanation of the general view that is taken of our current federal system, which arose in the context of the COAG meeting. Let us see what the attitude of the Commonwealth government is to cooperative federalism at this point of our federation's history. In the run-up to the COAG meeting, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) issued a state,. ment. He said:· On the eve of the COAG Conference in Hobart I take the opportunity to repeat the Government's call for a new commitment to change. A ·new consensus about change. That is our position. In cooperation with the states we want to ensure· that change for the better is made in our country. At the conclusionof the COAG meeting, the Prime Minister, when interviewed after that meeting, was reported as saying: Could I say that .thiS was a: very effective meeting. I did say last week that I thought that the Council of Australian Governments has been an effective body, I said that over the course of this week and proposed a continuing and cooperative approach to the Commoriwealth/State federal structure in this country. Now, this today has produced a very significant outcome adopting competition policy criteria for the whole economy. And that includes not just the existing area covered by the trade practices act, but for govemmentbusiness enterprises or bodies and including unincorporated enterprises. ThePrime Minister was asked the following question: Mr K!!atirig, have you read Mr Court's Rebuilding the Federation? He. replied: It hasn't been drawn to my immediate attention, no. He said, 'It The next question was: Why have you decided to relax the level of tied grants to the states? The P,rime Minister replied: We haven't decided to relax the level of tied grants. What we've said is that we want tod!!liver programs effectively, these programs are often best delivered jointly between the Commonwealth and the stateS. And we've got portfoli<Hninisters and state line ministers working in councils bringing reports .on hQusing, .on health and community services tQ the next meeting. That is the government's approach. A further question was asked: Mr Keating, Richard CQurt described YQu,before he came tQ this meeting, as a creeping centralist ... ? . . The Prime Minister responded: Well, he's much mQre agreeable inside the meetings,we are getting to the heart of it now---'I have gQt tQ say. And the result is ... 10Qk, don't take any nQtice .of what I say, lQQk at what we dQ. At three meetings .of COAG we've produced a national rail highway, a national training authority, food and product. standards, nQW theadQption .of majQr, mainframe competitive principle .of the Hilmer variety fQr an eCQnQmy-wide adoptiQn. It means that there is cQoperation between the CQmmQnwealthand the states and the nQtion that anyQne can try and beat states interests into some SQrt .of an issue which is exclusively, therefore, tQ the detriment of their state ... really I don't think that stands up when youlopk at the outcomes cQming frQm these cQQperative meetings. The Prime Minister continued: . .. I make two clear points about this-""-that unifQrm taxatiQn is·the glue that holds the FederatiQn tQgether. It's what makes what. would .otherwise be six eCQnQmies .one natiQn. That's not to say that the program delivery under these things should nQt be examined. But, that doesn't mean that .we can't have huge cQoperatiQn in other matters be they transport, be they standards, be they in electricity .or water. And what we're showing is that we're getting .on with those as again we did tQday with electricity. That is. the ,government's position. We need go no further to accept the fact that that is the position adopted by all of the conservative state governments. I will now read froln the communique from COAG that was signed and agreed to by not just other conservative state premiers but Richard Court. The introduction to the communique states: The CQuncil .of Australian GQvernments today held its third meeting, in HQbart. The CQuncil, comprising the Prime Minister, Premiers and .Chief Ministers and the President .of the Local Government Association, had wide ranging discussiQns aimed at increasing cQ-QperationamQng all spheres .of gQvernment in the national interest. The key .objectives .of the CQuncil's deliberatiQnswere to assist in bringing abQut· a more competitive and integratednational;market, and mQre efficient and effective arrangements fQr the delivery .of services in areas ,.of shared responsibility. This Colllmunique sets .out the. agreed outCQme .of thQse discussiQns. I, will not go into detail about the Hilmer competition matters, but I will quote, for the benefit of those opposite, that part of the communique which relates to Commonwealtnstate roles and responsibilities as agreed toby Premier Court:: The CQuncil did not have the .opportunity tQ conclude its cQnsideratiQn .of the report frQm the Working GrQup whi.ch it established at itspreviQus meeting tQ identify thQse functiQnal areas which exhibit inefficiencies in existing intergQvernmental arrangements and where progress 'cQuld be made in clarifying the roIes and responsiblIities .of governments. It agreed that this should be the main item .on the agenda fQr the meeting .of the CQuncil in August 1994. . The Oluncil did, however, agree that insQme areas a clear allocatiQn .of functional responsibility toone level .of gQvernment may be appropriate. In .other areas, where rQles and resPQnsibilities are shared, the Council considered it may be mQre apprQpriate tQ delineate rQles and responsibilities .of the different levels .of government within and across particular functiQnal areas in order tQ prQduce mQre efficient and effeCtive service delivery, eliminate .overlap and duplicatiQn, minimise impQsts .on the economy and enhance accountability. The Council agreed that the overriding .objective should be tQ improve outcomes for clients and value f9r mopey fQr taxpayers. . The Council noted that the practice of tied grants has sometimes led to duplicatiQn and confusion .of roles and resPQnsibilities between the States, TerritorieS and the CQmmQnwealth. The CQuncil acknowledged that any review .of ComlTlQnwealth/State roles and resPQnsibilities 'shQuld includecQnsideration oftied grants With a view to reducing their incidence. That is what is stated in the communIque. 'That is the most recent 'and best evidence that we' have 'in respeCt of the attitude which governments, Commonwealth and state, take to our current federation or cooperative Commonwealth-state relations: Let us 'look at the way irfwhich that meeting was interpreted by the general public through the media. Mr.Rocher-:-No, it doesn't happen that way; Steve.' . .'. .",56
137,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,":-My Western Australian colleague the' honourable member for Curtin laughs but he is sitting there shuffling and embarrassed. He will not get to his feet to defend either Premier Court or his own leader. I refer to an article in the Weekend Australian of 26 February entitled 'Competition breakthrough with States', which states: The agreement on competition policy at yesterday'S Council of Australian Governments meeting. was a decisive step in securing a more efficient economy, The article goes on: ... the Hobart COAG delivered an important degree of the federal-States co-operation which the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was seeking. Both camps emerged as winners. On the front page of the same Weekend Australian the economics editor, Alan Wood, refers to the meeting. He says: . ... the fact that genuine progress has been achieved in a vital, but politically hazardous, area of micro-economic reform. The Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett,· was reported again in the Weekend Australian as saying: . . . he thought it left the States in a reasonable position. ""It is a better starting position than many would have anticipated,""",60
138,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That's a big compliment. . Mr STEPHEN SMITH,.. - It is a much bigger compliment than the one he gave to Premier Court, which I will come to shortly. Professor Hilmer is reported in the Australian as saying: Hobart has given us a better start to this than might reasonably have been expected.... Success will mean not only economic benefits, but that· we have found a way for our· federation to handle the reality of what are single national-and often international-markets in the interests of all. That is the attitude taken by commentators to the current status of our federal-state relations. Let us have a quick look at the document which Premier Court tabled at that meeting. All honourable members would be aware of the attitude taken to. thatdocument,which was entitled Rebuilding the federation, by the conservative premiers. I quote from a transcript of the ABC News on Friday night, 25 February, in which, firstly, Premier Kennett and then the other conservative premiers were asked whether they had seen Premier Court's document: KENNETT -""I don't want you to tell anyone, but I haven't read it as yet."" Question-Do you intend to? ""Oh, probably on the flight back if I can."" FAHEY-""I haven't had time to look at it."" BROWN-""I've seen parts of it- I haven't read the entire document."" GROOM-""Ha! Very Interesting. (pause) It brings back memories ... That is the precise point. I will now turtl to the document. I will not . even try to go through this document at length. But I want to draw to the attention of the House the memories that it brings back for Premier Groom. In the introduction Premier Court acknowledges the fact that we are now a modem nation state moving into the next century. In the document he states: No one would dispute that Australia is a different country from the one in which the Federal system of Government was established. As a nation we are attempting to meet the new challenges and opportunities that are being presenting by the new era in world trade and our fast developing Asian neighbours. He goes on to say: I hope that this document is a positive first step in an informed debate which will lead to a rebuilding of the Federal system of Government in Australia .. But when we look at the document itself it is not looking to the future of either my state or process our country. We find a document that starts in 1900. The executive summary states: In 1900, and subject only to very light Imperial control from Londori,· each of the Australian colonies was legally and constitutionally illdependent. Those were the memories that sparked up in the mind of Premier Groom, and that is where Premier Court wants to take us back to. And there are a few insidious things on the way. Under the heading 'Centralised tax powers' it states: . After the War, the High Court upheld Canberra's authority to levy income taxes. This resulted in the States being forced out of the income tax field. The flavour of tl1is document is Richard Court's secret agenda-double income tax- He wants a separate state income tax for Western Australia. That is his agenda. Let us also look at what it says about the external affairs power in the paragraph on external affairs. It states: Originally the scope of this power was small, because most of Australia's external affairs were handled in London. That is what he harks back to. It continues: What has altered the Compact has been Canberra's deliberate use of the external affairs power, with the High Court's assistance ... So, unlike the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), he is not content to be handcuffed to the 1955 white picket fence. He. is not content, unlike most honourable members opposite, to be handcuffed to that era. Not only does Richard Court want to take us back to the 19OOs; he is handcuffed to Lord Forrest's grave in Karrakatta at the corner of his own electorate.· That is where he wants to take us back to. That is his mind-set. Under the heading 'The picture today', again it laments: The loss of income taxing powers ... Subsequent High Court and Commonwealth decisions have, for all practical purposes, States from re-entering the income tax field. So his lament is, 'Let's go back to Lord Forrest's era, but, while we are doing it, let us give Western Australia, through Richard Court, a separate state income tax'. What comfort does this give? Richard Court refers to . Sir John Forrest being commissioned by the Governor to form a ministry in 1890. Then we see the hidden agenda emerging again under the headings 'Reluctance to federate' , . 'Should Western Australia have gone alone?' and 'The move to secede'. Here we have the disgraceful conduct of Premier Court giving succour to a movement which suggests that Western Australia should secede from the Commonwealth. When we look at this document we see the things that Premier Court is harking for. He is not content to be like the honourable member for Bennelong, handcuffed to the 1955 picket fence. He wants to go back to John Forrest, but he wants a state income tax in the process. Richard Court really does the citizens of Western Australia a grave disservice because he puts Western Australia out in isolation from all of the other premiers. The honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) quoted from the· editorial in today's West Australian. I will quote from an article in the 'News Extra' entitled 'Court misses with States' rights drive'. That is the real problem for him. The lead paragraph states: Channel 1's Canberra bureau chief, Dennis Grant, summed up the mood at the Hobart meeting of State leaders and the Prime Minister Paul Keating last Friday. He told viewers: ""Frankly, Richard Court has made a bit of a goose of himself."" The view was that the wheels had fallen off Mr Court's States' rights barrow. And his own sortfellow LiberaLPremiers-hadhardly helped his cause. In conclusion, the subject of the matter of public importance referred to the serious economic implications for Western Australia of Australia's federal system. I will tell honourable members what the economic implications are. Together with Queensland, Western Australian i- our strongest state. I will tell honourable members why this is the case. It is has nothing to do with Richard Court. The things that Richard Court has done barred have added nothing to Western Australia's economic strengths. That has come from the changes made by this government to internationalise Australia's economy. (TIme expired) Mr Rocher-Iinvite the honourable member to table the statement to which he is referring, made by the Premier of Western Australia. Mr Stephen Smith-Is the honourable member referring to the document tabled at the COAG meeting? . Mr Rocher-No, the document from which you were quoting. ..",61
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Is· then;- a document that the honourable member wishes to table? If not,· I call the honourable member for Curtin. .",62
140,Mr ROCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was somewhat bemused by. the remarks of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). His contribution almost exclusively consisted of reading from the media. I hoped that we might have had some original thoughts from the honourable member. It seems that we will have to wait for those thoughts on this subject-and on many others, I suspect. Leaving aside the prime duty of a member of the House 'of Representatives to' represent the people of his or' her electorate, which representation is bound to be deficient-and I have real concerns about that-if anyone event is to hasten the erosion of state responsibilities and centralised power in this city of Canberra it will be the election of the ALP candidate to the seat of Fremantle in the forthcoming election. There has been a lQt of high grovel in. sections of the media about the merits of Ms Carmen Lawrence, former Premier of Western Australia. In the process they have overlooked some matters and this has led to the tendency to sweep under the carpet the 'best' traditions of the Bllrke, Dowding and latterly Lawrence administrations. They are there to be seen and they are on the record. If this parliament should see Ms Lawrence elected, we are going to have an exercise in memory. She will be a perfect replacement for the former minister for sports rorts. I will give honourable members an example of her memory. Ms Lawrence was asked a question before the royal commission into WA Inc: In July to November 1988 did you believe that the purpose and effect of the government involvement in PICL was fully and accurately explained tq the public? A. Cannot recall. The next question was: Did you attend a Cabinet meeting in about July  discussed Rothwell's current financial position? She answered: No recollection. She was then asked:. During 1988, SOIC and GESB each supported Rothwells to the extent of $50 million. Please - hen you first became aware of such support being proposed or having occurred? . Ms Lawrence replied: No direct knowledge.. This woman has' more ways of saying 'I cannot remember' than any politician that ever lived-with 'perhaps the exception of Ronald Reagan. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to consider the past record of the Labor candidate for the seat of Fremantle. She voted with the government of Western Australia for the motion that the government support Rothwells with a $150 million guarantee. She voted fora motion to support the government taking an equity investment in the Kwinana petrochemical project. She voted against the motion to accept the WA MCCusker report, in regard to which an amendment stipulated an urgent need for the WA fnquiry. She opposed opposition calls for a special investigation of Rothwells. She opposed motions for an independent commission of audit to examine government business dealings. That is the person who aspires to be the member for Fremantle. As recently as March 1993. when Ms Lawrence was asked about a possible move to federal politics-and she repeated the gaffe time and again-she revealed that she had turned down an 11 th hour offer to run for the federal seat at the previous election because she believed it to be morally wrong. Twelve months later it is now morally right. What does that say about the calibre of the woman who aspires to represent the people of Fremantle? . Given 'her memory, she will meet a lot of new friends every day here because there are a lot of people wandering around, and she is . going to see the same people and they will be new to her given her memory. She has the qualities to replace the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) in this Labor cabinet. We recall the fact that she could not remember having overdrawn and improperly drawn . on a $5,000 parliamentary imprest account which she ultimately had to pay out, but she has, a perfect memory. to replace the honourable member for Canberra. With that memory sbe is in line with the Prime Minister state (Mr Keating), who on occasions' cannot even remember to lodge his personal tax return. . There can be few people with worse credentials than Ms Carmen Lawrence to represent the best interests of Fremantle, or Western Australia, in this parliament. This claimed newfound interest in the interests of Western Australia that we read about in some sections of the media does momentarily attract media time and space, but what about the record? There simply is not time to catalogue all the relevant matters which would be of interest to those people who might be espousing the cause of Ms Lawrence. She only. recently caved into the Prime Minister on Mabo when she conceded the most fundamental of state responsibilities in the management of land title. She did that, with all the huge and detrimental implications that has for our state of Western Australia. It is indicative of a larger problem with Ms Lawrence: her failure to stand up for the interests of the people of Western Australia, and her demonstrated willingness to put those interests second to those of her Labor colleagues in this town. As one journalist said of her recently: Her commitment ... to retaining her home state's interests as her first priority ... may prove slippery than a Murray River carp when the Labor power blocs decide to exert their authority. That is it in a nutsheIl. This will .be the same slipperiness that she demonstrated two months ago when she undertook to stay on as the state Labor leader until the next election and, more recently, when she said that serving politicians should not quit their seats between elections. She was not talking, about the former member for Fremantle, let me assure you; she was talking about herself and her state colleagues. What has she done? She has quit. Mind you, so would I given her abysmal record and the abysmal failure of her campaign last year. We all know that Carmen· Lawrence is capable of abandoning commitments as soon as the opportunity arises. We have seen it in this case, and she did it readily; she played hard to get but it was false, it was insincere. Whether the misuse of the foreign affairs powers is either real or perceived, the process undermines the responsibility of the states in general and Western Australia in particular. I have.searched high and low for something Ms Lawrence may have had to say about the interests of Western Australia. It was only t:ecently, when she anno/lnced her candidature, that she found interest in the subject at all. That is the only reference I could find..,not a word; not even neeting resistance to - hat has happened in this",62
141,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,She gave away the railway line.,64
142,Mr ROCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"She gave away the railway line; it was losing a lot of money, I guess. I emphasise again: it is the 'record, n()t the words; with which we are concerned. The characterisation of her candidacy by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as 'a pit stop on the road to Canberra' is apt. That is all that can be said for it. She progressed from 27 June 1991 when, as premier,she refused to accept Labor's national land rights aspirations to a stage where, in state opposi.: tion in 1994, she embraced the most far-reaching legislation imaginable in the form of the Native Title Act. There was not a whimper of protest then. It is hard for me to imagine a greater disservice which could be done more to this parliament, but mote importantly to Western Australia, than having Ms Carmen Lawrence as Keating's. representative in Fremantle. (TIme expired).",64
143,Ms DEAHM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Macquarie) (4.50 p.m.)Like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Crosio), who is at the dispatch box, during the speech of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) I was wondering what the heIlwe were talking about. I had to keep looking at the terms of the matter of public importance. I did not hear very much from him about Western Australia's rights or about the federal system. It was, like just about every speech given in this place recently by honourable members from Western Australia, just another denigration of Dr Carmen Lawrence. We can expect nothing better from them in the lead-up to the by-election because those opposite know they will lose it and they know that Dr Lawrence will make a fine new member of the front bench of this government. At least the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) did address herself partly to the issue, despite the fact that she also indulged in the denigration and bating of Dr Lawrence. However, I will address myself to the issue. It is always a vexed issue and it is something with which, believe it or not, I do have some sympathy. I worked for the New South Wales government for some time and I k-ow that at times there are problems of confllct,overlap and all of those sorts of things. When Australia became a federation 94 years ago it did so for. very good reasons. It did so because this continent is a nation and we became constitutionally, even if not in spirit, a nation at time. R appears that we are not yet a nation, having heard the honourable member for Pearce say that she is not an Australian first. Why is she in this place if she does not put her country before all else? It is very admirable for honourable members in this place to be loyal to their local government areas, electorates, regions and states. Obviously, we need to stick up for those issues and to represent those areas. I see that only one member who has to be in this place has bothered to. stay and listen. Mrs Gallus-I don't. I'm not on duty.",64
144,Ms DEAHM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,In that case nobody is on duty. Mrs Crosio-Their own MPI and there is not a soul interested in it.,65
145,Ms DEAHM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That does not matter. Mrs Crosio-It is your MPl Where are your people?,65
146,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,lam here.,65
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The parliamentary secretary and the honourable member for Moore will not have a private conversation.,65
148,Ms DEAHM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The reality is that when Australia became a federation we had to overcome the. differences between the states: we had to get on another train at state boundaries because the rail lines were different and, even now, when families go from one state to another they have to adjust to a new education system. Central government cannot be compared with totalitarian countries, as the honourable member for Pearce likes to say. It is typical of people from the other side to cry totalitarianism and to look for reds under the beds; Central government has worked with the states to bring legislation and regulation which is of benefit to the whole of Australia. Unfortunately, the current Premier of Western Australia is not very keen on that. I noticed that the honourable member for Pearce did tiot bother to mention COAG, which .was a great milestone last week in bringing together state and federal issues. The honourable member for Pearce, like so many that of her colleagues, is living in the past. An editorial headed 'Centralism versus State taxes' in the Australian of 24 February says: It is imperative that the debate move beyond the old stereotypes-yet federal-State relations seem chained to the prisons of the past. I suggest that the honourable member for Pearce finds herself chained to the prisons of the past In her speech on the Native Title Bill, she said: To hurriedly overturn 200 years of legal precedent to right the wrongs of the past is flawed thinking. What an appallingstatement for somebody to make! Her predecessor, MrFred Chaney, was probably very disappointed with that statement.· It is certainly flawed thinking to believe thatjust because we have been doing something wrong for 200years we should not change it now. There is constant emphasis on states rights instead of state responsibilities. I noticed that at least the honourable member for Curtin used that word. We have responsibilities, not rights. One particular a:rea of interest to me as a person who represents an area of great environmental sensitivity is the Hawkesbury Nepean river system. We have great problems with the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system. I am constantly frustrated that this is a state responsibility. As a federal member; there is very little I can do. I sat here feeling great envy during the debate on the Murray-Darling legislation. I envied the Murray-Darling people because their river system runs through three states; therefore, a body has been set up in cooperation with those states and the Commonwealth to do something about cleaning up that river system. I certainly wish the Hawkesbury-Nepean ran through another state so that the federal government could do something about it. We know how much Mr Court cares about the environment. Every state except Western Australia has agreed with the Commonwealth to establish a national environment protection council. Why is Mr Court not interested? He does not want to protect the environment in Western Australia. He does not want to cooperate with the other conservative states and .the federal government. This. council would establish nl,ltional standards. The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) has been criticised a lot. We cannot pass up an excuse to give her another kick after: she has left the ministry! But at least was attempting in the environment portfoliothe environment portfolio seems to have been overlooked a lot in the last few months-to establish. national environment standards against the redneck opposition memQers of this state and this redneck Premier. The environment is a national issue. Everything that goes into the enviromnent-waterand air quality-is a m-tional issue. Air does not stop at state boundaries; nor do some rivers. The rivers which do not stop at state, boundaries suffer the consequences of catchment areas of other states. We have to get over this nonsense of states rights ori issues like the environment. Education and training is another area. The National Training Authority, which has recently been set up, is another good example of cooperation, of working together, to bring about a central and cooperative system. It is not a matter of the central governmentimposing itself on the states; it is a matter of cooperation. That is what the COAG meeting was about last week. I am sure that is the honourable member for Pearce omitted to mention COAG. She knew it would be an embarrassment. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) mentioned in his speech how pleas-d the other state premiers were with the cooperation that was taking place in that area. . The honourable member for Pearce' also mentioned-I think this is absolutely laughance able-that the former honourable member for Fremantle was such a Canberra person that neglected his own electorate. I would suggest this place. that a man who was in the prime··of his political career-lO years younger than I who have just come into this place-has chucked a good career in this place to live in Fremanhas expired. tIe. He said a number. of times how tiring it was to travelfrom his home; He wanted to be with his family at home in Fremantle. I am sure he is there because he loves the place. If he did not, he would have moved to Canberra. Those sorts of petty criticisms let down the side of an argument that might have had some substance. Before the honourable member for Perth left, he gave me a few notes containing points she that he did not have time to make. He points out that the many advantages Western Australia has gained are due to federal policies. The export culture that the federal government has established is a fine example. Western Australia is fortunate-it has nothing to do with any government-in having a great number of natural resources. It is that export culture, the low inflation' policies of· this government, international competition and low tariffs that have helped to make Western Australia a rich state. I am from New South Wales, as honourable members know. I am on the other side of the country. from Western Australia. It takes four to 4 11z hours to fly to Perth. Until I came into this place, I had made only very brief visits to Perth. I think it is a wonderful place. I have not been much beyond Perth, except to Fremantle, and I think the people who live in that state are extremely fortunate. They have a lot of things going for them. But wha.t they do not have going for them why is a Premier who, for his own. stubborn reasons, is rejecting and opposing policies, despite the benefits of those policies that come from this government, simply because they come from this government. I can think of no other reason. How can he reject the things that will benefit his state simply for . political reasons? I oppose this matter of public importance. I also put on record that I am disgusted that this matter of public importhas been brought purely for the sake of having a go at a candidate in a by-election, he which candidate will shortlybea minister in .",65
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Order! The time allotted for this discussion NA NA CONSERVATION BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by Mrs Kelly: That the bill be now read a second time.",66
150,Mrs GALLUS,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Hindmarsh) (5.00 p.m.}--The purpose of the Wet Tropics of 9ueen-­ land World Heritage Area ConservatIOn BIll is to implement the terms of an agreement between the Commonwealth. and Queensland for the management of the wet tropics area of North Queensland. An agreement concerning the wet tropics world heritage area management scheme was signed by the then Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland in November 1990.lt alI owed for the establishment of the Wet Tropic.s Management Authority, a wet tropics .management agency, a community consultative committee and a scientific advisory committee. The legislation is to manage the wet tropics area, complementary legislation having passed through the Queensland parliament in 1993. Originally, we were going to match that legislation, but as we are simply complementing the Queensland legislation this is a very slight bill. I think it is worth, while to look briefly what the management scheme c.overs. The wet tropics of Queensland management scheme covers five different sections. First, there is the ministerial council, the responsibility of which is to coordinate policy and funding of . the wet tropics between Queensland and the Commonwealth at ministerial level. Secondly, under'the rriinisterialcouncil comes the Wet Tropics Management Authority. It is the responsibility of the authority to report back to the council and to devise and make recommendations which go to the council, as well as be responsible to the council for the oversight of the management agency. This brings us to the third section, the agement agency. The management agency is responsible, through the authority to the ministerial council, for developing and implementing management plans for the authority. There· are then also two other committees. The first of these is the consultative committee, which isa community consultative committee. Its purpose is to allow the members of the community to have an input into the management of the authority. This compri-es a wide range of people from the community, including local government, tourists and Aboriginal representatives. The other committee is the scientific advisory committee, whose responsibility is to advise on research and those scientific matters affecting the management of the wet tropics. .. This brings me to the details of the bill. As I said,the details are very slight. There were only three things in the original bill brought to the parliament, before' it was introduced into the Senate: They are, firstly, that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories would appoint two members to the Wet Tropics Management Authority; secondly, that staff could be seconded from the Commonwealth to the authority; and, thirdly, that an anniJal report would be tabled in parliament every year. At the time this - ill was introduced into the Senate, the Austrahan Democrats brought in some amendments, two of which were adopted-I might say despite the opposition of the coalition. Although the opposition will not be opposing the bill in the House of Representatives, I think our opposiat tion was totally appropriate in the other place. One of the amendments brought on by the Democrats and which passed the Senate was that the Commonwealth minister, in appointing two people to the authority, should specify that one of those people be an Aborigine . As was pointed out by Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator CampbelI, the opposition thinks it is quite appropriate that an Aborigine be on the authority but we do not think that s?ould be specified in the legislation, for the sImple reason that there are only two appointees through the bill to the authority-whoever is most appropriate to fill those two positions. At present, the two positions are filled by Dr manKeto and Mr Donaghy. Both those people are eminently qualified. Mr Donaghy is a representative of theCaims commerce and tourism organisation and Dr Keto is a conservationist. 1 would not like to suggest which one of these members should be excluded to include an Aborigine. Perhaps one will be in the future, but that is certainly a matter to be decided on the qualifications of the people coming into the authority. I object very deeply to tokenism. I think to write into this legislation 'that an Aborigine be er, put on to that authority simply on the basis that he or she is an Aborigine is demeaning' to all indigenous people. Our indigenous people have enormous knowledge and qualifications of the land and where they are qualified they will be appointed. It the shame of the former Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories that to this date she has not fit to appoint to this position an Aborigine as one of her two people. I ask, as she has not done that in the past, why she saw fit to put it into the legislation. Also added to the bill was the recommendation that the Commonwealth minister, beit.he or she in future, should use his or her best offices to prevail upon the Queensland government to appoint an Aborigine to future consultative committees. I point out that the present consultative committee requires an Aborigine to serve on it. As the only other committee is the scientific committee, Senator Ian Macdonald asked quite justifiably in the Senate why this needed to be placed' in the legislation. Once there is a scientific committee and a community committee, we cannot see where the other committee would arise. it is a specialised committee, surely what important is that the person who goes on that committee be specialised in the matter which the committee has been set up, not simply be appointed because he or she is an Aborigine. Certainly on the consultative committee that is presently in existence it required, as. is appropriate, that an Aborigine be 01} that committee. Senator Coulter, in speaking to the amendments in the Senate, referred to the nomination of the wet tropics as a world heritage area and that the Aboriginal culture had mentioned as part of that nomination. ,The way Senator Coulter put it, it sounded like wet tropics had been nominated partly for their cultural value. That is not accurate. wet tropics were nominated for their natural and conservation value. It is true that Aboriginal heritage was mentioned in the nomination, but it was mentioned in one paragraph only. It was not supported as part of the nomination. As you would know; Mr Deputy Speakthere are two . types of nomination for world heritage listing. One is the natural aspects of an area and the other is the cultural aspects. If the Aboriginal culture had been a strong element in the nomination, that would have gone l!P as part of the nomination, but is, I suspect, to it did not in fact. So it remains that the wet tropics of Queensland, which is an absolutely fantastic seen and unique area-it has been well described in the Senate, so I shall not go into it further here-was put on the World' Heritage List for conservation vahie. Therefore, I ask: as there are only two Commonwealth appointees to the authority, how are they decided? Is the person there for conservation thrown off? This raises a difficulty. It would be my expectation that there will be Aborigines who, perhaps after Dr Keto has finished her term, will naturally fill that conservation role who will have the expertise to go on to the authority, having those conservation requirements and knowledge of the area, which would satisfy the reason for which the area has been nominated. Having mentioned the world wet tropics area, I am aware that the honourable member If for Leichhardt(Mr Dodd), who will be is following me in the debate today, is about to to table some findings of a survey on the wet for tropics which he was kind enough to hand to me before he spoke on it. I was distressed to note in one ofthose areas the effect of. world heritage listing on the local economy. In the is south region, 36 per cent of the people surveyed believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy;. in the tablelands 54 per cent believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy. This is a condemnation of the government, been not because it isa .world heritage area-I believe that is important and essential ·for the Australia-'-but because, with the removal of the logging and in declaring it a world heriThe tage area, the government did not live up to its commitment to the people of Ravenshoe and other areas to provide jobs, which was a promise that it made. The promise has not been kept and, as a result, families have been totally and utterly devastated. Unemployment has risen and families have been dispersed throughout the area. When the government declares world her'itage areas through the legislation, of which I will speak a little more in a moment, it has an obligation to make sure that those people dispossessed by it find other means of employment, otherwise conventions such as the world heritage convention will come into disrepute. I tum nowto the state of world heritage in Australia. World heritage is positively ed by all other countries in the world. year the International Union for the Conservaaround tion of Nature turns back hundreds of applicathat tions to have particular areas put on the World Heritage List. People in other parts the world are absolutely ecstatic when their areas is put on the World Heritage List; they see it as a positive boom to that area. Tourists from other countries are aware that that atea is special and unique and is worth seeing because it is on the World Heritage List. But that is not the condition in Australia. In Australia people fear and loathe world heriable tage, which is very sad for this government. It goes to the heart of the world heritage in this country and the legislation that c:lrawn up in the early 1980s-1 believe in 1983-on world heritage by the then minister, Barry Cohen. That legislation is the most draconian piece of legislation I have seen in my time in this place. It allows the minister a to go into declared world heritage area- Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that world heritage areas do not belong to the Commonwealth, they canbe private land or national parks; a whole range of areas can be declared world heritage areas-and say to a prhrate. land-holder, 'You can no longer do this your area', and there is nothing in that legislamarsh tion that guarantees compensation. The result chair, of this has been that people all around Australia fear that, if their area is declared world heritage area, they will be prevented from doing some activity and they will not paid compensation. Mr Dodd-Who stirred that up in the first place? Who told you that?",67
151,Mrs GALLUS,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"If the honourable member for Leichhardt thinks this is out of court, I suggest that he go down to WillandraLakes, which was put on the World Heritage List by the Fraser government. After this area had been put on the World Herit-ge List, the Labor government came to power; What has happened to Willandra Lakes in the 13 years since then? I will tell honourable members what has happened- Willandra Lakes was declared a world heritage area because its archaeological values have been totally and utterly degraded. There has been no protection regardof that area. The honourable member for Each Leichhardt should go up there and walk the area. He will see the sand moulds contain thousands of years of Aboriginal history. The tourists have been allowed tOTUn of and walk over them. There are no walkways one of through the area' and no Commonwealth money has gone into the area whatsoever. The people' used to be proud that they had the remnants of an Aboriginal civilisation' around the lunettes of the lake. They have now reached the stage where they tooMr Tim Fischer-Mungo Lake.",69

153,Mrs GALLUS,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"What has happened to Mungo Lake under this government is an absolute disgrace. Where is the government's genuine commitment to world heritage? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories . (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, wishes to make some comments about world heritage. Will she tell me whether she holds the belief.:....",69

155,Mrs GALLUS,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"My apologies, Mr Deputy a Speaker. The parliamentary secretary has commented on the care of Willandra' Lakes. be I invite her to go out to WiIIandra Lakes and ' have a look at what has happened under the 13 years of Labor management. As I said, the area has been degraded and the people who live there have been suffering extraordinarily under the world heritage regime. World heritagy boundaries were. drawn up on the basis of the property of the people who owned land-not on the values of the world heritage list but on the land-with nothought given to the fact that in the future that would be the way it would be administered. As a consequenc.e, the people of that area have lost income .. They have not been able to crop because, on the basis of world. heritage, they have lost capital value and they believe they cannot sell their properties without it. That whathas happened to the people in WiIIandra Lakes. Let us not stop at WiIIandra Lakes, let us look at the care of other world heritage areas under this government? For instance, Lord Howe Island has an enormous sewerage problem .and a massive weed problem. Where has the. commitment of this government been . to Lord Howe Island? There has been nothing there because this government has. been far more interested in grandstanding and saying, 'We are going to declare new places. We are going to have new places Rut on the World Heritage List'. Mr Dodd-Why don't you tell us about the New South Wales government? Mrs GALLUS....::.The Commonwealth had the responsibility of putting world heritage to the IUCN .and the nomination. Having done that, it was passed by the Labor government, which has shown no interest or responsibility to. either of. those two places. This is the commitment of this government to world heritage-:-nothing. What have we had since then? At. present we have the Lake Eyre fiasco. This is a government that believes in community consultation. This is the 'fee! good' Lab()rgovernment. It says, 'Let us talk to the community and find out what the grassroots want'. What do the' grassroots want? Did the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) go to Lake Eyre and talk to the people? . Mrs Crosio-Why should he? . Mrs GALLUS-The parliamentary secretary asks, 'Why should he go to Lake Eyre?' . The Prime Minister, out of the blue, in March 1993, suddenly announced to Australia in general that Lake Eyre Basin would be nominated by' thf?end of the year, without any consultation with the people at Lake. Eyre. What did these people do? They had never heard about world heritage. They rang the people at WilIandra. Lakes, went across to Shark Bay, talked to. the people in Western Australia and found out what happened with world heritage. They realised the possibilities of world heritage and what it could do to them. Since then, certain groups have approached the ,ex-minister and said, 'What will you do to help us get world heritage working is again in Australia?'. They said, 'The first thingwe need is a change in that absolutely draconian legislation which allows a minister to go in and dictate what can happen in an area and not offer any compensation at all'. It is not required by the legislation'. The National Farmers Federation, amongst others, has asked for a change to that legislation. Thepreviousminister cared so Iittlefor it that she said, 'We like it the way it is' . That is despite the fact that she had lost two nominations-the NuIIarbor Plains and the Lake Eyre region. So that is thehist6ry of this government on world heritage. It is a sad history. . The coalition has always supported world heritage. The Fraser government put the first five listings in Australia on the World Heritage List. We have always maintained our support for the World Heritage List and we will not support the way that this government has degraded it The government has let it fall down in the eyes of the community and has not fulfilled its obligation under the World Heritage Act to the World Heritage Commission. That is a disgrace. In regard to the wet tropics,one can only hope that' this government will pick up its act and look after not only the wet tropics but also those people who were put out of work when the wet tropics was declared part of the world heritage area.",69
156,Mr DODD,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"I am very proud to have significant areas of the wet tropics world heritage area in my electorate of Leichhardt. Also in my electorate is the headquarters of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Authority, which will .be firmly established by this legislation, together with the mirroring legislation that has already been passed by the Queensland government. This beautiful area is exceptional in that it is one of only 12 areas in the world that meet all four criteria for world heritage listing. well worth mentioning the criteria. They are that the site is, first, an outstanding example representing the major stages of the earth's revolutionary history; second, an outstanding example representing ongoing geological processes, biological evolution and man's interaction with his natural environment; third, contains superlative natural. phenomenon, formations and features; and, fourth, contains the most important and significant natural habitats where threatened species of animals or plants of outstanding value live. There is a diversity of landscapes that make up the superlative natural phenomena, formations and features of the wet tropics. Scenic areas include typical tropical rainforests with cathedral-like high canopies and giant trees, some over 3,000 years old,to dense vine forest with diverse life forms of strangler figs, twisting vines, climbing palms, ferns, Iilies and orchids. The region is one of extensive sweeping forest vistas with forest-clad mountains, often contrasting with the drier eucalypt forests. The area in my electorate north of Cairns combines beautiful lowland tropical rainforest and white sandy beaches and fringing reefs offshore. This combination of reef and rainforest-both are world heritage listed-is unique in the.world and is a special attraction that brings so many Australian and international visitors to Cairns. Tropical forests make up seven per cent of the earth's surface but contain more than half of the world's'biota. Biodiversity is recognised internationally as an impot1-nt goal. Proudly, Australia was one of the .first signatories to the biodiversity convention. The wet tropics of Far North Queensland has the most intense biodiversity of anywhere in Australia. The ecological factors of the wet tropics are important but so too are the pure· aesthetic. factors. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I am sure that you have traversed the wet tropics area of Far North Queensland. It is just magnificent. Unfortunately, Ido have enough opportunities to walk in the rainforests in my electorate of Leichhardt. I think there is a mystical character to the rainforest·which goes beyond anything that I could put into this It is speech and I am sure that you would agree with that. . There are also important economic factors. An article in the last Weekend Australian mentioned· the rivalry between Cairns· and Townsville. Itanalysed why Cairns has gone forward in relation to tourism and, unfortunately, Townsville seems to have been left behind .. The airport was also mentioned in that article. Certainly local initiative by the private and public sectors assisted with the Cairns airport, but it is no coincidence that the upsurge in tourism to both reef and rainforest in the far north that occurred during the late 1980s-certainly it is continuing in the 1990s-came at the saine time as the world heritage listing. When people are asked why they wantto come to the far north as a tourist attraction, they mention the Great Barrier Reef but more and more they are mentioning the Daintree region and the wet tropics. So, obviously, it is a very important and significant region. I think the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) is way off beam even to suggest that somehow the listing of the wet tropics has cost jobs. Tell the tourism industry in Far North Queensland that the listing of the wet tropics has cost jobs! That is just not true. It has been a job maker, not a job taker. We all know that such natural riches need protecting and the Wet Tropics World Heri. tage Authority is the main planning instrument for the Queensland and Commonwealth governments. The authority is doing an - xcellent job of consul-ing with all interests in the region to develop management plans which will reflect the various needs of differerit groups. The;honourable member for Hindmarsh ti:llked about the fear and loathing that people have of the wet tropics .. The success of the government's world heritage listing has been shown recently by a community attitudes survey conducted by AGB MCNair, to which the honourable member kindly referred. The survey found that 80 per cent of the people in the whole region supported the listing. That is up six per cent since 1992. The survey is interesting. It talks about awareness, and 87 per cent of people in my region are aware that the wet tropics have been world heritage listed. Over 85 per cent of people in Cairns support the listing-that is hardly fear and loathing-and 65 per cent of people in Cairns see a positive effect in the community from the listing. When. we look at the region as a whole, in 1992, 53. per cent of people in the region and 35 per cent of people in Cairns Level of Support St-ongly support Shghtly support Neither Slightly oppose .Strongly oppose Don't Know Total support Total-'oppose Incidence of ""Strongly Supporting"" Wet 70 46 % o toj,:-L-Total Sydney thoughtthe region had a positive effect on the local economy. In 1993, 50 per cent of people in the region and 45 per cent of people in Cairns thought the listing had a positive effect in their community. Although I am not totally critical of the whole of the speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I do not think that is evidence of fear and loathing. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the results of the AGB MCNair survey in relation to attitudes towards the wet tropics. Leave granted.

157,Mr DODD,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Part of that survey, which I have not sought to incorporate, talks about the awareness of world heritage listing. Spontaneous awareness of world heritage listed areas is greatest for Kakadu, rating 32 per cent in the cities, but for the wet tropics it rates 68 per cent regionally. Total awareness of the wet tropics as a world heritage listed area has risen significantly since last year-regionally, from 71 per cent to 87 percent, and in the cities it is up 12 per cent, from 31 percent to 43 per cent. So it is obvious that the listing of the world heritage area positively helps tourism in Far North Queensland and that means it positively helps jobs. The regional survey on the management of the wet tropics looks at reasons for dissatisfaction in 1993. Of those surveyed, 36 per cent were dissatisfied because it was taking too long, nothing was happening and there was not enough progress; These people are not showing fear and loathing. They are asking the Commonwealth and the Queensland government to get on with.. the job. Further reasons for dissatisfaction included: too much bureaucracy, 23 per cent; do not hear anything, 18 per cent; too much of politics, 12 per cent; developers have too much influence, seven per cent; stopping development in the region, threat to jobs, six per cent. The number of people who are dissatisfied beca,use deyelop-rs have too much influe.nce over the wet tropics is greater. than the number of people who are dissatisfied because development is being stopped.

I particularly welcome some recent amendments that have been incorporated irito the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill in relation to Aboriginal interest in the wet tropic rainforests. It is fit and proper that the preamble of the bill should now recognise that 'Aboriginal people have occupied, used, and enjoyed land in .the area since time immemorial'. I also look forward to the appointment of an Aboriginal representative on the board of the authority and I commend the Rainforest Aboriginal Network for the thorough and competent job it is doing in representing Aboriginal concerns both to the government and to the authority. Aboriginal people must be represented on the authority. It has been a fairly major oversight that Aboriginal people nave not previously been on the authority. It is very important-and I hope the honourable member for Hindmarsh is listening-not only because of the High Court's decision in the Mabo case and because Aboriginal people are part of the community but also because of the Aboriginal people's indigenous knowledge of the wet tropics region. They are the people who have had close knowledge of this region for thousands of years. It is very foolish for any government and any authority todisregard this indigenous knowledge. An area of the wet tropics most frequently recognised by people outside the region is the Daintree-Cape Tribulation area where local people first made a stand in drawing national attention to the construction of a road through the rainforest. That area of Douglas shire is now under enonnous pressure from thousands of tourists who flock to see the beauty of the reef and the rainforest. Fortunately the local council and its far-sighted chainnan, Mr Mike Berwick, have been working in conjunction with the Commonwealth to devise development plans for the area that will: (a) addresS adequately the needs and rights of local residents and landowners; (b) preserve the area's environmental assets; and (c) provide for a sustainable and prosperous ecotourism industry, The Commonwealth has been asked by the council to assist financially to allow it to draw up possible plans, and these representations have been favourably received. As a government, we have recognised that a small local community cannot bear the full burden of managing and protecting such a precious national resource. I take this opportunity to thank the two private trusts-the Daintree Rainforest Foundation arid the Australian Bush Heritage Fund-that have been responsible for raising money nationally to purchase a . biologically valuable block that will be managed in conjunction with the surrounding protected areas in the Daintree. One of the success stories that the Commonwealth government has created with the listing of the wet tropics and with cooperation of 11 councils is the North Queensland community rainforest reafforestdireCtion ation program. Currently about 70 young coastal people who are employed under LEAP are being trained and working at planting a variety. of trees on priva-e property for future harvesting as timber. Qver 100 other young people have gone through the program and the over 300 local farms have benefited. I must take this opportunity to correct some serious misrepresentations made in the Semite last week by Senator' Ian ¥acdonald, who criticised the Wet Tropics Management Authority over the size of its $5.5 milljon community relations project. Senator Macdonald accused the authority of self-promotion and self-aggrandisenientwithout checking facts. The reality is that the bulk of this money-in fact, $3.5 million-was spent on infrastructure maintenance, construction visitor facilities, walking tracks and roads and the establishment of new visitor centres, all of the most importan't features needed to get people into the area and have them go away satisfied with the experience. I wish that coalition spokespersons would check their facts instead of going off half-cocked. So to the future of the area. Pressures are building up as the coastal strip of Cairns is developed and land will become in 'short supply, putting pressure on the rainforest and on world heritage buffer areas. I express my support for the idea of a tunnel from Cairns to the tablelands to fadlitate the development of that region. The idea of a tunnel from Smithfield just north of Cairns to the bridge on the Barron River near Kuranda has been raised by the Chairman of the Mulgrave Shire, Mr Tom Pyne. I believe the tuntie1 idea is truly visionary. It is the sort of project that is scoffed at:. - understandably, because of the cost Queensland Department of Transport officials estimate the cost of the tunnel to be somewhere between $100 miIIion and $300 million. The cost, however, will be offset by a number of factors. Cairns is growing fast. Anyone who has flown into Cairns knows just how close the rainforest covered wet tropics mountain ranges are to the coast. I think you would the know that yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker. Cairns is spreading out in a north-south because of this mountain range. The strip is already feeling the pressure. It is highly sought after development land fot both housing and tourism development and a lot of areas. are prime cane land. This pressure is squeezing development up the hillsides at expense of pockets of rainforest. If Cairns continues to grow at its current rate, the . coastal development strip will eventually extend from Port Douglas to Cardwell. We simply cannot afford the associated infrastructure costs and, just as importantly in the context of this legislation, the environmental costs. Importantly, the tUn11el proposal has the the support of the far' north community. Most people agree that it would be an environmentally and economically reckless attempt to of widen the Kuranda range road. Already the range road is congested by heavy traffic servicing the growing tablelands population as well as tourists visiting Kuranda. In the wet season the range has. a tragic history of fatal and near fatal accidents. The Mulgrave Shire Council supports the tunnel because it takes the pressure off the increasingly congested coastal strip. The Mareeba shire at the other end supports it because it has low value rural l-nd ready for residential development and it will be an alternative route to the coast. The North Queensland greens support it as a way of relieving pressure on the coastal strip and the Wet Tropics Management Authority certainly prefers it to widening the Kuranda range road as a way of taking pressure off the coast. The sugar industry would. support it because the five-minute travel time to the coast would make it much more economi<;:al to get cane from the Atherton Tablelands to the sugar mills on the coast. The area of real growth in !iugar is the tablelands. There is an opportunihard ty .' for some people involved in tobacco production to shift to sugar production, but the problem is getting the cane from the tablelands to the mills on the coast. If we are to preserve the wet tropics area for future generations, maintain the sugar industry in the far north and meet the demands of a rapidly expanding residential population in the region, the federal government has to get together with the Queensland state government and industry and build this tunnel. In the long run, the tunnel will pay for itself. In the not too distant future I would like to be able to comment upon the construction of such a tunnel as an example of an important initiative that the Commonwealth has taken in the far north. I am proud to be a member of this government that has taken these initiatives. I will continue to do all in my power to ensure the prosperity. of the region that I represent in this House. I will encourage and support the crucial role of the Wet Tropics Management Authority in ensuring the sustainable use of the region's world renowned natural assets. It would be great for the coalition's credibility if, one day in a debate about world heritage in this House-I did not notice the honourable member for Hindmarsh saying this-it would concede that the Queensland National Party government was very wrong in opposing world heritage listing of the wet tropics. It is hyporcritical for the coalition to come inhere today and not mention that..The opposition went right down the wire, from the Bjelke-Petersen government to the Ahem government, in opposing wet tropics listing in the courts .and in the poHtical sphere. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Hawke Labor government on its farsightedness in listing the wet tropics world heritage area. I congratulate Senator Richardson, the current Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I also congratulate the former minister, Ros Kelly, because she has taken the wet tropics froll) the stage of listing to the stage where, this legislation is before the House. Molly Robson, the minister in Queensland, and Ros Kelly have put in all the work publicly and all the work in negotiation and consultation to get us to the point where we are today, with the authority and the bill before this House. That should be recognised. Given the events of this week, I especially acknowledge the work that the former minister, Ros Kelly, has done.",76
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"-.,. The honourable member might refer to the former minister by her correct title.",78
159,Mr TUCKEY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,The honourable member for Canberra.,78
160,Mr DODD,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"I am sorry; I mean the honourable member for Canberra. I thank the honourable member for O'Connor. As I said at the outset of my speech, I' am very proud to have this world heritage listed area ,in my electorate. I totally support the bill before the House.",78
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Before calling the next speaker, I' advise the honourable member for Leichhardt that, as the paper he presented for inclusion in Hansard does include some graphs, its inclusion will depend on the ability of Hansard to do so.",78
162,Mr TUCKEY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"O'Connor) (5.40 p.m.)Before presenting my contribution to this debate, I wish to refer to the remarks of the honourable, member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). I am in receipt of ,the AGB MCNair - urvey that he sought to incorporate. He was at pains to say that there had been no nomic effect as a result of the listing of the wet tr()pics. I note from the report to which he ,referred that for the south region, which obviously was one of the regions polled, positive effect is listed at 14 per cent and negative effect at 36 per cent, and that for the tablelands the positive effect is listed at 13 per cent and the negative effect, at 54 per cent. They are not my figures; they are his. Quite clearly there is some able to Cairns. No doubt Cairns was doing pretty well on its own. I would imagine a lot of these people who, have chosen a lifestyle in an area such as the wet tropics not really want to be shifted to Cairns and into that urban environment. Whilst no doubt the honourable member for Leichhardt would agree with the figures he has asked to have incorporated in Hansard, it appears that some interpretation would be needed. As to the effect on the residents' own community in tablelands, the positive effect was 18 per cent and the negative 34per c((nt. The Wet Tropics of Queensland World HeritageArea Conservation BiII is brought to this parliament under the external affairs power, which I think is section 51(xxix) of the constitution, and of course the power related to the area of the right of the executive to sign treaties without the appro\fal of parliament. This legislation, of course;1 does require the approval of parliament; it is a flow-on- I want to take the opportunity today to especially pay attention to that aspect. In December 1987 the Commonwealth 'listing. nominated the wet tropics area of North Queensland for world heritage listing. Senator Richardson, the then environment minister, banned logging of rainforests using his power under the World Heritage Properties Conserbeen vation Act. The area was placed on the world heritage list in December 1988. I think the honourable member for Leichhardt, had he stayed around to listen, would admit that was a very traumatic time in that area. This situation followed the role that Senator Richardson took upon himself, having polled or come to the decision from other polling that the green vote-and, of course, more importantly, the preferences of certain green ecocandidates-was going to be very important in that election, and we had this procession of . heritage listings. Senator Richardson would be well versed in that process because the trade the union movement has a similar role, in that the union bosses get one wage increase and then, very, shortly after that, if they do not go out to get another one, people start to question the need for their existence and for paying union , dues. So there is this constant procession of benefit applicfeeding the troops. Later-I think it might have occurred when that the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) was the minister-the town of Carnardid von, in an area well known to me, Shark Bay, in north Western Australia, was also listed. I lived on the coast of Shark Bay for 25 years. Today the people are extremely disillusioned as to the result of that listing. I made the point at the time, knowing the area as I did, that I could not consider what its heritage the values were. Of cqurse, the reason that it attracted the attention of the government was that many years ago some fishermen regularly fed some dolphins, which became tame and regularly visited the spot. They have become a tourist attraction, but they are not heritage. They could go away if people stopped feeding themand if that is the heritage, it has gone. Mention was also made of stromatolites, which are black rocks that have a very long history of growth and development involving hardening of algae. I think that various places that attracted popular and toorist attention around Australia were ticked off One at a time for heritage What has been the result of that? I got the greatest shock of my life during the Mabo debate when, in consultation with representatives of the mining industry, one very senior person casually mentioned that people had going overseas to the World Heritage Commission to find out what could be done in Australia. They had to go ,to a group of people representing countries-I do not know that which ones:-some of which might just have similar mineral potential and would rather qevelop theirs than ours. Of course, we can bet theirs is not under heritage listing. Representatives of our private sector are now travelling overseas. The tragedy of it was that these blokes did not mention it as being something of horror or shock; they have come to learn that they have to spend money to travel overseas to get approval to carry out works and to create employment and development and overseas income in Australia. This situation becomes even more ironic when we are going through a great national debate, spearheaded by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that puts the case that Australians should be independent of foreign influence and that they should consequently be able to set their. own agendas. Of course, we know what that is all about. It is about the Prime Minister's personal hatred of the United Kingdom and, of course, the fact that our political system happens to rely on the Westminster system-it is not bound to it by any means, but it relies on it. The Prilne Minister runs around saying to people, 'Would you like to be independent?'. If he asked me that question, the answer would be yes. If he asked anybody else, the answer would be yes. When, having decided on that, he says to people, 'What sort of political system would you like?', or, 'What sort of election or appointment of a head of state would you like?' - when they get the options put before them-they start to worry. But that is what we are having put to us in one breath whilst, from research that I have conducted, as of 1992 Australia had signed 112 treaties or conventions with the United Nations, each one committing the people of Australia to knuckle their forehead to foreign influence. Let us get it straight. If the Prime Minister positively agrees with a free and independent Australia, why does he do those sorts of things? My research takes me a bit further. When I look at this documentation, which I think might be from reports on the constitutional debates, which talks about the external affairs power and the power of the executiveoriginally vested, of course, in the' crown under our constitution-to sign treaties without consultation of the parliament, I find out how other couritries which do have a national pride and a pride in-heir constitution or bill of rights deal with these matters. In the United States, theconstitutiOll gives the President the executive power to make treatie-, but ()nly if two-thirds of senators pre-ent concur."" In that case, because the Senate is the states house of America, as it is the states house of Australia, each state, represented by its senators, has to give approval-up to two-thirds; a very high majority. That is how the Americans deal with it. They do not just sign their lives away. Furthermore, it is recognised in the United States that the treaty-making power is subject to some limitations, in that it cannot be used to override expressed prohibitions contained in the constitution such as the guarantees of liberty as contained in the bill of rights. Why do we not do that? If we so dearly love our country and our independence, why do we use the signing of treaties for the express purpose of overriding our constitution? Why have we created a situation, as'we have with this heritage legislation-we are dealing with a component of it today-where businessmen have to travel overseas to talk to foreigners? Our miners have told me this personally, without complaining about it. Mr ChynO\veth-That is rubbish. Mr TUCKEy-It is not rubbish. T\:le honourable member for Dunkley can withdraw that remark, because he is suggesting that I am lying. Members of the mining industry told me that personally, and not as though it was some big deal. It was no big deal. They were not trying to argue that they should not have even been there; they just told me as a matter of fact that they had been to the heritage commission. Why? To find out their rights. That is what happened. It is all right for those opposite to say what the effect is' and what it should be and what it should not be. The honourable member for DUrikley would have stood up some time ago and said that Victoria had no likelihood of land claims under Mabo, but it has one; I read about it in the paper the other day. The New South Wales government is withdrawing housing blocks from the market because it cannot guarantee ownership any more to someone who might buy them. I see that land blocks in Alice Springs have been sold, and that people are now being refused permission to build houses on them. It is all right to tell me what the government meant in its legislation; I am telling honourable members what happened. If the honourable member who has interjected wants to come with me, I will take him to the bloke who told me and let him tell him again. Mr Chynoweth-Where? Overseas to have a chat?",78
163,Mr TUCKEY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"No. An Australianrepresentative of the mining industry told me this recently. As I said, it ,was not as though it was a big deal to him. He just said in conversation that they had been over there to find out what they are allowed to do in Australia. Mr Chynoweth-You said they had to go overseas to get permission.",81
164,Mr TUCKEY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,They did. They had to go there and find out.,81
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,Mr Nehl)Order! Perhaps the honourable member for O'Connor will direct his remarks through the chair and the honourable member for Dunkley will contain himself.,81
166,Mr TUCKEY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Yes. He might cease interjecting. But there is the answer. I offer the honourable member for Dunkley a chance to meet this person. I think the fellow lives in Melbourne, so it would not be too hard for the honourable member to come and listen. We have seen this matter become almost a low farce. One of the great rights written in our constitution is the right of land management. The heritage legislation imposes itself particularly on that right and certainly on items that are above the ground. It is very much associated with land management. Section 51(xxxi) of the constitution, which deals with the power that is given to the Commonwealth, states: The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of the Parliament has power to make laws. That right of the Commonwealth contains the very powerful caveat of just terms. If the Commonwealth puts itself into the bU,siness of land management, it will pay. We are now seeing these sorts of treaties, be they in the heritage legislation or the external affairs power-in other words, the Racial Discrimination Act, et cetera-all being used to override the rights set down in our constitution for the people of a state. I underline that. So often we hear people sneer at the concept of states rights because they perceive them as the power of a premier or the elected government, forgetting that they are the elected government and that they do have that right. The people have elected them and expect the in to represent their interests. It was interesting to hear today in the MPI the comments' of two speakers as to how Carmen Lawrence failed to do. that. She gave away railway lines and our licensing system, et cetera. State premiers are not supposed to do all those things. They are elected to do the specific job of representing the interests of people, which vary from state to state for all sorts of good and proper reasons. That is where I want to come to. on this matter. Our Senate, at least in voting terms, is still representative of the interests of the people of each state in equal numbers. Senator Harradine has proposed in the Senate in various ways since at least 1983 that the Senate be given some power to approve of these various treaties before they are signed. Should this parliament go out and sign these treaties, as it surely has in the industrial relations area in recent times? I wonder whether it rang up the ILO and asked it to write out a few treaties in the area of industrial relations so that it could sign them. As most people would know, particularly from the constitutional debates, it was only at the last second that the founding fathers chose to put anything in our constitution relevant to industrial relations. Even then, they were given a power to co.nciliate and arbitrate, and that was the end of it. But that has been expanded by the government's rushing off to the ILO, signing treaties ,and conventions and which then coming back here and imposing requirements and laws across all of Australia when thepeopJe of certain states with elected governments had an entirely different view. They elected those gov-rnments on the platform of that entirely different view. The people of Western Australia were in no doubt about what the Court government proposed to do in the area of industrial relations when they voted it into office. not only clea:rly known in its policy; it was advertised day after day by the 'trade union movement in a massive scare campaign. The people voted for Court and that policy. The federal government's signing a treaty will .overrule the wishes of the people of Western Australia. The issue of Mabo was not so much a state election issue. One only has to poll people for a moment to realise that; on the basis of that treaty and the use of the external power, the people of Western Australia do not want it. .",81
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"I remind the honourable member that the subject. of this bill is the wet tropics area of Queensland: He might care to return to it. , MrTUCKEY - The subject of the biII is the use of the heritage legislation to implement certain agreements between the Queensland' government and the Commonwealth government. The only reason the Commonwealth government has any right to have this legislation before the parliament and have it likely to survive in the High Court is that it signed a treaty. It gave this property to the heritage commission at the United Nations. Although we still seem to be running it reasonably well ourselves, I wonder how long it will be before somegroup of tourist operators comes to me, as has the mining industry, and says, 'We have to save some' money. Can we get a government grant? We have to go to the heritage commission to find if we can build a motel'. That is the basis of what lam talking about. I am coming to the very core of what this is all about. The very core of this matter is the external affairs power and whether or not executives on my side' of politics, the Labor side of politics or some new side of politiCs should be able to do in Australia what practically no other country in the world does. Certainly those with the pride in their nation that the Americans have do not do it. The Americans do not give the President the right to go off signing treaties; they make it subject to a thirds vote in the Senate. Not even the Senate can override'its constitution. Yet these sorts of treaties are being used in Australia for that express purpose, and it is wrong. That is why, It was in many ways, we can ask questions about this specific legislation. There is nothing wrong with what the Commonwealth government chooses to do, because the people of the state of Queensland, through their elected government, have already taken action. That is why I support this piece of legislation. Of course, there are still those who lost their jobs, livelihood, future and lifestyle; I suppose that is not the only time it has happened. However, it is amazing how people losing the.ir jobs on an oil rig was of great concern to the Western Australian Labor Party but people who lost their jobs through a national park listing in Western Australia was not. All those good people in the timber industry came around today to see us. They ran a candidate against the. Labor Party in Western Australia in the last election. People who have voted for Labor all their lives are the victims. That has been proven time and again. Through initiatives taken in our state with CALM, in association with the Commonwealth, good, programs can be laid down for conservation in state governments. State governments are on the ground. They know about these things. There is no need for these sorts of treaties generally if the people of a state do not want them. There has been too much politics in this program. People will stand up in this chamber in 20 or 30 years time and condemn us for this expedient politieal approach. They will condemn us because they will be sick of going overseas to get permission to do what they would normally do in Australia as independent Australians. No other country would sell its own people out in this fashion just to centralise a bit of power. I repeat: the honourable member for Dunkley can COme and meet that bloke any time he likes.

168,Ms HENZELL,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,Capricornia) (6.00 p.m.)I am always following the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I never know whether I should be laughing or crying after listening to one of his speeches. I want to two- help him because he referred to something very important about Shark Bay.,82
169,Mr TUCKEY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Have you ever been there? MsHENZELL-No, but I will tell you what are there. There are stromatolites. the benefit of Hansard we need to get a clarification on one of the reasons why Shark Bay is so important Mr Tuckey interjeciing",83
170,Ms HENZELL,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"I did not interrupt you when you. were talking. Let me tell the. honourable member for O'Connor that stromatolites are one of the world's oldest living fossils. It occurs to me that the honourable member for O'Connor should feel a real mental kindred interest with the world's oldest living fossil because there may well be a definite association between the honourable member for. O'Connor and the world's oldest living fossil. Certainly, he seems to have been forever. We hear the same tired old diatribe in his speeches whether they are on the tropics or on anything else in his usual range-industrial relations, Mabo, states rights. . We have seen a concerted campaign by him to smear Carmen Lawrence, who is the Labor candidate for the seat of Fremantle, and another attempt by opposition members to smear because they have got into of smear. Mr Tuckey interjecting",83
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,83
172,Ms HENZELL,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"They have nopolicies so they are into smear and blood sports. They might have had a bit of a win this week I suppose they are feeling a bit cocky that, but in the end it will not do them good because the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation BiII will demonstrate once again the fundamental results difference between the government and the opposition. We have policies, reform strategy and we have been busy putting them intoplace over the last 10 to 11 years. That is why we are back in governof ment. That is why all the fossils on the opposition's front bench will stay there and become older living fossils. Mr Tuckey interjecting",83
173,Ms HENZELL,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"I am pleased that the honourable member for O'Connor is going so For we can actually get on with the serious business of debating this biII. I am' very pleased to speak in support of this bill and to support my colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), in whose electorate this very important area is located. With the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill 1993 we have a commitment by this government and a vision for one of the great areas of environsignificance in this country. This bill will provide complementary legislation to Queensland's Wet Tropics World Heritage Protection and Management Act 1993, which was passed by the state government in Sephere tember1993. The two pieces of legislation . will implement the terms of an agreement wet originally struck between the premier of Queensland and the then Prime Minister on 16 November 1990. The agreement provides for an. approach of cooperative management towards this environmentally sensitive region. The complementary legislation will also fulfil Australia's international obligations to the World Heritage Convention, which inscribed 900,000 hectares of rainforest and vegetation the politics in December 1988. The bill recognises the comprehensive nature of the Queensland legislation and with the Queensland act acknowin ledges that routine management will .be carried out by the Queensland government. The biII provides for. the Wet Tropics Management Authority to have representatives and from the Queensland government, the about Commonwealth government and the Joint much Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council. I understand that the Wet Tropics Management Authority has already achieved significant in its earlier stages, considering the controversial circumstances in which it comwe have a menced operations. , I believe it is important to refer to that history, because it is through the examination that history that we. can appreciate the operations of the authority. It will also pinpoint the environmental attitudes and policies of the conservative political forces in this country to the present day. Some of those issues are some of the reasons why opposition members are stillih opposition. They will continue to languish there without policies and only engage in the politics of smear and muckraking. Anyone who cares to remember the listing of the wet tropics on the World Heritage Register will remember the feroCity of opposition from the Queensland National Party. This group, whose influence still exterids to today's coalition, wasted millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to force a political show. down with Canberra. Despite appeals for cooperation with the management of the wet tropics from our government and in particular the then environment minister, Senator Richardson, the Queensland Nationals supported by their federal coalition colleagues embarked on a collision course with the Commonwealth govel)1ment. Former Queensland environment minister Geoff Muntz and former Queensland Attorney-General Paul Clauson led an $80,000 eight-member anti-heritage mission to Brazil to spread misinformation to the World Heritage Commission. Despite wasting hearly $80,000 on travel, close to $400,000 on advertising throughout Queensland and millions of dollars on failed High Court arid Supreme Court challenges, the wet tropics of North Queensland were world heritage listed. At all times Senator Richardson appealed·to the Queensland National Party government for its input into a cooperative management of the wet tropics region with the federal government. However, the Queensland environment minister after failing in his bid to· stop the listing turned around and had the temerity to suggest that· the federal government had bought members of the World Heritage Commission. In true conservative,born-to-rule fashion, the Nationals could not accept the. independent umpire's decision. That is why it is out of government in Queensland, I am delighted to tell honourable members. Mr Truss-Not for long.",83
174,Ms HENZELL,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"I see the honourable member for· Wide Bay has come into the chamber. The reason why I am refreshing the memories of honourable members with these historical events is that it gives an insight into the mentality of the coalition's policies on environmental heritage and conservation. Ido not just outline these facts for matters of an environmental nature.· Former Queensland Attorney-General Clauson's scare tactics on this issue expose the thinking of conservative politicians in a range of settings. At the time he said: If the Queensland government ·allowedit to go unchallenged; many other Queenslanders in other industries such as mining and farming could well find themselves in a similar position in the future, with their jobs suddenly being taken away from them. Does this sound familiar? We just heard the same sort of argument from .the honourable member for O'Connor. But then we hear that sort of thing all the time from the honourable member for O'Connor, so none of us should be surprised. . These bleatings are the same kind of twisted logic used in the debates on the native title legislation. Once again on this matter-since the honourable member for O'Connor brought it into the debate-the opposition failed to pick up on the opportunity to do something positive for itself and for the country. It will have to be led kicking and screaming into that debate. But thank goodness wiser heads prevailed in the Senate against the outright obstructionist attitude of the federal opposition. The coalition predicted if it went ahead that there would be jobs lost and so on. This form of logic dearly demonstrates the vast. difference between this government and the coali.tion. As I said, it is one of the many reasons why it is still languishing out of office. Thank goodness for. environmental issues that it is still out of office. It shows the Labor Party as having progressive ideas in reform and the coalition as a scaremongering band of reactionaries preying on the unknown with threats to gain political mileage. Thankfully, the people of Australia have the intelligence to see just how big a fraud this opposition is-'-like the former National Party government in Queensland. In relation to the wet tropics of North Queensland we are .not just talking' aboJJt an insignificant tract of bushland. We are talking about one of the most significant environmental regions in the ,world. . I will quote a few statistics that are of importance in this regard. The region covers 900,000 hectares of vegetation'. It contains trees that are over 3,000 years old; 30 per cent of Australia's marsupials; 60 per cent of Australia's bats; 30 per cent of Australia's frogs; 23 per cent of Australia's reptiles; 62 per cent of Australia's butterflies; and 18 per cent of Australia's birds. The list continues. There are 41 species of threatened plants, one-quarter of all plant typesin Australia and, as significantly, extensive remains of Aboriginal culture arid history with records dating back 10,000 years. This is the area that the conservative forces in this country did not wish to protect. This magnificent environmental wonder is 'what we are protecting with this hill. On 'behalf of the people of Queensland and Australia-including Aboriginal AustraliansI am only too happy to support this legislation. Senator Ian Macdonald was quoted in the Townsville Bulletin on 9 February of this 'year as opposing the appointment of an Aboriginal representative onto the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Apparently, Senator Macdonald and his coalition colleagues do not believe that Aboriginal people should have a voice in the wet tropics. They fail to appreciate that this region contains the only recognised Australian Aboriginal rainforest culture. Parts of the area around the remote Russel Valley are believed to hold un-exc,avated records dating back more than 10,000 years. . On a visit to Cairns in the middle of last year with the House of ,Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I spoke with representatives of the Aboriginal communities in the Cairns area who strenuously put forward the importance of their involvement in this area. I am pleased to see that this omission has been rectified. If we look at the history of our government in this respect, I believe it is one that we can be very proud of. Over th- past decade Labor has saved the Fr:anklin River in Tasmania, stepped up efforts to help conserve the Barrier Reef, spent $320 million on landcare projects and been at the forefront of the international some campaign to stop mining in the Antarctic . These are not insignificant achievements. In the 1990s, Labor nominated Fraser Island, Macquarie Island and parts of the Antarctic for world heritage listing; set greenhouse gas emission reducti9n targets; passed endangered species legislation; and focused on urban environmental concerns such as water and air quality as well as waste minimisation. It is important in this respect to refer to the Council of Australian Governments meeting in Hobart, attended by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), where an agreement on national guidelines for air pollution, water quality; and noise emission was achieved. It was a considerable achievement to attain the cooperation of state governments on matters that are of vital importance to Australia. This is one area that the former minister, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), has worked unceasingly on .. Labor has also established a process for ecologically sustainable development.. Under the former minister, Labor established the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency and the Australian Heritage Commission. It also. granted funding for community conservation groups through the voluntary conservation organisations scheme. This gives a greater number of Australians the opportunity to par,ticipate in green issues at .the community level. There is a raft of.other achievements which, if time permits, twill refer to. Labor policies have Seen Australia become a.leader in world environment policy. Australia is a world leader in implementing the World Heritage Convention with nine properties on the World Heri,tage List-something that the honourable member for O'Connor appears to deplore. This country has earned worldwide praise and, recognition for not allowing mining in' Kakadu or on Fraser Island. These are areas where the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has said that no harm would be done. With over half of Australia's forests and three-quarters of Australia's rainforests lost since European settlement,Labor has gone a long way towards rectifying this imbalance by its recognition of the wet tropiCs of North Queensland. What was the opposition going to offer us had it succeeded in gaining power just under 12 months ago? Unlike the coalition, which has been notorious for opposing the listing of world heritage areas, we have a commendable record. Under the opposition's discredited and discarded Fightback package; the power of veto over world' heritage areas would have been handed back to the states. As the former minister said in an MPI three weeks ago, the opposition will always kowtow to the states on environment matters, as on many other matters of policy; That is another reason why those opposite are ,still in opposition. Their policies would enable some development minded· state governments to. exploit areas of environmental significance' and embarrass Australia's reputation as a green leader. Over the past decade the coalition has opposed the protection of the Franklin River, campaigned for the expansion of uranium mining and perpetuated the myth of 'black and green' tape to support developers. Under Fightback.it wOlild have withdrawn funding for community conservation groups, slashed by half the budget of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, demoted the significance of the Australian Heritage Commission, increased petrol consumption by up to 25 per cent, thereby increasing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and-very importantly for the electorate of Capricornia and elsewhere:""'-'axed $10 million worth of funding to the Bureau of Meteorology. Recently· I was delighted to represent the former minister in opening the new Bureau of Meteorology in Rockhampton. I was gratified to learn that not only the staff of the bureau but all those who use its vital weather forecasting facilities were thrilled and delighted to have this new facility in Rockhampton, an area that has in previous times been affected by floods and cyclones. It is vital to the beef industry in particula-- I hope the honourable member for Wide BaY' would agree with me:""'-'that we have effective weather forecasting across this country. But in the name of economic rationalism and in its wonderful Fightback package, those opposite were going to take $10 million off the Bureau of Meteorology. They would have expanded nuclear energy facilities, including the use of nuclear power stations. This is the sort of environmental nonsense they were ped<;lling.:n is one of the many reasons why they lost the plot and the election just under 12 months ago. Despite the shame of being associated with this disgraceful set of policies, the opposition spokesperson on the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (MrS Galllls), had the' gall tocOme into the House three we-ks ago with 'an MPI on the . environment. ,of course, she also led the' debate today for the opposition. In that previous debate she had the audacity to say: .. The environmental health of Australians has suffered and the Australian environment itself has deteriorated. In her speech she focused on a report entitled A green .league of nations which suggested that. the OECD had said that Australia's standing was rather poor. Let me mention that the report. is not in fact an official OECD report. It is a report by a private group, the New Economics Foundation, which produced the report for an English newspaper. Many people have called into question the validity of . some or its assessments. The authors themselves said: This waS a relatively quick and dirty exercise .. ; The eleven indicators (on which the scoring was based) represent a relatively ad hoc selection of potential indicators -'. . While mindful of some valid problems in interpreting the data ... This was a less than valid exercise but, typically, it' was used by the opposition to slate our performance. On that occasion the honourable member for Hindmarsh said that we had turned world heritage in. this cOUl-try into an absolute farce and a joke. She failed to say that the reason why most of the information did not go to this organisation to provide an effective report was that the state governments did not provide the information, whereas the federal government had provided a 30-page submission. What we all rememberaboufthaf MPI on the environment was the abysmal performance of the opposition spokesperson on these matters, the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I will just refer to a couple of the issues she raised. She asked the minister, 'Where is the biodiversity strategy?'. Well, the strategy for biodiversity was approved by cabinet in 1993 and it is freely available. The honourable member for Hindmarsh also tookthe then minister to task for her .role in the bush fires. While the bush fires were raging, the former ,minister was consulting with the New South Wales environment minister to discuss assistance for burnt out national parks .. The honourable member had not bothered to find out what was really going on with her state colleagues. It was an abysmal performance and - do not think it provided much support,. security or comfort for the opposition. In closing, I want to place on record my gratitude to the former minister for the environment for her strong representations and commitment to Shoalwater Bay andior the excellent inquiry that has been carried Olit. I look forward to working with her successor on the implementation of that report when· it is presented to parliament. The fine record of this government and the record of the former ministefhilve resulted in very effective strategies for riot only the wet tropics of Queensland but also a whole raft of environmentally important issues that this government has been prepared to take up and get on with the job of doing, in contrast to the fossilised views of those opposite who come in here and continue to 'carp.

175,Mr TRUSS,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"We have the privilege as. Australians to live in a beautiful country which has many magnificent natural resources, scenery and an environment that is the envy of many other places in the world. We should be proud of that and accept our responsibilities to care for it. Sadly, Australia's record over the years has not always 'been without blemish. I find it disappointing that the government seems to choose to hang its environmental credentials on world heritage listing. It .has been particularly area of world heritage listing that this government has failed dismally. It has failed in its administration of our re$ponsibilities to the World Heritage Convention but, perhaps more importantly, it has failed to satisfy the people who have. been affected in world heritage areas and it has failed to provide appropriate management plans to support our obligations in world heritage areas -. To be on the World Heritage List should be a great honour; But in Australia it has been turned into apolitically divisive matter which has caused a great deal of anxiety and concern in the community. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Labor government has brutally used the questionable foreign affairs powers to usurp a role over management of vast areas of Australia. If the conservationists had their way and their wish list were' agreed to, perhaps half the country would be world heritage listed. To take that. kind of an approach cheapens the whole world heritage process. Instead' of our world heritage areas being very, special places, unique in the world, the extension of the list indiscriminately to almost any piece of territory tAat the conservationists cross cheapens those areas,that have already been listed and degrades the whole process. What has happened in Australia is that, as a result of the aggressive attitude the Labor government has adopted towards world heritage listing, a fear of the world heritage listing process has built up around the' country. I frequently hear in my electorate it being referred to as some kind of international conspiracy to subvert our national sovereignty. It should not be regarded in that light. But, because of the way in which the government has treated the world heritage process, it is not surprising that there is this kind of negative community reaction to the whole issue of world heritage listing. Unfortunately, the process has been grossly oversold by 'many people, Within both the conservation movement and, sadly, the government. It is simply a nonsense to suggest that by merely world heritage listing an area its protection is guaranteed. It does nothing of itself to protect an area. In my electorate, the in the government proposed to nominate to the World. Heritage List the Tin Can Bay heavy artillery firing range. This is an area that has been blasted, bulldozed, bombed, shelled, mortared and mined for quite some years. Yet it was the intention of the government-and this was clearly stated by the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the honourable member for Kingston (MrBilney), in a written answer to a question I asked-to continu- to shell, mortar and bomb this area even after it had been wofld heritage listed. So, if it is acceptable to bomb, mortar and blast an area' that has been world heritage listed, it is quite clear thattomerely put it on the list offers no protection at all. The protection of a world heritage area comes from a management plan that is developed to care for the area or by declaring' parts of the area a national park. Indeed, national park status offers much greater surety of protection and a much greater guarantee that the area will be looked after and cared for for future generations tpandoes world heritage listing: , . The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) suggested that it was world heritage listing that led to the protection of the North Queensland rainforests. That is a nonsense. It is the fact that the area. is a national park that has led to the pristine forest areas being protected. It. is the management plans which may b,e developed and which ensure the area is appropriately phmned that will guarantee the ·protection of the area. World heritage listing of itself does nothing other than to put the area on a list. It does nothing other than· draw attention to its existence. It is the management plan that is put in place that is critical to the future protection of an area. Therefore, I think it is essential that before any area is proposed to be included in the World Heritage· List the management plan should be developed. For instance, before the government goes to anarea and says, 'We are. considering nqminating 900,000 hectares of this area for world heritage listing', the management plan must be. put - efore the Australian people .. It. should particularly be put before the peopie who are likely to be affected by the listing. There would not have been the controversy associated with our world heritage listings if people had known what was proposed for the area before the nomination was made. Much of the concern is built around a lack of knowledge of what it means to be world heritage listed. Much of the concern is also built around the fact that everyone knows that many of the claims being made by the proponents of world heritage listing are utterly baseless: For instance, it is a complete nonsense to suggest that all we have to do is world heritage list an area and there will be an instant tourism boom. In fact, history has s-gge-ted the opposite. We find that with most areas that have been world heritage listed once the controversy dies down they generally suffer a reduction in the number of visitations and it' requites a long, detailed and extensive promotions campaign to build up interest in that area once again and to get tourists flowing back into the area. . Promotion is what encourages tourism . Appropriate tourism develOPments and infrastructure are what;support the tourist industry. World heritage listing is merely som,ething that can be used as.a marketing tool. It does nothing to guarantee visitations to the area. Sadly, when management plans are developed they 9ften lock tourists out of areas that they have previously visited. They place .restrictions on the number of people who may be able to visit an area and they reduce the opportunities and the freedom people have to visit areas that they previously wen- able to visit. I think that is unfortunate. We are developing an environinental elitism in Australia which says that not only should we protect an area butalso Australians should not visit it as well. It is frankly pointless to declare environmental parks and world heritage listed areas and then say to the Australian people that they are off limits for all but those in an elite group. We want to retain our special areas and we want to look after those parts of Australia that future generations have a right to enjoy, but a part of caring for them must surely also involve a regime for enjoying those areas. When we lock up an area and exclude people from visiting it we do not do our environment or our community a service. We need to build on and take advantage of the special areas tharwehave in our country. I think it is important 'that in' developing plans for our world heritage areas we be sure that we take into our confidence the local people-ensuring that, they play an active part in developing a management plan. It should not be just academics in faraway places that develop, the management plans. I think that has been part of the trouble that has occurred i.n the North Queensland wet tropics. People have been brought in from outside to develop management plans and to play a supervisory role over what should happen. It is beyond doubt, as was suggested in the survey referred to by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), that there is a view in North Queensland that theWorld Heritage Management Authority has caused needl-ss del-ys through senseless bureaucracy and that the management processes have slowed down any kind of development or use of the region's, natural resources. In fact, on many occasions it has been necessary to go to the ministerial council to try to break through deadlocks that have occurred in the management arrangements. Relying on environment ministers to break deadlocks is clearly going to mean a long, delayed process being associated with whatever may happen in the region.",87
176,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,Unless they use a whiteboard.,89
177,Mr TRUSS,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Certainly a number of difficulties have been occurring. There has been a tendency as well for the government to then give compensation packages. It is interesting that members of the government get up and say that world heritage listing is a great bonuthat is going to bring instant wealth and riches to a region, but that they then find it necessary, to offer compensation packages. The compensation packages are necessary because when logging is stopped and developments are prevented there are job losses. Ask the people of Ravenshoe, Maryborough, or of other world heritage areas. Compensation packages have been provided-$75 million to the North Queensland w'et tropics and $51 million to my own electorate for the Fraser Island and Great Sandy, Region world heritage nomination. In a sense this has been guilt money-the 30 pieces of silver; money that has been thrown to those areas to absolve consciences about the disruption that has occurred. This money has tended to be thrown into those areas without any responsibility, without any care being given to the way in which it is to be spent. In the case of the North Queensland compens!,ltion package something like $7 million went to the wrong organisation. This was money utterly wasted. In my own electorate the story is sadly similar. Most of the money has actually gone to pay the wages of Queensland government public servants. Very little of it has gone to the workers or the companies who have lost their livelihoods. Most of the money has gone to pay the wages of public servants to do work they otherwise would have done anyhow. No-one in the Commonwealth seems to be standing up to ensure that this money is wisely spent. In a quite extraordinary action two budgets ago the government added $13 million to the Fraser Island compensation package, allegedly to pay capital gains tax for the companies which were receiving compensation money. I have no idea how these calculations were made although, knowing the minister concerned, I suspect they were made on a whiteboard. That is about as logieal as these calculations have been-$13 million was added to the Fraser Island compensation package to pay capital gains tax. When we do a little mental arithmetic we see that if $13 million were needed for capital gains tax the compensation paid to the companies would have had to have been perhaps $100 million.",89
178,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,And it wasn't.,89
179,Mr TRUSS,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Jndeed it was not. In fact, the government advanced $3 million of that $13 million to the Queensland government. On last report, and as stated in the last question that I put on notice in relation to this matter, only a few thousand dollars had been spent. This is an example of the illogical way in which the government has dealt with many of these issues. I want to say a lot more on a future occasion to this House about the way in which the $51 million allocated to the Fraser Island compensation package has been spent. It has been equally as great a scandal as the North Queensland compensation package. That is simply not good enough. It is not good enough for government members to absolve themselves from responsibility by thinking of a big number and pretending to spend that amount of money in an area. A proper management plan should be developed which minimises inconvenience and maximises the benefit to the area, guarantees protection, and ensures that the area is available for future use while ensuring that the resources available are used to their maximum benefit. The wet tropics bill initially attracted little opposition. However, 'amendments lT1ade to it-largely at the instigation of th- Australian Democrats but supported by the .government-:-;have done considerable damage to the bill. The Democrats have. added a. totally illogical preamble. This is a bill about proteGting the North Queensland wet tropics. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) said, the North Qlieensland wet tropics were listed because of their nature and conservation values, not because of any particular involvement with the Aboriginal people.. The preamble added to this bill is utterly illogical. It says: . .. considerations taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows., . Aboriginal people have. occupied; used, and land jnthe.Area since time immemorial. I am not quite sure what 'time immemorial' means. I certainly question whether Aboriginal people have been in the area since time immemorial, anyhow. The preamble then goes on to justify the entire bill on the basis that Aborigines were there previously. It ignores the real reasons why'this bill ,is in existence; namely, that the area was' nominated' and accepted for world heritage listing because of its great nature and conservation values.' It is therefore illogical for the bill to require the Commonwealth to appoint· an Aborigine as' one of its two representatives on themanagement authority. Certainly. Aborigines live in that pat:ticular area .. - have' no objection whatsoever to an Aborigine being appointed to· the management authority so long as that appointment is ,on merit and the Aborigine is able to contribute in a constructive way towards the management of that large area and bring with him or her the necessary skills to provide a benefit to the authority. But I object, as a matter of principle, to people being chosen irrespective of their ability just because they are Aborigines. Two. per cent or thereabouts of that region's population are probably Aborigipes, yet 50 per cent of the Commonwealth nominees have to be Aborigines. That is just illogical. There are probably more .Italians than Aboriginals living in that area yet .there is no requirement to have an Italian. or anybody else of a particular raceon the board. I think we Syt a' very dangerous precedent in this biJI when we start. talking about appOInting .people to' government positions on the basis of theirrilce. It is indeed racism of the' worse' kind. If this bill were to say that no Aborigine shall. be appointed to the management. authority there would be widespread condemnation and I would join in that condemnation, but. it is equally silly to say that people must be appointed to this authority just because of their race. I think that 'this is an objectionable addition to the bill by way of amendment initiated by the Democrats and slipported by members of the government. . World heritage listing waS granted because of the area's nature and conservation values, enjoyed not because Aborigines have made their way over that particular area in previo-s generations. The appointees-of which there are only' two-need to be appointed' on their merits. The current appointees. are, Dr Keto, a weB-known conservationist,. and a Mr Donaghy from the Cairns tourism authority. I find it hard .to believe, that the Commonwealth government will not want to pander to its environmentalist lobby and appoint an environmentalist as 'one of therepresentatives t6 thebdard. Ddes that mean that the local tourist industry and the local land..:holders, many of' whom have their land world heritage' Iisted, 'are 'not going to be represented in any way on this management authority? I find that objectionable and disgraceful. . ,.' If that is not bad en6ugh, this bill also requires ,the Commonwealth' to .lean on. - he Queensland government to appoint an Aborigine as one of its representatives. Again, I think it is tohilly' inappropriate for the Commonwealth to try to decide who the Queensland government should appoint as its representatives. It is also objectionable that the Queensland government should be, required to appoint somebody on the basis of race. This bill is therefore demeaning of Aborigines. It is insulting to them to suggest that'they are unable to be appointed on their merits and that specific positions neeq to be created on this basis. The ex-minister in her first reading speech got it right when she pointed out thatthis partiCular bill: ... provides for a regime of cooperative management of this' sensitive and unique environment ... These two pieces of legislation together will bring into effect permanent management arrangements to implement Australia's international obligations for the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Property. . . ' The Commonwealth legislation will be an acknowledgment of the Commonwealth's on-going commitmerit to protect, conserve, present and transm.it to future generations the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Property, in accordance with Australia's obligations under the World, Heritage Convention. , Nothing is said there about an obligation to the Aboriginal people or that this area is peculiarly theirs. It belongs to all Australians. Its management is the responsibility of all Australians. We should choose the best available people, those who are guaranteed to have the best qualities to do the best job,to be on that management committee, irrespective of their race and what state they come from. This is an i01portanttask forourcountry. We have an important responsibility to future generations. We need to ensure that it is done well. '",89
180,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Fisher) (6.40 p.m.);....;Two issues have dominated the Australian political landscape over the last, decade. Members on both sides of the House would know that they are, firstly, the economy and, secondly, the environment. The key' to environmental' and economic success is balance. Most. people would agree that we need a balance in these areas as, indeed, in many others. Where disputes arise onth- national horizon there should be a balanced approach. Quite often there is a tug of war between that side of politics and this side of politics. It is important to remember that the Austral;. Ian Labor Party does flOt have a monopoly over concern of environmental matters. People on this side of the House are equally concerned and equally appreciative that we hold this nation and its environment in trust for future generations. The secret of success, though, is to provide jobs and industry development in the 1990s in the areas of tourism, mining and the pastoralindustry, for example, while at the same time ensuring preservation of, our nation's unique environment. . It is ,possible to be successful with both of these aims, but the government is quite often prepared to sacrifice jobs, development and-when one looks' at the Mabodisaster-certaintyin the pursuit of some particular ideological objective of its own. However, the pursuit of balance in environ.; mental matters is possibly the, most challenging agenda facing Australia's decision makers. Sometimes the.balance has gone one way and sometimes it has gone the other way. There has been a national debate on the area of the wet tropics, covered by, this wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill. On the' one hand, the logging community o¥North Queensland had an industry that was viable, sustainable and wrichsought to.preserve and maintain,qngoing Jlse of th,- timber that continues to grow in. that area. On the other hand, militant environmentalists felt that it was importanfto sa-rifi,ce that industry in ,the interests of preserving-he - hollsanpsof hectares of rainforest. ""Everyone woul4 also support. the protection of world importantflora andfauna. So this argument wentto llnd fro:.on the;Qne hand, th-. argument for jobs- the economy, certainty and development and, on' the other· hand, concerns about the environment.Th.e government has not really had, the· right approach in 'every many areas .. Indeed- the machinery bill"" before the House,in some respetts, has mov-d on from the debate we have had over many years on the wet tropics and world heritage. The North Queensland wet tropics area comprises about 900,000 hectares of rainforest and associated vegetation between Townsville and Cooktown. It comprises not one parcel but 620 parcels of land. This land is, about 37.72 per cent state forest and almost 30 per cent national"" park. The land tenure of the remainder of the wet tropics area is made up of leasehold, timber reserve,.vacant land and freehold. Although the freehold proportion of the wet tropics area is quite small, we ought to always remember that those freehold land-holders are affected in a greater way than other people whose land, is not within a world heritage listed area. It is always important to make sure that, when the community makes a value judgment that in the interests of the nation an area ought to be listed or preserved under world heritage; the freehold landowners are not disadvantaged. Many people would be aware that an endeavour was made by the Labor governmentin 1987 to register the wet tropics area for, world heritage listing. That listing was achieved in 1988 . .The Queensland National Party. government very strenuously opposed that listing. The federal government relied on the very, wide, interpretation of the external affairs power by the unelected and unaccountable politicians of the High Court to give this parliament the legislative competence to, in effect, legislate in reI at'i on, to world heritage matters- , Understandably, a High Court ,challenge waS;issued by the Queenslandgovernmen- but that failed: An appeal was going·to·be lodged, but Queensland had achange of government iii 19891-most unfortunately, 1tiilght add, for that state-and the new doss government was prepared to accommodate the federal gov-rnrtienL"" "" , Mr Reith-TYpical.. ,",91
181,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"ILis typical. The Queensland and,federal governments reached, this agreement. A deal was signed relating to the management and funding of the wettropics, and the bill before the House isthept:oduct 'of that process. The agreement provided for the establishment of a ministerial council, a management authority to advise' the ministerial council, a management agency to develop and implement plans and programs, a community consultative committee and a scientific advisory committee-in many respects, bureaucracy gone mad. The agreement also prQvidedJor the Commonwealth to contribute to the costs of capital works in the wet tropics and running costs of the management agency. In 1993 the Queensland parliament carried into law the Queerishind Wet Topies World Heritage Protection and Management Act. The bill befote the House carries out the federal government's obligatioris as part of that deal entered into with Goss-Labor in Queensland. Thus we have the' bill, before the House which represents a meeting by the Labor Party o[its side of the deal with Goss in Queensland. The'bill covers three areas. It enables the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to nominate members to the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Mr Deputy Speaker Truss,you, yo-rseJf very accurately pointed out ,how the. amendments forced on the government by the Australian Democrats require this parliament and, the federal government to discriminate by having an Aborigine on :that authority, not on: the basis of competence-no-:one· would object to Aborigines being on, the authority on the basis of competence'7""Qut on the basis of their race. In ,some respects, we could say that,the amendmen.tforced .on the gove\11ment ,by the Democrats ;is .a. racist amf;ndment., As, you 'pointed our very'accutately, Mr Deputy Speaker, the amendment reqijiring an Aboriginal persciti:to;be placed on theauthority by the federal goVernment isrlemeaning to Aboriginal people. Furthermore; the' government, as part of its deal to secure passage of the legislation through t,he .senate, had, to ',"" agree tQ have the feden.1 parlhimentbring its powers of persuasion to, beat 011, th-,Queens­ land .La):>or' governmel1t to follow' .suit... ,In other words""on,e Aborigine, will, he. appointed by ,tre, feper-lgOvernment. and,,;ppssiply a second Aborigine appoint<:id ,by the state government. ..' . , "" , "". ,', , (- , .: , .As.I said, if they .are.the dght people; the best people and the most competent people to be appointed on merit, I fot:one;would not object, but I am opposed !o tokenism. I am also opposed to racist appotn.tment-. - fte- all, the whole idea of world hentage hsttng IS to protect the unique environment of the area. It is not designed to pander to any group in the community, particularly one which may well have had a very long association with' the land but which makes up only two per cent of the Australian population. When I look at the preamble to the legislation, inserted at the insistence of the Democrats, I sometimes wonder whether the Demo,.. cratsare seeking' to establish the basis for some kind of Mabo claim. The preamble says: . Aboriginal people have occupied, used, and enjoyed land in the Area since time immemorial. The Area is part of thecultutal landscape of Rainforest Aboriginal peoples and is important spiritually, socially, historically arid culturally to aboriginal people particularly concerned with the land. It is,therefore, the intention of the Parliament to recognis- a role for Aboriginal peoples particularly concerned with land and waters in the Area, and give Aboriginal peoples a role to play in its management. '., Quite frankly, I believe that the native title legislation, carried by this parliament last year, is ail unmitigated disaster. I hope' that, upon return to government and when the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), is a minister with some responsibility for this area, we will in fact repea:1 the native title legislation, which is a recipe for racial disharmony and uncertairity. It is also a recipe for loss of jobs. The passage of this bill in this place, where the government controls the numbers-at least until the next election-will no doubt be somewhat straightforward compared with the chequeredhistory of the events which gave birth to the bill and, indeed, with the difficulties the gove-ent experienced in the Senate. In 1988, following. - orld heritage listing, the town of Ravenshoe, in North Queensland, which was a prosperous community, became a welfare town. We all know how millions of dollars disappeared. Would you believe that the Prime Minister(Mr Keating), following the sacking of rorting Ros, has now brought back into a position of great ,prominence Senator Richardson, whom I believe was the minister at the time the decisions were made concerning compensation for Ravenshoe.",92
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,Mr Truss)...::.... Order! The honourable member should refer to members by their proper titles.,93
183,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Everyone knows that she is a rorter, everyone knows that she is 'Ros' and everyone knows that she has now been sacked because- . . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member must not make allegations against the honourable member for Canberra.",93
184,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"There have been plenty of allegations, Mr Deputy Speaker. .",93
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,I call on you to withdraw.,93
186,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"If the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) objeCts to what I said, I withdraw those comments.",93
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,I. require you to withdraw them. .,93
188,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"I do so in deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I withdraw, but I am also mindful of the attack you led as Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation, and the Arts, pointing out the shortcomings of the honourable member for Canberra, the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, which required her resignation to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) only yesterday. One ought to bear in mind that, sadly, the compensation in Ravenshoe, as indeed in your own electorat-; Mr Deputy Speaker, has not gone through to those people who needed and deserved it. Many local ,people in Ravenshoe were owed many thousands of dollars and they. have been declared bankrupt. That is. a tragedy. The community was paid a· lot of money-blood money, as I think you described it in your own speech, Mr Deputy Speaker-'-to compensate people for this so called wonderful thing called world heritage listing, yet the money has not got through to and has not benefited the community, the people who have in fact been required to suffer financially and personally as a result of a decision which was deemed to be in the national interest. . I raise the situation concerning RilVenshoe not to· say necessarily that it was wrong that such a fragile environment should be protected but simply to highlight the problems which occur when a federal government is prepared to use the powers given to it by the High Court, through the very wide interpretation of the external affairs 'power, to ride roughshod over the views of local people and local and state governments. It is important to support industry, but it is also important to support preservation of our environment. After all, as I said earlier, we hold our nation's environment· in trust for future generations. Once it is gone, we cannot restore it. It is important to support industry, the development of export markets and jobs. Responsible development is the key. It is also important to . have a responsible decision making process when it comes to environmental issues. One ought to look at the flora and fauna situation in that area covered by the' wet tropics. I understand that 30 per cent of Australia's marsupial population is there along with 60 per cent of the. bat population, 62 per cent ofbuttetflies, 30 per cent of frogs, 23 per cent of reptiles-'-although I thought there were a lot of those on the other side of the House-and 18 per cent of birds. The wet tropics is home to an incredibly diverse range of primitive angiosperm, a flowering plant family. Of this particular species, 13 of the 19 can be foundin the wet tropics. Some of the trees iii 'the wet tropics region are estimated to be more than 3,000 years old. I think it is important to note that in this legislation, and in the complementary legislation carried by the Queensland parliament, provision has. been made for the day-today management to be carried out by the state government. It is interesting to noteparticularly when one looks at the motion moved in this place by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), which seeks a scrapping of the federal system, as we understand it, to be replaced by a series. of regions instead of the states and local authori'ties--'-that what this legislation seeks to achieve is a situation where the whip is cracked by the federal government which establishes policy and the state government simply becomes the agent for carrying out t-at policy imposed from on high. We do have a problem with duplication in so many areas of government activity. I think it is a pity that governments at federal levelgovernments on both sides of the political spectrum-have not respected the federal compact more. There has been an erosion of constitutional authority from the states to Canberra as· a result not of referenda of the Australian people but of High Courtinterpretation. Thus we fihd legislation like the bill currently before the House coming before this parliament-not only in this area but also in so many other areas. Mr Reith-Creeping centralism.",93
189,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"It is galloping centralism, not merely creeping centralism. The simple fact of the matter is that,. because of the way the High Court has interpreted the constitution-I will not say rorted the constitution because one would not want to reflect on the High Court-the court has in effect tom up the Australian constitution as we understood it to mean in 1901. The federal government now is able, through entering into treaties-incidentally, they are not referred to us for approval in this parliament-to acquire legislative competence in any area it chooses. All it has to do is enter into an international treaty with some banana republic on any. matter whatsoever. Even if the substance of that treaty under our constitution domestically should be a matter for the states, the federal government can acquire the legislativecompetence to control that matter. We talk a lot about states rights and the rights of the federal parliament,butit is fairly unfortunate that we have a situation now where all power could well be centralised in Canberra. We find more and more that the federal parliament is legislating in areas which were traditionally spheres of state responsibility. .. . World heritage listing can be a good thing. The Liberal Party has supported the principle of world heritage listing. After aU,if our sensitive environment is destroyed or damaged, we cannot repair it. But it is important Tuesday, 1 March 1994 not to ride roughshod over the rights and views of local people. If the community large determines that a world heritage listing is required, then it is appropriate that there proper compensation paid. The feder,il Labor government struts around claiming that it seeks to have Australia as tnily independent nation, that we ought tug the forelock to Britain. We do not do that. The government claims through its republican mental situation in Australia., agenda that Australia should become free and independent and separate from everyone else. This federal Labor government is subverting Austr-1ia's national independence through all of these treaties we are signing. There can now be appeals from Australian mooted. courts on Australian domestic decisions to UN committees. What it isreally doing issubvertty iilg our sovereignty through many of treaties it is entering into and it is about it took stock of the sittJation. It is certainly matter of which the Australian people should take notice because, quite frankly, it isabso}utely revoIting-:-in fact, it is almost fraudulander lent"":""""':for the Prime Minister to saying that he is trying to tum Australia· into a more independeilt country, wheh we are independent now, through his republican agenda since through signing all of these treaties he is signing away our independence. Mr Reith-He is tugging the forefock to the foreigners.",94
190,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"'-He is. It is important in areas which are under world heritage listing to have as much local input as possible. I pleased that the legislation we are debating least makes provision for this. The opposition is not very happy about some of the amend900,000 ments sought by the 'Democrats. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, have outlined your concerns and I agree totally with you. There is a need for a balance between environmental and economic goals. In fact, the need for that balance has never been greater. I think people on both sides of politics should certainly in that direction. We often find that the government claims it has a mortgage on environmental concern. The reality is that it is not interested .balance. The federal Labor government often marches into this place seeking to impose its REPRESENTATIVES 1531 own views. We on this side of the House are at concerned about our environment and about the future, but we wiJI not allow those opposbe ite to come in here and parade as the great saviours of the environment. Their own record over 11 years of government has been quite a disastrous. An international report recently not showed that the minister who has just resigned has presided over a very poor environ. We are not opposing this bill, but we are concerned about the. Democrats' amendments. The government really ought to - econsider some of these amendments so that the legislation gets back to what was first debated and",95
191,Mr DOBIE,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Mf DepuSpeaker, I shaH try not to cause you emthe barrassment by misnaming anyone in this time House. I say no more. I want to add some a brief comments to the debate on the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill 1994. As a former Queensarid, having spent an enjoyable part of go around my life in North Qi.leensland",95
192,Mr SLIPPER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,Where abouts?,95
193,Mr DOBIE,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"All over-I am familiar with this part Of the country which is the subject of this item of legislation. I share some of the concerns that have been expressed today, but I also share pleasure that many parts are part of a world heritage situation. The wet tropics of Queensland represent a am truly remarkable part df the Australian landat scape. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you wiJI know by now, the wet tropics cover an area of hectares between Townsville and Cooktown. The area is designated as state forest and national park, although a timber reserve accounts for just under nine per cent of the area. I would digress from my notes to say that I, too, am one of the people who believe that the borders of the wet tropics work land were drawn far too broadly and widely and contain areas that should not be part of the world wet tropics area. However,it is the diversity of plants and in a animals contained within the wet tropics which make this area such as an environmental asset to tliiscountry. It has been estimated that some trees within the rainforest are over 3,000 years old. The oldest tree I have seen there is estimated at 400 years old, and I must tell you that it is a wreck. The area is also home to a wide variety of native Australian fauna. So it is not surprising that this lar area should be the focus of environmental debate in this place-not enough, but at least we have one of the few opportunities to debate it at this time. What is surprising, however, is this government's and in particular the former environment mihister's lack of action in the world heritage area. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) has already covered this topic within this debate, though I will make some' comments later in regard to the former minister or, as she should be correctly called, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly). This bill is basically non-controversial and merely implements the agreement between the Queensland state government and the Commonwealth government which was signed in November 1990. This is a complementary bill to the Queensland Wet Tropics World Heritage Protection and :Management Act 1993, which was enacted by the Queensland state government last year. And I say full marks to the Queensland government for taking only three years to bring in its tion; it is better than the Commonwealth, which has taken four years. As is generally customary with bills of this nature, the coalition will not be opposing this legislation. That should come as no sllrprise, for the coalition has a proud record of achievement on real environmental matters. In regard to world heritage, which we are c;lebating here today, I think it is timely to remind the House that it was the coalition which secured the listing of the Great Barrier Reef, the Willandra Lakes and Kakadu, on the World Heritage Register in 1981. To hear some of the speakers on the other side today, their memory obviously. does. not go back quite far enough. A year later, the coalition had proposed the listing of the Lord Howe Islands group and the western Tasmanian wildemessarea on the World Heritage Register. It was, in fact, a coalition government which first established a federal environment department, and it was also a coalition government which proclaimed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Parksomething' that is forgotten when we are talking about the then Queensland government particuand the Commonwealth government at that time. It also created the Kakadu and Uluru parks. So there is' ample evidence of the coalition's prior achievements in environmentalprotection, and particularly in the area of world heritage listing: As a parliamentary member of the coalition at the time of those achievements, I think it is timely and important that, as we debate ,this issue of world heritage, we recall that the coalition brings to this debate a history of real achievement regarding world heritage matters. As I have said, this bill is not contentious, though the preamble has presented problems as have been discussed fully-and I use the correct titles-by the honourable member for Wide. Bay (Mr Truss) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). The agreement between the Queensland state government and the Commonwealth allows for the Commonwealth to nominate two directors to the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Clause 5 of this bill deals with that aspect.The bill, via clause 6, also allows the legisla- process whereby Commonwealth public servants can be seconded to the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Listening to the debate, I cannot recall anyone having quite pointed that out before. The fi n a I'm a in provision ·of the bill, clause 8, as I understand it, is to make it obligatory for the report of the authority to be tabled in parliament within 15 days of its receipt each year. There does not appear to be much else contained within this bill, except the preamble. In terms of financial implications,the bill has no beneficial financial effects. However,it is my understanding that the agreement provides that the Commonwealth contributes $10 million for capital works and other such costs in the general management of the wet tropics. I, too, have been to Ravenshoe andvisited there shortly after the troubles that the then minister for the environment went through. I am distressed to hear that Ravenshoe is now a, mendicant town. As non-contentious as this bill may appear, past experience has shown that one has to be very careful in having former minister for the environment, the honourable member for Canberra now, rements sponsible for administering public money, but that seems to have passed now. However, in westernview ,of her resignation yesterday, it is readily apparent to the opposition, the press and the gen.eral public that this former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories was hopelessly incompetent. It is somewhat ironic then that, at a time when the absolute incompetence of the former Minister is on the front page of every newsgovernment paper in the country, we are debating a bill which was going to give the minister more money to administer. This is a sad irony, which becomes all the more intriguing when one considers that the electorates which contain the wet tropics are actually marginal Labor electorates-Leichhardt and Herbert. Presumably, the funding arrangements for this wet tropics agreement were worked out on whiteboard in the former minister's office. Having said that, I issue a welcome to the new Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Richardson, who in reality is being retreaded-hOt that his experiences in North Queensland bear talking about today; I will do that at a future time and in some detail. However, it is interesting to note that it was Senator Richardson who was the that minister responsible for the listing of the wet tropics on the World Heritage Register in December 1988. Many of the articles in the press in recent days have focused on the froth and bubble style of ministerial practice of the former minister for the environment. High on publicicompensation ty but low .on policy seems to have been the general experience of this minister. This been seen to be true of the sports rorts affair, but it is also true in, terms of world heritage listings as well. This government has continued the practice of previous Labor governments in making major government announcements outside parliament. The former minister for the environment, the· honourable member for Canberra, also avoided parliamentary scrutiny implemented. of her decisions in a similar manner-and did so constantly. A clear example relates to the the proposed listing of Lake Eyre where the former minister made no formal pronounceon this issue in the parliament. She did in fact make a statement in Birdsville in far Mr BruceScott-'-ln my electorate.",95
194,Mr DOBIE,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"In the shadow minister's electorate. I worked there for some years, as I have already told him. The former minister for the environment did not handle the issue of world heritage with any degree of competence. The debacle over Lake Eyre, where the missed the cut-off date for the listing of that site, is a clear example of this. The government and the former minister did not· take seriously the concerns of people living in areas proposed to be listed on the World Heritage Register, as iIlustrated by the example of Lake Eyre. Similarly, she did not implement a management plan for the Will andra Lakes area of western New South Wales, the which was listed on the World Heritage Register over 12 years ago by a coalition government. Mr Bruce Scott-A shameful performance.",97
195,Mr DOBIE,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"As the honourable member for Maranoa says, that is shameful. These are the types of issues which need to be considered within the overall context. of any debate on world heritage. That is the approach the coalition has adopted. We .on this side of the House recognise that the livelihood of people living within these areas may, and in most cases will, be seriously affected. In January of this year the National Farmers Federation made a plea to the former minister, the honourable member for Canberra, for for farmers who have been affected by world heritage listing. I do not has know whether the NFF received a response . from her. I surmise that she was preoccupied with other activities-of a sporting nature perhaps. While it is all very well for the former minister to seek publicity by making pronouncements on environmental matters, the this needs to be supported by community consultation and· effective management' to ensure that any such decisions are properly It is unfortunate that the former minister was very good at seeking the publicity limelight, but when it came to the hard graft of making sure these environmental decisions were fair and supported by an ongoing process of review, she was seriously lacking. That is why we should not be deluding ourselves into thinking that AJ.lstralia does not have environmental problems. The recent OECD report, which was a damning indictment of Australia's environmental record, is testament to this. This report was a badge of shame for the former minister for the environment. It goes to the heart of the matter that it is substance that counts in environmental matters and notgnlbbinga few headlines here and there. . This bill is a minor one, and I do not intend to take much more of the House's time. I raise one final·, issue which relates to the relative popularity of seeking world .heritage listings. In March last year' Mr Bing Lucas, the Chairman of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN-the Commissionon National Parks and Protected Areasmade some sensible comments in relation to world heritag-. Mr Lucas was of the view that some conservation groups had attempted to 'get on the'world heritage bandwagon'. He said that some conservationists were unrealistic in their ambitions about world heritage. We know that. I have a tendency to agree with Mr Lucas. It should be remembered that, when assessing whether or not an . area is suitable to be listed on the World Heritage Register, four criteria are used. First, the site must be an outstanding site exemplifying the earth's evolutionary history. Second, the site must be an outstanding example representing ongoing geological processes, biological evolution and the interaction between humans and their natural environment. Third, the site must contain superlative natural phenomena, formations or features.·Fourth, the site must contain important and significant natural habitats where threatened species of animals or plants of outstanding value live. For a site to be listed on the world register it is clear that it has to be very special environmentally; otherwise the concept of world heritage will become debased. So we have to be careful in nominating sites for proposed listing on the register. I believe that some conservation groups do no service to their cause by downplaying the significance of what it means for an area to be listed on the world heritage register. . The coalition will naturally support this bill in accordance with its proud record of achievement on environmental records.. But in this process we urge the new minister to seriously examine the consequences that such listings on the world register may have for local communities. I do not know whether the new minister, Senator Richardson, is earmarked for the environmentalp.0rtfolio for the . long run. Much of the press comment seems to indicate that he. will be a.caretaker minister while the government anxiously awaits the outcome of the Fremantle by-election. I caution the government not to count its chickens before they are hatched. The Liberal Party has an excellent candidate for this pyelection and I for one would not be surprised if the former Premier of Western Australia did not make it to Canberra. That is not relevant to the bill, but' I felt like saying it. Be that as it may, I request of the new minister for the environment, for however long he will remain within this portfolioMr Bruce Scott-Not long.",97
196,Mr DOBIE,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"I h-aryour comment. For ,however long he will .remain within this portfolio, 1 hope he win make a greater attempt than the former minister to administer the concept of world heritage. This particular bill is relatively minor, but the greater issue of world heritage is very important as we seek a balance in environmental matters. I wish the new minister well in this regard. I also wish the parliament well whenever it has a world heritage matter brought before it. I hope we will not again go through some of the bleatings that we' heard today from those on the government side suggesting that people on this side have no history in, and no regard for, environmental matters. Although I believe the wet tropics is a great area in a great position-I would not be a Queenslander if I did not think this-there has to be real concern about what the borders of this area are and hbw it wiIlbe managed, irrespective of who will be the four people to prepare this matter. ; Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE (Dawson) (7.17 p.tri.)-In ,speaking in support Tropics of Queensland World Hentage Area Conservation Bill, it is appropriate that I follow the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), because he has a great knowledge of this area and appreciation of its beauty. It is also appropriate from the point of view that he represents the electorate of Cook, because this bill formalises a discovery made back in 1770 by that famous captain and navigator who sailed the east coast, Captain Cook. He knew the beauty of the reef because he landed on it at one stage. Following that· example, the Barrier Reef is no\v fully declared and the appropriate legislation is now in place-albeit as late as it is. It is very important to realise the implicationsof that because, as the honourable 'member for Cook has just said, concern for environmental matters is a latter found virtue of the Labor Party. The Great Barrier Reef was listed as a result of the joint efforts of the coalition government of Prime Minister Fraser and the Queensland government led by Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. I think it is appropriate that we realise that in Australia today there isa greater feeling and attachment to the environment than there ever has been in the past. So this bill comes at an appropriate time to make that acknowledgment. Thisbill formalises an agreement by the state of Queensland and the Commonwealth to work together to conserve the wet tropics. It covers basically three areas. First, it enables the Commonwealth to nominate two members to the six-member board of directors of tpe Wet Tropics Management Authority, Secondly,it enables the Commonwealth minister to make Australian Public Service personnel .available to the WTMA. Thirdly, it provides for the, annual report of the authority to, be tabled in the federal parliament. This matter has had a chequered career. Agreement was reached between the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Premier of Queensland back in 1990. But the protection of t-is whole area under world heritage goes back to 1986-87. It is that part of it that has had a chequered career. 0: The wet tropics is a protected area of the Wet 900,000 hectares. It is only a small portion of the Queensland land base which, unfortunately, has been diminishing as far as tree structures are concerned. I go on record with others to say that there was an excess extravagance by those who drew up the boundaries which affected, and are still affecting, the livelihood of many people in that area. In 1987, along with ,other members of the coalition, I visited the wetlands and rainforests. I was able to see that, in spite of the great emotion that was building up against the Queensland government of the day, a great management plan had been in place for the previous 20 to 30 years which involved selective logging of the areas, making sure there was regeneration and actively managing the areas. But a large stick has been used. These are now world heritage areas. It was quite incorrect to say that the areas were under the threat of being detimbered and that those in the forestry qepartment were il lot of vandals. This was obviously a political ploy. There should have been at that stage, and there should be in the future, a greater awareness of the effect that a declaration would have on the lives of people. The reality is that people elect us to this parliament. It would be interesting to go back to those areas now to try to find out where the' $75 million which was appropriated for structural adjustment was spent. I know that an $8 million contribution is the subject of an inquiry because the money was not actually spent in the area; it was spent down south, below the border, to provide new sawmills. As somebody else has said, a great amount of that money has gone to public servants, not to the people who lost jobs or to the small businesses that, closed down. When we were in Ravenshoe we looked at the problems that would develop if it were declared a world heritage are-. Dnfor: tunately, we now have the reality. As I said, it is very difficult to find what the $75 million has been used for. We have to realise the effect that this type of declaration will have on the lives of people. We are dealing with the opportunities of the people and the quality of life of people. We are looking at jobs. The prospects of many people have been unfairly diminished by a situation which I believe was .not entirely necessary. It is no good going back over the past, except to learn. from the past when entering into future declarations. One of the things that has been learnt by the environmental people is that .unless a sovereign state steps forward and says it wants an area to be under a heritage listing, it should not be the prerogative of a central government using external powers to' achieve that end. This did create a lot of bitterness and that bitterness stays on. I want to draw the attention. of the House the fact that we are not talking about the only wet tropics area or the only rainforest in Australia. At the back of Mackay is an area which has been declared as a national park for the last 20 or 30 years-again, the product of a conservative government in Queensland. It is not correct to say that certain people were rapists in respect of everything to do with the environment. I have been to that national park. Recently the park asked for advice on the management plan. Not knowing much about timber, I wrote back and suggested that if it was looking at a management plan, it might change the name of the park from the Eungella National Park to the Ian' Wood National ParkMr Dobie-Hear, hear! Splendid idea.",98
197,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"'-That is right. He was a great contributor to this parliament, to the environment and to the surrounds of Mackay, the city he loved so much. He was instrumental in the declaration. He was - lso instrumental in recognising that these rainforests have a tourist potential. The manner in which they are now managed and the manner in which the rangers take their jobs to heart are something to behold. It is not just a matter of the department and the rangers providing standards, monitoring safeguards or protecting fauna and flora. I know of Ii couple-a ranger and his wife-who are documenting by photographs and description all the flora tropical rainforest area. This couple, Steven and Alison Pearson, recently wrote to me for assistance. They. have already authored two books-Plants of Central Queensland and Rainforest Plants of Eastern Australia. They have told me that they are still in debt in connection with the publication of those books. I have copies of those books; they are brilliant. They record aspects of life that may not exist in two, three, five or six years time. This couple is researching the flora of Queensland rainforests. They have the material available and they wish to publish a book on rainforest plants. In their letter to me they said, 'Look we have done 5,000 hours of voluntary work colkcting the relevant material; we are still in debt for their original two to books; is there any way in which you can help out?'. We must realise that a book of this nature and this sort of voluntary. work means something to every Australian. To date this couple have found 60 undescribed species of plant in the central Queensland area alone. They have photographed aU the specimens they have collected. Theyhave the only photographs on earth of many rare, threatened. and un-named species. In the past five years alone, they have discovered 15 new orchid species. They have photographed the orchids and they say that those photographs 'should be made available to the public and scientists alike in order to recognise them to prevent their: extinction' through pressures of ever expanding development'. They state in their letter: - : If we do not receive support and our work is lost, it is extinct, lost forever as many of the places Steven has been to are very isolated and have never before been visited by people researching and photographing plants. We have the only photographs on earth of many plants. We are the only people on earth that know exactly where to go to find more specimens of these rare plants for science. ' Later on in their j¢tter they outline the advantages of these. plants apropos being used for drugs and in preventing some .sicknesses and illnesses. They further state: Tourism benefits through showing what Flora Australia has to offer, attracting visitors.to travel to new areas to see rare plants where they grow that exist in that naturally ... and under the strictest environmental and management controls. They further state: The greatest benefit is to the en,:ironment as o-r work provides the Managers wIth resources In .identifying threatened flora as is. necessary for Environmental Impact Assessments . . . . They go on to say that every day three species of life forms become extinct. One wonders how many were extinct before they had an opportunity to look for them. That is the real threat. I\Jring this matter to the attention of the House because these two people are pioneering in a very vital area of environmental control. I will be taking this matter to the appropriate minister to make sure that these people receive consideration. It is more important to give money to this type of work than to some sporting associations where the need is not established. The need in this regard would be obvious to anyone, particularly to those who have spoken in this debate. It would also be appropriate for Ian Wood to finally be recognised. Just as an anecdote, oneof the co-authors of this book, .Steven Pearson, and L were trapped with 11 others on top of Mount Dalrymple. We helicoptered in one day. We had to leave the helicopter there and walk out. Thirteen hours and two.s-retcher bearersJater, we came out. I felt confident with Steven because he knows the area. He is associated with it and loves it. It was a real pleasure to get to know the chap at that time. If ever two people have done so much work for the environment in identifying, establishing and trying to retain the· flora we have, it is these two people: I think the honourable member for Cook mentioned that this is a very important area for' the preservation of fauna and flora, and we must be alert to these possibilities all the time. Electricity generation is very important for the Tully-Millstream area. There is a lot of controversy about this matter. Even though the current Labor government in Queensland has, in moments of sanity, approved that scheme, there is a shortage of electricity generation in North Queensland. Under these new state-Commonwealth arrangements, unless there is some generation of electricity in the North Queensland area by the cheapest means possible-that is, water-there will be a great .difficulty in the future .

198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Jenkins)Order! It being 7.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted. I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Bonney, Mrs Lores Mrs SutLIVAN (Moncrieft) (7.30 p.m.)Today. I attended the funeral on the Gold Coast of one of the great pioneers of Australian and international aviation, Lores Bonney, who died last Thursday at the age of 96. B0111 Maude Rose Rubens in South Africa on 20 November 1897, her family came to Australia in 1906 and settled in Melbourne. In 1917 she married Harry Bonney and moved to Brisbane. 'She then became a housewife and society figure. . In 1928 Mrs Bonney met the man who was to change her life-her husband's cousin, Bert Hinkler. Hinkler took her for a joy-ride in an aeroplal)e, and her great passion for flying was born. In those days women were not educated and they certainly did not fly aeroplanes. She secretly learnt how to fly. In due course, she had to ,let her husband know what she was doing. From 1931 to 1937, in what is called a remarkable six-year burst, she set a number of aviation records, both Australian and .world records, that have never been equalled. In 1932 she became the first woman to circumnavigate Australia. I shall be seeking leave to have a number of tables incorporated in Hansard. I have shown them to Hansard and to the Parliamentary Secretary' to the Minister for Industry, TechnoJogy and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table. They are extracts from her flight logs to which I wish to make some reference. I seek leave to incorporate Table 1, headed 'Details taken from Mrs Bonney's Pilot Log Book Round Australia Flight 1932'. Leave granted.

199,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I have to be brief because time is very limited. Just to run one's eye downthe details ·()f these logbooks is to read in a few words stories of most extraordinary courage and adventure. For example, the entry for 20 August 1932· refers to flying from Darwin to Ord River-over country for which there were no maps, with only a compass, with no radio, no navigation' assistance, and nobody living there:-a flight which took six hours and 45 minutes, there are two words: 'Awful trip'. The next day, 21 August 1932, she flew from OrdRiver to Halls Creek oyer similar country, a flight which tookfour hours and 40 minutes, and these words appear. : ,. . I .

It was only in latter days, with the makirig by Adrienne Swanton of a television documentary for the ABC entitledSonzehow we almost forgot Mrs Bonney and the publication in 1979 of the book Pioneer Airwoman by Terry Gwynn-Jones, that Mrs Bonney came back to any public attention. Terry Gwynn-Jones hazards the view that one of the reasons Mrs Bonney was never taken seriously, even when she was setting theseextraordinary records and showing enormous courage; and physical and aviation skill, was that she was a society woman. The ABC documentary I referred to was shown on Queensland ABC. only once and late at night. It has never been shown in the rest of Australia and I hope the ABC will now rectify that. Finally, I quote from the dedication to the book, In memory of all those forgotten women pioneers, her favourite extract from her favourite book Jonathan Livingston Seagull which epitomises her life and which passage was an inspiration in her life: We can lift ourselves.out of ignorance, we can find ourselves as creatures of excellence and intelligence and skill. We can be free! We canleam to fly! That sums up, in just a few words, the story of the bored housewife and society wife who became one of the great figures in world aviation history. Community Grants",103
201,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"History will record that this week the Liberal Party was successful in getting the scalp of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. The actions of the Liberal Party were a triumph for MCCarthyism in which the Liberal Party was ably abetted by the press-a sad indictment of the Liberal Party and·a very sad indictment of the media in Australia. We can look at the issue now that the honourable member is no longer the minister. And I might add that the honourable member was certainly no friend of mine. The truth is that every grant that was made was fully documented. What was not fully documented was how the honourable member made the decisions. In the private sector a person in such an executive position dealing with often very small loans would not be expected to detail those things' in any great way. The truth is, of course, that very few opposition members understand how the private sector does work. . . Mr Bruce Scott-We're the only people who do in this House. Most people over there haven't worked anywhere else",105
202,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member were any great success, he would not be here! The truth is that this system was, in many ways, self-regulating because those who got a grant had to put in a certain percentage of the money. Most of these grants went to local government. So there was a clear incentive to ensure that the program was real and beneficial. The money was not paid until the project was finished or until contracts were signed. ' Engaging in MCCarthyist tactics of continually shifting the questions all the time is bound to create some conflict. It was claimed that the honourable member for Canberra had misled the House by saying that she had not authorised any grants that had fallen outside the guidelines. The opposition then turned up a grant of $11,000 for a band. It was quite reasonable and correct of the former minister to say, 'This wasn 'toutside the guidelines because it was referred to me by my department and I said that the scheme was okay'. The department looked at the guidelines and said that those guidelines required the money to be spent on capital equipment but then said, 'These people only want to buy instruments'. For a band, instruments are capital equipment. A band does not need houses or buildings unless it wants to play the bongos on the roof of a tin shed. So the accusation regarding that grant was petty, mean-spirited and highly politicalMCCarthyist in the extreme. Why has this arisen? The answer is clear: the opposition simply. has no policy. This is very dangerous for Australia because the one thing the Westminster system needs is a good opposition. It is quite clear that we have not had that in this House in recent years. If we had had a good opposition there is no doubt that we would have been a better government Many of the mistakes we have made were because there was simply no opposition coming from the other side of the House. We find quite often in this House that those opposite get tip and attack us· for not being green enough. We have had the spectacle of their abusing the Labor Party for not being green enough. How ridiculous can they get? These people, who are living in a time warp, are now grasping at the opportunism of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and .Territories (Senator Richardson), At least he had his timing right. Those opposite do, not have. their timing right; there are no longer any' votes in pandering to the greens .. Yet those opposite get up in the House andauack us for not being green enough. Issues of substance, such as the crazy threewhere mine uranium policy, are not being addressed by those opposite because they do not have any policy direction. We are going to be uncontested in this matter. It is a policy which should be changed. Logic and the national interest are crying out for change. Theopposition will not advance a rational course for change because it does not have any policy direction. The opposition has reverted to MCCarthyism because it has no substance. In the short term, MCCarthyism can probably win. It will be accepted. We have seen the way that members· of the press gallery Jap it up. They lap it up because, to them, this place is a play thing. But, in the long run, it will be seen by the people of Australia for what it is. (Time expired) . National Crime Authority",105
203,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (7.40 p.m.}The report by the Joint Committee. qri. the National Crime Authority into the NCA's use of underworld figure James MCCartney Anderson as a protected witness should bea matter of public alarm. The report outlines how the NCAignored a murder to convict Abe Saffron on tax avoidance charges. The NCA spent more than $157,000 on Saffron'S former business associate, Anderson,. funding a number of overseas trips for him, aU to obtain ·his testimony against Saffron-' testimony of doubtful value. Page 94 of the report shows ·that i(Anderson had not been used as an informant he would almost certainly have been charged and convicted with Saffron. Who said that crime does not pay? The bureaucrats at the newly formed NCA were so keen to get their No. 1 target that they ignored the evidence of Anderson's more serious criminality and involvement in the murder of Juanita. Nielsen. For the NCA, the ends justified the means. Common decency went out the window in a rush to justify the organisation's existence. InfaiIing to investigate the Nielsen murder, the NCA joined elements of the New South Wales police in a shameful cover-up of the murder of an innocent woman-a person whose only crime was to oppose property· development in the street she lived, as thousands of residents do throughollt cities everywhere. . . , Last week's report by the New South Wales ICAC's Commissioner Temby is a timely reminder that corruption still reaches into the higher echelons of the New South Wales police. Today, one of the original investigators in charge of the Nielsen case is in line for the job of commissioner. I refer to Assistant Commissioner Norm Maroney, who was also attached to the NCA when Jim Anderson was an ·informant. On 6 July 1975, two days after Mrs Nielsen disappeared at Anderson's Carousel club, the duty offic:er at Darlinghurst police questioned Eddie Trigg-the c:lub's night manager., Trigg said .that Mrs Nielsen had gone to the club 'about publicity for the disco', according-o the committee report. He thep said, 'I told her that the' directors ,of the establishment had decided not to advertise at that time due to poor business'. The next evening, detectives Maroney and Karl Arkins interviewed. Trigg, who contradicted his first story and said that he paid. Mrs Nielsen $130 for a> half-page ad and that she had then left. The veracitybf the statements Of Trigg and Anderson were accepted without question, as was any evidence which indicated that Nielsen had departedfrbm the club. They were apparently-not willing to listen to. persuasive evidence that connected her dIsappearance with her opposition to the redevelopment of Victoria Street by Frank Theeman, a friend of Anderson. They apparently accepted a ,repdrt by an associate of Anderson that he had seen Nielsen getting into a yellow car, thus taking her away from the Carousel club where ,her murder almost certainly occurred. Based on this evidence, Assistant CommissiOJler Maroney, now in charge of the case, spent the next 18 months tracking down the owners of 1,500 yellow Fords, all to no avail. While the police had strong evidence linking Nielsen's disappearance to the developer Frank Theeman,they ignored it. Indeed, within weeks' of the disappearance, Theenian adrtiittcil paying Jim Anderson $25,000. When he. asked them to keep it secret for personal reasons, they complied and wasted their time on the futile yellow car link. It is a disgrace that the Nielsen murder has remained unsolved, particularly after the information brought to light at the threemonth Nielsen inquest in 1983, after which nothing effective was achieved by the New South Wales police. This is consistent with profile throughout the whole case. The Nielsen case has been characterised by inaction and, at best, reaction rather than by a commitment to finding the murderer. Many people may regard the Nielsen case as old hat, because they believe it will never be solved, 'but this is to ignore its central importance and the principle of accountability. It is a case which goes to the very heart of corruption of the New South Wales police, and not upsetting the status quo of cosy police relationships with Sydney's crime kings. ""What has really happened is that millions of dollars of public money have been wasted; the police have achieved nothing; Jim Anderson has been protected, and the murder of an innocent woman has been ignored by the National Crime Authority. This case must be immediately reopened in the name of justice, while there is still time to do so. Victoria: Education",106
204,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Corinella) (7.45 p.m.)Education funding in Victoria for capital works provides a real contrast in the attitudes, commitments and ideology of this federal Labor government and that of the New Right extremists of the Liberal state government. As honourable members will be aware, the federal government is primarily responsible for funding capital works in non-government schools-and fund them we have. Over the last 12 months I have been able to announce the following grants: $685,000 to St Kevins Primary School in Hampton Park for seven new classrooms; $972,000 to St Francis Xavier College, CranbourneCampus, for a new library and technology facilities; $295,000 to Hillcrest Christian College, Nyora for a technology centre and refurbishment of the library; and $495,000 to St Agathas Primary School, Cranbourne, for new classrooms and pupil amenities. That is more than $2 ·million in the last 12 months. The enormous population growth in my electorate means that the demand for schools, both government and non-government, is steadily on the increase. These grants were its welcomed by the local communities who were to benefit. However,some concerns were raised that the Commonwealth should be fundi,,!g state government schools for capital works. I checked it out and found that the Commonwealth is funding massive capital works in state government schools in my area, but with no recognition being given from the state government. Commonwealth funds are given to the state governments and administered by them. There are very broad guidelines that the states must adhere to, but generally it is up to the discretion of the state as to what areas and which schools the money is spent on. All the money must be spent on schools, therefore. debt reduction strategies or similar state government financial policies have no effect on the amount available. The federal government, has. pumped millions of dollars into government schools in the shire of Cranbourne, and over half a million dollars more than. the state govern.:. ment over the last three years. The figures from the State Directorate of School Education show that in the years 1990.to 1992 inclusive the Commonwealth spent more than $8 million on capital works in government schools in the shire of Cranbourne. This figl)re compares with $7.6 million provided by the state government. In fact the level of funding from the Commonwealth to the state government has actually increased every year. These increases have been legislated for the eight years from 1985. In 1993 over $1 miIlion of federal money was· spent in Cranbourne .schools. Courtenay Avenue Primary School received a grant of· $770,000;. Coral Park Primary School, $54,000;Cranbourne Secondary College, $65,000; Kooweerup Secondary College, $60,000, and Rowellyn Park primary school, $100,000. But what is obvious from these figures is that since the election of the Kennett state government there has been it decrease in the level of capital fundingfrom both federal and state sources to schools in Cranbourne-only about $1 million in federal funds in 1993, compared with more than $8 million in the previous three years. Why has there been this major cutbatkin funding allocation to the Cranbourne area? It is not because of a lack of need. There are still school sites vacant in rapidly growing suburbs. There are stiIl secondary colleges bursting at the seams. There is stiIl an obvious and well-acknowledged need for more government schools. Yet this Liberal state government continues to wind down not only its own funding commitment to Cranbourne, but also that funding provided by the ·federal government for capital works at state government schools. Let uS be clear about this-the state government determines where this funding is allocated. It is responsible for the' lack of educationHourn, al facilities, and it is responsible for previous funding levels not being maintai.ned. But it is not only its obvious lack of commitment to the growing suburbs of outer Melbourne but also the absolute hypocrisy of its position which is exposed in its announcements of the limited amount of new capital funding projects. The state government takes complete credit for any capital works funding in state government schools. That is the great thing about the Kennett Liberals; they cut funding to all sorts of worthy causes; they Claim credit for federal government initiatives, and all the while they maintain an imperious ruling rhentality-not unlike members on the other side, iunfortu"" nately in a situation where they will never be able to exercise it.  and his'imperious attitude. You would have to agree with that. MrGRIFFIN, -1 do not know what the honourable member for Sturt had for tea, but I would not mind a bottle of it after we,close tonight. The Commonwealth has made a clear commitment to the .education of our young people. This is evidenced by the f-ct that we have legislated annual increases in the allocations to the states for education. When this is compared with the cuts in education· budgets, school closures; teacher reduction and; in Cranbourne's case, a diversion of funds away from growth areas, it is clear that the state government does not have the same commitment to our young people. Lawrence, Dr Carmen . MrTUCKEY (O'Connor) (7.50 p.m.)The West Australian newspaper on page 8 today reported' the fact that the state federal electoral officer for WA, Barry Young, has been obliged to write to all candidates iiI the Fremantle by-election teIIing them of a fact that should be well known, particularly to such experienced persons in the political system: that is, they cannot canvass for votes in aged persons hostels and other places where mobile polIing booths will operate. It so happens that by coincidence I sat in on the briefing of the Liberal candidate, Geoff when he was told clearly by Liberal Party officials of this particular rule and when he was told clearly not to go to those particular places-notwithstanding that most candidates would. The Liberal Party knew its responsibility, but according to this article: Mr Young said 'his 'warning'was prompted by a report that Dr Lawrence had visited Fremantle's Stan Reilly Lodge on February 17. An ex-premier of Western Australia, a woman who stood up in, the parliament and put laws down, does not even know how to comply with the normal electoral laws of Australialaws written by her own people. Furthermore, that is the law and nobody should know better th- she not to break it. Everybody has been trying to contact Dr Lawrence recently. She does not want to answer questions on anything. Of, course, she can no longer say,'1 can't remember'. She went through a stage of being a cabinet minister and going into every cabinet meeting with plugs in her ears because she never heard any evil-notwithstanding that WA Inc- was on every day. The response from the Labor Party is: Dr Lawrence refuses to answer. The article goes on: Dr Lawrence was not aVililable for comment yesterday. However, ALP state secretary Mark Nolan said she had merely introduced herself, to people at the lodge. That is not campaigning; that is not canvassing! The article also says: , The Act forba?e.people to canvass, solicit or to induce votes in ,or near a polling booth.. , This means the lodge in this case. The article goes on to say: .""But .we deny that Dr Lawrence did any of those th-ngs In' relatIon to the Stan Reilly Lodge,"" he saId. ' ""At no stage was' canvassing being undertaken ... she went along to have a cup of tea. The article goes on to say that the act is wrong. The government has the right to change the act, but 1 put ,it to honourable members that an endorsed candidate for the Labor Party suddenly turns up at an aged persons lodge and the Labor Party has the temerity to tell us she was not there looking fo- a ,few votes. That. is the basis of my oPJechon. Her memory IS something unbelievable. She forgets overnight-I call her Miss Forgetful. She cannot r.emember anything. Maybe she did read that section of the electoral act-if the Labor Party organisation in Western Australia had done its job-that said that candidates are not allowed to go to these places.'",107
205,Mr WALKER,ADJOURNMENT,You are.,109
206,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"No, you are not, and Barry Young says so. .",109
207,Mr WALKER,ADJOURNMENT,He does not say that at all.,109
208,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Of course he does. The fact.is candidates are not allowed to go. But - avmg been caught with your fingers in the ttll,why not .stand .up and say 'guilty'? Why perpetrate thIS busmess that we got from the horiour-ble member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), who saId one day, 'I dealt only with eligible applications'; and the next day she came in here and said, 'No, 1 made one eligible that was ineligible'. We are going to get a direct replacement-the same sort of deal. The woman broke the law. All she needs to do is be.hone-t about - t. Barry Young has ,already saId he IS not gomg to prosecute her.,",109
209,Mr WALKER,ADJOURNMENT,"That's right, because 'he knows she's innocent. . Mr.Tl!CKEY-He is - arning everybody. He saId It was probably madvertent. She is not .in-?ce-t because by her own party;s IldmlSSlOn she wentto the Stan Reilly Lodge. We know ,all about the government and, its try position on no bills. It would declare anyone's evidence on its side-it did so for Laurie Brereton. The simple fact is that this woman has been caught. It just shows again her attitude to politics, of whiCh 1 complain so bitterly in this place. She will let a close assoCiate come forward ?nd put a petition to the parliament accusing mnocent women outside the parliament of perjury. And one goes and suicides. What does she do with the bloke that presented 'the petition-a dreadful thing? As the Leader ()f the Opposition she promoted him. This is the w-man who cannot, even openly admit to domg something wrong. She is going to come here as a minister and she will be misleading t?is, House, that is, if she wins the by-electlon-:-and I am mpre and more doubting it. But If she does Win the by-election, we can bet on one thing: we will not get much truth out of Carmen. (Time expired) Journalists: Ethics"" MrPYNE (Sturt) (7.55 p.m.)-It is sometimes said that the press gallery runs Australia. I disagree. To me, the gallery often seems obsessed by a search for strong leaders who might be able to run the country. Instead of dominating the policy agenda, the gallery indulges in a disproportionate coverage of personalities rather than policies. .I have no doubt that many politicians resent journalists. No-one here will shun publicity, but when it comes to day-today contact, politicians believe journalists want something new and controversial while they want to persuade the public that their vi-ws are right. They think that interviewers .get their kudos by catching out interviewees at the cost of discrediting public figures and the institutions they represent. This' approach is an oversimplification. It ignores all the demands journalistic processes and communication mediums place on the reporting of news. More than that, it begrudges the role journalists have.as transmitters the public of what goes on in - his place .. Our media has a vital role to play inholding to account those who exercise power. If journalists lose creditability among the public, they are undercutting this primary function. A public without confidence in its journalists is less free. This makes journalists' ethics so important. Recently I learnt that the Media, Entertainment and. Arts Alliance, which incorporates the Australian Journalists Association, was reviewing its code of ethics and inviting the public to make submissions as part qf. the· review. However, I did not learn this from any of the main media outlets. Instead; the information came from, the editor of the South AiI-traliim Uniting Church newspaper, New Times, Mr Nicholas Kerr. He had heard it on the ABC. My staff found a small piece on the AAP but, according to the parliamentary library; out of all the daily newspapers they monitor each dlly it had scored only one mention,in the Melbourne Age. This pOints to a problem- Journalists must 'live up to certain standards, but it is also essential decision makers - the editors and proprietors-do the same. The AJA's code of ethics lists 10 rules, requiring members: to be fair and honest and disclose necessary facts; to avoid undue emphasis on gender, race, religion or physical ability; to respect all confidences; to divorce their persoriaLand financial or commercial interests from' their. professional interests; to give full identification before obtaining interviews; to respect grief and privacy; and to correct inaccuracies . The code forms the core of media se1fregulation, but many actual decision makers are not members of the AJA and therefore are not covered, despite endorsing the code and expecting staff to abide by it. So why do we Dot hear more about media ethics?' . There has been a decline in public confidence in journalists over recent. years. There has been a perceived failure in self-regulation, and in some states legislative solutions have been sought. This has occurred at a time when new media opportunities, such as pay t() TV, are opening up and the concentration of media ownership has led to calls for guarantees of editorial independence. . A Senate committee. is currently investigating the rights and responsibilities of the media. The police association tn my own state of South Austnilia told the committee last year that it favoured some form bf licensing system for journalists. I am sure that most people would be disturbed by the abuse of power that could exist under such a licensing system. At the same time, th-re is a genuine concern about the implications of allowing journalists to protect sources, awarding them powers not afforded to the police, doctors or even priests. The review of the AJA code deserves more publicity, but even it has its own weaknesses. The preamble, which in part reads, 'Respect for truth and the public's right to information are over-riding principles for all journalists', could be used to cover a multitude of sins. The press co-mcil is largely seen as a toothless tiger. The ill-fated experiments of that the 'Sydney Morning Herald with an in-house ombudsman suggest this is not the way to go. The media's work istoo important. Journalists and proprietors' need to work together to develop a system of accountability which preserves press freedoms while enshrining effective self-regulation before they are hit with the heavy hand of the state.",109

215,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 October 1993: Are Members of Parliament permitted toadvertise from within Commonwealth funded offices inviting the public to join a particular political party; if so, how is this use of Commonwealth funded resources justified; if not, what is the penalty. . Mr Bilney-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided· the following answer to the honourable member's qllestion: Members of the Parliament are provided with an Electorate Office primarily for the conduct of their parliamentary and electorate business. The nature of the demands placed on Senators and Members and the extent of their duties and responsibilities, including participation in the political process, inevitably causes occasions to arise when activities are challenged as being of a party political nature. Consequently, it is important that the subject of a complaint is investigated and assessed on its merits. The display of material in Electorate Offices is treated in a similar fashion and Senators and Members are asked to refrain frorridisplaying material which is primarily of a party political nature in the public areas of their Electorate Offices as it ma:y offend a section of the community. Where instances are brought to the attention of the Department of Administrative Services, the Senator or Member concerned is asked to remove the offending material. Prime Minister and Staff: Processing by Customs (Question No. 678)  the Minister for Science and Small Business, upon notice, on 22 November 1993: Are Customs officers stationed at RAAF Fairbairn to process the Prime Minister and his party on their return from overseas visits; if so, what is the cost. Mr Lee-The Minister for Science and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable member's.qu-stion: There are no Customs officers stationed at RAAF Fairbairn. All international military nights arriving at RAAF Fairbairn, including the Prime Minister's return from overseas trips, are processed by Customs officerS from the ACT Sub-Collectorate of Customs, located in Fyshwick. Costs associated with that processing are borne as pari of the normal running costs of the ACT Sub-Collectorate- There is no separate record available to identify the specific costs. It is Customs policy not to collect these costs when processing mifitary. or public aircraft at a military airport, which is usually the case with the Prime Minister's party.
